purring half cats sleep hours day sometimes even cats sleep age explain cats crepuscular mostly active cats tend bury feces defecating attracted litter box attractant cats also generally defecate litter socialization defined member specific group learning part said continuous learning process allows individual learn necessary skills behaviors required particular social cats domestic wild participate social behaviors even though thought cat species besides lions solitary antisocial certain circumstances food availability shelter protection cats seen social behaviors cats participate colony organization social learning socialization cats socialization humans freeliving domestic cats tend form small colonies consist one female known queen kittens large colonies consist several queens male cats present types colonies serve purpose reproduction defending territory within colonies altruistic behavior occurs means expecting queen helps another queen gave birth helping queen get help return gives although free living cats found colonies stable social order like lion free living cats usually found colonies protection predators food although many advantages group living easy access mates defensive measures protect food also disadvantages sexual competition mates group gets big fights may break cats observational type learning emerges early cats shown many laboratory studies young kittens learn hunt mothers observing techniques catching mother ensures kittens learn hunting techniques first bringing dead prey litter live prey demonstrates techniques required successful capture kittens bringing live prey litter kittens catch preycatching behavior kittens improves time mothers present observational learning cats described terms drive complete behavior cue initiates behavior response cue reward completing shown cats learn predatory behavior mothers drive hunger cue prey response catch prey reward relieve hunger sensation kittens also show observational learning socializing humans likely initiate socialization humans mothers exhibiting nonaggressive nondefensive even though mothers spend time kittens male cats play important role breaking fights among litter observational learning limited kittens also observed adulthood studies done adult cats performing task pressing lever visual adult cats see others performing task learn perform task
