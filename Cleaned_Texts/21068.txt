discovered genetic basis mammalian circadian clock identified clock gene takahashi elected national academy sciences takahashi graduated richard montgomery high school rockville maryland takahashi attended swarthmore college graduated degree biology worked patricia decoursey university south carolina year graduation applied work michael menaker university texas austin menaker ultimately moved university oregon takahashi received neuroscience phd takahashi postdoctoral fellow national institute mental health two years martin zatz assuming faculty position northwestern universitys department neurobiology physiology held takahashi joined faculty university texas southwestern medical center dallas loyd b sands distinguished chair takahashi also serves member scientific advisory board

genomics journal biological early takahashi menaker studied bird pineal gland culture system vitro understand circadian oscillations demonstrated suprachiasmatic nucleus scn identified control center circadian rhythms mammals played role authors also collaborated decoursey used hamsters demonstrate photoreceptor system responsible entrainment circadian rhythms different visual takahashi buhr yoo examined potential temperature fluctuations entrain biological oscillators finding master circadian pacemaker robust oscillator typically entrained environmental lightdark cycles also capable entraining temperature fluctuations isolated vitro indicates temperature resetting fundamental property mammalian clocks likely works highly conserved mechanism mammalian cells also suggests body temperature rhythms controlled scn homeothermic mammals potential mechanism master clock may synchronize circadian oscillators within tissues throughout takahashis research led many developments understanding circadian clock mammals affects physiology relationships environment takahashi michael greenberg studied mechanisms mammalian suprachiasmatic nuclei entrainment environmental light cycles explored relationship phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein creb cfos transcription protein previously indicated component photic entrainment using immunoprecipitation takahashi greenberg able show light induced creb phosphorylation occurs subjective given creb shown regulate cfos transcription pheochromocytoma takahashi greenberg able conclude phosphorylation creb scn may play important role mammalian photic vitro research pineal gland culture system used understand circadian oscillations limitations cell culture system evident takahashi switched methods begin using forward genetics positional required advanced knowledge underlying understand genetic molecular bases circadian using mutated mouse strains takahashi colleagues isolated
