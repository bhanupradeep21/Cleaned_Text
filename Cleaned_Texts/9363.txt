object permanence understanding whether object sensed effect whether continues exist fundamental concept studied field developmental psychology subfield psychology addresses development young childrens social mental capacities yet scientific consensus understanding object permanence emerges human development jean piaget swiss psychologist first studied object permanence infants argued one infants important accomplishments without concept objects would separate permanent existence piagets theory cognitive development infants develop understanding end sensorimotor stage lasts birth two years piaget thought infants perception understanding world depended motor development required infant link visual tactile motor representations objects according view touching handling objects infants develop object developmental psychologist jean piaget conducted experiments collected behavioral tests infants piaget studied object permanence observing infants reactions favorite object toy presented covered blanket removed sight object permanence considered one earliest methods evaluating working infant started develop object permanence might reach toy try grab blanket toy infants yet developed might appear piaget interpreted behavioral signs evidence belief object ceased exist reactions infants already started developing object permanence frustration knew existed know however reaction infants yet started developing object permanence oblivious infant searched object assumed believed continued piaget concluded infants young understand object permanence lack object permanence lead anotb errors children reach thing place older infants less likely make anotb error able understand concept object permanence younger infants however researchers found anotb errors always show concluded type error might due failure memory fact infants usually tend repeat previous motor piagets formulation six stages object recent years original piagetian object permanence account challenged series infant studies suggesting much younger infants clear sense objects exist even sight bower showed object permanence goes piagets coordination secondary circular reactions stage infants supposed understand completely hidden object still exists eight twelve months old two studies demonstrate idea first study showed infants toy car moved inclined track disappeared behind screen reemerged end still track researchers created possible event toy mouse placed behind tracks hidden screen car rolled researchers created impossible event situation toy mouse placed tracks secretly removed screen lowered car seemed go mouse infants surprised impossible event suggests remembered toy mouse still existed object permanence also location also study researchers used experiment involving two differently sized carrots one tall one short order test infants response carrots would moved behind short wall specifically designed make short carrot disappear well tested infants habituation patterns disappearance tall carrot behind wall impossible infants young months displayed greater stimulation toward impossible event much habituation possible event true tall carrot second experiment research suggests infants understand objects earlier piaget primarily four challenges piagets framework one criticism piagets theory culture education exert stronger influences childs development piaget maintained factors depend much practice culture provides developmental processes conversational experiments nonhuman primates suggest monkeys track displacement invisible invisible displacement represented prefrontal development frontal cortex linked acquisition object various evidence human infants consistent example formation synapses frontal cortex peaks human recent experiments using near infrared spectroscopy gather neuroimaging data infants suggests activity frontal cortex associated successful completion object permanence however many types animals shown ability object permanence include dogs cats species birds carrion crow eurasian jays foodstoring magpies dogs able reach level object permanence allows find food hidden beneath one two cups rotated similarly cats able understand object permanence extent dogs cats fail understand see something go apparatus one direction still cat tries enter another however cats seem quite good invisible displacement test dogs hard say whether poorer performance true reflection abilities due way longitudinal study found carrion crows ability developed gradually albeit slight changes order mastery compared human infants one task task crows able master crows showed perseverative searches previously rewarded location socalled anotb error mastered visible rotational displacements consistently failed complex invisible rotational another study tested comparison long took foodstoring magpies develop object permanence necessary able live research suggests magpies followed similar pattern human infants developing shown artificial intelligent agents trained exhibit object building agents revealed interesting structure object permanence task involves several visual reasoning components important ones detect visible object learn moves reason movement even visible shamsian et al found object permanence achieved agent two separate timesensitive modules one tracks visible objects second decides track one object occludes contains target object permanence shown apply videos one areas focus object permanence physical disabilities blindness cerebral palsy deafness intellectual disabilities syndrome etc affect development object permanence study performed result shows area children intellectual disabilities performed weakly children without disabilities along lines social interaction tasks imitation causality tasks performed weakly children without disabilities however object permanence still acquired similarly related social interaction psychologists believe object permanence alone may predict communicative achievement object permanence along several sensorimotor milestones plays critical role interacts communicative development children severe observed study recognizing full mastery object permanence one milestones ties childs ability engage mental representation along relationship language acquisition object permanence also related achievement selfrecognition study also focused specifically effects syndrome object permanence found reason children participated successful acquiring object permanence due social strength imitation along imitation potential factor success another factor could impact children syndrome could also willingness child recent studies suggest idea object permanence may innate function young children reference piagets theory established young children develop object permanence age question arises occur particular perception already existed within minds young children object permanence really inbred response neural pathways developing young minds studies suggest multitude variables may responsible development object permanence rather natural talent infants evidence suggests infants use variety cues studying object perception objects permanence tested without physically hiding object rather object occluded slightly obstructed infants view left visual cues examining object different trajectories also found longer infant focuses object may due
