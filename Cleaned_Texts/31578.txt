management crohns disease involves first treating acute symptoms disease maintaining remission since crohns disease immune system condition cured medication surgery treatment initially involves use medications eliminate infections generally antibiotics reduce inflammation generally aminosalicylate antiinflammatory drugs corticosteroids surgery may required complications obstructions fistulae abscesses disease respond drugs within reasonable time however surgery cure crohns disease involves removing diseased part intestine rejoining healthy ends disease tends recur surgery remission induced goal treatment becomes maintenance remission avoiding return active disease flares side effects prolonged use corticosteroids avoided although people able maintain remission spontaneously many require immunosuppressive compounds mesalazine sulfasalazine shown little efficacy treatment crohns disease either induction maintenance current guidelines advise use compounds crohns corticosteroids class antiinflammatory drugs used treat moderate severe flares crohns disease however used sparingly cause serious side including cushings syndrome mania insomnia hypertension high blood glucose osteoporosis avascular necrosis long bones corticosteroids confused anabolic steroids used enhance athletic performance commonly prescribed oral steroid prednisone typically dosed mgkg induction remission crohns intravenous steroids administered hospital setting used oral steroids work corticosteroids reduce bodys ability fight infection care must taken ensure active infection particularly intraabdominal abscess initiation steroidscitation needed another oral corticosteroid budesonide trade name entocort limited absorption high level firstpass metabolism meaning lower quantities drug enter bloodstream shown useful treatment mild moderate crohns maintaining also effective used combination antibiotics treat active crohns budesonide released ileum right colon therefore topical effect disease steroid enemas also used treat symptoms lower colon rectum hydrocortisone budesonide liquid foam enemas marketed purposecitation needed azathioprine commonly used immunosuppressants maintenance therapy crohns disease purine antimetabolites meaning interfere synthesis purines required inflammatory cells duration action months drugs dosed mgkg literature supporting use higher cochrane systematic review included randomized controlled trials concluded azathioprine effective inducing remission person crohns azathioprine may useful following indications azathioprine treatment may lead rare lifethreatening side effects rare side effects include leukopenia may also increased risk lymphoma associated azathioprine azathioprine listed united states fda human however confers considerably less morbidity mortality corticosteroidscitation needed infliximab trade name remicade among others mousehuman chimeric antibody targets tumor necrosis factor alpha tnfα cytokine inflammatory response monoclonal antibody inhibits proinflammatory cytokine tnfα administered intravenously dosed per weight starting mgkg increasing according character diseasecitation needed infliximab found utility follows side effects infliximab like immunosuppressants tnf class serious potentially fatal infliximab carries fda blackbox warning label listed side effects include hypersensitivity allergic reactions risk reactivation tuberculosis serum sickness risk multiple serious side effect also include lymphoma severe adalimumab like infliximab antibody targets tumor necrosis shown reduce signs symptoms approved treatment moderate severe crohns disease adults responded well conventional treatments lost response unable tolerate adalimumab also number serious potentially fatal safety concerns characteristic antitnfα drugs blackbox warning fda label listed potential side effects include serious sometimes fatal blood disorders serious infections including tuberculosis infections caused viruses fungi bacteria rare reports lymphoma solid tissue cancers rare reports serious liver injury rare reports demyelinating central nervous system disorders rare reports cardiac failurecitation needed natalizumab antiintegrin monoclonal antibody shown utility induction maintenance treatment moderate severe crohns natalizumab may appropriate patients respond medications block tumor necrosis factoralpha january fda approved natalizumab induction remission maintenance remission moderate severe crohns total large randomized controlled trials demonstrated natalizumab effective increasing rates maintaining symptomfree patients crohns disease natalizumab also linked pml though used combination interferon label also recommends monitoring liver enzymes due concerns possible damage also associated rare serious risk multifocal leukoencephalopathy brain infection leading death severe disability therefore specific program exists prescribers must enrolled

randomized control trials including international multicenter randomized parallelgroup doubleblind clinical trial gemini demonstrated vedolizumab effective induction maintenance remission patients active crohns disease surgery normally reserved complications crohns disease disease resists treatment drugs confined one location surgery often used manage complications crohns disease including fistulae small bowel obstruction colon cancer small intestine cancer fibrostenotic strictures strictureplasty expansion stricture sometimes performed otherwise complications resection anastomosis removal affected section intestine rejoining healthy sections surgery usually performed crohns disease eg ileocolonic resection none surgeries cure eliminate crohns disease disease eventually comes back healthy segments intestine although crohns disease recurs surgery usually comes back site small intestine transplants becoming less experimental still mainly performed response short bowel syndrome due high rate transplant many diets proposed management crohns disease many improve symptoms none proven cure specific carbohydrate diet usually requires adjustments patients patient finds certain foods increase decrease symptoms may adjust diet accordingly food diary recommended see positive negative effects particular foods low residue diet may used reduce volume stools excreted daily people lactose intolerance due small bowel disease may benefit avoiding lactosecontaining foods patients eat may given total parenteral nutrition tpn source vitamins nutrients fish oil may effective reducing chance relapse less severe terminal ileum common site involvement site vitamin absorption people crohns disease risk deficiency may need supplementation cases extensive small intestine involvement fatsoluble vitamins e k may deficient folate deficiency risk patients treated methotrexate simultaneously receive folate supplementation stress influence course crohns disease smoking also associated disease smokers crohns encouraged explore smoking cessation programs smoking make crohns disease worse people also increase risk recurrence surgery crohns disease patient undergoes surgery quit smoking disease likely recur aggressively use oral probiotic supplements modify composition behaviour gastrointestinal microbiome researched recently understand whether may help improve remission
