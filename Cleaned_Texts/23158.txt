huxley identified first three questions niko tinbergen gave fourth question huxleys questions failed distinguish survival value evolutionary history tinbergens fourth question helped resolve darwins theory evolution natural selection scientific explanation animals behaviour usually well adapted survival reproduction environment however claiming particular mechanism well suited present environment different claiming mechanism selected past due history literature conceptualizes relationship function evolution two ways one hand function evolution often presented separate distinct explanations hand common definition adaptation central concept evolution trait functional reproductive success organism thus present due selected function evolution inseparable however trait current function adaptive without adaptation sense instance environment changed imagine environment small body suddenly conferred benefit organism previously body size effect small bodys function environment would adaptive would become adaptation enough generations passed small bodies advantageous reproduction small bodies selected given best understand presently functional traits might produced natural term function preferable adaptation adaptation often construed implying selected due past function corresponds aristotles final evolution captures history organism via phylogeny history natural selection working function produce several reasons natural selection may fail achieve optimal design mayr buss et al one entails random processes mutation environmental events acting small populations another entails constraints resulting early evolutionary development organism harbors traits anatomical behavioural previous phylogenetic stages since many traits retained species evolve reconstructing phylogeny species often makes possible understand uniqueness recent characteristics earlier phylogenetic stages pre conditions persist often also determine form modern characteristics instance vertebrate eye including human eye blind spot whereas octopus eyes two lineages eye originally constructed one way vertebrate eye constructed intermediate forms adaptive would enabled evolve without blind spot corresponds aristotles formal prominent classes proximate causal mechanisms include examining living organisms biologists confronted diverse levels complexity eg chemical physiological psychological social therefore investigate causal functional relations within levels biochemist might examine instance influence social ecological conditions release certain neurotransmitters hormones effects releases behaviour eg stress birth tocolytic contractionsuppressing effect however awareness neurotransmitters structure neurons enough understand higher levels neuroanatomic structure behaviour whole sum parts levels must considered equally important cf transdisciplinarity nicolai hartmanns laws levels complexity corresponds aristotles efficient ontogeny process development individual organism zygote embryo adult form latter half twentieth century social scientists debated whether human behaviour product nature genes nurture environment developmental period including culture example interaction distinct sum components involves familiarity childhood number species individuals prefer associate familiar individuals prefer mate unfamiliar ones alcock incest taboo incest inference genes affecting living together interact environment differently genes affecting mating behaviour simple example interaction involves plants plants grow toward light phototropism away
