rare biosphere refers large number rare species microbial life ie bacteria archaea fungi found low concentrations changes biodiversity ecosystem whether marine terrestrial may affect efficiency function climate change anthropogenic perturbations decrease productivity disrupt global biogeochemical cycles possible ramifications changes well characterized understood point redundancy ecosystem may protect dynamics microbial ecosystems tightly coupled biogeochemical example marine microbial loop bacteria decompose organics recycle nutrients nitrogen organisms phytoplankton reduction recycled nitrogen would limit production rate phytoplankton turn limiting growth grazers effects throughout food web nitrogen cycle gauge effects base line microbial diversity needed species rare biosphere offer gene pool activated changing conditions thus keeping ecosystem members rare biosphere recognised important drivers many key ecosystem functions example providing bioavailable nitrogen marine soil previous attempts characterize situ abundance different microbial species specific environment made culturing molecular biology culturing produces narrow picture rarer species present especially studying environment less microbes cultivable standard molecular biology techniques sanger sequencing results much broader scope highlights abundant species neither techniques capture diversity present current state art practice use highthroughput sequencing techniques pioneered dr mitchell sogin marine biological laboratory method broadened scope biodiversity discovery rare high throughput sequencing tag sequencing divides unique rrna gene target gene tag sequences operational taxonomic units otus based upon similarities dna code sequenced gene sanger shotgun sequencing tag sequencing organize sequences however resolution tag sequencing provides sets apart methods resulting increased efficiency serial efficiency increase made possible use internal primer sequences resulting restriction digest overhanging though otus provide means distinguishing possible number phylogenetic groups possible deduce phylogenetic relationships based upon otu tags associated otus must crossreferenced gene banks order tags phylotyped relationships result tag sequencing produce orders magnitude larger estimates otus present ecosystems producing long tail species abundance long tail accounts less abundant species particular ecosystem time represents thousands populations accounting phylogenetic diversity ecosystem lowabundance highdiversity group rare biosphere using method sogin et al study microbial diversity north atlantic deep water produced estimate different particularly dramatic considering previous studies employing traditional pcr cloning techniques resulted estimates considering low abundance members rare biosphere may represent ancient persistent less abundant species limited number viral infection ultimately death lysis unlikely viruses depend high concentrations host organisms additionally less abundant implies limited growth smaller end cell size limits likelihood death ingestion grazers prefer larger active microbes important note taxa rare mean previous conditions planet history rare taxa could episodically abundant resulting either global changes biogeochemical cycles small change conditions current given persistence taxa right conditions potential dominate become abundant conditions may occur many temporal scales may possible rare taxa dominate anomalous years el change abundance may occur seasonal global climate change may provide rare taxa conditions necessary increase abundance even low abundance taxa belonging rare biosphere may affecting global biogeochemical cycles example recent evidence implicates rare minority

unlimited source genetic diversity currently lot discussion investigations ongoing microbial communities present resilience environmental perturbation catastrophe closely related species may present unique novel genetic attributes compared near rare biosphere could seen seed bank transferring genes resulting fitter recombinants rise become dominant rare biosphere studied numerous different environments including seas lakes soils even deep debate concerning distribution taxa within rare biosphere taxa within group given site may process studies arctic seabed identified thermophilic bacteria arriving mechanisms dispersal could metabolically populations thermophilic bacteria arctic reach suitable niche become metabolically active increase abundance requires one view populations nondiscrete endemic one particular body alternatively studies suggest given biogeography rare taxa idea rare biosphere product dispersal seems study arctic ocean biogeography rare biosphere found parcels water within ocean rare biosphere presented large amount diversity suggests populations within rare biosphere experience evolutionary forces specific location found selection speciation also
