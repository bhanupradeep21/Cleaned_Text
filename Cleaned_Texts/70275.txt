bioinformatics sequence assembly refers aligning merging fragments longer dna sequence order reconstruct original sequence needed dna sequencing technology might able read whole genomes one go rather reads small pieces bases depending technology used typically short fragments reads result shotgun sequencing genomic dna gene transcript ests problem sequence assembly compared taking many copies book passing shredder different cutter piecing text book back together looking shredded pieces besides obvious difficulty task extra practical issues original may many repeated paragraphs shreds may modified shredding typos excerpts another book may also added shreds may completely unrecognizable first sequence assemblers began appear late early variants simpler sequence alignment programs piece together vast quantities fragments generated automated sequencing instruments called dna sequencers sequenced organisms grew size complexity small viruses plasmids bacteria finally eukaryotes assembly programs used genome projects needed increasingly sophisticated strategies handle faced challenge assembling first larger eukaryotic fruit fly drosophila melanogaster human genome year developed assemblers like celera able handle genomes million eg fruit fly melanogaster billion eg human genome base pairs subsequent efforts several groups mostly major genome sequencing centers built largescale assemblers open source effort known launched bring together innovations genome assembly technology open source framework expressed sequence tag est assembly early strategy dating assemble individual genes rather whole genomes problem differs genome assembly several ways input sequences est assembly fragments transcribed mrna cell represent subset whole genome number algorithmical problems differ genome est assembly instance genomes often large amounts repetitive sequences concentrated intergenic regions transcribed genes contain many fewer repeats making assembly somewhat easier hand genes expressed transcribed high numbers eg housekeeping genes means unlike wholegenome shotgun sequencing reads uniformly sampled across genome est assembly made much complicated features like cis alternative splicing transsplicing singlenucleotide polymorphism posttranscriptional modification beginning rnaseq invented est sequencing replaced far efficient technology described de novo transcriptome assembly three approaches assembling sequencing data referencedguided assembly combination types type applied long reads mimic short reads advantages ie call quality logic behind group reads smaller windows within reference reads group reduced size using kmere approach select highest quality probable contiguous contig contigs joined together create scaffold final consense made closing gaps scaffold terms complexity time requirements denovo assemblies orders magnitude slower memory intensive mapping assemblies mostly due fact assembly algorithm needs compare every read every read operation naive time complexity current denovo genome assemblers may use different types graphbased algorithms referring comparison drawn shredded books introduction mapping assemblies one would similar book template perhaps names main characters locations changed denovo assemblies present daunting challenge one would know beforehand whether would become science book novel catalogue even several books also every shred would compared every shred handling repeats denovo assembly requires construction graph representing neighboring repeats information derived reading long fragment covering repeats full two ends hand mapping assembly parts multiple matches usually left another assembling technique look general three steps assembling sequencing reads scaffold preassembly step essential ensure integrity downline analysis variant calling final scaffold sequence step consists two chronological workflow quality check depending types sequencing technology different errors might arise would lead false base call example sequencing naaaaaaaaaaaan naaaaaaaaaaan include adenine might wrongfully called adenine instead sequencing highly repetitive segment target dnarna might result

complexity sequence assembly driven two major factors number fragments lengths longer fragments allow better identification sequence overlaps also pose problems underlying algorithms show quadratic even exponential complexity behaviour number fragments length shorter sequences faster align also complicate layout phase assembly shorter reads difficult use repeats near identical repeats earliest days dna sequencing scientists could gain sequences short length dozen bases weeks work laboratories hence sequences could aligned minutes hand dideoxy termination method aka sanger sequencing

technologies eg nanopore sequencing continue emerge despite higher error rates technologies important assembly longer read length helps address repeat problem impossible assemble perfect repeat longer maximum read length however reads become longer chance perfect repeat large becomes small gives longer sequencing reads advantage assembling repeats even low accuracy different organisms distinct
