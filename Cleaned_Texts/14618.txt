bird extinction complete elimination species members taxonomic class aves known bird species approximately become extinct critically general consensus among ornithologists anthropogenic activities continue current trends suggest onethird bird species even greater proportion bird populations rendered extinct end critically endangered species scientists estimate face extinction decades without proper conservation efforts species current presence extant populations often impacted many factors simultaneously habitat loss exploitation invasive species greatest influences avian extinction island species especially sensitive factors bird extinctions since late century native habitat loss sizable impact birds deforestation particular associated declines around known avian birds may susceptible anthropogenic activities due morphology smaller avian species tend harmed significantly destruction habitat bigger species often endangered human hunting invasive species larger birds faced extinction often island species differences influence among birds may association traits differ many island mainland although complete destruction habitat gravely diminish species viability fragmentation habitat also harmful associated extinction example wood thrush although extant endangered seen substantial decline due part fragmented habitats brownheaded cowbird native brood parasite much pervasive smaller forested areas shift habitat made wood thrush woodland songbirds susceptible parasitism reducing exploitative behavior egg collection hunting eg feathers meat taxidermy etc also linked extinction species decline inherently activities opposition wildlife excessive harvest significantly harm populations potentially resulting extirpation andor complete often associated antiquity bird exploitation still issue prevalent century even establishment conservational statutes ortolan bunting songbird considered traditional delicacy hunted illegally france faces complete pet trade also strong ties bird extinction particularly affecting parrots poaching primary cause spixs macaws extinction invasive species also pose significant threat bird survival birds limited distribution eg island species greater invasives dangerous birds pigs rodents etc typically damage bird species via groundlevel predation especially many islandendemic species experience defense case kākāpō
