history research origin life encompasses theories life began ancient times philosophy aristotle millerurey experiment panspermia hypothesis life exists throughout universe distributed meteoroids asteroids attempt explain life originated shifts origin another heavenly body advantage life required formed planet occurs rather single location spread galaxy star systems via cometary meteorite evidence scant finds support studies martian meteorites found antarctica extremophile microbes survival outer space terrestrial bacteria particularly deinococcus radiodurans highly resistant environmental hazards could survive least three years outer space based studies international space extreme speculation biochemistry life could begun early million years big bang supposedly habitable epoch life may exist throughout carl zimmer speculated chemical conditions including boron molybdenum oxygen needed create rna may better early mars early lifesuitable molecules originating mars would later migrated earth via meteor ejections traditional religion attributed origin life deities created natural world spontaneous generation first naturalistic theory abiogenesis goes back aristotle ancient greek philosophy continued support western scholarship theory held lower animals generated decaying organic substances aristotle stated example aphids arise dew plants flies putrid matter mice dirty hay crocodiles rotting sunken basic idea life continuously created result chance century people began question spontaneous generation works like thomas brownes pseudodoxia epidemica contemporary alexander ross erroneously rebutted robert hooke published first drawings microorganism antonie van leeuwenhoek drew described microorganisms probably protozoa many felt existence supported spontaneous generation since seemed simplistic sexual reproduction asexual reproduction cell division yet observed van leeuwenhoek disagreed spontaneous generation convinced using experiments ranging sealed open meat incubation close study insect reproduction theory francesco redi showed maggots appeared meat flies prevented laying lazzaro spallanzani demonstrated microbes present air could killed boiling louis pasteurs experiments demonstrated organisms bacteria fungi spontaneously appear sterile nutrientrich media could appear invasion withoutcitation needed middle century biogenesis supported much evidence spontaneous generation effectively disproven pasteur remarked finding never doctrine spontaneous generation recover mortal blow struck simple gave mechanism life diversified simple organisms variety complex forms today scientists agree current life descends earlier life become progressively complex diverse charles darwins mechanism evolution natural selection darwin wrote jd hooker march stating mere rubbish thinking present origin life one might well think origin matter origin species referred life created really meant appeared wholly unknown process soon regretted using old testament term single generally accepted model origin life scientists proposed several plausible hypotheses share common elements differing details hypotheses based framework laid alexander oparin john haldane first molecules constituting earliest cells synthesized natural conditions slow process molecular evolution molecules organized first molecular system properties biological oparin haldane suggested atmosphere early earth may chemically reducing nature composed primarily methane ammonia water hydrogen sulfide carbon dioxide carbon monoxide co phosphate molecular oxygen ozone either rare absent according later models atmosphere late hadean period consisted largely nitrogen carbon dioxide smaller amounts carbon monoxide hydrogen sulfur lack molecular oxygen chemically reducing oparin haldane supposed new notable research hypothesis subject appeared oparin reasoned atmospheric oxygen prevents synthesis certain organic compounds necessary building blocks life book origin proposed echoing darwin spontaneous generation life attacked pasteur fact occur impossible conditions found early earth changed preexisting organisms would immediately consume spontaneously generated organism oparin argued primeval soup organic molecules could created oxygenless atmosphere action sunlight would combine ever complex ways formed coacervate droplets droplets would grow fusion droplets reproduce fission daughter droplets primitive metabolism factors promote cell integrity survive become extinct many modern theories origin life still take oparins ideas starting point time haldane suggested earths prebiotic oceans quite different modern counterparts would formed hot dilute soup organic compounds could formed bernal called idea biopoiesis biopoesis process living matter evolving selfreplicating nonliving proposed biopoiesis passes number intermediate stages robert shapiro summarized primordial soup theory oparin haldane mature form john bernal showed based upon subsequent work difficulty principle forming molecules recognize necessary molecules life inorganic precursors underlying hypothesis held oparin haldane bernal miller urey instance multiple conditions primeval earth favoured chemical reactions synthesized set complex organic compounds simple precursors bernal coined term biopoiesis refer origin suggested occurred three stages bernal suggested evolution commenced stages bernal regarded third stage biological reactions incorporated behind cells boundary difficult modern work way cell membranes selfassemble work micropores various substrates may key step towards understanding development independent freeliving stanley miller harold urey performed experiment demonstrated organic molecules could spontaneously formed inorganic precursors conditions like posited oparinhaldane hypothesis experiment used highly reducing mixture ammonia hydrogen well water form simple organic monomers amino mixture gases cycled apparatus delivered electrical sparks mixture one week found carbon system form racemic mixture organic compounds including amino acids building blocks proteins provided direct experimental support second point soup theory around remaining two points theory much debate centers reanalysis saved vials uncovered biochemicals originally discovered including amino acids studies suggest primeval atmosphere earth
