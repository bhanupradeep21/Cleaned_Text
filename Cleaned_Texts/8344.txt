anatomy polyp abnormal growth tissue projecting mucous membrane attached surface narrow elongated stalk said pedunculated attached without stalk said sessile polyps commonly found colon stomach nose ear sinuses urinary bladder uterus may also occur elsewhere body mucous membranes including cervix vocal folds small intestine polyps tumors neoplasms others nonneoplastic example hyperplastic dysplastic benign neoplastic ones usually benign although premalignant concurrent malignancy name ancient origin use english nasal polyp latin polypus animal similar appearance called polyp attested although word earlier used octopus relative incidences location incidences malignancy risks various types colorectal relative incidences gastric colon polyps commonly associated symptoms occasionally may cause rectal bleeding rare occasions pain diarrhea concern potential colon cancer present microscopically risk benign colon polyps becoming malignant since polyps asymptomatic usually discovered time colon cancer screening common screening methods occult blood test colonoscopy modern flexible endoscope sigmoidoscopy usually older rigid endoscope lower gastrointestinal series barium enema digital rectal examination dre virtual colonoscopy polyps routinely removed time colonoscopy either wire loop known polypectomy snare first description p deyhle germany biopsy forceps adenomatous polyp found must removed since polyp precancerous propensity become cancerous certainty polyps found diagnostic modality removed colonoscopy although colon cancer usually found polyps smaller cm polyps found removed since removal reduces likelihood future colon cancer adenomatous polyps removed repeat colonoscopy usually performed three five years latercitation needed colon polyps categorized sporadic adenomatous polyps adenomas polyps grow lining colon carry high risk cancer adenomatous polyp considered premalignant ie likely develop colon types polyps occur colon hyperplastic inflammatory polyps unlikely develop colorectal people aged least one adenomatous polyp cm diameter multiple adenomatous polyps often result familial polyposis coli familial adenomatous polyposis condition carries high risk colon adenomas constitute approximately digestive polyps polyps approximately small usually less cm diameter small potential malignancy remaining adenomas larger cm approach chance containing invasive three types adenomatous polyp risks progression colorectal cancer increase polyp larger cm contains higher percentage villous component also shape polyps related risk progression carcinoma polyps pedunculated stalk usually less dangerous sessile polyps flat polyps sessile polyps shorter pathway migration invasive cells tumor submucosal distant structures also difficult remove ascertain sessile polyps larger cm usually contain villous features higher malignant potential tend recur following colonoscopic although polyps carry significant risk colon cancer tubular adenomatous polyps may become cancerous grow larger larger tubular adenomatous polyps increased risk malignancy larger develop villous components may become estimated individual whose parents diagnosed adenomatous polyp greater chance develop colon cancer individuals family history colonic way establish risks colon polyps patients family history overall nearly population regardless family history risk developing colon cancercitation needed screening colonic polyps well preventing become important part management condition medical societies established guidelines colorectal screening order prevent adenomatous polyps minimize chances developing colon cancer believed changes diet might helpful preventing polyps occurring way prevent polyps developing cancerous growths detecting removing themcitation needed colon polyps grow sometimes cause bleeding within intestine detected occult blood test according american cancer society guidelines people annual occult blood test people recommended flexible sigmoidoscopies performed every years detect abnormal growth could adenomatous polyp adenomatous polyps detected procedure colonoscopy recommended medical societies recommend colonoscopies every ten years starting age necessary screening practice colon screening provides accurate image intestine also allows removal polyp found adenomatous polyp identified colonoscopy several methods removal including using snare heating colonoscopies preferred sigmoidoscopies allow examination entire colon detect polyps upper colon half polyps occurcitation needed statistically demonstrated screening programs effective reducing number deaths caused colon cancer due adenomatous polyps risk complications associated colonoscopies approximately percent compared lifetime risk developing colon cancer around small likelihood recurrence surveillance polyp removal recommendedcitation needed endometrial polyp uterine polyp polyp lesion lining uterus endometrium takes space
