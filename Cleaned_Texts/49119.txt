animal captivity confinement domestic wild specifically animals held humans prevented escaping said term animal captivity usually applied wild animals held confinement term may also used generally describe keeping domesticated animals livestock pets may include example animals farms private homes zoos laboratories animal captivity may categorized according particular motives objectives conditions confinement throughout history domestic animals like pets livestock kept captivity tended humans however pets livestock animals put captivity receive human care wild animals well despite fact wild animals harbored humans thousands years captivity always come close present zoos failed domestication attempts furthermore wealthy predominantly aristocrats kings collected wild animals various reasons affluent built first zoos personal collections demonstrate dominance wealth private collections animals known menageries contrary domestication ferociousness natural behaviour wild animals preserved exhibited today zoos claim reasons keeping animals human care conservation education science captive animals especially domesticated sometimes develop abnormal behaviours one type abnormal behaviour stereotypical behaviors ie repetitive apparently purposeless motor behaviors examples stereotypical behaviours include pacing selfinjury route tracing excessive selfgrooming behaviors associated stress lack stimulation animals exhibit tend suffer zoochosis manifested stereotypical many keep animals captivity attempt prevent decrease stereotypical behavior introducing stimuli process known environmental enrichment goals environmental enrichment make environments complex fluid offer engaging complex processes give animals chances make decisions techniques commonly used provide environmental enrichment include social occupation physical sensory another type abnormal behavior shown captive animals selfinjurious behavior sib selfinjurious behavior indicates activity involves biting scratching hitting hair plucking eye poke may result injuring although reported incidence low selfinjurious behavior observed across range primate species especially experience social isolation selfbite involves biting ones arms legs shoulders genitals threat bite involves biting ones hand wrist staring observer conspecific mirror threatening manner selfhit involves striking oneself part body eye poking behavior widely observed primates presses knuckle finger orbital space eye socket hair plucking jerking motion applied ones hair hands teeth thus resulting excessive proximal causes selfinjurious behavior widely studied captive primates either social nonsocial factors trigger type behavior social factors include changes group composition stress separation group approaches aggression members groups conspecific male individuals nearby separation females removal social isolation particularly disruptions early motherrearing experiences important risk studies suggested although motherreared rhesus macaques still exhibit selfinjurious nurseryreared rhesus macaques much likely selfabuse motherreared nonsocial factors include presence small cut wound irritant cold weather human contact frequent zoo example study shown zoo visitors density positively correlates number gorillas banging barrier low zoo visitors density caused gorillas behave relaxed way captive animals often escape attention disruption caused general public stress resulting lack environmental control may lead increased rate selfinjurious studies suggest many abnormal captive behaviors including selfinjurious behavior successfully treated pair housing pair housing provides previously singlehoused animal samesex social method especially effective primates widely known social social companionship provided pair housing encourages social interaction thus reducing abnormal anxietyrelated behavior captive animals well increasing wild animals may placed captivity conservation studies exotic pet trade places captivity connected aza association zoos aquariums may hold animals captive means save extinction example aza safe save animals extinction promotes wellbeing care animals conservation additional disciplines order protect aid wildlife organization focuses creating recovery plans cooperation aza workers advancement conservation furthermore aza zoos aquariums accredited aza use help educators veterinarians people research assistance zoos aquariums able proper necessities needed recovery programs prevent animals going annually subjected thousands wild animals end captivity due wild animal trade animals held captivity overabundance population roadside zoos additional reasons animals may end captivity animals captured original habitat come animal breeders come black market wild animals captured held captivity may sold pet stores auction sales world wide zoos known place visitors come see wild means zoos may keep animals confinement example zoos may keep animals captive means save going extinct specifically science advances published study concluded work population human beings affected growth animals going extinct around world uproar animals going extinct caused zoos use captive breeding programs endangered animals effort create stronger population said zoos responsible reducing number animals endangered species list zoos could also known place animals put taken natural habitat animals pulled native habitat taken location unfamiliar said animals may experience shock poor mental health furthermore wild animals died inside zoos due shock placed unknown setting specific also mean taking animals away native habitat possibly disrupt way living animal husbandry animal rights wild animal keeping
