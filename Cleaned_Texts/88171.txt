barnlunds model influential transactional model communication first published dean barnlund formulated attempt overcome limitations earlier models communication regard rejects idea communication consists transmission ideas sender receiver instead identifies communication production meaning response internal external cues barnlund holds world objects meaningless meaning depends people create meaning assign aim process reduce uncertainty arrive shared understanding meaning constant flux since interpretation habits people keep changing barnlunds model based set fundamental assumptions holding communication dynamic continuous circular irreversible complex unrepeatable cues central importance barnlunds model cue anything one may attribute meaning trigger response barnlund distinguishes public private behavioral cues public cues available anyone present communicative situation like piece furniture smell antiseptic room private cues accessible one person like sounds heard earphones pain ones chest behavioral cues direct control communicators contrast public private cues include verbal behavioral cues like making remark weather nonverbal behavioral cues pointing toward object barnlunds model uses arrows going communicators different types cues represent person gives attention certain cues decoding encode produce behavioral cues response barnlund developed intrapersonal interpersonal model intrapersonal model shows simpler case one person involved processes decoding encoding interpersonal model two people participate react public private cues also behavioral cues person produces barnlunds model influential first major transactional model communication pertains criticism earlier models impacted development later models criticized based claim effective forms communication fails explain meaning created dean barnlund understands models attempts create simplified picture underlying complex especially relevant complex process good model manages portray salient features single glance may thus assist researchers empirical studies however form simplification also comes risks like overlooking distorting factors present real barnlunds model aims present main components communication terms functions barnlund formulated transactional model communication response simplifications limitations found various earlier models take form linear transmission models interaction linear transmission models like model see communication linear process sender encodes idea form message transmits message channel receiver receiver decode message order understand however many subsequent communication theorists pointed linear transmission models simple account forms communication regular facetoface conversation example usually designated sender receiver instead participants send receive messages problem partially resolved interaction models like schramms interaction models communication twoway process include feedback loop messages exchanged back forth linear circular participants take turns encoding decoding messages linear transmission models interaction models common understand communication transmission exchange barnlund tries overcome limitations approaches emphasizing complexity agrees interaction models participants act sender receiver goes beyond pointing encoding decoding two distinct processes two simultaneous interdependent aspects process rejects idea meaning exists prior communication sees instead product communication communicators assign world around words communication production meaning rather production barnlund world contents meaningless become intelligible significant meaning assigned ordering process happen automatically product mind learned barnlund uses term communication wide sense referring acts meaning develops within human involves typical forms verbal communication like talking friend event occurred also includes nonverbal communication pointing somewhere grimacing pain however since processes meaningmaking restricted exchanges people also forms communication taking place person reason decode internal external stimuli encode corresponding behavioral since processes stop sensory deprivation sleep barnlund includes even cases forms barnlund aim communication reduce uncertainty act efficiently arrive form shared understanding phenomenon negotiating emphasizes active nature process meaning something invented assigned given rather something follows meaning intrinsic property sounds gestures ascribed example cultures assign nodding meaning yes means cultures case meaning nod arises applies equally national flags traffic signs contain meaning instead anything gets meaning interpreted certain regard barnlund understands communication production meaning mere production exchange meaning constant flux practice interpretation continuously evolving individual societal level meanings assigned thing may change lot time passes example learning new word person starts ascribe new meaning corresponding sound societal level many new phrases introduced rise online communication meaning preexisting phrases also changed result reason different interpretations never fully consistent barnlunds model based set fundamental assumptions communication dynamic continuous circular irreversible complex communication dynamic sense static entity everchanging continuous process assigning meanings objects world happens process clear beginning end goes even sensory seeing communication circular barnlund rejects idea found linear transmission models messages pass linear process sender receiver instead participants act sender widest sense even happens one person present making sense world around communication irreversible sense effects communicators undone regard communication influences changes participants various ways conversation usually way go back restore state communicators prior communication complex many reasons many components many types communication many factors determine communicative process reason also unrepeatable means easy way communicative exchange since would mean controlling factors affecting plays often possible message two occasions retelling joke news report usually exactly implies person may interpret message two distinct occurrences differently depending situation context personal changes barnlunds model communication one wellknown transactional models communication published dean barnlund article transactional model based idea countless external internal cues present communication consists decoding ascribing meaning encoding appropriate responses happens intrapersonal communication person present interpersonal communication communicating cues objects signs aspects one may attribute meaning may trigger interpretations reactions one kind barnlund understands communication response always vast number cues present moment people interpret react many ways communicators may respond cues influence explicitly talking cue one way respond many cues influence process barnlund distinguishes three types cues public cues private cues behavioral public cues belong environment direct control communicators natural cues created human intervention examples natural cues atmospheric conditions visual properties minerals shape vegetables contrast artificial cues resulting human manipulation environment processed wood pile magazines smell antiseptic doctors waiting public cues accessible anyone environment private cues contrast accessible specific individual include listening podcast earbuds coins hidden ones many private cues internal thoughts emotions feeling sudden pain ones communicators behavior also source cues nonverbal cues form gestures verbal cues talking public private cues outside direct control communicators contrast behavioral cues controlled communicators constitute reactions behavioral cues include deliberative acts picking magazine unconscious mannerisms moving eyebrows response unexpected central aspect verbal communication concerns encoding decoding verbal behavioral however cues relevant interpretation usually depends cues present example different meaning may assigned remark depending whether made clinic golf course public cue whether speaker enunciates stern face flushes time nonverbal behavioral cue way communicators interpret kinds cues reduce ambiguity important aspect different types cues transferred one type another type example private cue form thought transferred verbal behavioral cue expressed speech public cues may changed private cues example book closed hide contents vast number cues available moment communicators select ones want attend different communicators focus different cues decoding give special weight nonverbal cues focus private selection also depends valence cue ie positive negative meaning communicator ascribes barnlund aim communication reduce successful many relevant cues possible interpreted process communicators try keep open mind different potential meanings cue goal arrive coherent picture meaning interpreted cues since interaction shapes intrapersonal communication special form communication since involve second person certain respects similar forms communication person decodes internal external stimuli trying make sense world around encodes neuromuscular reactions barnlund first discusses case intrapersonal communication since fewer elements reason easier understand interpersonal communication diagram circle middle represents person areas around symbolize different types cues currently present person engaged activity decoding cues orange arrows encoding responses cues yellow arrow orange arrows point toward cues express meaning actively assigned received read spiral inside person indicates activities encoding decoding distinct processes different interdependent aspects one barnlund uses example person waiting alone reception room clinic person confronted various cues assigns meaning public cues like furniture magazines table rainstorm outside window others private like persons memory last visit mint taste chewing gum also include behavioral cues form persons awareness bodily movements flipping page magazine altering position chair may change one moment next cues present ones person attends person responds interpersonal communication paradigmatic form communication happens two people interact take form regular facetoface conversation includes many forms phone calls texting slipping someone note barnlund interpersonal communication significantly complex people cues clear division sender receiver since communicators play roles shown diagram two sets private cues one communicator like two sets nonverbal behavioral cues addition also verbal behavioral cues present correspond linguistic exchange taking place speaker says teacher writes blackboard yellow arrows show participant generates verbal nonverbal behavioral cues orange arrows represent activity decoding cues interpersonal communication communicator also aware verbal nonverbal behavioral cues generated party react cues depends cues barnlund uses example doctor entering waiting room greet patient different public cues discussed furniture magazines still present may slightly different person person example watch hanging wall behind patient visible doctor doctors wellhidden fatigue private cue patient aware doctor greets patient extends hand produce verbal nonverbal behavioral cues patient becomes aware decide respond response generate verbal nonverbal behavioral cues many cues influence exchange unfolds example private cue form fond memory patient doctor may positive impact public cue form unpleasant smell waiting area may negative impact even smell never mentioned barnlund points interpersonal communication participants usually pay attention behavior otherwise reason aware person interprets therefore exercise control behavioral cues produce form selfregulation happens soon person present often verbal communication taken barnlunds objections earlier models communication influenced various subsequent theorists pertains specifically focus complexity communication complexity often missed attempt simplify process form compact another influential element idea meaning constructed communicators attributed cues rather merely received sent around form barnlunds emphasis role interpretation personal meaning ascriptions constant flux adopted many subsequent transactional model often seen origin constitutive models applied fields teaching market research business barnlunds model criticized various ways example argued effective facetoface smallgroup communication reading writing mass communication since role specific environment less pronounced cases another objection barnlunds model fails explain meaning created example take account communicative competence may help participants take conscious control meaning created barnlund dean c july transactional model communication akin johnnye goldberg alvin myers gail stewart joseph eds language behavior de gruyter mouton pp isbn
