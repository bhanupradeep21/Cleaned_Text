contribution paleontology hence paleobiology one first researchers tried put flesh onto bones time paleontologists mainly interested assembling bones tried deduce physiology living behavior dinosaurs studying nopcsa first suggest archosaurs cared young exhibited complex social behavior idea take one first people study biology dinosaurs known father even though coined term paleophysiology study evolution physiology works field exploited paleohistological another nopcsas theories ahead time birds evolved grounddwelling dinosaurs theory cursorial origin theorized proavis theorized predecessor birds running animal forearms lifted ground would flap made jump scales forearms would develop feathers aid eventually allowing theory found favor later gained wide acceptance though later fossil finds treeliving feathered dinosaurs suggest development flight may complex nopcsa envisioned additionally nopcsas conclusion least mesozoic era reptiles shared much scientific community nopcsa studied transylvanian dinosaurs intensively even though smaller cousins elsewhere world example unearthed sixmeterlong sauropods group dinosaurs elsewhere commonly grew meters named nopcsa deduced area remains found island hațeg island haţeg hatzeg basin romania mesozoic theorized limited resources found islands commonly effect reducing size animals generations producing localized form dwarfism nopcsas theory insular known island today widely additional pygmy sauropods named europasaurus recently discovered northern nopcsa also created theory dinosaurs sexual dimorphism published among others thought hadrosaurid species cranial crests males without females paired kritosaurus parasaurolophus prosaurolophus saurolophus others examples proved true opinion sexual dimorphism present among hadrosaurid dinosaurs gained acceptance see example lambeosaurus nopcsa discovered named several species lifetime named species mochlodon later renamed rhabdodon robustum also named struthiosaurus transylvanicus described named teinurosaurus meaning extended tail named turtle species kallokibotion bajazidi literally means beautiful box bajazid reason name shell reminded bajazids nopcsa also interested evolutionary especially macroevolution fossil record yield relevant data nopcsa also important indeed nopcsa one first scholars study geology western balkans particularly
