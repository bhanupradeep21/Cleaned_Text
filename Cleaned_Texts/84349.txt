produced hydrolysis starch isosorbide discussed plantbased platform chemical biodegradable derivatives various functionality obtained commonly prescribed medication united states million hydrogenation glucose gives sorbitol isosorbide obtained acidcatalyzed dehydration dsorbitol yields monocyclic furanoid turn forms dehydration bicyclic furofuran derivative reaction gives isosorbide addition undesirable byproducts removed costly distillation recrystallization alcohols recrystallization combination methods deposition vapor high purity product essential use monomer uncoloured high molecular weight polymers shall obtained isosorbide white crystalline highly hydrophilic solid two secondary hydroxy groups vshaped bicyclic system possess different orientations leading different chemical reactivities allows selective monoderivatization isosorbide hydroxy group endo oriented forms hydrogen bond oxygen atom adjacent furan ring makes hydroxy group nucleophilic reactive exo oriented
