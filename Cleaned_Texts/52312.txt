bedwetting alarm behavioral treatment nocturnal enuresis enuresis alarm methodology originated french german physicians first decade century meinhard von pfaundler german pediatrician made discovery accidentally original intention create alarm device would notify nursing staff child bed wetting needed changed showing device significant therapeutic advantages certain time despite early success treatment developed two independent groups psychologists orval mowrer willie mae mowrer john morgan frances witmer mowrer used modified pfaundler alarm device children ages years showing empirical success bell pad method treatment nocturnal enuresis maximum time required accomplish treatment exceeding two individual places sensor usually located briefs underwear turns alarm device various types alarms going sleep enuresis alarm triggered sensor sheets night clothes becomes wet urine setting auditory signal intention causing individual wake cease voiding arise void parents advised wake child alarm children prone turn go back highly suggested treatment alarm worn every night treatment effect response immediate treatment continued months child dry consecutive nights whichever comes may cultural differences acceptability may highly disruptive household may require significant commitment time effort family must motivated adhere therapy successful preemptively apprised likely difficulties assured first weeks troublesome necessary doctors monitor childs progress early address problems facilitate enuresis alarm utilizes classical operant conditioning provide means causing sleeping individual regularly awakened immediately onset urination void toilet prevent bed classical conditioning paradigm components bell pad method following unconditioned stimulus us awakening stimulus alarm sound unconditioned response ur awakening response sphincter contraction neutral stimulus ns feeling produced bladder distention feeling full bladder conditioned stimulus cs feeling produced bladder distention conditioned response cr awakening response sphincter contraction initially individual experiences alarm sounding activated urination us eliciting awakening response sphincter contraction ur wake stop urinating travel bathroom continued pairing alarm sound us feeling full bladder ns previous ns feeling full bladder becomes cs elicits waking response cr waking go use bathroom operant conditioning paradigm alarm sound serves noxious stimuli added environment effectively implementing positive punishment procedure whenever individual activates alarm urinating eventually causes avoidance response individual maintain behavior negative reinforcement avoiding alarm sound altogether future individual wakes urinate avoids wetting researchers enuresis alarm credit treatment effect classical conditioning paradigm explained original research however researchers noted important difference conditioning treatment usual classical conditioning treatment typical classical conditioning unconditioned stimulus withdrawn conditioned response gradually weakens repeated application conditioned stimulus successful cases enuresis alarm conditioning treatment extinction occurs following withdrawal alarm stimulus suggests conditioning treatment may follow operant avoidance conditioning rather classical conditioning addition strictly classical conditioning explanation fails incorporate social positive reinforcement may introduced individuals environment family members signs improvement taking account social however theorized classical operant conditioning contribute effectiveness treatment urine sensor necessary part bedwetting alarm basic urine sensor consists two electricity conductors separated moisture absorbing insulating material low dc electric voltage provided batteries applied across conductors low voltage usually volts dangerous user insulating material frequently cotton cloth common briefs absorbs urine allows electricity pass conductors resulting small electric current conductors conductors attached alarm device triggers alarm senses current sensors alarms engineered based concept note unless urine reaches sensor mechanism adequately wets briefs insulator conductors urine may sensed alarm activate sensors usually classified terms attachment mechanisms briefs urine absorbing medium major sensor attachment categories mechanical clips sticky tape pads flat surface sensors magnetic attachment wiring sewed special briefs stainless steel clips often used easily attached detached briefs point urination flat surface sensors require sticky tape pads attached briefs magnetic sensors magnetically attached briefs magnetic sensors wired briefs typically used wireless alarms another consideration sensor cable applicable attached alarm transmitter case wired alarms wireless alarms wireless alarms truly wireless transmitter part sensor completely selfcontained wired alarms sensors wire cable runs sensor located point urination underneath users pajama shirt wherever alarm located body frequently collar pajama shirt close ear attachment mechanism alarm electric current flows alarm important easily detached unintentionally comes alarm use alarm may triggered connectors plastic telephone jacks unlikely detached unintentionally etc wearable alarm design child patient wears moisture sensor underwear pajamas type sensor detect moisture almost immediately sensor attached alarm unit electricity conducting wire cable worn shirt many wearable alarms vibrate well sound wake deep wireless bedwetting alarm one sensor alarm unit communicate means wire transmitter senses moisture directly attached childs underwear signal transmitted wirelessly unit across room child alarm unit childs room alarm unit activated necessary get bed turn new wireless alarms add convenience also sounding alarm caregivers room allowing patient caregiver sleep comfort privacy beds rooms multiple alarms house increase convenience remote controls facilitate using wireless bedwetting alarm system especially convenient parent belland pad alarms attach child way moisture sensor form pad mat child sleeps top pad detects moisture urine leaked onto alarm unit connected cord usually sits bedside stand alarm requires larger amount urine sensor detect moisture person must pad sense successful outcome enuresis
