atrial flutter afl common abnormal heart rhythm starts atrial chambers first occurs usually associated fast heart rate classified type supraventricular atrial flutter characterized suddenonset usually regular abnormal heart rhythm electrocardiogram ecg heart rate fast symptoms may include feeling heart beating fast hard skipping beats chest discomfort difficulty breathing feeling ones stomach dropped feeling lightheaded loss consciousness although abnormal heart rhythm typically occurs individuals cardiovascular disease eg high blood pressure coronary artery disease cardiomyopathy diabetes mellitus may occur spontaneously people otherwise normal hearts typically stable rhythm often degenerates atrial fibrillation rarely persist months years similar abnormal heart rhythm atrial fibrillation atrial flutter also leads poor contraction atrial chambers heart leads pooling blood heart lead formation blood clots heart poses significant risk breaking traveling bloodstream resulting strokes supraventricular tachycardia ventricular heart rate beats per minute suggestive though necessarily diagnostic atrial flutter administration adenosine vein intravenously help medical personnel differentiate atrial flutter forms supraventricular immediate treatment atrial flutter centers slowing heart rate medications beta blockers eg metoprolol calcium channel blockers eg diltiazem affected person chest pain lost consciousness blood pressure normal known stable atrial flutter affected person chest pain lost consciousness low blood pressure unstable atrial flutter urgent electrical shock heart restore normal heart rhythm necessary longterm use blood thinners eg warfarin apixaban important component treatment reduce risk blood clot formation heart resultant medications used restore normal heart rhythm antiarrhythmics ibutilide effectively control atrial flutter time started atrial flutter recurs high rate time despite continued atrial flutter treated definitively technique known

characteristic sensations heart feeling like beating fast hard sensations usually last episode resolves heart rate needed atrial flutter usually welltolerated initially high heart rate people normal response exercise however people underlying heart diseases coronary artery disease poor exercise tolerance may rapidly develop symptoms shortness breath chest pain lightheadedness dizziness nausea patients nervousness feelings impending needed prolonged atrial flutter fast heart rates may lead decompensation loss normal heart function heart failure may manifest exercise intolerance exertional breathlessness difficulty breathing night swelling legs andor needed although often regarded relatively benign heart rhythm problem atrial flutter shares complications related condition atrial fibrillation paucity published data directly comparing two overall mortality conditions appears rapid heart rates may produce significant symptoms patients preexisting heart disease lead inadequate blood flow heart muscle even heart rare situations atrial flutter associated fast heart rate persists extended period time without corrected normal heart rhythm leads tachycardiainduced even individuals normal heart heart beats quickly prolonged period time lead ventricular decompensation heart failurecitation needed little effective contraction atria stasis pooling blood atria stasis blood susceptible individuals lead formation thrombus blood clot within heart thrombus likely form atrial appendages blood clot left atrial appendage particularly important left side heart supplies blood entire body arteries thus thrombus material dislodges side heart embolize break travel brains arteries potentially devastating consequence stroke thrombus material course embolize portion body
