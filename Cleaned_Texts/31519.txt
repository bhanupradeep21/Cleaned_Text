nicolas rashevsky november january american theoretical physicist one pioneers mathematical biology also considered father mathematical biophysics theoretical studied theoretical physics st vladimir imperial university kiev left ukraine october revolution emigrating first turkey poland france finally us needed usa worked first westinghouse research labs pittsburgh focused theoretical physics modeling cell division mathematics cell fission awarded rockefeller fellowship went university chicago take appointment assistant professor department physiologycitation needed inspired reading growth form darcy wentworth thompson made first major contribution publishing first book mathematical biophysics also founded first mathematical biology international journal entitled bulletin mathematical biophysics bmb two essential contributions founded field mathematical biology bmb journal serving focus contributing mathematical biologists last years published one first books mathematical biology mathematical biophysics entitled mathematical biophysics physicomathematical foundations biology fundamental book eventually published three revised editions last revision appearing two volumes followed advances applications mathematical biology mathematical theory human relations approach mathematical model societycitation needed year established world firstcitation needed phd program mathematical biology university chicago early rashevsky developed first model neural paraphrased boolean context student walter pitts together warren mcculloch article published rashevskys bulletin mathematical biophysics pittsmcculloch article subsequently became extremely influential research artificial intelligence artificial neural later efforts focused topology biological systems formulation fundamental principles biology relational biology set theory propositional logic formulation hierarchical organization organisms human societies second half introduced concept organismic sets provided unified framework physics biology sociology subsequently developed authors organismic supercategories complex systems biology rashevskys outstanding phd students earned doctorate supervision george karreman herbert daniel landahl clyde coombs robert rosen anatol rapoport anatol rapoport took rashevskys course mathematical biology rashevsky could teach mathematical sociology insteadcitation needed however advanced ideas abstract relational biology concepts found little support beginning amongst practicing experimental molecular biologists although current developments complex systems biology clearly follow footstepscitation needed budget committee mathematical biology drastically cut however least part politically imposed rather scientifically motivated thus subsequent university chicago represented genetics nobel laureate george wells reversed previous position quadrupled financial support rashevskys committee mathematical biology research activities reminiscences nicolas rashevsky robert rosen written late later however fall retiring nicolas rashevsky university chicago president successor chair committee mathematical biology nicolas rashevsky strongly supported dr herbert landahlhis first phd student graduate mathematical biophysics whereas president wished appoint certain us biostatistician result rashevskys move university michigan ann arbor michigan taking ownership wellfunded bulletin mathematical biophysicscitation needed also formed nonprofit organization mathematical biology incorporated precursor society mathematical biology purpose dissemination information regarding mathematical biologycitation needed later years became active relational biology held well chaired first international symposium mathematical biology toledo ohio usa help former phd student dr anthony bartholomay become chairman first department mathematical medicine ohio university meeting sponsored mathematical biology inccitation needed rashevsky greatly influenced inspired herbert spencers book principles biology also j h woodger axiomatic mendelian genetics launch search quest biological principles also formulate mathematically precise principles axioms biology developed highly original approach address fundamental question life another theoretical physicist erwin schr√∂dinger asked narrower viewpoint quantum theory biologycitation needed wished reach holy grail theoretical mathematical biology heavy work load late related health toll finally prevented reaching ultimate goal rashevskys relational approach represents radical departure reductionistic approaches greatly influenced work student robert rosencitation needed nicolas rashevsky joined white russian navy wife countess emily flee lives constantinople taught american college moved prague taught special general relativitycitation needed prague moved paris france new york pittsburgh chicago usa life dedicated science founded mathematical biology wife emily supportive appreciative scientific efforts accompanying scientific meetings either initiated attendedcitation needed cut tall impressive figure slight eastern european accent clear voice thought day died heart attack caused coronary heart disease generosity well known often recognized print former associates visitors chief editor bmb declared policy helping authors optimize presentation submitted papers well proving many valuable suggestions submitting authorscitation needed suggested detailed changes additions developments like real gold mine submitting authors managed stay aloof science politics time even adverse circumstances mccarthy era completely unfounded political accusations made one two members close research group unlike another american theoretical physicist robert oppenheimer much lose loyal support wrongly accused researcher groupcitation needed article incorporates material nicolas rashevsky planetmath licensed creative commons attributionsharealike license
