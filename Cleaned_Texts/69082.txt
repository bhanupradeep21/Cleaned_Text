elimination diet also known exclusion diet diagnostic procedure used identify foods individual consume without adverse adverse effects may due food allergy food intolerance physiological mechanisms metabolic combination elimination diets typically involve entirely removing suspected food diet period time two weeks two months waiting determine whether symptoms resolve time period rare cases health professional may wish use elimination diet also referred oligoantigenic diet relieve patient symptoms common reasons undertaking elimination diet include suspected food allergies suspected food intolerances elimination diet might remove one common foods eggs milk might remove one minor nonnutritive substances artificial food colorings elimination diet relies trial error identify specific allergies intolerances typically symptoms resolve removal food diet food reintroduced see whether symptoms reappear approach claimed particularly useful casesclarification needed intermittent vague

estimated occur population unlike food allergy food intolerance occur nonatopic individuals food intolerances difficult diagnose since individual food chemicals widespread occur across range foods elimination foods one time would unhelpful diagnosing sensitivity natural chemicals benzoates salicylates found food identical artificial additives food processing provoke response since specific

skin blood test available identify offending chemicals consequently elimination diets aimed identifying food intolerances need carefully designed patients suspected food intolerance consult physician first eliminate possible elimination diet must comprehensive contain foods unlikely provoke reaction patient also need able provide complete nutrition energy weeks conducted professional nutritional advice dietitian nutritionist strongly recommended thorough education elimination diet essential ensure patients parents children suspected food intolerance understand importance complete adherence
