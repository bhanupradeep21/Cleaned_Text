hypotonia state low muscle amount tension resistance stretch muscle often involving reduced muscle strength hypotonia specific medical disorder potential manifestation many different diseases disorders affect motor nerve control brain muscle strength hypotonia lack resistance passive movement whereas muscle weakness results impaired active movement central hypotonia originates central nervous system peripheral hypotonia related problems within spinal cord peripheral nerves andor skeletal severe hypotonia infancy commonly known floppy baby syndrome recognizing hypotonia even early infancy usually relatively straightforward diagnosing underlying cause difficult often unsuccessful longterm effects hypotonia childs development later life depend primarily severity muscle weakness nature cause disorders specific treatment principal treatment hypotonia idiopathic neurologic cause physical therapy andor occupational therapy remediation hypotonia thought associated disruption afferent input stretch receptors andor lack cerebellum facilitatory efferent influence fusimotor system system innervates intrafusal muscle fibers thereby controlling muscle spindle examination diminished resistance passive movement noted muscles may feel abnormally soft limp diminished deep tendon reflexes also may noted hypotonia condition helped early interventioncitation needed central hypotonia accounts hypotonia hypotonic patients may display variety objective manifestations indicate decreased muscle tone motor skills delay often observed along hypermobile hyperflexible joints drooling speech difficulties poor reflexes decreased strength decreased activity tolerance rounded shoulder posture leaning onto supports poor attention extent occurrence specific objective manifestations depends upon age patient severity hypotonia specific muscles affected sometimes underlying cause instance people hypotonia may experience constipation others bowel problems term floppy infant syndrome used describe abnormal limpness infant born affecting limbs trunk head condition may appear immediately birth early life inability maintain proper posture movement rest severe cases hypotonic infants often difficulty feeding mouth muscles maintain proper suckswallow pattern good breastfeeding children normal muscle tone expected achieve certain physical abilities within average timeframe birth lowtone infants delayed developmental milestones length delay vary widely motor skills particularly susceptible lowtone disability divided two areas gross motor skills fine motor skills affected hypotonic infants late lifting heads lying stomachs rolling lifting sitting position remaining seated without falling balancing crawling sometimes walking fine motor skills delays occur grasping toy finger transferring small object hand hand pointing objects following movement eyes selffeedingcitation needed speech difficulties result hypotonia lowtone children learn speak later peers even appear understand large vocabulary obey simple commands difficulties muscles mouth jaw inhibit proper pronunciation discourage experimentation word combination sentenceforming since hypotonic condition actually objective manifestation underlying disorder difficult determine whether speech delays result poor muscle tone neurological condition intellectual disability may associated cause hypotonia additionally lower muscle tone caused mikhailmikhail syndrome characterized muscular atrophy cerebellar ataxia due abnormalities genecitation needed low muscle tone associated hypotonia must confused low muscle strength definition commonly used bodybuilding neurologic muscle tone manifestation periodic action potentials motor neurons intrinsic property nervous system

central nervous systems chromosomal disorders inborn errors metabolism cerebral dysgenesis trauma brain spinal metabolic causes includes glycogen storage disease type ii pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency mitochondrial disease zellweger syndrome syndrome congenital disorder glycosylation metabolic disorders infants usually presented various features dysmorphic feature seizures encephalopathy biochemistry profile apart conditions known cause hypotonia include congenital ie disease person born including genetic disorders presenting within months acquired ie onset occurs birth approach diagnosing cause hypotonia syndromes neurology first localization physician must first determine hypotonia due muscle neuromuscular junction nerve central cause narrow possible causes cause hypotonia found lie brain classified cerebral palsy cause localized muscles classified muscular dystrophy cause thought nerves called hypotonia due polyneuropathy many cases definitively diagnosing patient includes obtaining family medical history physical examination may include additional tests computerized tomography ct scans magnetic resonance imaging mri scans electroencephalogram eeg blood tests genetic testing chromosome karyotyping tests specific gene abnormalities spinal taps electromyography muscle tests muscle nerve biopsycitation needed mild benign hypotonia often diagnosed physical occupational therapists series exercises designed assess developmental progress observation physical interactions since hypotonic child difficulty deciphering spatial location may recognizable coping mechanisms locking knees attempting walk common sign lowtone infants tendency observe physical activity around long time attempting imitate due frustration early failures developmental delay indicate

nature underlying disease cases underlying cause treatable general treatment comprises providing supportive care rehabilitation services nutritional respiratory along normal pediatric care specialists may involved care child hypotonia include developmental pediatricians specialize child development neurologists neonatologists specialize care newborns geneticists occupational therapists physical therapists speech therapists orthopedists pathologists conduct interpret biochemical tests tissue analysis specialized nursing care underlying cause known treatment tailored specific disease followed symptomatic supportive therapy hypotonia severe cases treatment may primarily supportive mechanical assistance basic life functions like breathing feeding physical therapy prevent muscle atrophy maintain joint mobility measures try prevent opportunistic infections pneumonia treatments improve neurological status might involve things medication seizure disorder medicines supplements stabilize metabolic disorder surgery help relieve pressure hydrocephalus increased fluid brain national institute neurological disorders stroke states physical therapy improve motor control overall body strength individuals hypotonia crucial maintaining static dynamic postural stability important since postural instability common problem people physiotherapist develop patient specific training programs optimize postural control order increase balance protect postural asymmetries use supportive protective devices may physical therapists might use neuromuscularsensory stimulation techniques quick stretch resistance joint approximation tapping increase tone facilitating enhancing muscle contraction patients patients demonstrate muscle weakness addition hypotonia strengthening exercises overload muscles electrical muscle stimulation also known neuromuscular electrical stimulation nmes also used activate hypotonic muscles improve strength generate movement paralyzed limbs preventing disuse using nmes important patient focus attempting contract muscles stimulated without concentration movement attempts carryover volitional movement nmes ideally combined functional training activities improve outcomes occupational therapy assist patient increasing independence daily tasks improvement motor skills strength functional endurance speechlanguage therapy help breathing speech andor swallowing difficulties patient may therapy infants young children may also include sensory stimulation programs physical therapist may recommend anklefoot orthosis help patient compensate weak lower leg muscles toddlers children speech difficulties may benefit greatly using sign language term hypotonia comes ancient greek ὑπο hypo τόνος tónos τείνω teinō stretch terms condition
