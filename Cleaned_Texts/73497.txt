mycology phycology microbiology botany scholars lichenology known lichenologists lichens group received less attention classical treatises botany groups although relationship humans species documented early times several species appeared works dioscorides pliny elder theophrastus although studies deep first centuries modern age usually put forward examples spontaneous generation reproductive mechanisms totally centuries naturalists included lichens diverse groups early century french researcher joseph pitton de tournefort institutiones rei herbariae grouped genus adopted latin term lichen
