practitioners prone using treatments believe good without first evaluated adequately ensure harm patient much harm done patients result saying treatment success patient died important harm good also important know likely treatment harm patient physician go prescribing medications know prescribe medications otherwise treat patient unless knows treatment unlikely harmful least patient understands risks benefits likely benefits outweigh likely risks practice however many treatments carry risk harm circumstances eg desperate situations outcome without treatment grave risky treatments stand high chance harming patient justified risk treating also likely harm principle nonmaleficence absolute balances principle beneficence good effects two principles together often give rise double effect
