posterior cortical atrophy pca also called bensons syndrome rare form dementia considered visual variant atypical variant alzheimers disease disease causes atrophy posterior part cerebral cortex resulting progressive disruption complex visual pca first described frank benson pca usually affects people earlier age typical cases alzheimers disease initial symptoms often experienced people midfifties early case writer terry pratchett went public diagnosed rare cases pca caused dementia lewy bodies main symptom resulting posterior cortical atrophy decrease visuospatial visuoperceptual capabilities since area atrophy involves occipital lobe responsible visual atrophy progressive early symptoms include difficulty reading blurred vision light sensitivity issues depth perception trouble navigating additional symptoms include apraxia disorder movement planning alexia impaired ability read visual agnosia object recognition twostreams hypothesis damage ventral stream visual system located temporal lobe leads symptoms related general vision object recognition deficits damage dorsal wherehow stream located parietal lobe leads pca symptoms related impaired movements response visual stimuli navigation neurodegeneration spreads severe symptoms emerge including inability recognize familiar people objects trouble navigating familiar places sometimes visual addition difficulty may experienced making guiding movements towards objects decline literacy skills including reading writing spelling may furthermore neural death spreads anterior cortical regions symptoms similar alzheimers disease memory loss may pca significant atrophy one hemisphere brain hemispatial neglect may result inability see stimuli one half visual anxiety depression also common studies shown pca may variant alzheimers disease ad emphasis visual although primarily different sometimes overlapping brain regions involve progressive neural degeneration shown loss neurons synapses presence neurofibrillary tangles senile plaques affected brain regions eventually leads dementia pca cortical damage gray matter cell body loss posterior regions especially occipital parietal temporal lobes whereas alzheimers typically damage prefrontal cortex pca tends impair working memory anterograde memory leaving episodic memory intact whereas ad typically impaired episodic memory suggesting differences still lie primary areas cortical time however atrophy pca may spread regions commonly damaged ad leading shared ad symptoms deficits memory language learning although pca earlier onset diagnosis alzheimers often made suggesting degeneration simply migrated anteriorly cortical brain standard definition pca established diagnostic criteria possible know many people condition studies found percent people diagnosed alzheimers disease pca however pca often goes unrecognized true percentage may high percent researchers physicians working establish standard definition diagnostic criteria pca may also correlated lewy body disease disease b√°lints syndrome gerstmann addition pca may result part mutations presenilin gene cause pca unknown fully accepted diagnostic criteria partially due gradual onset pca symptoms variety rare nature disease younger age onset typically first international conference pca held vancouver canada continued research testing hopefully result accepted standardized criteria pca often initially misdiagnosed anxiety disorder depression suggested depression anxiety may result symptoms decreased visual function progressive nature disease early visual impairments often led referral ophthalmologist result unnecessary cataract due lack biomarkers pca neuropsychological examinations neuroimaging also assist diagnosis pca ad neuroimaging carried using mri scans singlephoton emission computed tomography positron emission tomography pet neuroimages often compared people ad assist diagnosis due early onset pca comparison ad images taken early stages disease vary brain images ad early stage brain atrophy shown centrally located right posterior lobe occipital gyrus ad brain images show majority atrophy medial temporal cortex variation within images assist early diagnosis pca however years go images become increasingly similar due majority pca also developing ad later life continued brain key aspect found brain imaging pca patients loss grey matter collections neuronal cell bodies posterior occipital temporal cortices within right people pca neuroimaging may give clear diagnosis therefore careful observation relation pca symptoms also assist variation lack organized clinical testing led continued difficulties delays diagnosis specific accepted treatment pca yet discovered may due rarity variations times people pca treated ad treatments cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil rivastigmine galantamine antidepressant drugs also provided positive treatments occupational therapy help adapting visual changes may people pca caregivers likely different needs typical cases alzheimers disease may benefit specialized support groups groups young people dementia study date definitive provide accepted conclusive analysis
