oogonium pl oogonia small diploid cell upon maturation forms primordial follicle female fetus female haploid diploid gametangium certain thallophytes oogonia formed large numbers mitosis early fetal development primordial germ cells humans start develop weeks present fetus weeks normal oogonia human ovaries spherical ovoid shape found amongst neighboring somatic cells oocytes different phases development oogonia distinguished neighboring somatic cells electron microscope observing nuclei oogonial nuclei contain randomly dispersed fibrillar granular material whereas somatic cells condensed nucleus creates darker outline microscope oogonial nuclei also contain dense prominent nucleoli chromosomal material nucleus mitotically dividing oogonia shows dense mass surrounded vesicles double cytoplasm oogonia appears similar surrounding somatic cells similarly contains large round mitochondria lateral cristae endoplasmic reticulum er oogonia however underdeveloped made several small vesicles small vesicles contain cisternae ribosomes found located near golgi oogonia undergoing degeneration appear slightly different electron microscope oogonia chromosomes clump together indistinguishable mass within nucleus mitochondria er appear swollen disrupted degenerating oogonia usually found partially wholly engulfed neighboring somatic cells identifying phagocytosis mode blastocyst mammalian embryo primordial germ cells arise proximal epiblasts influence extraembryonic signals germ cells travel via amoeboid movement genital ridge eventually undifferentiated gonads week development gonads begin differentiate absence chromosome gonads differentiate ovaries ovaries differentiate ingrowths called cortical cords develop primordial germ cells week female xx embryonic development primordial germ cells grow begin differentiate oogonia oogonia proliferate via mitosis week embryonic development oogonia week development eventually oogonia either degenerate differentiate primary oocytes asymmetric division asymmetric division process mitosis one oogonium divides unequally produce one daughter cell eventually become oocyte process oogenesis one daughter cell identical oogonium parent cell occurs week month embryonic oogonia either degenerated differentiated primary oocytes primary oocytes undergo oogenesis enter meiosis however primary oocytes arrested prophase first meiosis remain arrested stage puberty begins female contrast male primordial germ cells arrested spermatogonial stage birth enter spermatogenesis meiosis produce primary spermatocytes puberty adult regulation differentiation germ cells primary gametocytes ultimately depends sex embryo differentiation gonads female mice protein responsible differentiation female xx gonads ovaries activates βcatenin signaling pathway upregulating essential step ovary differentiation research shown ovaries lacking exhibit sex reversal gonads formation ovotestes differentiation somatic sertoli cells aid development female xx germ cells collect undifferentiated gonads upregulation required germ cell differentiation oogonium eventually enter meiosis one major factor contributes upregulation initiation βcatenin signaling pathway via also responsible ovary differentiation since produced somatic cells protein acts germ cells paracrine mode however factor regulation many factors scrutiny process still theorized oogonia either degenerate differentiate primary oocytes enter oogenesis halted prophase first meiosis post partum therefore believed adult mammalian females lack population germ cells renew regenerate instead large population primary oocytes arrested first meiosis puberty one primary oocyte continue meiosis menstrual cycle absence regenerating germ cells oogonia human number primary oocytes dwindles menstrual cycle menopause female longer population primary recent research however identified renewable oogonia may present lining female ovaries humans primates thought germ cells might necessary upkeep reproductive follicles oocyte development well adulthood also discovered stem cells may migrate bone marrow ovaries source extragenial germ cells mitotically active germ cells found mammalian adults identified tracking several markers common oocytes potential renewable germ cells identified positive essential oocyte discovery active germ cells oogonia adult female could useful advancement fertility research treatment germ cells extracted isolated grown successfully germ cells used restore fertility mice promoting follicle generation upkeep previously infertile mice also research done possible germ line regeneration primates mitotically active human female germ cells could beneficial new method embryonic stem cell development involves nuclear transfer zygote using functional oogonia may help create patientspecific stem cell lines using significant controversy regarding existence mammalian oogonial stem cells controversy lies negative data originated many laboratories united states multiple approaches verify existence oogonial stem cells yielded negative results research group united states able reproduce initial phycology mycology oogonium refers female gametangium union male motile nonmotile female gamete takes place within oomycota organisms female oogonia male equivalent antheridia result sexual sporulation ie development structures within meiosis occur haploid nuclei gametes formed meiosis within antheridia oogonia fertilization occurs diploid oospore produced eventually germinate diploid somatic stage thallophyte life many algae eg chara main plant haploid oogonia antheridia form produce haploid gametes diploid part life cycle spore fertilized egg cell undergoes meiosis form haploid cells develop new plants haplontic life cycle zygotic meiosis oogonia certain thallophyte specieswhich usually round ovoid contents divided several uninucleate oospheres contrast male antheridia elongate contain several heterothallic species oogonia antheridia located hyphal branches different thallophyte colonies oogonia species fertilized antheridia another colony ensures selffertilization impossibleclarification needed contrast homothallic species display oogonia antheridia either hyphal branch separate hyphal branches within common mode fertilization found certain species thallophytes antheridia bind oogonia antheridia form fertilization tubes connecting antheridial cytoplasm oosphere within oogonia haploid nucleus gamete antheridium transferred fertilization tube oosphere fuse
