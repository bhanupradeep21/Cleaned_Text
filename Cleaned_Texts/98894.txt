protein toxicity effect buildup protein metabolic waste compounds like urea uric acid ammonia creatinine protein toxicity many causes including urea cycle disorders genetic mutations excessive protein intake insufficient kidney function chronic kidney disease acute kidney symptoms protein toxicity include unexplained vomiting loss appetite untreated protein toxicity lead serious complications seizures encephalopathy kidney damage even protein toxicity occurs protein metabolic wastes build body protein metabolism nitrogenous wastes urea uric acid ammonia creatinine produced compounds utilized human body usually excreted however due conditions renal insufficiency underfunctioning kidney unable excrete metabolic wastes causing accumulate body lead toxicity although many causes protein toxicity condition prevalent people chronic kidney disease consumes proteinrich diet specifically proteins animal sources rapidly digested metabolized causing release high concentration protein metabolic wastes blood stream protein toxicity significant role neurodegenerative diseases whether due high protein intake pathological disorders lead accumulation protein waste products efficient metabolism proteins oligomerization amino acids proteolysis mechanism protein lead well known neurodegenerative diseases includes transcriptions dysfunction propagation pathological cytoplasmic inclusions mitochondrial stress granule ammonia one waste products protein metabolism harmful especially brain crosses blood brain barrier leading whole range neurological dysfunctions cognitive impairment death brain mechanism counteract presence waste metabolite one mechanisms involved impairment brain compromise astrocyte potassium buffering astrocytes play key role however ammonia crosses system gets saturated leading astrocyte swelling brain urea another waste product originates protein metabolism humans however urea used body source nitrogen essential growth life relevant disorders urea cycle genetic leading defective enzymes transporters inhibiting reabsorption urate subsequent increase ammonia levels high protein intake lead high protein waste different protein poisoning since issue relates high level waste metabolites usually protein consumption goes onethird food consumed situation presents liver limited capacity wont deaminate proteins leading increased nitrogen body rate urea excreted keep rate produced catabolism amino acids lead toxic levels ammonia furthermore limited rate gastrointestinal tract absorb amino acids uric acid waste metabolite derived protein metabolism many high protein diets also contain higher relative fractions nucleic acids one two types nucleic acids purines pyrimidines problematic metabolized uric acid humans excess lead problems chiefly gout kidneys play essential role reabsorption excretion uric acid certain transporters located nephron apical basolateral surfaces regulate uric acid serum levels uric acid toxic nitrogen derivates antioxidant function blood low levels people compromised kidneys lower excretion uric acid leading several diseases including renal damage cardiovascular disease diabetes creatinine might direct indicator protein toxicity however important mention creatinine could increase due overwork kidneys exposed high levels protein waste also high serum creatinine levels could indicate decreased renal filtration rate due kidney disease increase byproduct consequence muscle breakdown high protein highprotein diet health concern suffering kidney disease main concern high protein intake may promote renal damage lead protein toxicity physiological changes induced increased protein intake increased glomerular pressure hyperfiltration place strain already damaged kidneys strain lead proteins inadequately metabolized subsequently causing toxicity highprotein diet lead complications renal disease linked progression disease wellknown nurses health study found correlation loss kidney function increased dietary intake animal protein people already diagnosed renal association suggests total protein intake exceeds recommendations may accelerate renal disease lead risk protein toxicity within diseased individual reason dietary protein restriction common treatment people renal disease proteinuria present protein restricted individuals shown slower rates progression renal several studies however found evidence protein toxicity due high protein intakes kidney function healthy people diets regularly exceed recommendations protein intake found lead increased glomerular filtration rate kidneys also effect hormone systems body well established physiological effects harmful individuals renal disease found responses detrimental healthy demonstrate adequate renal activity people healthy kidney function kidneys work continuously excrete byproducts protein metabolism prevents protein toxicity occurring response increased consumption dietary protein kidneys maintain homeostasis within body operating increased capacity producing higher amount urea subsequently excreting body although proposed increase waste production excretion cause increased strain kidneys research supported currently evidence suggests changes renal function occur response increased dietary protein intake part normal adaptive system employed body sustain homeostasis healthy individual wellfunctioning kidneys need concern increased dietary protein intake lead protein toxicity decreased renal function protein toxicity metabolic disorders associated chronic kidney failure shown related systemic complications atherosclerosis anemia malnutrition unexplained vomiting loss appetite indicators protein toxicity two symptoms accompanied ammonia quality breath onset kidney failure likely culprit people kidney disease dialysis advised avoid consumption protein possible consuming much accelerates condition lead death problems stem accumulation unfiltered toxins wastes protein metabolism kidney function naturally declines age due gradual loss nephrons filters kidney common causes chronic kidney disease include diabetes heart disease long term untreated high blood well abuse analgesics like ibuprofen aspirin kidney disease like polycystic kidney disease genetic nature progress individual normal conditions body ammonia urea uric acid creatinine produced protein metabolism excreted kidney urine byproducts excreted properly body accumulate become highly toxic protein consumption major source waste products accumulation waste products occur people kidney insufficiency eat diet rich protein therefore excrete waste blood urea nitrogen bun test measures amount urea nitrogen blood increased levels urea blood uremia indicator poor elimination urea body usually due kidney increased bun levels caused kidney diseases kidney stones congestive heart failure fever gastrointestinal bleedings bun levels also elevated pregnant people people whose diet consists mainly increased creatinine levels blood also sign kidney damage inability excrete protein waste byproducts properly confirmation kidney disease kidney failure often obtained performing blood test measures concentration creatinine urea blood urea creatinine blood test bun test usually performed together along blood panels treatment options protein toxicity include renal replacement therapies like hemodialysis lifestyle modifications like diet low protein decreased sodium intake exercise also incorporated part treatment plan medications may also prescribed depending symptoms common medications prescribed kidney diseases include hypertension medications like angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acei angiotensin ii receptor blockers arb found kidney diuretics may also prescribed facilitate waste excretion well fluid retention kidney transplant surgery another treatment option healthy kidney donated living deceased donor accumulation protein metabolic waste products body cause diseases serious complications gout uremia acute renal failure seizure encephalopathy death products protein metabolism including urea uric acid ammonia creatinine compounds human body must eliminate order body function properly build uric acid causing high amount uric acid blood condition called hyperuricemia longstanding hyperuricemia cause deposition monosodium urate crystals around joints resulting arthritic condition called body unable eliminate urea cause serious medical condition called uremia high level urea blood symptoms uremia include nausea vomiting fatigue anorexia weight loss change mental status left untreated uremia lead seizure coma cardiac arrest body unable process eliminate ammonia protein toxicity lead build ammonia bloodstream causing condition called hyperammonemia symptoms elevated blood ammonia include muscle weakness fatigue left untreated ammonia cross blood brain barrier affect brain tissues leading spectrum neuropsychiatric neurological symptoms including impaired memory seizure confusion delirium excessive sleepiness disorientation brain edema intracranial hypertension coma even prevalence protein toxicity accurately quantified numerous etiologies protein toxicity arise many people protein toxicity result chronic kidney disease ckd endstage renal disease esrd prevalence ckd stages us remained relatively consistent prevalence people received treatment esrd increased people per million people per million prevalence treated esrd increases age prevalent males females higher native hawaiians pacific islanders racial however prevalence protein toxicity specifically difficult quantify people diseases cause protein metabolites accumulate typically initiate hemodialysis become urea
