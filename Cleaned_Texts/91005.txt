site saturation mutagenesis ssm simply site saturation random mutagenesis technique used protein engineering single codon set codons substituted possible amino acids many variants site saturation technique paired site saturation saturating two positions every mutant library scanning site saturation performing site saturation every site protein resulting library size x number residues protein contains every possible point mutant protein saturation mutagenesis commonly achieved sitedirected mutagenesis pcr randomised codon primers eg artificial gene synthesis mixture synthesis nucleotides used codons different degenerate codons used encode sets amino amino acids encoded codons others exact ratio amino acids equal additionally usual use degenerate codons minimise stop codons generally desired consequently fully randomised nnn ideal alternative restricted degenerate codons used nnk nns benefit encoding amino acids still encode stop codon time alternative codons ndt dbk avoid stop codons entirely encode minimal set amino acids still encompass main biophysical types anionic cationic aliphatic hydrophobic aromatic hydrophobic hydrophilic case restriction use single degenerate codon possible reduce bias several computational tools developed allow high level control degenerate codons corresponding amino saturation mutagenesis commonly used generate variants directed httpsenwikipediaorgwikisaturationmutagenesis
