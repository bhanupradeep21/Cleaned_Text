developmental psychology scientific study humans grow change adapt across course lives originally concerned infants children field expanded include adolescence adult development aging entire developmental psychologists aim explain thinking feeling behaviors change throughout life field examines across three major dimensions physical development cognitive development social emotional within three dimensions broad range topics including motor skills executive functions moral understanding language acquisition social change personality emotional development selfconcept identity formation developmental psychology examines influences nature nurture process human development well processes change context across time many researchers interested interactions among personal characteristics individuals behavior environmental factors includes social context built environment ongoing debates regards developmental psychology include biological essentialism vs neuroplasticity

originally formulated urie bronfenbrenner specifies four types nested environmental systems bidirectional influences within systems four systems microsystem mesosystem exosystem macrosystem system contains roles norms rules powerfully shape development microsystem direct environment lives home school mesosystem relationships connect microsystem exosystem larger social system child plays role macrosystem refers cultural values customs laws microsystem immediate environment surrounding influencing individual example school home setting mesosystem combination two microsystems influence example sibling relationships home vs peer relationships school exosystem interaction among two settings indirectly linked example fathers job requiring overtime ends influencing daughters performance
