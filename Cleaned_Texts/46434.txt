diaphragmatic rupture also called diaphragmatic injury tear tear diaphragm muscle across bottom ribcage plays crucial role breathing commonly acquired diaphragmatic tears result physical trauma diaphragmatic rupture result blunt penetrating trauma occurs people diagnostic techniques include xray computed tomography surgical techniques explorative surgery diagnosis often difficult signs may show xray signs show appear similar conditions signs symptoms include chest abdominal pain difficulty breathing decreased lung sounds tear discovered surgery needed repair injuries diaphragm usually accompanied injuries indicate severe injury may occurred outcome often depends associated injuries diaphragmatic injury since pressure higher abdominal cavity chest cavity rupture diaphragm almost always associated herniation abdominal organs chest cavity called diaphragmatic hernia herniation interfere breathing symptoms may include orthopnea shortness breath lying coughing people herniation abdominal organs signs intestinal blockage sepsis abdomen may bowel sounds may heard chest shoulder epigastric pain may present injury noticed right away main symptoms indicate bowel diaphragmatic rupture may caused blunt trauma penetrating trauma iatrogenic causes result medical intervention example surgery abdomen also occurred spontaneously time pregnancy discernible injury diaphragm reported present cases blunt chest cases blunt trauma vehicle accidents falls common penetrating trauma reported cause cases also proposed common cause blunt trauma discrepancies could due varying regional social economic factors areas stab gunshot wounds cause diaphragmatic clinicians trained suspect diaphragmatic rupture particularly penetrating trauma occurred lower chest upper penetrating trauma contents abdomen may herniate chest cavity right away may later causing presentation since diaphragm moves breathing penetrating trauma various parts torso may injure diaphragm penetrating injuries high third rib low twelfth found injure iatrogenic cases occurred complication medical procedures involving thorax abdomen occurred complication thoracentesis radiofrequency although mechanism unknown proposed blow abdomen may raise pressure within abdomen high diaphragm blunt trauma creates large pressure gradient abdominal thoracic cavities gradient addition causing rupture also cause abdominal contents herniate thoracic cavity abdominal contents pleural space interfere heart function lung function high intrathoracic pressure results increase right atrial pressure disrupting filling heart venous return venous return determines cardiac output results reduction cardiac ventilation lung side tear severely inhibited hypoxemia low blood oxygen usually rupture side blow side three times likely cause diaphragmatic rupture blow physical examinations accurate usually specific physical sign used diagnose thoracoscopic laparoscopic methods chest xray known unreliable diagnosing diaphragmatic low sensitivity specificity often another injury pulmonary contusion masks injury xray half time initial xrays normal hemothorax pneumothorax nasogastric tube stomach may appear film chest cavity sign pathognomonic diaphragmatic rupture xray better able detect injury taken back person upright usually possible person usually stable enough thus usually taken front person lying positive pressure ventilation helps keep abdominal organs herniating chest cavity also prevent injury discovered ct scan increased accuracy diagnosis specific findings ct scan exist establish free edge ruptured diaphragm may curl become perpendicular chest wall sign known dangling diaphragm herniated organ may constrict location rupture sign known collar sign liver herniates rupture right side may produce two signs known hump band signs hump sign form collar sign right band sign bright line intersects liver believed result due ruptured diaphragm although ct scanning increases chances diaphragmatic rupture diagnosed surgery rate diagnosis surgery still another diagnostic method laparotomy misses diaphragmatic ruptures often diaphragmatic injury discovered laparotomy undertaken another abdominal laparotomies common penetrating trauma compared experienced blunt force injury diaphragmatic rupture found often thoracoscopy reliable detecting diaphragmatic tears laparotomy especially useful chronic diaphragmatic hernia diaphragmatic ruptures occur left possible liver situated right upper quadrant abdomen cushions however injuries occurring left side also easier detect xray half diaphragmatic ruptures occur right side associated liver injuries occurring right associated higher rate death numerous serious accompanying bilateral diaphragmatic rupture occurs ruptures associated much higher death rate mortality injuries occur one since diaphragm constant motion respiration tension lacerations heal injury usually becomes larger time main goals surgery repair injuries diaphragm move herniated abdominal organs back original done debriding nonviable tissue closing time injury repaired early surgery important diaphragmatic atrophy adhesions occur time sutures used injuries hemothorax may present immediate threat may need treated first accompany diaphragmatic videoassisted thoracoscopy may cases isolated diaphragmatic rupture associated good outcome surgically death rate mortality diaphragmatic rupture blunt penetrating trauma estimated respectively injuries play large role determining herniation abdominal organs present people abdominal trauma present trauma diaphragmatic injuries present people significant blunt average abdominal high body mass index may associated higher risk diaphragmatic rupture people involved vehicle occur due trauma vehicle accidents due great force needed rupture rare diaphragm alone injured especially blunt trauma injuries associated many fact diaphragm injured indication severe injuries organs may occurred thus mortality diagnosis diaphragmatic rupture deaths due lung common associated injuries include head injury injuries aorta fractures pelvis long bones lacerations liver associated injuries occur
