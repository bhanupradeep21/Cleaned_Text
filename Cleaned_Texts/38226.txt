endovascular coiling endovascular treatment intracranial aneurysms bleeding throughout body procedure reduces blood circulation aneurysm use microsurgical detachable platinum wires clinician inserting one aneurysm determined blood flow longer occurring within space one two main treatments cerebral aneurysms surgical clipping clipping alternative stenting bleeding endovascular coiling used treat cerebral aneurysms main goal prevention rupture unruptured aneurysms prevention rebleeding ruptured aneurysms limiting blood circulation aneurysm space clinically packing density recommended aneurysms
