males cervix testing women sexually active less years age year well new sexual partners recommendation applies men sex men gonorrhea prevented use condoms sex one person uninfected treatment usually ceftriaxone injection azithromycin resistance developed many previously used antibiotics higher doses ceftriaxone occasionally retesting recommended three months sexual partners last two months also

ophthalmia neonatorum develop infants born women left untreated gonorrhea spread original site infection infect damage joints skin organs indications include fever skin rashes sores joint pain advanced cases gonorrhea may cause general feeling tiredness similar also possible individual allergic reaction bacteria case appearing symptoms greatly rarely may settle heart causing endocarditis spinal column causing meningitis likely among individuals suppressed immune systems gonorrhea caused bacterium neisseria previous infection confer immunity person infected become infected exposure someone infected infected persons may able infect others repeatedly without signs symptoms infection usually spread one person another vaginal oral anal men risk getting infection single act vaginal

gonorrhea diagnosed gram stain culture however newer polymerase chain reaction pcrbased testing methods becoming initial treatment fails culture done determine sensitivity bacteria tests use pcr aka nucleic acid amplification identify genes unique n gonorrhoeae recommended screening diagnosis gonorrhea infection pcrbased tests require sample urine urethral swabs cervicalvaginal swabs culture
