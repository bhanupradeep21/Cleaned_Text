outgroup favoritism social psychological construct intended capture socially disadvantaged groups express favorable attitudes even preferences toward social cultural ethnic groups considered many psychologists part variety systemjustifying motives outgroup favoritism widely researched potential explanation disadvantaged normative social motivated support maintain preserve status specifically outgroup favoritism provides contrast idea ingroup favoritism proposes individuals exhibit preference members group members review existing literature ideas people employ legitimize support ideas structures behaviors psychologists john jost mahzarin banaji observed existing theories egojustification ie utilization stereotypes means protect group justification ie utilization stereotypes protect status given social could adequately explain members given ingroup would express negative stereotypes often times leveraging contexts disadvantaged thus arguably attempt explain phenomena outgroup favoritism led development would later become system justification theory according jost banaji system justification theory constructed around notion people three basic needs need certainty meaning need safety security need shared reality ie epistemic existential relational taking inspiration immense body work already examining people justify experiences one individual group levels jost banaji additionally proposed people meet three needs systemic level contrary longstanding idea strong identification group individual level generate opposite ie individuals motivated preserve positive image group system justification theory founded upon idea people meet epistemic existential relational needs systemic level sometimes beyond individual grouplevels thus conceptualized within system justification theory framework outgroup favoritism best understood expression people motivated defendpreserve status quo given system even normative ideologies practices run counter current research phenomenon tends fall three dominant streams first examines assessments outgroup favoritism group attitude work area commonly involves asking members socially disadvantaged groups extent would support policies structures favor socially advantaged groups scholars examined grouplevel expressions outgroup favoritism along dimensions ranging political ideology economic status example one classic albeit

hoffarth analyses conservative sexual minority members scholars continuing critique negative selfstereotyping interacts outgroup though many agree two share close links ongoing debate whether negative

negative selfstereotyping clear behavioral attitudinal expression underlying outgroup preference motive product internalized inferiority essentially stereotyping behavior cant occur without motive motive cant measured independent behavioral jost explicitly states people special motivation favor outgroup merely outgroup rather outgroup favoritism seen one manifestation tendency internalize thus perpetuate system furthermore given system justification theory motivationbased scholars propose behavioral attitudinal constructs like negative selfstereotyping would appropriate consider independently motives purely motivebased understanding system hand consider negative selfstereotyping separate construct system justification umbrella note negative selfstereotyping mediates similar outcomes outgroup favoritism regardless whether outgroup favoritism considered amorphous nature debate helped research indicating negative selfstereotyping outgroup favoritism engender similar
