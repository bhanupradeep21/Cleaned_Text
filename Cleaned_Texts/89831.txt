metallic comssa rsvp mx waterfall dr kt buster cyl speculation using heavier mod beginning learn tricks lead worse performance due excessive reliance mods momentum rather developing refined finger control addition modified pens massproduced spinning pens also exist pens usually heavier many pen mods ones adjustable weights available pen spinners often use spinning pens greater customization ability modified pens one niche pen modding involves spinners favor aesthetically pleasing designs mods spinning functionality increase customization potential mods often use pen clear barrel base allows spinner put printed design called insert barrel without affecting tactile quality mod spinners use stickers help customize mods may change feel mod due uneven surface creates common mods custom aesthetic options include rsvp mx mod ayatori mod another aspect pen modding grip cuts modder cuts design grip piece increase aesthetic quality despite grip cuts often impractical since intricate cuts
