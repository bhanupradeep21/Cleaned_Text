cruralispennia extinct genus enantiornithean bird known specimen cruralispennia discovered early cretaceous huajiying formation china formally described type species cruralispennia cruralispennia multidonta generic name latin shin feather specific name means manytoothed holotype cruralispennia ivpp semiarticulated partial skeleton surrounded remains carbonized cruralispennia lived alongside several species enantiornitheans protopteryx sichakou basin huajiying formation approximately million years ago despite one earliest known ornithothoraces genus possessed several features derived enantiornitheans well unusual traits convergent ornithuromorphs group containing modern birds cruralispennia also notable crural feathers originally described possessing unique form unknown feathered however also hypothesized holotype specimen recently molted unusual feathers simply new feathers yet lose thick sheath around although skull poorly preserved several elements identifiable premaxilla short tall rear part frontal domed left dentary preserves fourteen teeth characteristically high number compared enantiornitheans although none teeth preserve complete crowns visible trend teeth becoming buccolingually sidetoside flattened towards back spine incomplete several articulated thoracic vertebrae preserve lateral groove characteristic enantiornitheans fused pygostyle ivpp characteristically short broad tapering distally upturned tip entirely unlike long rod spearlike pygostyles known enantiornitheans well confuciusornithids sapeornithids instead pygostyle similar plowshaped pygostyles ornithuromorphs modern birds form pygostyle attaches tail muscles control advanced pennaceous rectrices fanshaped tails however presence ivpp simple hairlike tail feathers throws doubt hypothesis plowshaped pygostyle always correlates advanced fanshaped coracoid ivpp slender similar advanced enantiornitheans thinnest part coracoid third furthest away sternum widest half nearest sternum however edges coracoid almost parallel near sternum unlike coracoids enantiornitheans drastically splay outwards near sternum forming concave outer front sternum pointed rostral spine known enantiornitheans rear edge sternum two pairs thin rodlike structures although structures known basal enantiornitheans ivpp inner pair extend distance outer pair hand vshaped xiphoid region similar basal enantiornitheans protopteryx pengornithids forelimb rather short robust humerus possessing enantiornithean features hand shorter humerus alular digit reduced features characteristic advanced postacetabular process ilium characteristically short tapering extends downward ischiadic peduncle ischium shorter pubis upward pointing process midway shaft similar basal ornithuromorphs pubic foot enantiornitheans tibiotarsus tarsometatarsus long slender fibula short tapering advanced enantiornitheans ornithuromorphs toe claws sharp wellpreserved feathers surround every part skeleton except snout feet body tail feathers short hairlike rachises feathers upper side neck longer lower side asymmetrical pennaceous feathers preserved attached wings although shorter enantiornitheans twice length characteristic features ivpp genus cruralispennia named crural leg feathers feathers present tibiotarsus possibly femur although overlap body feathers makes femurs integument uncertain long wirelike consisting rachislike structure seemingly formed fusion bundle parallel barbs rachislike structure forms length feather distal feathers length individual parallel barbs become distinguishable forming brushlike tip form feather morphology dubbed proximally wirelike part short filamentous distal tip pwfdt also present feathers projecting along front edge left wing pwfdt feathers currently known cruralispennia although similar ribbonlike tail feathers oviraptorosaur similicaudipteryx probable pwfdt feathers result genetic overexpression gene promotes barb fusion rachis formation suppression sonic hedgehog gene promotes formation individual another possibility pwfdt feathers novel type feather unique cruralispennia instead immature pennaceous feathers formed recent molt several lines reasoning supporting hypothesis long thick rachis minimal barbs tip pwfdt feathers resemble moderately developed pin feathers known modern birds well newly described juvenile enantiornitheans addition interspersed mature feathers truly unique feather types expected separated typical feathers many specimens feathers loosely attached separated rest specimen adding evidence hypothesis molting structures believed fossilized melanosomes found five feather samples specimen using scanning electron due rodlike shape identified eumelanosomes correspond dark shades although specific colors stated analysis studies shown coloration extant birds correlates length aspect ratio length width ratio sample taken crural feathers eumelanosomes shortest aspect ratio may corresponded dark brown coloration highest aspect ratio eumelanosomes found sample head feathers high aspect ratios known correlate glossy iridescent colors although without knowing structure feathers keratin layer fossilize well hue assigned wing tail samples also high aspect ratios tails eumelanosomes largest cruralispennia referred enantiornithes taxons description due various features humerus lack procoracoid processes long acromion process scapula phylogenetic analysis recovered cruralispennia moderately advanced enantiornithean derived basal members clade protopteryx pengornithids derived features present within cruralispennia include reduced fibula short hand however presence short plowshaped pygostyle ivpp shows cruralispennia derived features different enantiornitheans cruralispennia seemingly belongs previously undiscovered ancient lineage enantiornitheans convergently evolved many ornithuromorphlike features addition presence derived genus early cretaceous evidence family tree ornithothoraces older currently known fossils histological study ivpp humerus found lines arrested growth present within bone evidence ivpp died within one season however due bone inner outer layer ivpp believed died near adulthood factors support idea individuals cruralispennia grew quickly reaching adult size less year contrast enantiornitheans believed grown slowly taking several years reach adulthood cruralispennias growth strategies similar confusciusornis ornithuromorphs although slightly difficult determine function crural pwfdt feathers unique first place several possibilities put forth possible functions include insulation heat shielding social signalling although pwfdt feathers probably simple provide aerodynamic advantage narrowness means unlikely
