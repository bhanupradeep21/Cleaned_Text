partial volume effect defined loss apparent activity small objects regions limited resolution imaging system occurs medical imaging generally biological imaging positron emission tomography pet singlephoton emission computed tomography spect object region imaged less twice full width half maximum fwhm resolution x zdimension imaging system resultant activity object region higher resolution decreases effect better resolves tissuecitation needed partial volume loss alone occurs surrounding activity object region less object loss activity object generally involves increase activity adjacent regions considered outside object ie spillover small object eg voxel object size comparable spatial resolution imaging system observed activity sum activity due partial volume loss plus spillover adjacent regions method correct partial volume effect referred partial volume correction see article related medical equipment stub help wikipedia expanding
