bispecific monoclonal antibody bsmab bsab artificial protein simultaneously bind two different types antigen two different epitopes naturally occurring antibodies typically target one antigen bsabs manufactured several structural formats bsabs designed recruit activate immune cells interfere receptor signaling inactivate signaling ligands force association protein bsabs explored cancer immunotherapy drug delivery alzeimers original concept bsabs proposed nisonoff collaborators including first idea antibody architecture problem producing pure antibodies solved creation hybridoma technology new era monoclonal antibodies moabs milstein cuello created hybridhybridoma quadroma singlechain variable fragment scfv invented huston team minimize refolding problems contains incorrect domain pairing aggregation twochain bsabs became developed knobsintoholes technology many formats bsabs two main categories igglike main types manufacturing methods quadromas chemical conjugation genetic recombination method results unique format retains traditional monoclonal antibody mab structure two fab arms one fc region except two fab sites bind different antigens common types called trifunctional antibodies three unique binding sites antibody two fab regions fc region heavy light chain pair unique mab fc region made two heavy chains forms third binding site bsabs often manufactured quadroma hybrid hybridoma however quadroma method relies random chance form usable bsab inefficient another method manufacturing igglike bsab called knobs holes relies introducing mutation large amino acid heavy chain one mab mutation small amino acid mabs heavy chain allows target heavy chains corresponding light chains fit together better makes production bsabs bsabs lack fc region entirely thus leads relatively simple design include chemically linked fabs consisting fab regions various types bivalent trivalent singlechain variable fragments scfvs also fusion proteins

platform forms multispecific binding connection vh regions two antibody molecules products designed based platform small molecules small molecules high stability better tissue permeability even though nonigglike bsabs low molecular weight thus high tumor tissue permeability halflife relatively short require multiple binding bsab target antigens lead variety effects widely used application approach cancer immunotherapy bsabs engineered simultaneously bind cytotoxic cell target tumour cell destroyed possible observe bridging effect bsabs cellcancer cell interactions using labelfree live cell imaging catumaxomab one first trifunctional antibodies approved therapeutic use binds cytotoxic cells epcam human fc region additionally binds cell expresses fc receptors like macrophage natural killer cell dendritic cell since fc region still intact allows bsab trigger common immune responses recognized fc receptor antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxicity complementdependent growth tumor

brings two protein antigens together one complex factor ixa factor x coagulation cascade cognate antigens bound two factors brought together coagulation factor viiia healthy individual patients bleeding disorder hemophilia viiia current treatment disorder supplement patients fviii reduce bleeding complications fviii recognized foreign protein patients due absence protein thus immune response generated protein besides fviii short halflife less hours thus cleared rapidly however humanized bsab lower immunogenicity long serum halflife compared fviii thus provide better treatment cancer immunotherapy ordinary monoclonal antibodies activate tlymphocytes fab regions already used binding tumor cells type cell fc bispecific antibodies also higher cytotoxic potential bind antigens expressed relatively effective dose around milligrams per square meter body surface area per day several orders magnitude lower ordinary nonigglike bsabs smaller size allows reach antigens usually unavailable conventional case ebola vaccines method allows antibody target intracellular targets usually accessible traditional monoclonal antibody additionally targeting one molecule useful circumvent regulation parallel pathways avoid resistance treatment binding blocking multiple targets pathway beneficial stopping disease conditions complicated multifaceted effects throughout together
