vertebrae family reflects likelihood perucetus fewer vertebrae basilosaurids conservative length meters ft innominate bone perucetus highly reduced still features welldeveloped acetabulum condition considered ancestral among whales innominate however differs shape basilosaurus proximal end ilium notably robust early pelagiceti centra lumbar vertebrae greatly elongated like basilosaurines pachycetines quite reach proportions extreme members said groups ends ribs large club shaped another feature similar characteristic feature perucetus high degree pachyosteosclerosis present bones body

namely members subfamily pachycetinae whales approach levels bmi seen perucetus bianucci colleagues highlight several lines evidence suggest bone mass increase result pathologies besides presence bmi pachycetines increase uniformly present perucetus bmi would inconsistent caused disease condition due pachyostosis vertebrae greatly inflated making nearly twice voluminous ft long blue whale increase bone mass also observed microanatomy bone ribs entirely composed dense bone lack medullary cavity seen bones animals vascular channels penetrate bone narrow indicating maturity animal also adding already dense nature perucetus may ranged weight long tons short tons average long tons short tons ft skeletal structure alone would accounted long tons short tons already two three times weight skeleton ft long blue whale weight estimates based around relation skeletal total body mass modern mammals notably whales much lighter skeletons compared total mass whereas sirenians dugongs manatees similar land mammals much denser skeletons contribute total weight bianucci colleagues note difficulties determining weight basilosaurids suggest increase skeletal mass could compensated larger amounts blubber less dense soft tissue ultimately extreme values used calculations leading wide range weight estimate present type description basing math sirenians weight long tons short tons calculated combining lowest ratio found cetaceans highest estimated skeletal mass yields weight long tons short tons mean values hand result weight long tons short tons may indicate although long species could heavier modern blue perucetus identified member pelagiceti based high number lumbar vertebrae circular centra highly reduced innominate bone within pelagiceti welldefined acetabulum suggests closer affinities basilosaurids like basilosaurus pachycetus cynthiacetus chrysocetus llanocetids mystacodon bianucci colleagues subsequently added perucetus family immense size bone density make impossible perucetus gone land line classification basilosaurid pachyosteosclerosis taken sign perucetus lived shallow waters using buoyancy control modern manatees given size weight perucetus could resisted crashing waves turbulent waters something inferred similarly buoyant stellers sea cow animals affinity shallow waters congruent interpretation basilosaurids preferred coastal waters rather living open fragmentary nature animal renders precise statements locomotion uncertain suggestions made elongated centra vertebrae instance may suggest like manatees dugongs swam use axial undulation indicates shallow waters rather pelagic habitats animal great size vertebrae impose limits swimming style perucetus shape transverse processes vertebrae using methods previous study would suggest perucetus limited ability flex upward side side possessed increased ability flex downward ventrally could suggest perucetus swam slow movements tail making use side side movements suggested basilosaurus strong ventral flexion particular may great importance animal pushing ocean floor order breathe surface precise function combination pachyosteosclerosis gigantism fully understood may linked energetic cost undulating movements ability dive longer periods diet feeding style remain even mysterious since skull material animal currently known still possibilities inferred based lifestyle deduced postcrania many noted similarities sirenians could taken sign grazing lifestyle notion deemed unlikely cetacean known herbivorous deemed likely perucetus fed molluscs crustaceans animals sea floor either suction feeding filter feeding lifestyle would comparable modern grey whale beluga whale feed mainly bottomdwelling filterfeeding former suction latter another hypothesis
