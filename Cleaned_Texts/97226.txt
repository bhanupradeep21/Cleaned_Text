asilomar conference recombinant dna influential conference organized paul maxine colleagues discuss potential biohazards regulation biotechnology held february conference center asilomar state beach group professionals primarily biologists also including lawyers physicians participated conference draw voluntary guidelines ensure safety recombinant dna technology conference also placed scientific research public domain seen applying version precautionary principle effects guidelines still felt biotechnology industry participation general public scientific due potential safety hazards scientists worldwide halted experiments using recombinant dna technology entailed combining dnas different establishment guidelines conference scientists continued research increased fundamental knowledge biology publics interest biomedical recombinant dna technology arose result advances biology began decades tradition merging structural biochemical informational approaches central problems classical genetics became apparent two main underlying concepts tradition genes consisted dna dna encoded information determined processes replication protein synthesis concepts embodied model dna produced combined efforts james watson francis crick rosalind franklin research watsoncrick model yielded theoretical advances reflected new capacities manipulate one capacities recombinant dna technology technology entails joining dna different species subsequent insertion hybrid dna host cell one first individuals develop recombinant dna technology biochemist stanford name paul experimental design cleaved cut fragments monkey virus cleaved double helix another virus antibacterial agent known bacteriophage lambda third step fastened dna dna bacteriophage lambda final step involved placing mutant genetic material laboratory strain e coli bacterium last step however completed original berg complete final step due pleas several fellow investigators feared biohazards associated last step known cause cancer tumors develop mice additionally e coli bacterium although strain used berg inhabited human intestinal tract reasons investigators feared final step would create cloned dna might escape environment infect laboratory workers workers could become cancer concern potential biohazard along others caused group leading researchers send letter president national academy science nas letter requested appoint ad hoc committee study biosafety ramifications new technology committee called committee recombinant dna molecules national academy science usa held concluded international conference necessary resolve issue time scientists halt experiments involving recombinant dna asilomar conference recombinant dna took place asilomar conference center californias monterey peninsula main goal conference address biohazards presented recombinant dna technology conference principles guiding recommendations conduct experiments using technology safely established first dealing potential risks containment made essential consideration experimental design second principle effectiveness containment match estimated risk closely conference also suggested use biological barriers limit spread recombinant dna biological barriers included fastidious bacterial hosts unable survive natural environments barriers nontransmissible equally fastidious vectors plasmids bacteriophages viruses able grow specified addition biological barriers conference advocated use additional safety factors one factor physical containment exemplified use hoods applicable limited access negative pressure laboratories another factor strict adherence good microbiological practices would limit escape organisms experimental situation additionally education training personnel involved experiments would essential effective containment asilomar conference also gave recommendations matching types containment necessary different types experiments recommendations based different levels risk associated experiment would require different levels containment levels minimal low moderate high risk minimal risk level containment intended experiments biohazards could accurately assessed expected minimal low risk containment appropriate experiments generated novel biotypes available information indicated recombinant dna could either alter appreciably ecological behavior recipient species increase significantly pathogenicity prevent effective treatments resulting infections moderate risk level containment intended experiments probability generating agent significant potential pathogenicity ecological disruption highrisk containment intended experiments potential ecological disruption pathogenicity modified organism could severe thereby pose serious biohazard laboratory personnel public levels containments along previously mentioned safety measures formed basis guidelines used investigators future experiments involved construction propagation recombinant dna molecules using dna prokaryotes bacteriophages plasmids animal viruses prokaryotes bacteriophages plasmids experiments could performed minimal risk containment facilities construction recombinant dna molecules propagation involved prokaryotic agents known exchange genetic information experiments involving creation propagation recombinant dna molecules dnas species ordinarily exchange genetic information generate novel biotypes experiments performed least low risk containment facility experiment increased pathogenicity recipient species result new metabolic pathways

highrisk containment working animal viruses experiments involved linkage viral genomes genome segments prokaryotic vectors propagation prokaryotic cells conducted vectorhost systems demonstrated restricted growth capabilities outside laboratory moderate risk containment facilities safer vectorhost systems became available experiments could performed low risk facilities experiments designed introduce propagate dna nonviral low risk agents animal cells low risk animal dna could used vectors manipulations confined moderate risk containment eukaryotes attempts clone segments dna using recombinant dna technology warmblooded vertebrates genomes performed vectorhost systems demonstrably restricted growth capabilities outside laboratory moderate risk containment facility potentially contained cryptic viral genomes potentially pathogenic humans however unless organism made dangerous product recombinant dnas coldblooded vertebrates lower eukaryotes could constructed propagated safest vectorhost system available low risk containment facilities additionally purified dna source performed known functions judged nontoxic could cloned available vectors low risk containment addition regulating experiments conducted guidelines also forbade performance experiments one experiment cloning recombinant dnas derived highly pathogenic organisms addition neither cloning dna containing toxin genes large scale experiments using recombinant dnas able make products potentially harmful humans animals plants allowed guidelines experiments banned potential biohazards could contained current safety participants asilomar conference also endeavored bring science domain general public possible motivation watergate scandal scandal resulted bungled breakin watergate hotel served democratic national committee headquarters two years burglary taped evidence discovered indicated president nixon discussed coverup week three days following release tape nixon resigned presidential office event focused nations attention problem government secrecy fostering illegal immoral behavior suggested political scientist ira h carmen motivated scientists asilomar conference bring science public eye ensure would accused additionally according dr berg dr singer forthright scientists avoided restrictive legislation due development consensus conduct bringing science public eye also coincided rapid rate recombinant dna technology entered industrial world practical applications technology funding research using started coming private sector less public sector addition many molecular biologists confined academia developed ties private industry equity owners corporate executives led creation biotechnology industry although time public debates occur hazards recombinant debates eventually scientists stated hazards exaggerated research could conducted seen ascot report found federal register march report emphasized hazards recombinant dna general community small point practical consequence general reason along high economic pressures industrial development supportive political environment existed research industry based recombinant dna continued years conference people ascribed large amount significance according paul berg maxine singer conference marked beginning exceptional era science public discussion science policy guidelines devised conference enabled scientists conduct experiments recombinant dna technology dominated biological research research turn increased knowledge fundamental life processes cell cycle additionally conference along public debates recombinant dna increased public interest biomedical research molecular genetics reason genetics vocabulary become part daily press television news turn stimulated
