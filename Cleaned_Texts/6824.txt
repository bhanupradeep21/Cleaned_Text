urticating hairs urticating bristles one primary defense mechanisms used numerous plants almost new world tarantulas various lepidopteran caterpillars urtica latin nettle stinging nettles genus urtica bristles urticate characteristic type plant many plants several families term also refers certain types barbed bristles cover dorsal posterior surface tarantulas caterpillars abdomen many tarantula species eject bristles abdomens directing toward potential attackers bristles embed animals skin eyes causing physical irritation usually great discomfort term hairs technically misnomer technically mammals possess true technical word plant hairs trichomes common form urticating hairs plants typified nettles possess sharppointed hollow bristles seated gland secretes acrid fluid points bristles usually break wound acrid fluid pressed various plants unrelated true nettles urtica species possess similar defensive bristles common names often reflect eg bull nettle many cacti subfamily opuntioideae feature fine loosely attached short spines called glochids plant disturbed many spines fall penetrate skin causing irritation many glochidia barbed complicating removal enhancing persistence skin exposure glochidia occupational hazard fruit pickers outside workers areas opuntioideae thrive spines persist clothing gloves become airborne right conditions several lepidopteran families include species whose larvae bear urticating hairs families prominent respect include adults species also urticating scales species shed urticating hairs defense pupae eggs urticating setae spines cause irritation break lodge skin larger animals humans species setae hollow connecting venomproducing cells like hypodermic needle generally setae externally irritating may dangerous contact made mucous membranes ingested cause severe skin necrosis eczemalike symptoms shedding certain species lonomia family saturniidae inject venom lifethreatening stings often occur defense mainly result brushing spines however many species whose larvae armed bristles evolved utilize defense mechanism perceived threat example many larvae family lasiocampidae bear dense bands short stinging bristles across thoracic segments bristles normally retracted folds skin caterpillar disturbed display bristles usually contrasting colors nature bright andor contrasting colors used many invertebrates amphibians reptiles fungi plants visual warnings predators indicating presence toxicity venom poison defensive adaptation may also seen bluff technique certain harmless species mimic appearance similarlooking toxic species means protection example reptiles coral snakes family elapidae wellknown venomous nonvenomous milk snakes colubridae appear visually similar utilizing mimicry advantage roughly stimulated held lasiocampid larvae likely writhe lash forcing stinging bristles vulnerable surface many species larvae lack localized concentrations bristles armed generally urticating hairs even lash frantically disturbed making difficult handle without suitable equipment toxins broken bristles may spill causing dermatitis surface browntail moths euproctis chrysorrhoea native europe invasive parts world bristles shed broken molts windborne direct contact live dead larvae required trigger spite defenses species birds feed avidly hairy caterpillars grabbing beaks scrubbing ground
