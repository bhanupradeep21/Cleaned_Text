even though intimacy broadly defined terms romantic love sexual desire neuroanatomy intimacy needs explanation order fully understand neurological functions different components within intimate relationships romantic love lust attachment rejection love also known functions neuroanatomy involved applied observations seen people experiencing stages intimacy research analysis systems provide insight biological basis intimacy neurological aspect must considered well areas require special attention mitigate issues intimacy violence beloved partner problems social bonding pair bonding intense social attachment normally initiates partner preference sexual situations monogamy many mammalian species monogamous species generally exhibit exclusive responsibility well coparenting studies using monogamous prairie voles microtus ochrogaster showed forming pair bond stimulated mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway pathway dopamine released ventral tegmental area vta nucleus accumbens prefrontal cortex signals ventral pallidum complete reward processing two important neuropeptides mediated pair bond formation oxytocin arginine vasopressin avp even though males females molecules oxytocin shown predominantly females vasopressin predominantly promoted pair bonding receptor specificity shown essential mating activating dopamine receptors nucleus accumbens male female prairie

special ways involving attention traits worthy functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri studies shown right ventral tegmental area vta stimulated subjects shown picture beloved part reward mechanism vta signals parts brain caudate nucleus release dopamine older studies generally attributed love limbic system consisting temporal lobes hypothalamus amygdala well hippocampus functional components limbic system important components emotional processing motivation specifically current research also suggests components hypothalamus playing role romantic love possesses penchant bonding mammals secreting neuropeptides oxytocin research implicated nerve growth factor ngf neurotrophin fundamental neuron survival development nervous system earlystage romantic love subjects experiencing euphoria emotional dependency often characteristic romantic lust also known libido defined pursuing sexual primarily driven endocrine system brain also involved neural processing specifically hpg hpa axes play primary roles priming sex well stress response intimacy motivated reward system steroid hormones activate desire promote partner preference social attachment process sexual dopamine released individual aroused associates lust product dopaminergic reward system however interactions sex romantic love goal orientation helps confirm difference brain activation patterns contrasting primary goal romantic love copulation occur without two individuals romantic love monogamous bond sometimes copulation might even occur romantic love relationships however still play role successful reproduction supplemented romantic rejection love considered unrequited unreciprocated separation loved one cause grief sometimes lead individual expressing characteristics depression study symptoms

romantic love study ultimately showed areas activated romantic love also activated rejection results study suggest rejected lovers stimulation brain regions still love since romantic love follows dopaminergic reward system anticipatory nature receiving reward well deciding losses gains decision making allows neural circuitry become adaptable allows rejected change behavior two stages first

form monogamous pair bond another individual future may provide insight issues formation pair bonds well psychological problems inefficient love activates neural circuitry maladaptive drugs cocaine dopaminergic reward pathways involved elicit response gaining reward reinforcement thereby leading researchers believe love love drugs abuse stimulate similar levels dopamine reward reinforcement

frontal gyrus left sensorimotor cortex contrast negatively valenced words stimulated greater activation right supramarginal gyrus males greater activation left part hippocampus negative therefore different brain regions males females could allude differential responses emotional processing intimate situations known insecure feeling partner regards losing loved one another jealousy result extreme situations violence abuse insecure partner one study men women shown sentences suggested sexual emotional infidelity rated intensity jealousy males activation brain areas induced sexual infidelity laden statements included visual cortex middle temporal gyrus amygdala hippocampus claustrum females visual cortex middle frontal gyrus thalamus cerebellum found males showed stimulation amygdala regards sexual infidelity females showed greater activation visual cortex regions male brain provided insight neuroanatomy associated sexual aggressive behavior regions could studied
