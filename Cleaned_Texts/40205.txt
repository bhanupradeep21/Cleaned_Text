leuchter report document authored american execution technician fred leuchter commissioned ernst zündel defend trial canada distributing holocaust denial material leuchter compiled report intention investigating feasibility mass homicidal gassings nazi extermination camps specifically auschwitz traveled camp collected multiple pieces brick remains crematoria gas chambers without camps permission brought back united states submitted chemical analysis trial leuchter called upon defend report capacity expert witness however trial court ruled neither qualifications experience act leuchter cited absence prussian blue homicidal gas chambers support view could used gas people however residual ironbased cyanide compounds categorical consequence cyanide exposure discriminating leuchter introduced unreliable factor experiment findings seriously flawed result contrast tests conducted polish forensic scientists discriminated ironbased compounds confirmed presence cyanide locations accordance used holocaust addition report criticized leuchter overlooked critical evidence documents ss architectural office recorded mechanical operation gas chambers others verified rate nazis could burn bodies ernst zündel german pamphleteer publisher living canada put trial publishing richard verralls holocaust denial pamphlet six million really die deemed violate canadian laws distributing false news zündel found guilty conviction overturned appeal led second prosecution zündel lawyers joined robert faurisson french academic literature holocaust denier came toronto advise previously testified expert witness first joined david irving english writer holocaust denier assist defense testify zündels faurisson claimed technically physically impossible gas chambers auschwitz functioned extermination facilities based comparisons american execution gas chambers therefore suggested getting american prison warden participated executions gas irving faurisson therefore invited bill armontrout warden missouri state agreed testify suggested contact fred leuchter bostonian execution equipment designer faurisson reported leuchter initially accepted mainstream account holocaust two days discussion stated leuchter convinced homicidal gassings never occurred met zündel toronto agreeing serve expert witness defense leuchter traveled spend week accompanied draftsman cinematographer supplied zündel translator fluent german polish wife although zündel faurisson accompany leuchter said every step way arriving poland group spent three days former auschwitz concentration camp site another former majdanek concentration camp filmed leuchter illicitly collecting regarded forensic quality samples wreckage former gas extermination wife translator acted drawings samples taken film footage physical collection leuchters notebook detailing work surrendered trial court leuchter claimed conclusions based expert knowledge gas chamber operation visual inspection remained structures auschwitz original drawings blueprints said blueprints given auschwitz museum compiled report published canada leuchter report engineering report alleged execution gas chambers auschwitz birkenau majdanek poland zündels samisdat publications england auschwitz end line leuchter report first forensic examination auschwitz focal point publications david irvings publishing however court accepted report evidentiary display direct evidence leuchter therefore required explain testify veracity leuchter could examined court admitted toxicologist dismissed need degree engineering court function engineer dont engineering degree witness well would question honour engineering degree bachelor arts degree required background training college level field perform function engineer court determines leuchter admitted oath bachelor arts degree implicitly suggested engineering degree unavailable saying college offer engineering degree studies boston university actually offered three different kinds qualification student asked court ba obtained field entitled operate engineer confirmed even though degree similarly leuchter claimed obtained research material camps including original crematoria blueprints auschwitz majdanek camps archives testified documents far important role shaping conclusions physical samples collected yet trial director auschwitz museum denied leuchter received plans blueprints judge ronald thomas began label leuchters methodology ridiculous preposterous dismissing many reports conclusions basis based secondhand information refused allow testify effect zyklon b humans never worked substance neither toxicologist judge thomas dismissed leuchters opinion greater value ordinary tourist regards leuchters opinion said opinion report never gassings never exterminations carried facility far concerned ive heard capable giving opinionhe position say said sweepingly report could carried facilities questioned functioning crematoria judge also prevented leuchter testifying hasnt leuchter also claimed consultation relating sodium cyanide hydrogen cyanide dupont ongoing thing dupont largest american manufacturer hydrogen cyanide stated never provided information cyanides persons representing holocaust deniers including fred leuchter never provided information regarding use cyanide auschwitz birkenau contents report particular leuchters methodology heavily criticized james roth manager lab carried analysis samples leuchter collected swore oath results trial roth learn trial got later stated cyanide would penetrated depth around micrometers tenth thickness human hair samples brick mortar concrete leuchter took indeterminate thickness aware lab ground samples fine powder thus severely diluted cyanidecontaining layer sample indeterminate amount brick varying accurate analysis would obtained analyzing surface samples leuchter collected roth offered analogy investigation like analyzing paint wall analyzing timber behind leuchters opposition possibility homicidal gassings auschwitz relies residual cyanide remains found homicidal gas chambers delousing chambers facilities exposed substance zyklon b many delousing chambers stained iron based compound known prussian blue apparent homicidal gas disparity leuchter cites accordingly samples included measurements claims measured much cyanide delousing chambers gas chambers argues inconsistent amounts necessary kill human beings argument often cited holocaust deniers similar claims also made germar rudolf according richard j green order leuchter rudolf demonstrate significance findings necessary prove necessity prussian blue formation conditions homicidal gas chambers operated showing delousing chambers prussian blue homicidal gas chambers proves nothing shown conditions gas chambers produce prussian words green states leuchter failed show prussian blue would produced homicidal gas chambers first absence proof homicidal gassings took problem prussian blue means categorical sign cyanide one factor necessary formation high concentration terms difference amounts measured delousing chambers homicidal gas chambers critics explain exact opposite deniers claim true insects far higher resistance cyanide humans concentration levels ppm parts per million exposure time sometimes long hours necessary succumb contrast cyanide concentration ppm fatal humans matter difference one reasons behind concentration disparity another exceedingly sensitive factor small deviances could determine whether prussian blue may form ph ph could affected presence human also delousing chambers left intact ruins crematoria birkenau exposed elements forty years time leuchter collected samples would severely affected results unlike prussian blue iron based cyanides cyanide salts highly soluble since formation prussian blue unconditional outcome exposure cyanide reliable indicator leuchter rudolf claim measured much cyanide delousing chambers homicidal gas chambers since discriminate unreliable factor green maintains instant bias introduced similarly rudolf acknowledges prussian blue always form upon exposure cyanide thus reliable marker yet continues include iron compounds analysis green describe since building contains prussian blue staining would exhibit much higher levels detectable cyanides one without green writes leuchters rudolfs measurements reveal nothing already visible naked february professor jan markiewicz director institute forensic research ifrc kraków conducted experiment iron compounds given ruins gas chambers birkenau exposed cumulative meters precipitation based climatological records since introduction markiewicz team optimistic able detect cyanides many years later nevertheless legal permission obtain samples collected areas sheltered elements leuchters report stated small amounts cyanide detected ruins crematoria merely result fumigation however ifrc points control samples took living areas may fumigated part typhus epidemic tested negative cyanide typhus epidemic occurred crematoria birkenau even final remarks accordingly ifrc demonstrated cyanides present facilities claimed exposed ie five crematoria cellars block delousing critics state attempt demonstrate crematoria could functioned homicidal gas chambers basis exposed cyanide unsuccessful given presence remains facilities write gas chambers exposed cyanide levels higher background levels elsewhere camp living areas cyanides addition tests conducted auschwitz revealed presence cyanides ventilation grilles found ruins crematorium ii thus also demonstrating leuchter report first forensic examination camp purported title london historian richard j evans argued due leuchters ignorance large disparity amounts cyanide necessary kill humans lice instead disproving homicidal use gas chambers small amounts cyanide leuchter detected actually tended confirm order heinrich himmler crematoria gas chambers birkenau destroyed ss order hide evidence nothing bases crematoria iv v seen floor plans facilities indicated bricks laid across concrete crematoria ii iii ruins professor robert jan van pelt labels leuchters comment facilities changed since hydrogen cyanide explosive leuchter maintained gas chambers could never operated due proximity ovens correct hydrogen cyanide explosive concentrations ppm times lethal dose ppm critics estimate conservatively within minutes gas chamber victims exposed considerably lower lower explosion limit leuchter gone archives spent time archives wouldve found evidence ventilation systems evidence ways introduce zyklon b buildings evidence gas chambers undressing rooms leuchter incorrectly assumed gas chambers basement gas chambers crematoria ii iii mechanically ventilated via motors roof space main crematorium capable extracting remaining gas renewing air every three four ventilation used crematoria iv v although ventilation system later installed crematorium v may sonderkommando prisoners wore gas masks removing presented court document chief auschwitz architect sssturmbannführer karl bischoff leuchter misconstrued aeration belüftung ventilation entlüftung part furnace blower systems actually reference ventilation channels walls straddle gas visible blueprints still partly seen ruined east wall crematorium iii gas leuchter also prepared act expert witness regarding
