allowing animals adjust innate behaviors changes natural world natural animal instinct example protect territory danger potential predators animal needs respond quickly sudden appearance predator may less obvious importance defensive responses sudden appearance new unfamiliar stimulus whether dangerous initial defensive response new stimulus important animal fails respond potentially dangerous unknown stimulus results could deadly despite initial innate defensive response unfamiliar stimulus response becomes habituated stimulus repeatedly occurs causes harm example prairie dog habituating humans prairie dogs give alarm calls detect potentially dangerous stimulus defensive call occurs mammal snake large bird approaches however habituate noises human footsteps occur repeatedly result harm prairie dogs never habituate nonthreatening stimuli would constantly sending alarm calls wasting time however habituation process prairie dogs may depend several factors including particular defensive response one study measured several different responses repeated presence humans alarm calls prairie dogs showed habituation whereas behavior escaping burrows showed another example importance habituation animal world provided study harbor seals one study researchers measured responses harbor seals underwater calls different types killer seals showed strong response heard calls mammaleating killer whales however respond strongly hearing familiar calls local fisheating population seals therefore capable habituating calls harmless predators case harmless killer whales researchers prefer simply describe adaptive value observable habituated behavior others find useful infer psychological processes observed behavior change example habituation aggressive responses male bullfrogs explained attentional learning process allows animals form enduring mental representations physical properties repeated stimulus shift focus attention away sources irrelevant unimportant habituation innate defensive behaviors also adaptive humans habituation startle response sudden loud noise habituation much ubiquitous even humans example habituation essential element everyones life changing response food repeatedly experienced meal people eat food meal begin respond less food become habituated motivating properties food decrease consumption eating less meal usually interpreted reaching satiety getting full experiments suggest habituation also plays important role many experiments animals humans shown providing variety meal increases amount consumed meal likely habituation stimulusspecific variety may introduce dishabituation food variety also slows rate habituation children may important contributing factor recent increases wewho also find habituation found emotional responses called opponentprocess theory proposed researchers richard solomon john corbit known responses subject tend change repetitively presenting certain stimuli concerning opponentprocess theory emotional reactions stimuli weaken decrease others reactions strengthened increase take example end semester university worried grade entire semester need grade final pass course study efficiently test taking feel receive high grade check gradebook see get exam instead received c distraught know way pass course semester minutes begin calm next hour back normal emotional state example emotional response explained opponentprocess theory begins outside stimulus provoking emotional reaction increases rapidly intense presumably learned receive high letter grade gradually emotional state declines level lower normal eventually returns neutral pattern coincides two internal processes referred aprocess bprocess aprocess affective response stimulus initial emotional response one pleasant unpleasant bprocess reaction lower intensity aprocess aprocess fastacting ends soon stimulus ends removed unlike aprocess bprocess much slower returning baseline concerning definition opponent process presentations present aprocess necessarily change bprocess strengthened instead rises quickly reach highest intensity much slower attempting return baseline stimulus removed sum opponentprocess theory
