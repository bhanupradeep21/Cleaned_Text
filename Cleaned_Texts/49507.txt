orthologs distantly related species opossum suggesting form evolution occurring throughout sequence relatively recent amino acids long proline rich meaning greater proportion proline residues exist throughout protein including domain comparison human proteins proline rich proteins often observed intrinsically unstructured connected proteinprotein interactions signaling however isnt certain whether traits hold true amino acids isoleucine tyrosine asparagine present decreased proportion compared typical human protein two highly positive sequences exist towards n terminus highly negative sequence exists within domains towards c terminus whole however appears slightly basic overall positively charged protein corresponding isoelectric point polar soluble predicted contain phosphorylation sites humans including serine threonine tyrosine additionally predicted nacetylglucosamine attachment sites highly conserved predicted sumoylation secondary structure explicitly

well known example obesity observed patients traced deletion insulin receptor gene symptoms learning disabilities speech impediments tied similar gene however possible absence causes minor disability masked symptoms additionally possible plays secondary role one deleted genes second option slightly supported noting proline rich proteins known function human chromosome chromosomes tend frequently produce proteins involved proteinprotein interactions many general types
