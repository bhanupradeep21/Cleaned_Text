phalloplasty construction reconstruction penis artificial modification penis surgery term also occasionally used refer penis russian surgeon nikolaj bogoraz performed first reconstruction total penis using rib cartilage reconstructed phallus made tubed abdominal flap first female male sex reassignment surgery performed sir harold gillies fellow physician michael dillon documented pagan kennedys book first manmade mancitation needed gillies technique remained standard one decades later improvements microsurgery made techniques available complete construction reconstruction penis performed patients whocitation needed different techniques phalloplasty construction new penis sometimes called neophallus typically involves taking tissue flap donor site forearm extending urethra length neophallus another goal temporary lengthening also gained procedure releases suspensory ligament attached pubic bone thereby allowing penis advanced toward outside body procedure performed discreet horizontal incision located pubic region pubic hair help conceal incision site however scar formation cause penis retract therefore american urological association considers division suspensory ligament penis increasing penile length adults procedure shown safe phalloplasty requires implanted penile prosthesis achieve erection penile prostheses implanted devices intended restore erectile rigidity cisgender men build neophallus new penis transgender men penile implants used phalloplasty surgeries cisgender transgender patients since two main types penile implants malleable also known noninflatable semirigid inflatable implants types pair cylinders implanted penis replacing nonerectile tissue cisgender men serving core neophallus phalloplasty procedure cylinder inflatable implant filled sterile saline solution pumping saline chambers cylinder produces erection glans penis however remains unaffected sex reassignment surgeries new penis formed use penile implant surrounded tissue pump unit inflatable penile implants resembles human testicle serve artificial testicle concomitant initially standard penile implants used phalloplasty procedures however since corpus cavernosum penis undergoing phalloplasty fact standard penile implants designed implanted corpus cavernosum many adverse since zephyr surgical implants proposes malleable inflatable penile implants particularly designed phalloplasty implantation procedures usually done separate surgery allow time proper healing sensation retained clitoral tissue base nerves flap tissue attached may eventually disadvantages include phalloplasty method latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous phalloplasty procedure involves insertion subcutaneous soft silicone implant penile notouch surgical technique penile prosthesis implantation surgical procedure developed j francois eid implantation penile implantation use notouch technique minimizes risk infection advancements design manufacturing process ipp improved mechanical survival infection emerged leading cause implant failure although relatively infrequent varying infection penile prosthesis results serious medical consequences bearer requiring
