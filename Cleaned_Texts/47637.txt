praeanthropus including bahrelghazali alongside sahelanthropus fossil ape known chad anamensis afarensis validity bahrelghazali widely accepted given remains similar teeth quite similar jawbone afarensis large incisorlike canines bicuspid premolars opposed molarlike premolars unlike afarensis alveolar part jawbone tooth sockets almost vertical opposed oblique possesses poorly developed

third premolar afarensis specimen middle awash ethiopia described feature shows premolar anatomy highly variable mandibular symphysis midline jaw especially well dimensions symphysis afarensis though relatively thick compared carbon isotope analysis indicates diet predominantly savanna foods grasses sedges underground storage organs usos rhizomes smaller portion may comprised typical ape food
