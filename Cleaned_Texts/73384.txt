tisamenus serratorius also transferred two species described john obadiah westwood genus namely phasma pachymorpha deplanatum todays name tisamenus deplanatus phasma pachymorpha draconinum current name tisamenus james abram garfield rehn son john william holman rehn mention special position two hoploclonia species hoploclonia gecko hoploclonia cuspidata already known borneo synonymized tisamenus hoploclonia transferred previously known tisamenus species genus hoploclonia described eight species created identification key philippine species divided four subgroups according morphological aspects also described genus ilocano ilocano hebardi transferred species listed heterocopus ranarius current name tisamenus ranarius two genera separated filipino species transferred back genus tisamenus occurring borneo left genus study based genetic analysis shows ilocano hebardi remaining species genus time belongs tisamenus whereby ilocano became synonym division subgroups made could confirmed four investigated species known name tisamenus latinisation greek tisamenos τισαμενός ancient male given valid species representatives genus consistently small mediumsized centimetres male centimetres female sex sexes wingless often similar species differ mainly speciesspecific spines also species barely recognizable spines triangular structure mesonotum characteristic representatives short side isosceles triangle runs parallel leading margin mesonotum two sides longer meet less third mesonotum length depending species mostly clear keel runs middle species begins front margin mesonotum therefore also recognized triangle sometimes extends abdomen even end spines often found lateral margins thorax pairs pronotum middle meso metanotum many representatives also additional paired andor centrally arranged spines abdomen color mostly dominated light brown tones often black light brown beige patterns found less often even almost white patterns males usually less patterned looking often notice abdomen apparently much narrow especially true species whose thorax becomes wider wider towards metanotum proportions females appear symmetrical abdomen always wider males typical representatives obriminae secondary ovipositor end abdomen laying eggs ground rather short tisamenus females surrounds actual ovipositor ventral formed eighth sternite called subgenital operculum dorsally eleventh tergum referred supraanal plate nocturnal animals hide near ground day even night hardly climb higher centimetres food plants eggs laid ground females ovipositor
