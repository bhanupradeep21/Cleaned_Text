cardioversion medical procedure abnormally fast heart rate tachycardia cardiac arrhythmia converted normal rhythm using electricity drugs synchronized electrical cardioversion uses therapeutic dose electric current heart specific moment cardiac cycle restoring activity electrical conduction system heart defibrillation uses therapeutic dose electric current heart random moment cardiac cycle effective resuscitation measure cardiac arrest associated ventricular fibrillation pulseless ventricular pharmacologic cardioversion also called chemical cardioversion uses antiarrhythmia medication instead electrical perform synchronized electrical cardioversion two electrode pads used alternatively traditional handheld paddles comprising metallic plate faced saline based conductive gel pads placed chest patient one placed chest one back connected cables machine combined functions ecg display screen electrical function defibrillator synchronizing function either manually operated automatic allows cardioverter deliver reversion shock way pads selected amount electric current predefined number milliseconds optimal moment cardiac cycle corresponds r wave qrs complex ecg timing shock r wave prevents delivery shock vulnerable period relative refractory period cardiac cycle could induce ventricular fibrillation patient conscious various drugs often used help sedate patient make procedure tolerable however patient hemodynamically unstable unconscious shock given immediately upon confirmation arrhythmia synchronized electrical cardioversion performed elective procedure shocks performed conjunction drug therapy sinus rhythm attained procedure patient monitored ensure stability sinus rhythm synchronized electrical cardioversion used treat hemodynamically unstable supraventricular narrow complex tachycardias including atrial fibrillation atrial flutter also used emergent treatment wide complex tachycardias including ventricular tachycardia pulse present pulseless ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation treated unsynchronized shocks referred defibrillation electrical therapy inappropriate sinus tachycardia always part differential diagnosis various antiarrhythmic agents used return heart normal sinus pharmacological cardioversion especially good option patients atrial fibrillation recent onset drugs effective maintaining normal rhythm electric cardioversion also used pharmacological cardioversion drugs like amiodarone diltiazem verapamil metoprolol frequently given electrical cardioversion decrease heart rate stabilize patient increase chance cardioversion successful various classes agents effective pharmacological cardioversion class agents sodium na channel blockers slow conduction blocking na channel divided subclasses b c class ia slows phase depolarization ventricles increases absolute refractory period procainamide quinidine disopyramide class ia agents class drugs lengthen phase repolarization include lidocaine mexiletine phenytoin class ic greatly slow phase depolarization ventricles however unlike effect refractory period flecainide moricizine propafenone class ic agents class ii agents beta blockers inhibit sa av node depolarization slow heart rate also decrease cardiac oxygen demand prevent cardiac remodeling beta blockers cardio selective affecting beta receptors others nonselective affecting beta receptors beta blockers target receptor called cardio selective responsible increasing heart rate hence beta blocker slow heart rate class iii agents prolong repolarization blocking outward k current amiodarone sotalol effective class iii agents ibutilide another class iii agent different mechanism action acts promote influx sodium slowsodium channels shown effective acute cardioversion recentonset atrial fibrillation atrial flutter class iv drugs calcium ca channel blockers work inhibiting action potential sa av nodes patient stable adenosine may used restoration sinus rhythm patients macroreentrant supraventricular tachycardias causes shortlived cessation conduction atrioventricular node breaking circus movement node macroreentrant pathway restoring sinus rhythm cardioversion restoration sinus rhythm atrial rhythm largely scheduled procedure addition cardiology anesthesiology also usually involved ensure comfort patient duration shock therapy presence registered nurses physician associates medical personnel may also helpful procedure starting procedure patients chest back prepped electrode placement skin free oily substances eg lotions hair may otherwise interfere adhesion complete medical team adhere pads patient using rolling motion ensure absence air pockets see details pad placement anesthesiology team administer general anesthetic eg propofol order ensure patient comfort amnesia procedure opioid analgesics eg fentanyl may combined propofol although anesthesiology must weight benefits adverse effects including bite blocks extremity restraints utilized prevent selfinjury cardioversion medications administered glabellar reflex eyelash reflex may used determine patients level consciousness pads connected machine interpret patients cardiac rate rhythm deliver shock appropriate time machine synchronize sync r wave rhythm strip although uncommon sometimes machine unintentionally sync high amplitude waves important ensure machine synced appropriately r interpretation patients rhythm imperative using cardioversion restore sinus rhythm less emergent arrhythmias pulse present eg atrial flutter atrial fibrillation however patient confirmed pulseless ventricular tachycardia vtach ventricular fibrillation vfib shock delivered immediately upon connection pads application electrical cardioversion properly termed machine synced patients cardiac rhythm machine must charged determine amount energy measured joules j patient requires many factors considered general rule thumb recentonset atrial arrhythmias require less energy compared persistent atrial arrhythmias cardiologist suspects patient may less respondent cardioversion higher energy may utilized machine synced charged shock delivered following electrical cardioversion cardiologist determine sinus rhythm restored confirm sinus rhythm distinct p wave seen preceding qrs complex additionally rr interval evenly spaced sinus rhythm restored pads may disconnected medical equipment removed patients eg bite blocks restraints etc patient regain consciousness soon thereafter effects propofol generally last minutes however arrhythmia persistent machine may recharged higher energy level cardioversion attempt may repeated recommended wait seconds subsequent cardioversion attempts amount time may adjusted based patient andor provider pad placement

placed along left midaxillary line choosing right pad placement important aspect measuring success electrical cardioversion example anteriorposterior pad positioning commonly used attempting restore atrial arrhythmia vector pads predominately runs atria anteriorlateral pad positioning may used attempting restore pulseless ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation may enough time strength
