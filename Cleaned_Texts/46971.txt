stabilizing wrist straight position splinting softtissue distraction may used preceding centralization classic centralization central portions carpus removed create notch placement different approach place metacarpal middle finger line ulna fixation radial tissues still short softtissue stretching soft tissue release different approaches manipulation forearm bones may used enable placement hand onto ulna possible approaches shortening ulna resection segment removing carpal ulna significantly bent osteotomy may needed straighten placing wrist correct position radial wrist extensors transferred extensor carpi ulnaris tendon help stabilize wrist straight thumb carpometacarpal joint absent centralization followed pollicization postoperatively long arm plaster splinter worn least

centralization procedure may cause injury ulnar physis leading early epiphyseal arrest ulna thereby resulting even shorter sestero et al reported ulnar growth centralization reaches normal ulnar
