minimum information publication quantitative realtime pcr experiments miqe guidelines set protocols conducting reporting quantitative realtime pcr experiments data devised bustin et al devised paper published claimed detect measles virus children autism use rtqpcr results proved completely unreproducible authors also try reproduce raw data found large amount errors basic mistakes analysis incident prompted stephen bustin create miqe guidelines provide baseline level quality qpcr data published scientific miqe guidelines created due low quality qpcr data submitted academic journals time becoming common next generation sequencing machinery allowed experiments run cheaper cost technique utilized across science multiple fields instruments methods designs qpcr used differs greatly help improve overall quality miqe guidelines made generalized suggestions basic experimental procedures forms data collected minimum level reported information researchers understand use reading published material setting recognized largely agreed upon set guidelines deemed important scientific community especially due ever increasing amount scientific work coming developing countries many different languages international group scientists headed stephen bustin collaborated put together set guidelines perform qpcr forms data collected published process also allowed editors reviewers scientific journals employ guidelines looking submitted paper included qpcr data thus guidelines set sort checklist step procedure certain items marked essential e submitting data publication others marked desirable additional version guidelines published september use fluorescencebased quantitative realtime pcr also acted pr√©cis broader form researchers creating versions specific forms qpcr may require supplementary different set items check including singlecell digital pcr appropriate adherence existing miqe guidelines also overviewed scientific areas including clinical noted bustin amount uptake usage miqe guidelines within scientific community still far many published papers qpcr experiments lacked even basic data presentation proper confirmation effectiveness said data studies retained major reproducibility issues conclusions evidence could replicated researchers throwing initial results doubt despite many papers directly citing bustins original miqe publication following guideline checklist material however researchers pointed least success number papers rejected academic journals publication due failing pass miqe checklists studies retracted fact lack proper data pass miqe guidelines noted publicly pointed journal setting new comparative qpcr systems titled dots boxes new england biolabs stated designed data collection portion around miqe guidelines data fit minimum parameter checklists scientific instrument companies assisted guideline compliance purposefully tailoring devices including biorad creating mobile app allows active marking miqe checklist step overview anniversary since publication miqe guidelines conducted june discussed scientific studies produced better organized results following august updated version guidelines digital pcr method published account improvement machinery technologies techniques since original release additional guideline steps added data analysis also providing simplified checklist table researchers rtqpcr targeting assay developed alongside stephen bustin using miqe guidelines clinical biomarkers december order identify clinical presence viral particles miqe guidelines split different sections make checklist include considerations qpcr also resulting data collected analyzed presented important part latter including information relating analysis software used also submitting raw data relevant large portions guidelines include basic actions would normally included experiments publications regardless item describing experimental control group differences information includes many individual units used group experiment two pieces defined essential study section also includes two desirable points pointing whether authors laboratory core laboratory university organization conducted qpcr assay acknowledgement individuals contributed essential requirements samples sample material must meet includes description sample form dissection used processing method done whether samples frozen
