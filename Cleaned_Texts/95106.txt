intussusception medical condition part intestine folds section immediately ahead typically involves small bowel less commonly large symptoms include abdominal pain may come go vomiting abdominal bloating bloody often results small bowel complications may include peritonitis bowel cause children typically unknown adults lead point sometimes risk factors children include certain infections diseases like cystic fibrosis intestinal risk factors adults include endometriosis bowel adhesions intestinal diagnosis often supported medical children ultrasound preferred adults ct scan intussusception emergency requiring rapid treatment children typically enema surgery used dexamethasone may decrease risk another adults surgical removal part bowel often intussusception occurs commonly children children males often affected usual age occurrence six eighteen months early symptoms include periodic abdominal pain nausea vomiting sometimes green color bile pulling legs chest area intermittent moderate severe cramping abdominal pain pain intussusception temporarily resolves intussuscepted bowel segment transiently stops contracting later signs include rectal bleeding often red currant jelly stool stool mixed blood mucus lethargy physical examination may reveal sausageshaped mass felt upon palpating children unable communicate symptoms verbally may cry draw knees chest experience dyspnea difficult painful breathing paroxysms pain neonates may present bilious vomiting blood stained fever symptom intussusception however intussusception cause loop bowel become necrotic secondary ischemia due compression arterial blood supply leads perforation sepsis causes fever rare cases intussusception may complication purpura immunemediated vasculitis disease children patients develop intussusception often present severe abdominal pain addition classic signs symptoms hsp causes intussusception clearly established understood cases intussusception children arise unknown include infections anatomical factors altered motilitycitation needed earlier version rotavirus vaccine linked intussusception current versions frequent type intussusception ileum enters cecum however types occur part ileum jejunum prolapses part prolapses called intussusceptum part receives called intussuscipiens almost intussusceptions occur intussusceptum located proximally intussuscipiens peristaltic action intestine pulls proximal segment distal segment however rare reports opposite true anatomic lead point piece intestinal tissue protrudes bowel lumen present approximately lead point best exemplified polyp serves focal area traction peristaltic action pulls distal bowel thus invaginating attached bowel trapped section bowel may blood supply cut causes ischemia lack oxygen tissues mucosa gut lining sensitive ischemia responds sloughing gut creates classically described red currant jelly stool mixture sloughed mucosa blood study reported actuality minority children intussusception stools could described red currant jelly hence intussusception considered differential diagnosis children passing type bloody intussusception often suspected based history physical exam including observation dances sign digital rectal examination particularly helpful children part intussusceptum may felt finger definite diagnosis often requires confirmation diagnostic imaging modalities ultrasound imaging modality choice diagnosis exclusion intussusception due high accuracy lack radiation appearance target sign also called doughnut sign sonograph usually around cm diameter confirms diagnosis image seen transverse sonography computed tomography doughnut shape created hyperechoic central core bowel mesentery surrounded hypoechoic outer edematous longitudinal imaging intussusception resembles also called pseudokidney sign hyperechoic tubular centre covered hypoechoic rim producing kidneylike children insussusception ileocecal junction accounts percent intussusception two main differential diagnoses acute gastroenteritis rectal prolapse abdominal pain vomiting stool mucus blood present acute gastroenteritis diarrhea leading symptom rectal prolapse differentiated projecting mucosa felt continuity perianal skin whereas intussusception finger may pass indefinitely depth sulcus condition usually immediately lifethreatening intussusception treated either barium watersoluble contrast enema aircontrast enema confirms diagnosis intussusception cases successfully reduces success rate however approximately recur within hourscitation needed cases reduced enema intestine damaged require surgical reduction surgical reduction surgeon opens abdomen manually squeezes rather pulls part telescoped surgeon successfully reduce bowel damaged resect affected section often intussusception reduced laparoscopy pulling segments intestine apart forcepscitation needed intussusception may become medical emergency treated early eventually causes death reduced developing countries medical hospitals easily accessible especially problems complicate intussusception death becomes almost inevitable intussusception severe medical problem suspected person must taken hospital immediatelycitation needed outlook intussusception excellent treated quickly untreated lead death within two five days requires fast treatment longer intestine segment prolapsed longer goes without bloodflow less effective nonsurgical reduction prolonged intussusception also increases likelihood bowel ischemia necrosis requiring surgical resectioncitation needed condition common children strikes infants one every united states first year life incidence begins rise one five months life peaks four nine months age gradually declines around monthscitation needed intussusception occurs frequently boys girls ratio approximately adults intussusception represents cause approximately bowel obstructions frequently associated neoplasm malignant
