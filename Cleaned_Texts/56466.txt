conduction aphasia also called associative aphasia uncommon form difficulty speaking aphasia caused damage parietal lobe brain acquired language disorder characterised intact auditory comprehension coherent yet paraphasic speech production poor speech repetition affected people fully capable understanding hearing fail encode phonological information production deficit loadsensitive person shows significant difficulty repeating phrases particularly phrases increase length complexity stumble words attempting people frequent errors spontaneous speech substituting transposing sounds also aware errors show significant difficulty correcting example clinician want say words say boy aphasic boy clinician home aphasic home clinician seventynine aphasic ninetyseven sevintysine siventynice clinician lets try another one say refrigerator aphasic frigilator frerigilator frigaliterlater aahh mixed tim shallice elizabeth warrington able differentiate two variants constellation reproduction repetition type authors suggested exclusive deficit auditoryverbal shortterm memory repetition conduction aphasia whereas variant assumed reflect disrupted phonological encoding mechanism affecting confrontation tasks repetition reading naming similar lefthemisphere damage involving auditory regions often result speech deficits lesions area damage sensorimotor dorsal stream suggest sensory system aid motor speech studies suggested conduction aphasia result damage specifically left superior temporal gyrus andor left supra marginal classical explanation conduction aphasia disconnection brain areas responsible speech comprehension wernickes area speech production brocas area due specific damage arcuate fasciculus deep white matter tract aphasic people still able comprehend speech lesion disrupt ventral stream pathway conduction aphasics show relatively wellpreserved auditory comprehension may even completely functional cases individualized unique extent speech production fluent grammatically syntactically correct intonation articulation also maintained speech often contains paraphasic errors phonemes syllables dropped transposed eg snowball snowall television vellitision ninetyfive percent ninetytwenty percent hallmark deficit disorder however repetition aphasic people show inability repeat words sentences asked saying sentence person conduction aphasia able paraphrase sentence accurately able repeat possibly motor speech error processing disrupted inaccurate forward predictions detected errors translated corrective commands due damage auditorymotor prompted repeat words person unable produce many paraphasic errors example prompted bagger person may respond recent summaries syndrome show similarities defective speech writing relatively good comprehension sudden speech conduction aphasic fluent yet lengthy inadequately structured aphasic people difficulty finding words appropriate context accurately pronouncing word aphasic errors naming reading aloud repeating recognized individuals conduction aphasia able express fairly well word finding functional comprehension although people aphasia may able express fairly well tend issues repeating phrases especially phrases long assessment aphasia clinician usually examine persons verbal fluency comprehension repetition reading writing naming asked repeat something person unable without significant difficulty repeatedly attempting selfcorrect conduite dapproche however aphasics recognize errors repetitively try correct typically aphasic make multiple attempts correcting errors correct recognition due preserved auditory error detection errors frequently fit pattern incorrect approximations common errors typically occur morphemes share one similarly located phonemes b differ least one aspect makes substituted morphemes semantically distinct repetitive effort approximate appropriate word phrase known conduite repetitive self correction commonly used aphasic people conduction aphasia due relatively preserved auditory comprehension conduction aphasics capable accurately monitoring attempting correct errors speech example prompted repeat rosenkranz germanspeaking aphasic may respond rosenbrau rosenbrauch rosengrau bro grosenbrau grossenlau rosenkranz kranz conduction aphasia mild language disability people return normal brocas wernickes aphasia commonly caused middle cerebral artery symptoms conduction aphasia aphasias transient sometimes lasting several hours days aphasias language disorders frequently due stroke symptoms change evolve time simply disappear cause stroke people make good recovery may persistent healing brain inflammation hemorrhage leads decreased local impairment furthermore plasticity brain may allow recruitment new pathways restore lost function example right hemisphere speech systems may learn correct lefthemisphere damage however chronic conduction aphasia possible without transformation people show prolonged profound deficits repetition frequent phonemic paraphasias repetitive selfcorrection spontaneous speech conduction aphasia caused damage parietal lobe brain especially regards area associated lefthemisphere dominant dorsal stream arcuate fasciculus connects brocas area wernickes area important speech language production comprehension respectively two areas control speech language brain arcuate fasciculus thick band fiber connects two areas carries messages area damaged person experiences damage auditorymotor integration system results disruption delayed auditory feedback network causing individual difficulty correcting speech repetition additionally recent evidence suggests conduction aphasia also caused lesions left superior temporal gyrus andor left supramarginal conduction aphasia also seen cases cortical damage without subcortical recent research pointed multiple different explanations conduction aphasia based newer models suggesting language facilitated cortically based anatomically distributed modular networks several standardized test batteries exist diagnosing classifying aphasias tests capable identifying conduction aphasia relative boston diagnostic aphasia examination bdae western aphasia battery wab two commonly used test batteries diagnosing conduction aphasia examinations involve set tests include asking person name pictures read printed words count aloud repeat words nonwords shwazel neuroimaging also used look stroke tumor infection another pathology setting conduction aphasia done ct mri brain first imaging modality speech language therapy typically used treatment medical surgical treatments treatment aphasia generally individualized focusing specific language communication improvements regular exercise communication tasks regular therapy conduction aphasics shown result steady improvement western aphasia battery western aphasia battery assesses neurological disorders discern degree type aphasia present test also discerns persons strengths weaknesses used treat person better therapists customize treatment patient main focus speech therapy conduction aphasia person strengthen correct word usage auditory comprehension major goal focus late century paul broca studied person expressive aphasia person lesions anterior perisylvian region known brocas area produced halting labored speech lacking function words grammar example clinician brought hospital patient yes ah monday ah dad peter hogan dad ah hospital ah wednesday wednesday nine oclock ah thursday ten oclock doctors two two doctors ah teeth yah doctor girl gums comprehension generally preserved although deficits interpretation complex sentences extreme example one person could produce single syllable tan meanwhile carl wernicke described person receptive aphasia damage left posterior superior temporal lobe named area word images person could speak fluently speech lacked meaning severe deficit auditory comprehension example clinician brings hospital two disorders expressive receptive aphasias thus seemed complementary corresponded two distinct anatomical locations wernicke predicted existence conduction aphasia landmark monograph der aphasische symptomenkompleks eine psychologische studie auf anatomischer first distinguish various aphasias anatomical framework proposed disconnection two speech systems motor sensory would lead unique condition distinct expressive receptive aphasias termed leitungsaphasie explicitly predict repetition deficit note unlike wernickes aphasia conduction aphasics would able comprehend speech properly intriguingly would able hear understand speech errors leading frustration wernicke influenced theodor meynert mentor postulated aphasias due perisylvian lesions meynert also distinguished posterior anterior language systems leading wernicke localize two wernickes research fiber pathways connecting posterior anterior regions lead theorize damage fibers insula would lead conduction aphasia ludwig lichtheim expanded wernickes work although labeled disorder commissural aphasia distinguish aphasias tied processing sigmund freud would argue old framework inaccurate entire perisylvian area posterior anterior regions equivalent facilitating speech function kurt goldstein postulated spoken language central phenomenon opposed differentiated disparate set functionally distinct modules freud goldstein conduction aphasia thus result central core language breakdown goldstein labeled disorder central later work examination brain structures however implicated arcuate fasciculus white matter bundle connecting posterior temporoparietal junction frontal cortex norman geschwind proposed damage bundle caused conduction aphasia characteristic deficits auditory repetition due failed transmission information two language studies showed conduction aphasics intact inner voice discredited central deficit model freud wernickelichtheimgeschwind disconnection hypothesis thus became prevailing explanation conduction aphasia however recent reviews research cast doubt singular role arcuate fasciculus model spoken language httpsenwikipediaorgwikiconductionaphasia
