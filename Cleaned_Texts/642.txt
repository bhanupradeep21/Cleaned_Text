health organization half cases hearing loss prevented primary prevention simple strategies prevention include hearing loss due otitis media prevented healthy ear hearing care practices suitably dealt early detection followed appropriate medical surgical due lack readably available hearing screenings developing countries hearing loss often left undetected ages reasons lack hearing screenings part due limited personnel financial resources according mcpherson olusanya hearing screenings considered high priority component hearing healthcare program large due fact early detection hearing loss infants allow prompt assessment detection intervention congenital early onset hearing loss furthermore research shown importance early intervention critical period speech language development yoshinagaitano et al lastly hearing screenings may able detect transient hearing losses may dissipate appropriate medical intervention currently actions taken developing countries prevent hearing loss actions include promotion immunization known causes hearing loss eg measles mumps rubella improved care mothers child delivery education use misuse ototoxic drugs mcpherson olusanya unfortunately

olusanya write evidence ongoing infant hearing screening programs shown tests acceptable parents invasive painless quick administer currently employed developed countries growing number developing countries lastly recommended twostage screening protocol performed newborns prior hospital discharge order decrease number infants lost followup care screening newborns hospital prior discharge eliminates need ask parents return specifically child hearing test allows healthcare professionals satisfy ethical obligation ensure infants assessed hidden abnormality prior discharge parents may less likely return hospital invisible nonlifethreatening disorder apparently normal newborn babies order implement twostage screening protocol ie teoaes aabr recommended screening entrusted dedicated

lastly twostage screener begin teoaes followed aabr referred first stage ie teoaes screening occur close discharge possible order minimize referral rates vernix plugs challenges faced hospitalbased screenings may include excessive ambient noise causing higher referral rates long queue babies may results parents growing impatient thus leaving prior baby screened may fail reach significant number newborns born outside hospitals common developing countries unicef developing countries majority babies born outside hospitals causes dilemma developing hearing screening based hospital settings fortunately routine childhood immunization perhaps wellestablished public health program globally due substantial technicalfinancial support receives yearly unicef several donor agenciespartners mcpherson olusanya mothers newborns regardless birthing location take babies immunization clinics designated community health centers immunization clinics used platforms delivering new child health intervention packages developing countries due popularity derived known preventive value preventing childhood deaths killer disease offered free parents therefore communitybased hearing screenings may performed immunization clinics hopes reaching newborn babies missed hospitalbased screenings furthermore lin et al kapil bantock croxson speculate hearing screenings may even performed infant welfare
