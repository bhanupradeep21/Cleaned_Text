kabuki syndrome also previously known kabukimakeup syndrome kms syndrome congenital disorder genetic affects multiple parts body varying symptoms severity although common characteristic facial quite rare affecting roughly one first identified described two japanese groups led scientists norio niikawa yoshikazu named kabuki syndrome facial resemblance affected individuals stage makeup used kabuki japanese traditional theatrical specific symptoms kabuki syndrome vary large differences affected people kabuki syndrome distinctive facial features include arched eyebrows long eyelashes elongated eyelids lower lids turn prominent ears flat tip nose downward slant overlapping phenotypic features patients variations include prominent ears abnormal dentition congenital heart disease feeding difficulties cryptorchidism joint hypermobility developmental delay hypotonia behavioral difficulties common symptoms skeletal abnormalities short stature heart defects feeding difficulties failure thrive vision hearing difficulties weak muscle tone hypotonia small head size microcephaly frequent mild moderate intellectual disability mild severe developmental delay often associated kabuki infants young children often experience difficulties relating hypotonia feeding issuesfailure thrive infections surgical repair heart palate defects developmental delayscitation needed young children kabuki syndrome benefit early intervention services school age children tend fewer medical issues requiring hospitalization though frequent infections hearing loss feeding issues occur addition intellectual impairment difficulty visuospatial tasks maintaining attention usually require iep individualized education plan child attends public school older children adults report difficulties anxiety endocrine abnormalities immune system abnormalities itp idiopathic thrombocytopenia cvid common variable immune deficiency medical issues tend present older children adolescents type kabuki

syndrome genes belong family genes called chromatinmodifying enzymes specifically genes code histone methyltransferase histone demethylase play part regulation gene normal circumstances enzymes

mutations gene involve change amino acid sequence creates shortened nonfunctional chromatinmodifying consensus clinical diagnostic criteria kabuki syndrome ks defined december international group authors propose definitive diagnosis made individual age history infantile hypotonia developmental delay andor intellectual disability one following major criteria pathogenic likely pathogenic variant typical dysmorphic features defined point life typical dysmorphic features include long palpebral fissures eversion lateral third lower eyelid two following arched broad eyebrows lateral third displaying notching sparseness short columella depressed nasal tip large prominent cupped ears persistent fingertip pads criteria probable possible diagnosis including table suggestive clinical features included original description kabuki syndrome niikawa et defined five cardinal manifestations although cardinal manifestations may may present patient kabuki syndrome kabuki syndrome diagnosed clinically identifying symptoms physical exams lab results commonly geneticist alternatively may discovered using genetic testing whole exome whole genome diagnosis difficult given large spectrum disease fact patients carry one two known mutations carry multiple mutations complicates diagnosis furthercitation needed due rarity kabuki syndrome screened routine prenatal testing including blood tests chorionic villus sampling cvs amniocentesis although routine general population kabuki syndrome specific concern ie expectant mother diagnosed kabuki syndrome sibling ks possible test one specific prenatal testing require cvs amniocentesis however kabuki syndrome usually inherited therefore cases positive family kabuki syndrome positive screening tests cystic hygroma seen nuchal translucency ultrasound screening although findings nonspecific wide differential newly diagnosed patients kabuki syndrome often undergo tests aimed detecting common abnormalities associated syndrome include echocardiogram ultrasound heart detection structural heart defects kidney ultrasound detection structural renal abnormalities immunoglobulin levels pneumococcal titers hearing

manchester university hospitals research program kabuki syndrome several european groups based italy france germany netherlands also actively working improving understanding condition identifying potential treatments norio niikawa md geneticist japan treating child patient presenting unique facial characteristics various health problems never seen constellation symptoms dr niikawa wondered faced undiagnosed condition disorder genetic basis next several years physician treated several patients symptoms outpatient genetics clinic furthering support disorder never dr niikawa presented findings hypothesis first japan dysmorphology conference fellow physician conference yoshikazu kuroki recognised symptoms realised also seen several paediatric patients presentation presented two cases second annual conference following year two doctors separately submitted articles new diagnosis journal dr niikawa coined term kabuki syndrome also known kabuki makeup syndrome syndrome reference traditional japanese theatre respected greatly many children presenting diagnosis unusual elongated lower eyelids feature reminiscent theatrical makeup worn actors kabuki reported dr niikawa name kabuki makeup syndrome given facial appearance patients especially eversion lower eyelids reminiscent makeup actors kabuki traditional form japanese theater kabuki founded early century japan next years developed sophisticated form theater kabuki actors usually apply traditional makeup strengthen eyes especially hero play proud performing individual kanji left right mean sing 歌 dance 舞
