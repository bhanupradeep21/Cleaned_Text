postdomestication thought thousands years old heritable characteristics transmitted encoded used substance called dna stored almost every cell organism proteins molecules variety different things organisms dna instructions make protein called gene change sequence dna called mutation mutations inherently bad genetic diversity ultimately comes mutations mutations happen within gene create alternate forms gene called alleles alleles gene simply slightly different versions instructions make genes protein term allele sometimes replaced word modifier different alleles tend modify horses appearance way dna organized storage structures called chromosomes chromosome simply long piece dna gene much shorter piece rare exceptions gene always found place within chromosome called locus part chromosomes come pairs one chromosome parent chromosomes allele certain gene individual said homozygous gene two alleles different heterozygous horse homozygous certain allele always pass offspring horse heterozygous carries two different alleles pass either one trait expressed gene homozygous allele called recessive trait effect matter whether one copy two called dominant often dominant allele represented uppercase letter recessive allele lowercase letter instance silver dapple z dominant silver trait z recessive nonsilver trait however sometimes alleles distinguished normal wild type allele recent mutation example z nonsilver would wild type z would mutation wild type alleles represented n zz zz z zn valid ways describe horse heterozygous silver wild type notation mainly useful
