sulfonamide functional group part molecule basis several groups drugs called sulphonamides sulfa drugs sulpha drugs original antibacterial sulfonamides synthetic nonantibiotic antimicrobial agents contain sulfonamide group sulfonamides also devoid antibacterial activity eg anticonvulsant sultiame sulfonylureas thiazide diuretics newer drug groups based upon antibacterial allergies sulfonamides common overall incidence adverse drug reactions sulfa antibiotics approximately close hence medications containing sulfonamides prescribed carefully sulfonamide drugs first broadly effective antibacterials used systemically paved way antibiotic revolution medicine bacteria antibacterial sulfonamides act competitive inhibitors enzyme dihydropteroate synthase dhps enzyme involved folate synthesis sulfonamides therefore bacteriostatic inhibit growth multiplication bacteria kill humans contrast bacteria acquire folate vitamin sulfonamides used treat allergies coughs well antifungal antimalarial functions moiety also present medications antimicrobials including thiazide diuretics including hydrochlorothiazide metolazone indapamide among others loop diuretics including furosemide bumetanide torsemide acetazolamide sulfonylureas including glipizide glyburide among others inhibitors eg celecoxib sulfasalazine addition use antibiotic also used treatment inflammatory bowel sulfonamide drugs first broadly effective antibacterials used systemically paved way antibiotic revolution medicine first sulfonamide tradenamed prontosil prodrug experiments prontosil began laboratories bayer ag time component huge german chemical trust ig farben bayer team believed coaltar dyes able bind preferentially bacteria parasites might used attack harmful organisms body years fruitless trialanderror work hundreds dyes team led physicianresearcher gerhard working general direction ig farben executive heinrich hörlein finally found one worked red dye synthesized bayer chemist josef klarer remarkable effects stopping bacterial infections first official communication breakthrough discovery published two years drug patented klarer research partner fritz mietzschcitation needed prontosil bayer named new drug first medicine ever discovered could effectively treat range bacterial infections inside body strong protective action infections caused streptococci including blood infections childbed fever erysipelas lesser effect infections caused cocci however effect test tube exerting antibacterial action live animals later discovered daniel federico nitti jacques thérèse tréfouël french research team led ernest fourneau pasteur institute drug metabolized two parts inside body releasing inactive dye portion smaller colorless active compound called discovery helped establish concept bioactivation dashed german corporations dreams enormous profit active molecule sulfanilamide sulfa first synthesized widely used dyemaking industry patent since expired drug available result sulfa several years late hundreds manufacturers produced myriad forms sulfa lack testing requirements led elixir sulfanilamide disaster fall least people poisoned diethylene glycol led passage federal food drug cosmetic act united states first effective broadspectrum antibiotic available years penicillin heavy use sulfa drugs continued early years world war credited saving lives tens thousands patients including franklin delano roosevelt jr son us president franklin delano roosevelt winston sulfa central role preventing wound infections war american soldiers issued firstaid kit containing sulfa pills powder told sprinkle open sulfanilamide compound active protonated form drug low solubility sometimes crystallize kidneys due first pka around needed painful experience patients told take medication copious amounts water newer analogous compounds prevent complication lower pka around needed making likely remain soluble form many thousands molecules containing sulfanilamide structure created since discovery one account permutations yielding improved formulations greater effectiveness less toxicity sulfa drugs still widely used conditions acne urinary tract infections receiving renewed interest treatment infections caused bacteria resistant antibioticscitation needed sulfonamides prepared reaction sulfonyl chloride ammonia amine certain sulfonamides sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole sometimes mixed drug trimethoprim acts dihydrofolate reductase republic ireland largest exporter worldwide sulfonamides accounting approximately total sulfonamides potential cause variety adverse effects including urinary tract disorders haemopoietic disorders porphyria hypersensitivity reactions used large doses may cause strong allergic reaction serious classified severe cutaneous adverse reactions ie scars include syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis also known lyell syndrome dress syndrome quite serious scars reaction acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis one scars may triggered certain approximately general population adverse reactions treated sulfonamide antimicrobials note observation patients hiv much higher prevalence hypersensitivity reactions less common nonantibiotic sulfonamides though controversial available evidence suggests hypersensitivity sulfonamide antibiotics increased risk hypersensitivity reaction nonantibiotic key component allergic response sulfonamide antibiotics arylamine group found sulfamethoxazole sulfasalazine sulfadiazine antiretrovirals amprenavir fosamprenavir sulfonamide drugs contain arylamine group available evidence suggests patients allergic arylamine sulfonamides crossreact sulfonamides lack arylamine group may therefore safely take nonarylamine therefore argued terms sulfonamide allergy sulfa allergy misleading replaced reference specific drug eg cotrimoxazole two regions sulfonamide antibiotic chemical structure implicated hypersensitivity reactions associated class nonantibiotic sulfonamides lack common manifestations hypersensitivity reaction sulfa drugs rash hives however several lifethreatening manifestations hypersensitivity sulfa drugs including syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis agranulocytosis hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia fulminant hepatic necrosis acute pancreatitis among
