cognitive psychology affectasinformation hypothesis approach model evaluative processing postulating affective feelings provide source information objects tasks decision goal approach understand extent influence affect cognitive proposed affect two major dimensions namely affective valence affective way embodied source affect thought impact three main cognitive functions judgement thought processing variety scenarios influence affect processes thought mediated effects approach thought account wide variety behavioural phenomena affect information hypothesis emphasises significance information affect communicates rather affective feelings affective reactions responses provide embodied source information value valence well affective arousal provides embodied source information specifically affective reactions pleasant unpleasant reactions provide information positive good negative bad value objects task situations stimuli targets experienced source affective reaction take positive negative affect affective arousal involves implicit stress hormonal response adrenergic system explicit responses subjective provide information relevance urgency dimensions thought affect cognitive functioning influencing judgements decision making processing variety situations thought mediated influences finding schwarz clore noted literature wherein individuals thought review attend affective reactions making evaluative judgements decisions typically ask feel broad example may applied variety situations considering much like something judgements based feel particular stimulus opposed attributes characteristics said essentially object task situation stimulus experienced source affective reaction takes affect value judgement decision may made stimulus based attributed positive negative affect typically lead positive negative judgements affective arousal thought intensify positive negative affective reactions result judgemental evaluations relying affective arousal indicate strongly one feels empirical example findings intensified evaluations high affective arousal watching advertisements positive negative affective tone evaluated positive negative respectively conditions high affective arousal relative conditions low affective affect may elicited stimulus situation relevance referred integral conversely affect may momentary coincide time presence relevant stimulus unrelated stimulus referred incidental affect integral affect provides meaningful relevant information target stimulus judgement decision made incidental affect may lead affective feelings subsequently misattributed stimulus hand thus provide mistaken information stimulus mislead judgement decision variety research investigating influence affect judgement misattribution affect one study area investigated affective induced positive negative affective states based life event happy versus sad weather sunny versus rainy induced positive affective states good experiences sunny weather lead positive evaluations ratings general wellbeing relative induced negative affective state sad experiences rainy weather lead negative life evaluations also found negative life evaluations induced negative affective state removed state induced attributed irrelevant source life satisfaction misattribution occur induced positive affective state conclusion results indicate affective state indirectly influenced judgements life satisfaction type information conveyed affective feelings associated life another study area illustrates misattribution effect affective arousal induced high

dependent type affective reaction consequently influences type information processing style used interpret affect attributed response situation positive affect signals benign promotes relational involves primarily top processing conversely negative affect signals problematic inhibiting processing associated positive promoting referential associated primarily bottom example influence affect processing style influence use global versus local positive affect thought induce global processing style processing conversely negative affect reduces global processing enhances local processing style processing parts research area illustrated informative influence affective valence dependent accessibility global local processing styles situations either global local style accessible positive affect lead greater increase global local processing respectively compared negative affective valence also indicated informative effects stereotypical thought positive affect thought lead increased stereotypical thought processing illustrated research participants induced positive mood likely induced neutral negative mood make stereotypical judgement suggested due stereotypical thought elicited positive additionally negative affect demonstrated lead decreased stereotypical thought effect arousal judgement affective arousal proposed intensify cognitive processing induced result information provided affective illustration empirical research false memories showed high affective arousal false memories produced within different valence conditions positive negative neutral low affective affective arousal predominantly discussed regard informative influence affect memory however influence affective valence memory demonstrated research memory illustrated exposure pleasant unpleasant odours induce positive negative affective valence respectively induced positive affect provided significantly positive ratings rated happy memory retrieved memory induced negative affective valence also implicated memory affective arousal indicated influence redirects narrows attention towards potentially important salient factors environmental thus influencing information gets encoded mentioned effect mediated implicit explicit affective arousal responses indicative level importance affective arousal also implicated consolidation longterm memory mediating effects stress hormones adrenergic system shown functional connectivity amygdala hippocampus whose functions include memory empirical research investigating affective valence arousal found effects different aspects research investigated effect induced positive versus negative affective valence induced high low arousal memory encoding using picture slides delayed assess longterm memory immediate freerecall task free
