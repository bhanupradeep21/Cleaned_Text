polysomnography psg type sleep multiparameter study sleep diagnostic tool sleep medicine test result called polysomnogram also abbreviated psg name derived greek latin roots greek πολύς polus many much indicating many channels latin somnus sleep greek γράφειν graphein write type polysomnography sleep study performed overnight continuously monitored credentialed technologist records physiological changes occur sleep usually night though labs accommodate shift workers people circadian rhythm sleep disorders sleep times psg monitors many body functions including brain activity eeg eye movements eog muscle activity skeletal muscle activation emg heart rhythm identification sleep disorder sleep apnea breathing functions respiratory airflow respiratory effort indicators added along peripheral pulse oximetry polysomnography longer includes npt monitoring erectile dysfunction reported male patients experience erections phasic rem sleep regardless dream content limited channel polysomnography unattended home sleep tests called type ii iv channel polysomnography polysomnography performed technicians technologists specifically accredited sleep medicine however times nurses respiratory therapists perform polysomnography without specific knowledge training field polysomnography data directly related sleep onset latency sol remsleep onset latency number awakenings sleep period total sleep duration percentages durations every sleep stage number arousals also information crucial diagnostics directly linked sleep movements respiration cardiovascular parameters case polysomnographic evaluation information obtained body temperature esophageal ph according patients studys videoeeg polysomnography combines polysomnography video recording described effective polysomnography evaluation sleep troubles parasomnias allows easier correlation eeg polysomnography bodily polysomnography used diagnose rule many types sleep disorders including narcolepsy idiopathic hypersomnia periodic limb movement disorder plmd rem behavior disorder parasomnias sleep apnea although directly useful diagnosing circadian rhythm sleep disorders may used rule sleep disorders use polysomnography screening test persons excessive daytime sleepiness sole presenting complaint polysomnogram typically record minimum channels requiring minimum wire attachments patient channels vary every lab may adapted meet doctors requests minimum three channels eeg one two measure airflow one two chin muscle tone one leg movements two eye movements eog one two heart rate rhythm one oxygen saturation one belts measure chest wall movement upper abdominal wall movement movement belts typically measured piezoelectric sensors respiratory inductance plethysmography movement equated effort produces lowfrequency sinusoidal waveform patient inhales exhales wires channel recorded data lead patient converge central box turn connected computer system recording storing displaying data sleep computer monitor display multiple channels continuously addition labs small video camera room technician observe patient visually adjacent room electroencephalogram eeg generally use six exploring electrodes two reference electrodes unless seizure disorder suspected case electrodes applied document appearance seizure activity exploring electrodes usually attached scalp near frontal central top occipital back portions brain via paste conduct electrical signals originating neurons cortex electrodes provide readout brain activity scored different stages sleep combined referred nrem sleep stage r rapid eye movement sleep rem wakefulness eeg electrodes placed according international system electrooculogram eog uses two electrodes one placed cm outer canthus right eye one placed cm outer canthus left eye electrodes pick activity eyes virtue electropotential difference cornea retina cornea positively charged relative retina helps determine rem sleep occurs rapid eye movements characteristic also essentially aids determining sleep occurs electromyogram emg typically uses four electrodes measure muscle tension body well monitor excessive amount leg movements sleep may indicative periodic limb movement disorder plmd two leads placed chin one jawline one like eog helps determine sleep occurs well rem sleep sleep generally includes relaxation marked decrease muscle tension occurs decrease skeletal muscle tension occurs rem sleep person becomes partially paralyzed make acting dreams impossible although people paralysis develop rem behavior disorder finally two leads placed anterior tibialis leg measure leg movements though typical electrocardiogram ecg ekg would use ten electrodes two three used polysomnogram either placed collarbone side chest one collarbone six inches waist either side body electrodes measure electrical activity heart contracts expands recording features p wave qrs complex wave analyzed abnormalities might indicative underlying heart pathology nasal oral airflow measured using pressure transducers andor thermocouple fitted near nostrils pressure transducer considered sensitivecitation needed allows clinicianresearcher measure rate respiration identify interruptions breathing respiratory effort also measured concert nasaloral airflow use belts belts expand contract upon breathing effort however method respiration may also produce false negatives patients open close mouth obstructive apneas occur forces air mouth air enters airway lungs thus pressure transducer thermocouple detect diminished airflow respiratory event may falsely identified hypopnea period reduced airflow instead obstructive apnea pulse oximetry determines changes blood oxygen levels often occur sleep apnea respiratory problems pulse oximeter fits fingertip earlobe snoring may recorded sound probe neck though commonly sleep technician note snoring mild moderate loud give numerical estimate scale also snoring indicates airflow used hypopneas determine whether hypopnea may obstructive apnea standard test patient comes sleep lab early evening next hours introduced setting wired multiple channels data
