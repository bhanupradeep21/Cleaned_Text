amusia musical disorder appears mainly defect processing pitch also encompasses musical memory two main classifications amusia exist acquired amusia occurs result brain damage congenital amusia results musicprocessing anomaly present since birth studies shown congenital amusia deficit finegrained pitch discrimination population acquired amusia may take several forms patients brain damage may experience loss ability produce musical sounds sparing much like aphasics lose speech selectively sometimes still forms amusia may affect specific subprocesses music processing current research demonstrated dissociations rhythm melody emotional processing amusia may include impairment combination skill sets symptoms amusia generally categorized receptive clinical mixed symptoms receptive amusia sometimes referred musical deafness tone include inability recognize familiar melodies loss ability read musical notation inability detect wrong outof tune clinical expressive symptoms include loss ability sing write musical notation andor play mixed disorder combination expressive receptive impairmentcitation needed clinical symptoms acquired amusia much variable congenital amusia determined location nature brain injuries may affect motor expressive functioning including ability sing whistle hum tune oralexpressive amusia ability play instrument instrumental amusia musical apraxia ability write music musical agraphia additionally brain damage receptive dimension affects faculty discriminate tunes receptive sensorial amusia ability read music musical alessia ability identify songs familiar prior brain damage amnesic amusiacitation needed research suggests patients amusia also difficulty comes spatial amusics performed quickly normal individuals combined task spatial musical processing tasks likely due deficit normal individuals experience interference due intact processing musical spatial tasks amusics pitch processing normally depends cognitive mechanisms usually used process spatial congenital amusia show impaired performance discrimination identification imitation sentences intonational differences pitch direction final word suggests amusia subtle ways impair language amusic individuals remarkable sparing emotional responses music context severe lifelong deficits processing individuals amusia describe music unpleasant others simply refer noise find annoyingcitation needed social implications amusics often try avoid music many social situations optioncitation needed china countries tonal languages spoken amusia may pronounced social emotional impact difficulty speaking understanding however context clues often strong enough determine correct meaning similarly homophones amusia classified learning disability affects musical research suggests congenital amusia younger subjects taught tone differentiation techniques finding leads researchers believe amusia related dyslexia similar research shown amusia may related increase size cerebral cortex may result malformation cortical development conditions dyslexia epilepsy due malformation cortical development also lead increase cortical thickness leads researchers believe congenital amusia may caused identical phenomenon different area amusia also similar aphasia affect similar areas brain near temporal lobe cases amusia show symptoms aphasia however number cases shown aphasia exhibit symptoms amusia especially acquired aphasia two mutually exclusive one imply possession acquired amusia inability perceive music correlates inability perform higherlevel functions case musical ability improves higher cognitive functions suggests musical ability closely related higherlevel functions memory learning mental flexibility semantic amusia also related aprosody disorder persons speech affected becoming extremely monotonous found amusia aprosody arise seizures occurring nondominant hemisphere also arise lesions brain brocas aphasia come simultaneously amusia injury relation musical abilities components speech however understood diagnosis amusia requires multiple investigative tools described montreal protocol identification protocol center montreal battery evaluation amusia involves series tests evaluate use musical characteristics known contribute memory perception conventional protocol also allows ruling conditions explain clinical signs observed battery comprises six subtests assess ability discriminate pitch contour musical scales pitch intervals rhythm meter individual considered amusic perform two standard

electroencephalography eeg common methods employed uncover brain anomalies associated amusia see additionally voxelbased morphometry vbm used detect anatomical differences mris amusic brains musically intact brains specifically respect increased andor decreased amounts white grey two general classifications amusia congenital amusia acquired amusiacitation needed congenital amusia commonly known tone deafness tin refers musical disability explained prior brain lesion hearing loss cognitive defects lack environmental affects individuals congenital amusia seem lack musical predispositions people unable recognize hum familiar tunes even normal audiometry aboveaverage intellectual memory skills also show sensitivity dissonant chords melodic context discussed earlier one musical predispositions exhibited infants hallmark congenital amusia deficit finegrained pitch discrimination deficit apparent congenital amusics asked pick wrong note given distance two successive pitches small congenital amusics able detect pitch change result defect pitch perception lifelong musical impairment may emerge due failure internalize musical scales lack finegrained pitch discrimination makes extremely difficult amusics enjoy appreciate music consists largely small pitch tonedeaf people seem disabled comes music fully interpret prosody intonation human speech tone deafness strong negative correlation belonging societies tonal languagescitation needed could evidence ability reproduce distinguish notes may learned skill conversely may suggest genetic predisposition towards accurate pitch discrimination may influence linguistic development population towards tonality correlation allele frequencies linguistic typological features recently discovered supporting latter tone deafness also associated musicalspecific impairments inability keep time music beat deafness lack rhythm inability remember recognize song disabilities appear separately research shows likely appear tonedeaf experienced musicians w mathieu addressed tone deafness adults correctable acquired amusia musical disability shares characteristics congenital amusia rather inherited result brain also common congenital suggested music processed musicspecific neural networks brain view broadened show music processing also encompasses generic cognitive functions memory attention executive study published investigated neural cognitive mechanisms underlie acquired amusia contribute study performed stroke patients left right hemisphere middle cerebral artery mca infarction one week three months six months stroke amusic subjects identified one week following stroke course study amusics nonamusics compared brain lesion location performances neuropsychological testscitation needed results showed significant difference distribution left right hemisphere lesions amusic nonamusic groups amusic group significantly higher number lesions frontal lobe auditory temporal lobe lesions also observed patients amusia amusia common occurrence following ischemic mca stroke evidenced patients found amusic oneweek poststroke significant recovery takes place time amusia persist long periods test results suggest acquired amusia recovery poststroke stage associated variety cognitive functions particularly attention executive functioning working neurologically intact individuals appear born musical even able talk infants show remarkable musical abilities similar adults sensitive musical scales regular also infants able differentiate consonant dissonant intervals perceptual skills indicate musicspecific predispositions prolonged exposure music develops refines skills extensive musical training seem necessary processing chords development musical competence likely depends encoding pitch along musical scales maintaining regular pulse key components structure music aid perception memory also encoding pitch temporal regularity likely specialized music pitch perception absolutely crucial processing music use scales organization scale tones around central tone called tonic assign particular importance notes scale cause nonscale notes sound place enables listener ascertain wrong note played however individuals amusia ability either compromised lost musicspecific neural networks exist brain variety musicrelated tasks shown brocas area involved processing musical furthermore brain damage disrupt individuals ability tell difference tonal atonal music detect presence wrong notes preserve individuals ability assess distance pitches direction opposite scenario also occur individual loses pitch discrimination capabilities sense appreciate tonal context work distinct neural networks also exist music memories singing music recognition neural networks music recognition particularly intriguing patient undergo brain damage renders unable recognize familiar melodies presented without words however patient maintains ability recognize spoken lyrics words familiar voices environmental reverse case also possible patient recognize spoken words still recognize familiar melodies situations overturn previous claims speech recognition music recognition share single processing instead clear least two distinct processing modules one speech one many research studies individuals amusia show number cortical regions appear involved processing music report primary auditory cortex secondary auditory cortex limbic system responsible faculty recent studies suggest lesions cortical areas abnormalities cortical thickness deficiency neural connectivity brain plasticity may contribute amusia various causes amusia exist general findings provide insight brain mechanisms involved music processing discussed studies suggest analysis pitch primarily controlled right temporal region brain right secondary auditory cortex processes pitch change manipulation fine tunes specifically region distinguishes multiple pitches characterize melodic tunes contour pitch direction interval frequency ratio successive notes right superior temporal gyrus recruits evaluates contour information right left temporal regions recruit evaluate interval addition right anterolateral part heschls gyrus primary auditory cortex also concerned processing pitch brain analyzes temporal rhythmic components music two ways segments ongoing sequences music temporal events based duration groups temporal events understand underlying beat music studies rhythmic discrimination reveal right temporal auditory cortex responsible temporal segmenting left temporal auditory cortex responsible temporal studies suggest participation motor cortical areas rhythm perception therefore lack involvement networking bilateral temporal cortices neural motor centers may contribute congenital acquired memory required order process integrate melodic rhythmic aspects music studies suggest rich interconnection right temporal gyrus frontal cortical areas working memory music connection temporal frontal regions brain extremely important since regions play critical roles music processing changes temporal areas amusic brain likely associated deficits pitch perception musical characteristics changes frontal areas potentially related deficits cognitive processing aspects memory needed musical discrimination memory also concerned recognition internal representation tunes help identify familiar songs confer ability sing tunes ones head activation superior temporal region left inferior temporal frontal areas responsible recognition familiar right auditory cortex perceptual mechanism involved internal representation findings suggest abnormalities andor injuries regions brain could facilitate amusiacitation needed currently forms treatment proven effective treating amusia one study shown tone differentiation techniques success however future research treatment disorder necessary verify technique appropriate f gall mentioned musical organ specific region human brain could spared disrupted traumatic event resulting brain jeanbaptiste bouillaud described first series cases involved loss music abilities due brain injury grant allen first describe medical literature would later termed congenital amusia calling later late nineteenth century several influential neurologists studied language attempt construct theory cognition studied thoroughly language music visual processing also studied august knoblauch produced cognitive model music processing termed amusia model music processing earliest possibility certain individuals may born musical deficits new notion first documented case congenital amusia published study conducted female volunteer referred monica declared musically impaired response advertisement monica psychiatric neurological history hearing loss mri scans showed abnormalities monica also scored average standard intelligence test working memory evaluated found normal however monica lifelong inability recognize perceive music persisted even involvement music church choir band childhood teenage monica said enjoy listening music sounded like noise evoked stressful response order determine monicas disorder amusia subjected mbea series tests one tests dealt monicas difficulties discriminating pitch variations sequential notes test pair melodies played monica asked second melody pair contained wrong monicas score test well average score generated control tests showed monica struggled recognizing highly familiar melodies problems recognizing voices wellknown speakers thus concluded monicas deficit seemed limited later study showed amusics experience difficulty discriminating variations pitch also exhibit deficits perceiving patterns finding led another test designed assess presence deficiency pitch test monica heard sequence five piano tones constant pitch followed comparison sequence five piano tones fourth tone could pitch notes sequence completely different pitch altogether monica asked respond yes detected pitch change fourth tone respond could detect pitch change results showed monica could barely detect pitch change large two semitones whole tone half pitchprocessing deficit extremely severe seem include speech pitch variations speech coarse compared used conclusion monicas learning disability arose basic problem pitch discrimination viewed origin congenital past decadeas much discovered amusia however remains great deal learn method treatment people amusia defined tone differentiation techniques used amusic patients success found research children reacted positively tone differentiation techniques adults found training however research direction would aid determining would viable treatment option people amusia additional research also serve indicate processing component brain essential normal music also would extremely beneficial investigate musical learning relation amusia since could provide valuable insights forms learning disabilities dysphasia
