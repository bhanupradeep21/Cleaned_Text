job characteristics theory theory work design provides set implementing principles enriching jobs organizational settings original version job characteristics theory proposed model five core job characteristics ie skill variety task identity task significance autonomy feedback affect five workrelated outcomes ie motivation satisfaction performance absenteeism turnover three psychological states ie experienced meaningfulness experienced responsibility knowledge work redesign first got start prevailing attitude jobs simplified order maximize production however found subjected highly routinized repetitive tasks benefits simplification sometimes disappeared due worker dissatisfaction proposed jobs enriched ways boosted motivation instead simplified string repetitive viewpoint job characteristics theory emerged greg r j richard constructed original version job characteristics theory jct based earlier work turner hackman turner provided foundation objective characteristics jobs work design hackman indicated direct effect job characteristics employees work related attitudes behaviors importantly individual differences need development called growth need strength job characteristics theory hackman oldham presented final form job characteristics theory book work redesign main changes included addition two moderators knowledge skill context satisfaction removal work outcomes absenteeism turnover increased focus internal work motivation several outcome variables removed renamed well concentration shifted affective outcomes following results empirical studies showed weak support relationship psychological states behavioral addition theory oldham hackman also created two instruments job diagnostic survey jds job rating form jrf assessing constructs jds directly measures jobholders perceptions five core job characteristics experienced psychological states growth need strength outcomes jrf designed obtain assessments external observers supervisors researchers core job according final version theory five core job characteristics prompt three critical psychological states lead many favorable personal work outcomes moderators growth need strength knowledge skill context satisfaction moderate links job characteristics psychological states psychological states adopted earlier personal work outcomes initial theory internal work motivation job satisfaction absenteeism turnover performance quality however revisions original model included removing absenteeism turnover breaking performance quality work quantity work three critical psychological states job characteristic theory jct draw upon cognitive motivation theory previous work identifying presence certain psychological states could lead favorable jct provided chance systematically assess relationship previously discovered psychological states experienced meaningfulness experienced responsibility knowledge results outcomes importantly previous work work design showed job characteristics predict individual performance provide relationship existed job characteristics theory filled gap building bridge job characteristics workrelated outcomes use three critical psychological states three psychological states also conceptual core theory include experienced meaningfulness work experienced responsibility outcomes work knowledge results work activities psychological states theorized mediate relationship job characteristics workrelated outcomes according theory three critical psychological states noncompensatory conditions meaning jobholders experience three critical psychological states achieve outcomes proposed example workers experience three psychological states feel good perform well positive feelings turn reinforce workers keep performing according theory certain core job characteristics responsible psychological state skill variety task identity task significance shape experienced meaningfulness autonomy affects experienced responsibility feedback contributes knowledge results previous research found four job characteristics autonomy variety identity feedback could increase workers performance satisfaction task significance derived greg oldhams work experience assembly line worker though job provide task variety identity still experienced meaningfulness realization others depended work realization led inclusion task significance another job characteristic would influence experienced meaningfulness job thus job characteristics theory proposed five core job characteristics could predict work related job high score five core characteristics likely generate three psychological states lead positive work outcomes high internal work motivation high satisfaction work high quality work performance low absenteeism turnover tendency high levels job characteristics lead positive outcomes formulated motivating potential score mps hackman oldham explained mps index degree job overall high standing persons degree motivationand therefore likely prompt favorable personal work outcomes motivating potential score mps calculated using core dimensions discussed follows jobs high motivating potential must also high least one three factors lead experienced meaningfulness also must high autonomy job high mps job characteristics model predicts motivation performance job satisfaction positively affected likelihood negative outcomes absenteeism turnover according equation low standing either autonomy feedback substantially compromise jobs mps autonomy feedback job characteristics expected foster experienced responsibility knowledge results respectively contrary low score one three job characteristics lead experienced meaningfulness may necessarily reduce jobs mps strong presence one three attributes offset absence response one disadvantages job characteristics theory added individual difference factor model herzberg et al took account importance intrinsically extrinsically motivating job characteristics consideration individual importance individual differences demonstrated previous work showing individuals likely positively respond enriched job environment thus original version theory posits individual difference characteristic growth need strength gns moderates effect core job characteristics outcomes jobholders high growth need strength respond positively opportunities provided jobs high levels five core characteristics compared low gns theory scientific management emphasized efficiency productivity simplification tasks division labor herzberg et al theory aka twofactor theory influence job characteristics theory sought increase motivation satisfaction enriching jobs theory predicts changes motivators intrinsic work recognition advancement achievement lead higher levels employee motivation satisfaction hygiene factors extrinsic work company policies salary lead lower levels dissatisfaction actually effect satisfaction motivation sociotechnical systems predicts increase satisfaction productivity designing work optimized persontechnology interactions quality improvement based idea jobs improved analysis optimized work processes adaptive structuration provides way look interaction technologys intended actual use organization influence different workrelated outcomes idaszak provided corrected version job diagnostic survey corrected one measurement errors instrument suggested reverse scoring several questions blame inconsistent studies looking factors involved job diagnostic following factor analysis idaszak drasgow found six factors rather theorized five characteristics proposed job characteristics theory upon investigation able show sixth factor made reverse coded items authors rephrased questions ran analysis found removed measurement due inconsistent findings validity growth need strength moderator job characteristicoutcomes relationship graen scandura proposed model added growth opportunity another moderator suggested isnt simple positive relationship motivation growth need strength instead underlying incremental stairstep relationship various levels growth opportunity growth opportunity increments described events change either characteristics job understanding job hypothesized people high growth need strength met level growth opportunity could motivated increase performance people low growth need strength met increments performance would either maintain degrade field studies found support model original growth need strength humphrey nahrgang extended original model incorporating many different outcomes job characteristics authors divided revised set job characteristics three sections motivational social work context characteristics outcomes portioned four parts behavioral attitudinal role perception wellbeing outcomes results showed strong relationships expanded characteristics outcomes suggesting options enriching jobs original theory would taking earlier empirical research job characteristics theory psychological ownership researchers developed model combined two replaced psychological states job characteristics theory psychological ownership job mediator job characteristics outcomes addition positive personal work outcomes job characteristics theory negative outcomes eg territorial behaviors resistance change burden responsibility since inception job characteristics theory scrutinized first empirical tests theory came hackman oldham authors found internal consistency reliability scales discriminant validity items satisfactory also tried assess objectivity measure supervisors researchers evaluate job addition jobholders importantly authors reported relationships predicted model supported following publications empirical articles published examining job characteristics theory next fried summarized research job characteristics theory found modest support overall fried mentioned seven general areas criticism review discussed years since job characteristics theorys introduction organizational literature many changes field work oldham hackman suggest areas fruitful development work design social motivation job crafting social sources motivation becoming important due changing nature work country jobs requiring higher levels clientemployee interaction well increasing interdependence among employees mind would make sense investigate effect social aspects affective behavioral job characteristics theory mainly focused organizations responsibility manipulating job characteristics enrich jobs considerable buzz literature regarding job crafting job crafting employee control role organization hackman oldham point many avenues inquiry regarding job crafting benefits job crafting benefits due job crafting process actual changes made job negative effects job finally brought potential research directions relevant team work design specifically discuss need understand use workdesign aimed individual team level order increase performance type team best suited particular job characteristics theory firmly entrenched within work design also called job enrichment literature moreover theory become one cited organizational behavior practical terms job characteristics theory provides framework increasing employees motivation satisfaction performance enriching job characteristics job characteristics theory embraced researchers used multitude professions applied domain hackman oldham reported number consulting firms employed model modified meet httpsenwikipediaorgwikijobcharacteristictheory
