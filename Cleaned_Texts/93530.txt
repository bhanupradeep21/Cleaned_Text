thioflavins fluorescent dyes available least two compounds namely thioflavin thioflavin used histology staining biophysical studies protein particular dyes used since investigate amyloid also used biophysical studies electrophysiology thioflavins corrosive irritants acutely toxic causing serious eye thioflavin used research alzheimers disease neurodegenerative diseases thioflavin basic yellow methylene yellow ci tht benzothiazole salt obtained methylation dehydrothiotoluidine methanol presence hydrochloric acid dye widely used visualize quantify presence misfolded protein aggregates called amyloid vitro vivo eg plaques composed amyloid beta found brains alzheimers disease binds beta sheetrich structures amyloid aggregates dye displays enhanced fluorescence characteristic red shift emission additional studies also consider fluorescence changes result interaction double stranded change fluorescent behavior caused many factors affect excited state charge distribution thioflavin including binding rigid highlyordered nanopocket specific chemical interactions thioflavin prior binding amyloid fibril thioflavin emits weakly around nm quenching effects nearby excitation peak nm suspected play role minimizing emissions excited nm thioflavin produces strong fluorescence signal approximately nm upon binding amyloids thioflavin molecule consists benzylamine benzothiazole ring connected carboncarbon bond two rings rotate freely molecule solution free rotation rings results quenching excited state generated photon excitation however thioflavin binds amyloid fibrils two rotational planes two rings become immobilized therefore molecule maintain excited thioflavin fluorescence often used diagnostic amyloid structure perfectly specific amyloid depending particular protein experimental conditions thioflavin may undergo spectroscopic change upon binding precursor monomers small oligomers unaggregated material high beta sheet content even alpha helixrich proteins conversely amyloid fibers affect thioflavin raising prospect false negative results adult c elegans exposure thioflavin results profoundly extended lifespan slowed aging levels decreased lifespan higher thioflavin homogenous mixture compounds results methylation dehydrothiotoluidine sulfonic acid also used stain amyloid plaques like thioflavin binds amyloid fibrils monomers gives distinct increase fluorescence emission however unlike thioflavin produce characteristic shift excitation emission latter characteristic thioflavin results high background fluorescence making unable used quantitative measurements fibril another dye used identify amyloid structure congo red httpsenwikipediaorgwikithioflavin
