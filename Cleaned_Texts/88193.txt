pruritic urticarial papules plaques pregnancy puppp known united kingdom polymorphic eruption pregnancy chronic hiveslike rash strikes women pregnancy skin changes known occur people pregnant skin conditions dermatoses people prior getting pregnant become altered symptoms increase pruritic urticarial papules plaques pregnancy puppp one many skin conditions specific pregnancy occurs every presents longterm risk either woman fetus statistical increase risk premature labor fetal loss despite frequently severe puppp usually first appears abdomen often spreads legs feet arms chest neck face usually skin distension stretching thought possible trigger puppp commonly affects primigravida women first pregnancy large fundal measurements distance pubic bone top uterus andor carrying large babies multiples papules plaques often first appear within stretch marks changing appearance spreading areas body may experiencing signs symptoms puppp strongly recommended speak primary care physician receive consult dermatologist regarding skin changes puppp commonly presents rash starts within stretch marks rash may move areas body including limited trunk body arms legs feet chest neck people experiencing puppp reported rash spreading face palms hands soles rash usually begins skin looking abnormally red feeling itchy accompanied notable swelling skin tissue appears raised within stretch time individual segments rash join form one whole larger rash characteristics happens people report noticing skin surrounding rash appear white color blanched shape halos multiple features disease continue time reported widespread erythema red skin rash due damage underlying capillaries patches inflamed itchy rough cracked patches skin appear similarly features reported cases experiencing puppp tiny vesicles however common develop time certain reports shown positive correlation puppp excessive maternal weight gain along increased newborn birth weight additionally study ghazeeri al showed people underwent conception vitro fertilization timeline onset symptoms reported variability however people report experiencing symptoms third trimester last weeks pregnancy women puppp reported symptoms actually began immediately delivery mentioned papules plaques usually first appear abdomen although umbilicusbelly button often spread legs chest underarms etc however lesions breasts rare thats face usually spared become affected result papules plaques puppp causes skin itchy pruritic immensely affects patients sleep quality throughout puppp common dermatosis pregnancy frequent pregnant women habitating male fetus women quick conspicuous weight gain short period women ultimately deliver although exact cause condition known varying amongst individuals theories linking cause puppp hormonal alterations damage connective tissue pregnancy autoimmune disorder evidence theories currently skin condition occurs mostly first pregnancies primigravida third trimester likely multiple pregnancies triplets twins estimated people typical puppp people never given birth occasionally condition may also occur postpartum rarely ever occur first second additional associations hypertension induction labour observed difference outcome pregnancy mothers pregnancy abdominal wall rapid stretching hypothesized inflammatory reaction occurs due exposure reaction seen frequently twins triplets compared single births hypothesized due increased stretching abdominal wall carrying twins triplets causing earlier onset puppp compared undergoing single throughout pregnancy hormonal changes occur hypothesized changes may contribute onset puppp although current research low hypothesis seen multiple gestations exhibit increased level progesterone increase progesterone causes increased level progesterone receptors present eliciting immune reaction seen skin lesions multiple gestations increase sex hormones seen condition increase progesterone previously discussed also higher levels currently evidence weak role sex hormones play contributing puppp research puppp seen immunohistology profile used determine tissue components present within individual via use antibodies certain immune cells greater amount compared without puppp immunohistology profile shown cells consistent delayed hypersensitivity helper cell infiltrates dendritic cells epidermal langerhans hypothesized puppp appears response fetal antigens circulate throughout body example study showed fetal male dna found within lesions mothers skin thought caused fetal cells seen mothers blood throughout although condition determined autoimmune condition single study seen immunoglobulin igm deposition dermalepidermal membrane associated variety dermatosis including puppp problem hypothesis proposed condition reoccur progressively currently evidence detecting circulating antibodies associated onset puppp front view abdomen side view abdomen feet ankle view puppp often diagnosis exclusion may need laboratory testing rule dermatoses lab tests may include complete blood count comprehensive metabolic panel liver function tests serum human choriogonadotropin serum cortisol additional specialized tests may include serum indirect immunofluorescence biopsy lesions direct immunofluorescence rule pemphigoid common misdiagnosis urticarial pemphigoid gestationis hence needed exclude diagnosing puppp clinical features overlap therefore histological immunological studies necessary ensure misdiagnosis case pemphigoid gestationis lesions usually occur earlier periods gestation often involve umbilicus well positive immunofluorescence perilesional skin eczema people generally history atopy personal family eruption identified pruritic erythematous lesions flexural areas furthermore clinical differential diagnosis could drug eruptions urticaria viral sometimes people may require punch biopsy exclude herpes gestationis variant bullous pemphigoid occurring immediately pregnancy usually biopsy features consistent puppp pathognomonic symptoms particular disorder additionally biopsy unaffected perilesional skin could used direct immunofluorescence studies precise exclusion herpes important note diagnosis conducted trusted medical professional case woman experiencing symptoms puppp recommended contact primary care physician referral dermatologist treatment guidance majority cases puppp resolves within days weeks upon initial onset spontaneously within week however women continue experience symptoms long postpartum period one recent forms treatment suggested intramuscular injection autologous whole blood alternative treatment option people affected puppp right childbirth seems subjective objective improvements symptoms good option people worried taking medications pregnancy antihistamine tablets may prescribed provide relief itch although generally considered much less effective corticosteroid may decrease itching blocking histamine release well improving sleep quality furthermore firstgeneration antihistamines chlorpheniramine proven safe pregnancy supplement treatment secondgeneration antihistamines loratadine cetirizine nonsedating may also effective controlling pruritus pregnant knowing oral antihistamines generally ineffective highpotency topical steroids used treat puppp ideally tapering days therapy class ii corticosteroid creams ointments used aggressive cases oral systemic corticosteroids used treat severe benefits pregnant womans ingesting highpotency corticosteroids must weighed carefully possible mostly unknown risks developing fetus fetuses use highpotency topical corticosteroids grams throughout pregnancy may increase risk low birth weight rarely unusually persistent distressing cases women labor induced soon considered term pruritus unbearable patient puppp oral prednisone doses mgday generally used type severe cases treatment symptoms usually relieved hours oral treatment sometimes cases severe symptoms extremely unbearable early delivery discussed patient treatments ineffective however early delivery baby still guarantee symptoms gone luckily cases steroid treatment works efficiently symptoms generally greatly improved within several days steroid treatments usage controversial topic nonetheless shortterm onetime use advisable tends safer using third trimester compared first pine tar soapbody wash also bring relief keeping skin chilled cold shower iced cloths httpsenwikipediaorgwikitoxemicrashofpregnancy
