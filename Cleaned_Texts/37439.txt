barosaurus ˌbæroʊˈsɔːrəs barrohsorəs giant longtailed longnecked planteating sauropod dinosaur closely related familiar diplodocus remains found morrison formation upper jurassic period utah south dakota present stratigraphic zones composite term barosaurus comes greek words barys βαρυς meaning heavy sauros σαυρος meaning lizard thus heavy lizard barosaurus enormous animal adults measuring ft length weighing metric tons short according mike taylor ft long vertebra byu previously identified part type individual supersaurus may actually belong barosaurus suggested interpreted belonging barosaurus vertebra suggests animal ft long around short tons weight making one largest known dinosaurs neck length least molinaperez larramendi estimated slightly smaller ft short however research presented brian curtice society vertebrate paleontology conference supported previous interpretation byu supersaurus barosaurus differently proportioned close relative diplodocus longer neck shorter tail length overall longer apatosaurus skeleton less sauropod skulls rarely preserved scientists yet discover barosaurus skull related diplodocids like apatosaurus diplodocus long low skulls peglike
