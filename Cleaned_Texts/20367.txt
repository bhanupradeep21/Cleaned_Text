nebivolol beta blocker used treat high blood pressure heart βblockers generally less preferred treatment high blood may used blood pressure taken common side effects include dizziness feeling tired nausea serious side effects may include heart failure use pregnancy breastfeeding works blocking receptors heart dilating blood nebivolol patented came medical use available generic medication united commonly prescribed medication united states million used treat high blood pressure heart nebivolol used treatment angina decrease heart rate contractile force relevant patients need decrease oxygen demand heart blood supplied stenosed constricted arteries adequate ace inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor antagonists calciumchannel blockers thiazide diuretics generally preferred beta blockers treatment primary hypertension absence beta blockers help patients cardiovascular disease blocking receptors many sideeffects medications caused blockade reason beta blockers selectively block adrenergic receptors termed cardioselective beta blockers produce fewer adverse effects instance bronchoconstriction drugs nonselectively block receptors laboratory experiment conducted biopsied heart tissue nebivolol proved βblockers tested approximately times however drugs receptor selectivity humans complex depends drug dose genetic profile patient taking drug highly cardioselective addition doses mg nebivolol loses cardioselectivity blocks recommended starting dose nebivolol mg sufficient control blood pressure may require doses furthermore nebivolol also cardioselective taken patients genetic makeup makes poor metabolizers nebivolol drugs many caucasian people even black people poor metabolizers therefore might benefit less nebivolols cardioselectivity although currently directly
