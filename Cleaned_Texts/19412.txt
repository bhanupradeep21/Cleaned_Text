deficiency rare autosomal recessive disease characterized primary immunodeficiency syndrome disease first identified within white mennonite family professor bodo grimbacher professor christoph klein teams four offspring family showed symptoms including short stature recurrent infection streptococcus pneumonia typical sign immunodeficiency dysfunction cells contain specific lysosomerelated organelles including cytotoxic cells melanocytes neutrophil linkage analysis transcriptional profiling researchers successfully linked syndrome mutation downregulate gene gene responsible encoding late endosomallysosomal mek binding partner protein also known serves adaptor protein surface membrane late endosomes plays vital role regulating mapkerk signaling lysosomal thus deficiency mainly affects cells mapkerk signaling lysosomeslysosomerelated organelles strongly required normal function deficiency accurately diagnosed sequencing gene currently cure deficiency treatment plans symptombased including antibiotics target acute bacterial infection gcsf stimulate neutrophils growth improve patients immunity deficiency impair mapkerk signaling essential cell proliferation responding growth factors thus reduction cell counts types cells observed meanwhile lysosome biogenesis also impaired affecting cells contain specific lysosomerelated organelles like melanocytes cytotoxic cells neutrophils consequently might expect impairment normal function among cells like primary immunodeficiency syndrome patients deficiency prone infection due impaired immune systems example recurrent bronchopulmonary infection caused streptococcus abnormalities also observed among three major types immune cells firstly patients show severe neutropenia anc due impaired response towards granulocyte colonystimulating factor receptor furthermore efficiency patients neutrophils digest bacteria strongly hindered even though phagocytosis process underlying reason impairment azurophilic granules lysosomerelated organelles responsible lysis secondly decreased cytotoxic activity cells observed even though cell counts cells decrease cytotoxicity might also linked impaired lysosome impeding efficient release cytotoxic protein kill pathogens thirdly percentage naive b cells increases blood accompanied decrease igd igm memory b cells classswitched memory b cells iga b indicates bcell maturation might impaired reduced serum igm levels also addition half patients may also show reduced serum igg levels indicating shortterm longterm antibody responses infection beyond immunodeficiency patients deficiency also show hypopigmentation short hypopigmentation caused dysfunction melanosome lysosomerelated organelle melanocytes responsible synthesis secretion melanin pigments color hair skin transmission electron microscope tem accumulation immature melanosomes moreover melanosomes immediately degraded transferring basal keratinocytes cellular component outmost layer thus deficiency patients show abnormally light coloring skin hair eyes symptoms shared genetic diseases cause lysosomal defects like chediakhigashi syndrome hermanskypudlak syndrome type griscelli syndrome type however short stature observed among deficiency mapkerk signaling played essential role skeletal development may expect deficiency impair normal skeletal growth contributing short stature phenotype deficiency first identified within white mennonite family offsprings two unaffected parents showed kind inheritance pattern offsprings affected parents remained unaffected indicated deficiency autosomal recessive disorder addition white mennonite religious isolate tradition inbreeding marriage genetically closely related individuals decrease heterozygosity increasing risks autosomal recessive inheritance pattern background information scientists hypothesized autosomal recessive mutation causes deficiency order identify exact location mutation researchers performed linkage analysis total genetic markers chromosome including segregated perfectly indicating linkage genes flanking region genomewide transcriptional profiling employed narrow among genes gene expression abnormalities underexpression observed gene gene encoding thus disease highly likely caused mutation related gene point mutation cytidine adenosine observed untranslated region utr gene position lower exon utr especially polya tail plays vital role rna processing including maintenance rna stability mediation rna transportation point mutation near gene may also create alternative rna splice site resulting different research shown point mutation lead significant reduction mrna stability decrease translation protein leading studies conducted detailed underlying mechanism exclude possibilities future mapkerk pathway one important signaling pathways cells responsible cell proliferation response epidermal growth factor egf research shown adaptor protein crucial proper localization protein scaffold protein important normal transduction mapkerk pathway facilitating activation mapk fact functions adaptor protein ensuring proper attachment endosomal although activation mapk happen either plasma membrane endosomal major pathway mediated occur endosomal signaling process protein recruit protein endosomal membrane protein able recruit mapk without protein signaling module able localize late endosomes hindering mapk activation cells downregulated levels mimic deficiency patients cells phosphorylation rsk downstream products activated mapk significantly declined egf stimulation indicating decrease activated mapk explain short stature observed deficiency patients egfinduced cell proliferation erk signaling pathways central bone besides growth factor specific neutrophil proliferation granulocyte colonystimulating factor receptor gcsfr also functions signaling upon gcsfr stimulation neutrophils show significantly lower mapk phosphorylation activation level indicating declined gcsfrinduced mapk affect proliferation neutrophils explaining neutropenia observed deficiency patients protein also essential proper localization late endosomes lysosome endocytosis occurs early endosomes mature late endosomes travel towards perinuclear space lysosomes reaching perinuclear space endosomes fuse lysosomes form endolysosome responsible digestion endocytosed compounds besides delivering endocytosed compounds late endosomes also transport important components transgolgi network tgn lysosomes lysosomal biogenesis including deficiency cells average perinuclear distance lateendosomes increases indicating lateendosomes travel perinuclear space fuse without important lysosomal components lysosomal biogenesis regeneration strongly hindered thus expect type lateendosomal configuration destruction also observed among deficiency patients explain cells containing specific lysosomerelated organelles lose function deficiency patients leading hypopigmentation decrease tcell cytotoxicity also consistent inefficient digestion observed deficiency patients neutrophils engulfment bacteria endosome form bring bacterial debris lysosomes digestion endosomal movement strongly hindered decrease bacterial digestion efficiency must observed lysosome secretion defects short stature primary immunodeficiency syndrome three prominent symptoms used diagnosis short stature used distinguish deficiency lysosomal storage pedigree analysis also used confirm autosomal recessive inheritance pattern however ultimate confirmation based genetic screenings wholeexome sequencing used screen mutation related gene although deficiency patients mutation locates utr region instead exon region wholeexome sequencing technology still used recent wholeexome sequencing already extended targets include critical utr specific treatment deficiency treatments aim relieve symptoms instead disease antibiotics like used treat streptococcus pneumonia gcsf stimulate neutrophils intravenous immunoglobulin ivig therapy also used among patients low serum igg igm nowadays drugs developed directly target lossoffunction genetic expect drug targeting deficiency developed future
