superficial sexually mature adult axolotl age months ranges length cm although size close cm common greater cm rare axolotls possess features typical salamander larvae including external gills caudal fin extending behind head external gills usually lost salamander species mature adulthood although axolotl maintains due neoteny evolution axolotls much aquatic salamander heads wide eyes lidless limbs underdeveloped possess long thin digits males identified swollen cloacae lined papillae females noticeable wider bodies full eggs three pairs external gill stalks rami originate behind heads used move oxygenated water external gill rami lined filaments fimbriae increase surface area gas fourgill slits lined gill rakers hidden underneath external gills prevent food entering allow particles filter axolotls barely visible vestigial teeth develop metamorphosis primary method feeding suction rakers interlock close gill slits external gills used respiration although buccal pumping gulping air surface may also used provide oxygen buccal pumping occur twostroke manner pumps air mouth lungs fourstroke reverses pathway compression forces axolotls four pigmentation genes mutated create

regenerative processes occur billion base pair long sequence axolotls genome published largest animal genome completed time revealed speciesspecific genetic pathways may responsible limb although axolotl genome times large human genome encodes similar number proteins namely human genome encodes proteins size difference mostly explained large fraction repetitive sequences repeated elements also contribute increased median intron sizes bp times observed human bp mouse bp tibetan frog bp amphibians begin lives aquatic animals unable live dry land often dubbed tadpoles reach adulthood go process called metamorphosis lose gills start living land however axolotl unusual lack thyroid stimulating hormone needed thyroid produce thyroxine order axolotl go metamorphosis therefore keeps gills lives water life even becomes adult able reproduce body capacity go metamorphosis given necessary hormone axolotls produce must exposed external axolotl undergoes artificiallyinduced metamorphosis begins living land one method artificial metamorphosis induction injection iodine used production thyroid hormones axolotl undergoing metamorphosis experiences number physiological changes help adapt life land include increased muscle tone limbs absorption gills fins body development eyelids reduction skins permeability water allowing axolotl stay easily hydrated land lungs axolotl though present alongside gills reaching nonmetamorphosed adulthood develop axolotl gone metamorphosis resembles adult plateau tiger salamander though axolotl differs longer toescitation needed process artificially inducing metamorphosis often result death even following successful attempt casual hobbyists generally discouraged attempting induce metamorphosis pet neoteny term reaching sexual maturity without undergoing many species within axolotls genus also either entirely neotenic neotenic populations sirens necturus neotenic salamanders although unlike axolotls induced metamorphose injection iodine thyroxine hormone genes responsible neoteny laboratory animals may identified however linked wild populations suggesting artificial selection cause complete neoteny laboratory pet six adult axolotls

discovery starting point research neoteny certain ambystoma velasci specimens included original shipmentcitation needed vilem laufberger prague used thyroid hormone injections induce axolotl grow terrestrial adult salamander experiment repeated englishman julian huxley unaware experiment already done using ground since experiments done often injections iodine various thyroid hormones used induce neoteny observed salamander families seems survival mechanism aquatic environments mountain hill little food particular little iodine way salamanders reproduce survive form smaller larval stage aquatic requires lower quality quantity food compared big adult terrestrial salamander larvae ingest sufficient amount iodine directly indirectly cannibalism quickly begin metamorphosis transform bigger terrestrial adults higher dietary fact high mountain lakes live dwarf forms salmonids caused deficiencies food particular iodine causes cretinism dwarfism due hypothyroidism humans axolotls native mexican central valley although native axolotl population extended lakes wetlands make region native habitat limited lake xochimilco result expansion mexico city lake xochimilco large body water rather small series artificial channels small lakes temporary wetlands lake xochimilco poor water quality caused regions aquaculture agriculture demands also maintained inputs partially treated wastewater water quality tests reveal low nitrogenphosphorus ratio high concentration chlorophyll indicative oxygenpoor environment wellsuited addition intensive use pesticides agriculture around lake xochimilco causes run lake reduction habitat quality axolotls pesticides used contain chemical compounds studies show sharply increase mortality axolotl embryos larvae surviving embryo larvae also increase morphological behavior activity another factor threatens native axolotl population introduction invasive species nile tilapia common carp invasive fish species threaten axolotl populations eating eggs young outcompeting natural resources presence species also shown change behavior axolotls causing less active avoid predation reduction activity greatly impacts axolotls foraging mating small native population large loss genetic diversity lack genetic diversity dangerous remaining population causing increase inbreeding decrease general fitness adaptive potential ultimately raises axolotls risk extinction something already danger studies found indicators low interpopulation gene flow higher rates genetic drift likely result multiple bottleneck incidents events kill several individuals population occur sharply reduce genetic diversity remaining population offspring produced bottleneck events greater risk showing decreased fitness often less capable adaptation line multiple bottleneck events disastrous effects population studies also found high rates relatedness indicative inbreeding inbreeding especially harmful cause increase presence deleterious harmful genes
