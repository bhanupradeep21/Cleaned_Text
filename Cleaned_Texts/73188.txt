process aetosaurs specifically taxa addition ontogenetic variation hypothesis heckert lucas determined four locations within adamanian lvf acaenasuchus holotypes excavated two localities site great abundance adult desmatosuchus studies ongoing majority working paleontologists agree acaenasuchus retain status valid taxon independent desmatosuchus pitting example ontogenetic developments supported strongly due fact concept ontogenetic maturation poorly understood phenomena within address geographical proximity acaenasuchus fossils adult desmatosuchus evidence studied extent sufficient claim synonymy time many variables consider possibility species lived close proximity late triassic period also notable chinle formation region rich aetosaur specimens solely desmatosuchus acaenasuchus
