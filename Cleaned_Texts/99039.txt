pineal foramen supporting pineal gland pineal third eye suggested played role thermoregulation dicynodonts allowing register changes light levels throughout day yearly seasonal changes would allow respond modify thermoregulatory behaviours basking recorded modern tuataras absence pineal complex thliptosaurus suggests playing less important role thermoregulation although reasons unclear independent loss pineal foramen advanced therocephalians cynodonts across permotriassic boundary suggested consequence developing endothermic ie warm blooded metabolisms something inferred occurred contemporary dicynodonts independent loss pineal foramen thliptosaurus kistecephalian dicynodonts may support alternative hypothesis loss pineal foramen therapsids possible changing global environmental conditions end permian global warming movement continents towards equator meant less control needed thermoregulation therapsids like thliptosaurus decreasing need pineal foramen ultimately similar modern tropical lizards much reduced pineal eyes need regulate body temperature well lizards seasonal temperate environments changes therapsid thermoregulation influenced
