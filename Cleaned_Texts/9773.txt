deposition washing soil buried ruins denudation removal matter lower level caused mainly air water movement humic acids generated worms disintegrate rock burrowing behaviour speeds soil layer thickens process slowed worms swallow hard objects eg stones aid digestion causes attrition objects geological significance especially smaller particles otherwise eroded slowly rain causes castings move incline darwin worked weight moving certain distance given time also roll collect drains etc get blown greater effect casting movement tropics increased rain finest earth washed away ledges hillsides formerly believed caused grazing mammals partly due casting accumulations high winds especially gales almost effective sloperain moving castings crowns furrows formerly ploughed lands slowly vanish pasture due worms slowly incline fine earth washed slopes making shallow layer dissolving chalk supplies new earth darwin writes conclusion worms played important part history world persons would
