slot limit tool used fisheries managers regulate size fish legally harvested particular bodies water usually set state fish game departments protected slot limit prohibits harvest fish lengths measured snout end tail fall within protected example body water protected slot limit largemouth bass inches cm largemouth lengths may example largemouth bass shorter inches cm longer inches cm may removed water kept personal use accordance local fishing regulations slot limits based principle bass populations exhibit different habitat requirements different phases lives slot limits focus protecting one segment life history influence overall fishing minimum landing size similar regulation commercial fishing slot may also refer fish within size limits one keep example slot red drum measuring may kept anything may harvested fish may harvested red drum tag generally purpose behind implementation protected slot limits improve angling opportunities particular body bodies water protected slot limits often used regulate harvest waters natural reproduction concerned fish species occurs protected slot limit set way protects size fish deemed important species spawning success fishery size sexually productive fish protected harvest likely increased number spawn given year hence lead naturally produced individuals effort increase number fish natural reproduction mitigates need artificial stocking species provide viable recreational fishery addition improving natural reproduction success protected slot limit also serve improve average catchable size protected species particular concern recreational fisheries practice catch release prevalent slot limit protects fish evade harvest size exceeds lower end protected slot protected harvest exceed maximum size within protected slot fish within size range protected harvest time size would make desirable anglers scenario protection large numbers mediumsized fish translates higher success rate exceed slot hence protected slot limit increases amount fish reach large sizes sought sport anglers model assumes lake stream question contains forage base suitable support fish size issue protected slot limits cases marked controversy protected slot limit anglers desire harvest fish conflict main challenge lies economic ecological social factors fisheries managers must consider implementing harvest regulations protected slot limits take example situation involving lake mille lacs central minnesota anglers spend millions dollars travel countless miles fish lake mille lacs walleye sander vitreus highly sought table fare well sporting qualities case lake mille lacs long protected slot limit walleye slot limit inches cm time state fishing regulations stated lake mille lacs angler could keep four walleyes one walleye inches cm allowed walleyes within protected slot limit inches cm must immediately released protected slot limit worked well sense anglers soon found difficult catch harvestable sizes walleye catching overabundance slotsized fish many anglers become frustrated lack eater sized walleye intense protection size class fish caused sharp decline natural available forage base result large number unhealthy underweight slotsized walleyes fishery case represents exception outcomes common implementation protected slot limits however illustrate objectives fisheries managers must consider devising protected slot limits managers must balance health fishery trophy fish potential desired angler harvest angler fishing must measure fish caught make sure meets states wildlife fisheries requirements every state limits fish native ecosystems fish meets requirements angler allowed keep fish keep certain amount fish species besides slot limit ways limits officials use protect fish population slot limit put action four things must taken consideration order make sure harm done ecosystem growth rate defined long takes fish reach given size even though growth rate differs lake lake average largemouth bass grow three pounds kg less three years considered rapid recruitment defined number young fish live adulthood lakes coverage aquatic plants usually high bass recruitment whereas lakes little shoreline cover often low intermediate lake high recruitment good situation state use slot limit help control number small fish population recruitment low state would use minimumsize limit control fish mortality rate percent fish given lake die find true mortality rate lake officials must divide number fish harvested plus fish killed hooks divide number number fish die year growth rate recruitment rate mortality rate determined three factors met correct measurements must chosen insure harm done surrounding ecosystem slot limit used correctly fish population benefit surrounding ecosystem potentially could gain benefits slot limit slot limits beneficial fish species along ecosystem one benefit slot limits reduces amount competitive pressure fish size reduce competition also result healthier fish population since slot limit allow anglers keep fish produce eggs spawning season since fish healthier larger bring jobs tourists town cause citys revenue risecitation needed lake
