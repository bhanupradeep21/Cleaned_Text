hypercorrection higher likelihood correcting general knowledge error originally certain information understand accurate opposed unsure phenomenon suggests general knowledge information confidently misremembered someone person learns right version initial response corrected likelihood remembering piece information higher someone unsure initial answer refers finding given corrective feedback errors committed high confidence easier correct low confidence example student taking test state capitals certain pittsburgh capital pennsylvania test returned answer corrected harrisburg shocked answer incorrect student likely make sure remember correct answer student originally unsure answer hypercorrection effect explores whether making mistakes early learning process beneficial learner encoding pattern named hypercorrection psychologists janet metcalfe brady butterfield columbia university however originally noticed raymond w kulhavy wrote educational review focusing students correction process kulhavy discovered students confidently answered incorrectly tests modes examination homework corrected much likely remember material later study researchers metcalfe butterfield hypercorrection effect implications examined beginning presupposition error committed high confidence would require great deal effort overwrite researchers concluded errors committed great deal confidence among easiest errors even though conceptions hypercorrection emerged educational research limited learning environment general knowledge errors learned books movies television especially natural tendencies believe things common example misconception raindrops tearshaped understandably many believe depictions raindrops weather channels past years hypercorrection research focused factors behind whether people ages exhibit phenomenon evidence surprise embarrassment getting answer wrong important role hypercorrection people fear ridiculed answering general knowledge question incorrectly likely remember confident mistake made example person suggests scallops come trees persons friends laugh pointing scallops come ocean embarrassed response incorrect person makes sure remember fact avoid embarrassment another factor implicated hypercorrection vocabulary knowledge used answers individual certain instead unsure possibly implying people familiar answers confident research hypercorrection shows subjects likely guess pick correct answer retests sure response original suggests familiarity information may part producing hypercorrection effect claims hypercorrection effect stating significant part correction mistakes also supported study done using brain imaging janet metcalfe brady butterfield christian habeck yaakov stern conducted experiment using fmri observe neural correlations related hypercorrection effects people people participated experiment women men experimenters delivered questionnaire participants recorded brain activities using fmri correcting incorrect answers discovered participants received correction committing mistake brain showing activation temporoparietal junction tpj indicates entertaining original false belief well true hypercorrection effect knowledge knowledge errors effects correction knowledge errors seems likely effect studied genuine classroom settings yet hypercorrection effects mostly studied observation past scenarios effect mostly studied typical laboratory settings study done carpenter haynes corral yeung one first times effect studied authentic educational context study conducted university introductory horticulture class students class first presented questionnaires related educational content course presented correct answers later given posttest test information way analyzing test results researchers determined powerful hypercorrection effect present analyzing results researchers found students higher previous knowledge understanding material showed higher confidence original answers also exhibited much prevalent impressive hypercorrection effect inaccurate answers see studies mentioned higher general knowledge topic seems also bring along potent hypercorrection janet metcalfe explores effect possible repercussions using hypercorrection effect advantage classroom annual psychology review wrote topic explains focusing solely avoiding errors completely testing classroom may actually disadvantageous method teaching learning claim made neurologically typical students metcalfe even goes far say may actually beneficial practice students education commit correct errors lowstakes situations method coming learn understand given material addition benefits making errors learners metcalfe also claims process hearing errors correcting helpful teachers aside direct benefit learners teachers gain valuable information errors error tolerance encourages students active exploratory generative adds another beneficial aspect hypercorrection education proving importance theory implications age plays role within hypercorrection effect research showed people showed effect studies past asked young adults answer general knowledge questions recently older adults tested shown hypercorrection effect though provide definitive evidence state older adults exhibit however whether older adults better correcting knowledge unsure worse hypercorrection still result children concrete say prefrontal cortex part brain crucial memory important hypercorrection effect would plausible explanation since elders may impaired prefrontal cortices childrens may underdeveloped speaking difference hypercorrection effects relative age learn metcalfe stern eich older adults seen better job general test accuracy low occurrence hypercorrection effect younger adults shown display phenomenon however researchers found later problem memory processing mechanisms older people tend hypercorrect less older adults tended correct errors rather focusing highconfidence although finding raises another question regarding learning abilities older adults better focusing errors make young people harder learn older age researchers suggest experiment conducted vitro factual pieces information different outcome real life since older adults could particularly motivated learn truth capable engaging attention however suggestion remains unexplored field needs research proven research conducted andrew butler lisa fazio elizabeth marsh found highconfidence errors likely corrected also likely reproduced correct answer research subjects presented general knowledge questions asked confidence levels answers wrong answers corrected afterwards half subjects asked question right test half asked week later research showed initial period one week subjects less likely remember answers general knowledge questions correctly even importantly highconfidence errors likely lowconfidence errors reproduced delayed findings suggest important fact hypercorrection highconfidence errors likely corrected also likely reproduced correct answer especially period time hypercorrection effect demonstrated replicated several settings many different types participants recent years metcalfe j miele b hypercorrection high confidence errors prior testing enhances delayed performance blocks return hypercorrection effect tested participants general population also demonstrated group children autism spectrum though tested autism spectrum disorder significantly weaker general metacognitive ability previous participants without mental disorders show evidence weakened hypercorrection effect thus hypercorrection effect seen many completely disconnected general metacognitive ability phenomenon common among us
