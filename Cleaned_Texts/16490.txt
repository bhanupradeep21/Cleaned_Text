emotionally startling experiences especially patients long qt anxiety stress elevate bodys level cortisol adrenaline turn interfere normal functioning parasympathetic nervous system resulting overstimulation vagus vagus nerve induced palpitation felt thud hollow fluttery sensation skipped beat depending point hearts normal rhythm vagus nerve fires many cases anxiety panic experiencing
