physiology respiration movement oxygen outside environment cells within tissues removal carbon dioxide opposite direction thats physiological definition respiration differs biochemical definition refers metabolic process organism obtains energy form atp oxidizing nutrients releasing waste products although physiologic respiration necessary sustain cellular respiration thus life animals processes distinct cellular respiration takes place individual cells organism physiologic respiration concerns diffusion transport metabolites organism external environment gas exchanges lung occurs ventilation ventilation refers movement air lungs perfusion circulation blood pulmonary mammals physiological respiration involves respiratory cycles inhaled exhaled breaths inhalation breathing usually active movement brings air lungs process gas exchange takes place air alveoli blood pulmonary capillaries contraction diaphragm muscle cause pressure variation equal pressures caused elastic resistive inertial components respiratory system contrast exhalation breathing usually passive process though many exceptions generating functional overpressure speaking singing humming laughing blowing snorting sneezing coughing powerlifting exhaling underwater swimming diving high levels physiological exertion running climbing throwing rapid gas exchange necessitated forms breathcontrolled meditation speaking singing humans requires sustained breath control many mammals capable performing process breathing fill alveoli atmospheric air inhalation ml per breath inhaled air carefully diluted thoroughly mixed large volume gas liters adult humans known functional residual capacity remains lungs exhalation whose gaseous composition differs markedly ambient air physiological respiration involves mechanisms ensure composition functional residual capacity kept constant equilibrates gases dissolved pulmonary capillary blood thus throughout body thus precise usage words breathing ventilation hyponyms synonyms respiration prescription consistently followed even health care providers term respiratory rate rr wellestablished term health care even though would need consistently replaced ventilation rate precise usage followed respiration ch bonds broken oxidationreduction reaction carbon dioxide water also produced cellular energyyielding process called cellular respiration several ways classify physiology respiration
