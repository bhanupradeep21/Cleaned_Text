polycythemia also known polycythaemia laboratory finding hematocrit volume percentage red blood cells blood andor hemoglobin concentration increased blood polycythemia sometimes called erythrocytosis significant overlap two findings terms polycythemia describes increase hematocrit andor hemoglobin erythrocytosis describes increase specifically number red blood cells blood polycythemia many causes describe increase number red blood absolute polycythemia decrease volume plasma relative absolute polycythemia due genetic mutations bone marrow primary polycythemia physiologic adaptations ones environment medications andor health laboratory studies serum erythropoeitin levels genetic testing might helpful clarify cause polycythemia physical exam patient history dont reveal likely mild polycythemia often asymptomatic treatment polycythemia varies typically involves treating underlying treatment primary polycythemia see polycythemia vera could involve phlebotomy antiplatelet therapy reduce risk blood clots additional cytoreductive therapy reduce number red blood cells produced bone polycythemia defined serum hematocrit hct hemoglobin hgb exceeding normal ranges expected age sex

true polycythemia absolute polycythemia split two categories polycythemia newborns defined hematocrit significant polycythemia associated blood hyperviscosity thickening blood causes neonatal polycythemia include pathophysiology polycythemia varies based cause production red blood cells erythropoeisis body regulated erythropoietin protein produced kidneys response poor oxygen result erythropoeitin produced encourage red blood cell production increase oxygencarrying capacity results secondary polycythemia appropriate response hypoxic conditions chronic smoking obstructive sleep apnea high furthermore certain genetic conditions impair bodys accurate detection oxygen levels serum leads excess erythropoeitin production even without hypoxia impaired oxygen delivery alternatively certain types cancers notably renal cell carcinoma medications testosterone use cause inappropriate erythropoeitin production stimulates red cell production despite adequate oxygen primary polycythemia hand caused genetic mutations defects red cell progenitors within bone marrow leading overgrowth hyperproliferation red blood cells regardless erythropoeitin increased hematocrit red cell mass polycythemia increases viscosity blood leading impaired blood flow contributing increased risk clotting first step evaluate new polycythemia individual conduct detailed history physical patients

erythropoietin hence increased production erythrocytes secondary polycythemia production erythropoietin increases appropriately called physiologic polycythemia conditions may result physiologic polycythemia include conditions secondary polycythemia caused physiologic adaptation occurs irrespective body needs rare inherited mutations three genes result increased stability hypoxiainducible factors leading increased erythropoietin production shown cause secondary polycythemia polycythemia often asymptomatic patients may experience notable symptoms red cell count high patients significant
