evolutionary developmental biology evodevo study developmental programs patterns evolutionary seeks understand various influences shaping form nature life planet evodevo arose separate branch science rather recently early sign occurred synthesis evodevo field animal evolution one reason presence model systems like drosophila melanogaster c elegans zebrafish xenopus laevis however since wealth information plant morphology coupled modern molecular techniques helped shed light conserved unique developmental patterns plant kingdom origin term morphology generally attributed johann wolfgang von goethe opinion underlying fundamental organisation bauplan diversity flowering plants book metamorphosis plants proposed bauplan enabled us predict forms plants yet goethe first make perceptive

arabidopsis maize maize traditionally favorite plant geneticists extensive resources almost every area plant physiology development available arabidopsis thaliana apart rice antirrhinum majus brassica

progressed past decade better models molecular evolution refined analysis algorithms better computing power result advances computer sciences evidence suggests algal scum formed land million years ago ordovician period around million years ago land plants appeared began diversify late silurian period around million years ago fruits diversification displayed remarkable detail early devonian fossil

devonian plants reached degree sophistication allowed form forests tall trees evolutionary innovation continued devonian period plant groups relatively unscathed permotriassic extinction event although structures communities changed may set scene evolution flowering plants triassic million years ago exploded cretaceous tertiary latest major group plants evolve grasses became important mid tertiary around million years ago grasses well many groups evolved new mechanisms metabolism survive low warm dry conditions tropics last million years although animals plants evolved bodyplan independently express developmental constraint midembryogenesis limits morphological meristem architectures differ angiosperms gymnosperms pteridophytes gymnosperm vegetative meristem lacks organization distinct tunica corpus layers possess large cells called central mother cells angiosperms outermost layer cells divides anticlinally generate new cells gymnosperms plane division meristem differs different cells however apical cells contain organelles like large vacuoles starch grains like angiosperm meristematic cells pteridophytes like fern hand possess multicellular apical meristem possess tetrahedral apical cell goes form plant body somatic mutation cell lead hereditary transmission earliest meristemlike organization seen algal organism group charales single dividing cell tip much like pteridophytes yet simpler one thus see clear pattern evolution meristematic tissue pteridophytes angiosperms pteridophytes single meristematic cell gymnosperms multicellular less defined organization finally angiosperms highest degree organization transcription factors transcriptional regulatory networks play key roles plant development stress responses well evolution plant landing many novel transcription factor families emerged preferentially wired networks multicellular development reproduction organ development contributing complex morphogenesis land leaves primary photosynthetic organs plant based structure classified two types microphylls lack complex venation patterns megaphylls large complex venation proposed structures arose megaphylls according telome theory evolved plants showed threedimensional branching architecture three transformations planation involved formation planar architecture webbing formation outgrowths planar branches fusion webbed outgrowths fused form proper leaf lamina studies revealed three steps happened multiple times evolution todays contrary telome theory developmental studies compound leaves shown unlike simple leaves compound leaves branch three consequently appear partially homologous shoots postulated agnes arber partialshoot theory appear part continuum morphological categories especially leaf molecular genetics confirmed conclusions see proposed evolution leaves plants photosynthetic apparatus stems todays megaphyll leaves probably became commonplace mya simple leafless plants colonized land early devonian period spread linked fall atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations late paleozoic era associated rise density stomata leaf surface must allowed better transpiration rates gas exchange large leaves less stomata would heated suns rays increased stomatal density allowed bettercooled leaf thus making spread various physical physiological forces like light intensity humidity temperature wind

lycophytes also functionally similar gene players conserved role defining leaf primordia phytohormone auxin gibberelin cytokinin one feature plant phyllotaxy arrangement leaves plant body plant maximally harvest light given constraints hence one might expect trait genetically robust however may maize mutation one gene called abphyl abnormal phyllotaxy enough change phyllotaxy leaves implies sometimes mutational tweaking single locus genome enough generate diversity abphyl gene later shown encode cytokinin response regulator leaf primordial cells established sam cells new axes leaf growth

light harvesting infinite variety plant leaves generated subject intense research common themes emerged one significant involvement knox genes generating compound leaves tomato see universal example pea uses different mechanism mutations genes affecting leaf curvature also change leaf form changing leaf flat crinkly like shape cabbage leaves also exist different morphogen gradients developing

symmetry typical leaves james stated widely accepted radiality characteristic shoots dorsiventrality characteristic leaves extremes continuous spectrum fact simply timing knox gene fact evidence continuum already beginning land plant furthermore studies molecular genetics confirmed compound leaves intermediate simple leaves shoots partially homologous simple leaves shoots since generally accepted compound leaves express leaf shoot properties conclusion reached several authors purely morphological flowerlike structures first appear fossil records mya cretaceous flowering plants long assumed evolved within gymnosperms according traditional morphological view closely allied gnetales however recent molecular evidence odds suggests gnetales closely related gymnosperm groups gymnosperms form distinct clade molecular clock analysis predicts divergence flowering plants anthophytes gymnosperms cycads ginkgo conifers bennettitales gnetales angiosperms angiosperms cycads

agamous ag expressed todays flowers stamens carpel reproductive organs ancestor gymnosperms also expression pattern expressed strobili organ produces pollens similarly bgenes pi ancestors expressed

dicot petals carpels respectively turns true variation due slight changes madsbox genes expression pattern monocots another example toadflax linaria vulgaris two kinds flower symmetries radial bilateral symmetries due changes copy number timing location expression cycloidea related arabidopsis thaliana gene called agamous plays important role defining many petals sepals organs generated mutations gene give rise floral meristem obtaining indeterminate fate many floral organs keep getting produced flowers like roses carnations morning glory example dense floral organs flowers selected horticulturists since long increased number petals researchers found morphology flowers strong mutations agamous homolog plants leads making large number petals several studies diverse plants like petunia tomato impatiens maize etc suggested enormous diversity flowers result small changes genes controlling changes also cause changes expression patterns developmental genes resulting different
