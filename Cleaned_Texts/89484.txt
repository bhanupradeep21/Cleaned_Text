dissorophus disohrohfus meaning double roof two layers armor extinct genus temnospondyl amphibian lived early permian period million years ago fossils found north america heavy armor robust build indicate dissorophus active land similar members clade dissorophidae known late carboniferous early permian periods dissorphus distinguished small body size disproportionately large head short trunk american paleontologist edward drinker cope first briefly described dissorophus likely deriving genus name ancient greek δισσόςdissos double ὀροφήorophe roof refer double layer armor formed horizontal spinous branches top neural spines vertebrae touch forming carapace overlying rows bony osteoderms form armored dermal layer transverse bands correspond skeletal carapace beneath feature expressed well type species name multicinctus meaning manybanded latin cope referred animal veritable batrachian amphibian armadillo demar mentions boulengers interpretation dissorophus remarkable extraordinary exo endoskeletal reflected name dissorphus multicinctus double layered additional specimens dissorophus later collected museum comparative zoology harvard college university chicago described paleontologists williston case romer williston divided dissorophidae two subfamilies aspodosaurinae dissorophinae distinguished aspodosaurinae open otic notch single layered armor one armor segment per vertebral segment dissorophinae closed otic notch double layered armor two armor segments per vertebral cladogram schoch schoch developed cladogram based analysis anatomical features dissorophids found dissorophus broiliellus texensis broiliellus brevis broiliellus olson share pointed snout common micromelerpeton platyrhinops doleserpeton ecolsonia fedexia tambachia anconastes phonerpeton acheloma platyhystrix aspidosaurus conjunctio dissorophus broiliellus texensis broiliellus brevis broiliellus olsoni brevidorsum admiral taxon rio arriba taxon cacops morrisi cacops aspidephorus kamacops zygosaurus schoch sues describe skull dissorophus multicinctus short broad posteriorly demar williston mention skull two equal sides flat posterior orbit curved depressions anterior margins addition skull surface shows deep circular pits depressions situated posterior portions frontals bound narrow ridges thus difficult distinguish according demar skull depth increases posteriorly decreases anteriorly lateral view points another prominent feature dissorophus enlarged otic notch measuring cm length otic notch dissorophus relatively deeper members family dissorophidae possess shallow otic notches presence otic notch firmly assures dissorophides indeed unified amphibian family feature present amphibians lost later amniotes demar also adds depth otic notch relates length skull case short skulls would shallow otic notches longer skulls would possess deeper otic carroll makes similar observation demar broiliellus brevus short skull therefore shallow otic notch expected hand bolt makes crucial comment specimens used describe anatomical features demar carroll based assumption adult demar mentions external nares enlarged measures cm long larger note williston adds external naris elongated along skull margins resulting oval shaped outline oriented laterally orbits dissorophus relatively large circular oriented dorsally laterally demar describes orbits large enough intersect frontals palatines post orbitals lacrimals demar also makes points crucial feature suggest dissorophus broileillus closely related one another species feature region maxillary quadratojugal jugal meet case illustrates jugal overlaps quadratojugal maxillary thus extending tooth rows feature also observed carroll broiliellus brevis conjuctio dissorophus angustus thus feature gives another explanation relationship dissorophus conjunctio keeping mind dissorophus broiliellus closely related pointed snout conjunctio another distinct feature dissorophus maxillary teeth extend back ventral squamosal demar explains extension teeth back correlates jugal overlap maxillary quadratojugal addition demar clarifies contact vomer pterygoid lost resulting palatine contributing enlarged willistons anatomical analysis dissorophus reveal thirty five teeth additionally demars mentions entire lower jaw covered dermal pitting except region coronoid process also mentions coronoid process extends anteriorly serves attachment point muscles thus probable diet inferred would carnivore likely prey smaller animals insects smaller animals demar also comments distinctive feature present dissorophus multicinctus dissorophids explains presence ventral flange interrupts continuity lower jaw connecting ventral flange pitted surface angular continues ventral edge projects medially forming small shelf concludes arrangement lower jaw found dissopophid however angular projection ventral ventral flange also developed williston explains humerus femur dissorophus solidly built stouter humerus deep lateral curvatures wide supracondicular ridges femur lot stronger built compared humerus also mentions articular surface dissorophus femur flattened sharp rims anteroposterior convexity adds femur humerus expanded inner outer side narrow carapace another distinctive feature present dissorophus williston describes feature heavy bony covering necessarily broad long heavy dorsal section deeply pitted ventral section rather addition dilkess findings show osteoderm composed internal section external section expanded laterally distinction internal external section internal section associated flange flanges deeply notched edges notches serve attachment points neural spine explains hardships trying decipher regions neural spine hand external series positioned anterior internal series also adds series likely fused together interosteodermal ligaments osteoderm feature dilkes makes directly correlates bolts interpretations dissorophus double layered osteoderm comprising internal series external terms locomotion dilkes mentions compared cacops dissorphus likely flexible vertebral column terms lateral flexion axial rotation limitation locomotion solely based anatomy osteoderms dilkes explains coupling lateral flexion axial rotation throughout vertebrae translates limited locomotion case cacops dilkess interpretation degree angle inclination zygapophyses indicate coupling lateral flexion axial rotation highly limited addition extensive overlap internal series external series contributes limitation lateral flexion case dissorophus dilkes gives detail larger angle inclinations zygapophyses indicating greater coupling axial rotation lateral flexion despite insertion flanges neural spine conclusion demar dilkes clarify osteoderm growth covers first sections anterior vertebral column grows posteriorly fusion next posterior vertebral sections means reduction flexibility starts anteriorly proceeds posteriorly thus likely juveniles cacops dissorophus greater vertebral flexibility mentioned modern amphibians semiaquatic according demar dissorophus multicinctus made full transition terrestrial land indicated presence dermal armor made less dependent water better adapted active life hypotheses terrestriality include functions dorsal armor suggested demar include demars suggestions terrestriality functions dermal armor directly correlates geological location dissorphus multicinctus fossils according williston schoch information paleobiology database dissorophus fossils found clear fork division texas redbeds arroyo
