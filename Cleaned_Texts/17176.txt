active seti active search extraterrestrial intelligence attempt send messages intelligent extraterrestrial life active seti messages predominantly sent form radio signals physical messages like pioneer plaque may also considered active seti message active seti also known meti messaging extraterrestrial intelligence active seti term early though decades term term meti coined russian scientist alexander zaitsev proposed subtle distinction active seti science known seti deals searching messages aliens meti deals creation transmission messages aliens thus seti meti proponents quite different perspectives seti scientists position address local question active seti make sense words would reasonable seti success transmit object attracting etis attention contrast active seti meti pursues

strictly logical nonetheless understandable given prior definition terms concepts hailing addition characteristics radio signal wavelength type polarization modulation considered galactic distances interstellar medium induces scintillation effects artificial modulation electromagnetic signals modulation higher lower frequencies function sky direction large distances depth modulation exceed making meti signal difficult decode meti research message must redundancy although exact amount redundancy message formats still great dispute using ideograms instead binary sequence already offers
