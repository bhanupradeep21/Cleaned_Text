metabolic complication malignancy without however resulting necessarily obstruction metastasis go name paraneoplastic syndromes often indicate advanced disease worse prognosiscitation needed common paraneoplastic syndromes associated adenocarcinoma lung described according nurses health study risk pulmonary adenocarcinoma increases substantially long duration tobacco smoking smokers previous smoking duration years twice likely develop lung adenocarcinoma compared neversmokers relative risk approximately duration years increases relative risk cancer usually seen peripherally lungs opposed small cell lung cancer squamous cell lung cancer tend centrally although may also occur central unknown reasons often arises relation peripheral lung scars current theory scar probably occurred secondary tumor rather causing adenocarcinoma increased incidence smokers common type lung cancer seen nonsmokers deeper inhalation cigarette smoke results peripheral lesions often case adenocarcinomas lung generally adenocarcinoma grows slowly forms smaller masses however tends metastasize early large scale studies cancer genome atlas tcga systematically characterized recurrent somatic alterations likely driving lung adenocarcinoma initiation since smoking strong mutagenic factor lung adenocarcinoma one tumor types highest number common somatic mutations lung adenocarcinoma affect many oncogenes tumor suppressor genes including mutated cases egfr kras egfr kras mutations tend appear mutually exclusive fashion kras mutations associated smoking habits whereas egfr mutations occur frequently females people asian ethnicity copy number amplifications oncogenes tert egfr met myc reported well deletions tumor suppressor genes frequent alterations occur genes belonging receptor tyrosine kinase pathway egfr prominent example pathway involved cell proliferation survival often deregulated cancer consequence targeted therapies developed inhibit mutant pathway three membrane associated tyrosine kinase receptors recurrently involved fusions rearrangements adenocarcinomas alk ret eighty translocations also reported adenocarcinomas alk rearrangements common partner gene fusions tend occur tumors carry egfr kras mutations also lower frequency mutations alk ros fusions offer opportunities targeted therapies tyrosine kinase inhibitorscitation needed respiratory tract divided two main components conducting airways gas exchange airways gas exchange airways made alveoli small microscopic air sacs responsible exchange oxygen carbon dioxide normal breathing alveoli composed two cell types type type ii pneumocytes type pneumocytes cover alveolar surfaces able regenerate type ii pneumocytes common making cells within alveolar epithelium constitute alveolar several factors contribute transformation normal alveolar epithelium dysplastic precancerous lesions adenocarcinoma lung develops stepwise progression type ii pneumocytes undergo

majority lung cancers characterized either small cell lung cancer sclc nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc lung adenocarcinoma one three major subtypes nsclc also include squamous carcinoma large cell historically much debate accurate method describing adenocarcinoma lung several revisions classification systems published recently international multidisciplinary classification lung adenocarcinoma published represents consensus several organizations accurately describe specific type lung current classification system aims reliably predict prognosis determination therapeutic tumor size pattern cell growth depth cell invasion normal lung tissue considered determining classification following names represent stepwise pathologic progression natural course adenocarcinoma development adenocarcinoma situ ais minimally invasive adenocarcinoma mia invasive invasive adenocarcinoma lung includes heterogenous mixture subtypes variants consensus describes five subtypes invasive adenocarcinomas based cell pattern predominant subtypes described cell patterns identifying subtypes associated prognosis ranging favorable lepidic intermediate acinar papillary poor micropapillary four discrete variants invasive adenocarcinomas assignable five subtypes also included current classification chest xray radiograph often first imaging test performed person presents cough chest pain particularly primary care setting chest radiograph may detect lung nodulemass suggestive cancer although sensitivity specificity limitedcitation needed ct imaging provides better evaluation lungs higher sensitivity specificity lung cancer compared chest radiograph although still significant false positive computed tomography ct specifically aimed evaluating lung cancer includes chest upper abdomen allows evaluation relevant anatomic structures nearby lymph nodes adrenal glands liver bones may show evidence metastatic spread indeed us preventative services task force recommends annual
