neonatal herpes simplex simply neonatal herpes herpes infection newborn baby caused herpes simplex virus hsv mostly result vertical transmission hsv affected mother types include skin eye mouth herpes sem disseminated herpes dis central nervous system herpes depending type symptoms vary fever small blisters irritability low body temperature lethargy breathing difficulty large abdomen due ascites large may red streaming eyes cause hsv infect unborn baby often passes baby onset typically first six weeks baby greater risk affected mother contracts hsv later scenarios prolonged rupture membranes chilbirth trauma may increase risk globally estimated affect one around every babies united states contract neonatal herpes manifests three forms skin eye mouth herpes sem sometimes referred localized

rare developing countries development specific antibodies usually occurs childhood adolescence precluding later genital infection infections much common countries industrialized nations adolescent seroprevalence dropping steadily last decades resulting increase number young women becoming sexually active seronegative contributed increased genital herpes rates result increased neonatal herpes
