phase differences continuous sound used sound localization certain receptors sensitive certain types stimuli example different mechanoreceptors respond best different kinds touch stimuli like sharp blunt objects receptors send impulses certain patterns send information intensity stimulus example loud sound location receptor stimulated gives brain information location stimulus example stimulating mechanoreceptor finger send information brain finger duration stimulus long lasts conveyed firing patterns receptors impulses transmitted brain afferent neurons sensory systems quiescent state state sensory system converges input welldefined linear timeinvariant system whose input space vector space thus definition point zero also welldefined passive sensory system system operates without needing input power quiescent state state system converges input power always welldefined nonlinear nonpassive sensory organs since cant function without input energy example cochlea passive organ actively vibrates sensory hairs improve sensitivity manifests otoacoustic emissions healthy ears tinnitus pathological still quiescent state cochlea since welldefined mode power input receives vibratory energy eardrum provides unambiguous definition zero input power sensory systems multiple quiescent states depending history like flipflops magnetic material hysteresis also adapt different quiescent states complete darkness retinal cells become extremely sensitive noticeable visual snow caused retinal cells firing randomly without light input brighter light retinal cells become lot less sensitive consequently visual noise quiescent state less welldefined sensory organ controlled systems like dogs ears turn towards front sides brain commands spiders use nets large touchorgan like weaving skin even absence anything falling net hungry spiders may increase web thread tension respond promptly even usually less noticeable less profitable prey small fruit flies creating two different quiescent states things become completely illdefined system connects output input thus evermoving without external input prime example brain default mode network debate exists among neurologists specific number
