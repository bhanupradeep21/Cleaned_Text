human reproduction sexual reproduction results human fertilization produce human offspring typically involves sexual intercourse sexually mature human male sexual intercourse interaction male female reproductive systems results fertilization ovum sperm form normal cells contain chromosomes pairs gamete cells contain single chromosomes two cells merge one zygote cell genetic recombination occurs new zygote contains chromosomes parent giving chromosomes zygote undergoes defined development process known human embryogenesis starts typical gestation period followed childbirth fertilization ovum may achieved artificial insemination methods involve sexual assisted reproductive technology also exists order human reproduction achieved individual must undergone puberty first requiring ovulation females spermarche males occurred prior engaging sexual intercourse achieving pregnancy nonpenetrative means puberty humans infertile genitals lack reproductive function able discharge urine legal factors also play vital role achievement human reproduction minor age consent give legal consent sexual intercourse artificial alternatives reproduction former case liable older party charged statutory rape depending even minors age consent comprehensive sex education advises consenting parties use contraception avoid sexually transmitted diseases early unplannedunwanted pregnancies pregnancy girls age especially discouraged due reproductive systems yet reach full male reproductive system contains two main divisions testicles sperm produced penis discharges sperm semen known ejaculation humans organs outside abdominal cavity testicles outside abdomen facilitates temperature regulation sperm require specific temperatures survive less normal body temperature ie particular extraperitoneal location testicles may result reduction heatinduced contribution spontaneous mutation rate male germinal tissues compared tissues testicles remain close body likely increase temperature harm spermatozoa formation making conception difficult testes carried external scrotum rather within abdomen normally remain slightly cooler body temperature facilitating sperm production female reproductive system likewise contains two main divisions external genitalia vulva internal genitalia ovum meets sperm cell sperm may penetrate merge egg fertilizing help certain hydrolytic enzymes present acrosome fertilization usually occurs oviducts happen uterus zygote becomes implanted lining uterus begins processes embryogenesis morphogenesis fetus developed enough survive outside uterus cervix dilates contractions uterus propel birth canal vagina thereby gives external life newborn infant process called childbirth ova female sex cells much larger spermatozoon normally formed within ovaries female fetus birth mostly fixed location within ovary transit uterus contain nutrients later zygote embryo regular interval known menstrual cycle response hormonal signals process oogenesis matures one ovum released sent fallopian tube fertilized egg flushed system menstruation human reproduction normally begins copulation though may achieved artificial insemination followed nine months pregnancy childbirth pregnancy avoided use contraceptives condoms intrauterine human reproduction naturally takes place internal fertilization sexual intercourse process man inserts erect penis womans vagina either partner initiates rhythmic pelvic thrusts man achieves orgasm leads ejaculation semen containing sperm vaginal canal sperm ovum known gametes containing half genetic information parent created sperm one approximately million sperm typical ejaculation travels vagina cervix uterus fallopian tubes million ejaculated sperm reach fallopian tube egg simultaneously moves fallopian tube away ovary one sperm encounters penetrates fertilizes ovum creating zygote upon fertilization implantation gestation fetus occurs within pregnancy rates sexual intercourse highest menstrual cycle time days days optimal pregnancy chance recommendations sexual intercourse every every studies shown significant difference different sex positions pregnancy rate long results ejaculation alternative natural sexual intercourse exists artificial insemination sperm introduced female reproductive system without insertion also many methods assisted reproductive technology vitro fertilization one egg cells retrieved womans ovaries coincubated sperm outside body resulting embryo reinserted womb womancitation needed pregnancy period time fetus develops dividing via mitosis inside uterus time fetus receives nutrition oxygenated blood mother filtered placenta attached fetus abdomen via umbilical cord drain nutrients quite taxing mother required ingest slightly higher levels calories addition certain vitamins nutrients required greater quantities normal often creating abnormal eating habits gestation period days humans uterus baby first endures brief zygote stage embryonic stage marked development major organs lasts approximately eight weeks fetal stage revolves around development bone cells fetus continues grow estimated couples infertile fecunditity couples around menstrual labor separated stages first stage involves latent phase active phase separated dilation cervix cm second stage pushing stage third stage involves delivery placenta last stage contraction fetus sufficiently developed chemical signals begin process birth begins fetus pushed birthing canal newborn called infant humans typically begin respiration shortly birth long placenta eventually falls person assisting birth may also sever umbilical cord ancient human societies believed sexual intercourse necessary reproduction reasons sex result children mechanism mating produced
