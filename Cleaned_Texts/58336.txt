gene therapy using lentiviral vectors explored early stage trials update phase clinical trial three patients two showed improvement one improvements study concluded investigation warranted use procedure treat lebers congenital early trials used explore treatments including therapeutic use recombinant adenoassociated virus raav vectors many possible viral vectors remain options treatment various genetic disorders retina lead blindness retinal gene therapy using lentivirus vectors may way treat wider range genetic disorders retina various properties lentivirus make attractive alternative raav vectorscitation needed like raav vectors lentiviral vectors offer many features make excellent tool molecular biology possible medical treatments like many vectors commonly used laboratory lentiviral vectors allow efficient transfer foreign dna transgene target cells longlasting stable expression foreign dna generally reduced ability produce immune like many retroviral vectors lentiviral vectors possess original dna content allowing little provocation immune response possible unlike many retroviral vectors though lentiviral vectors offer advantage able successfully introduce transgene target cells whether target cells proliferate many retroviral vectors require replicating dna insert host important consideration application lentiviral vector parent virus gave rise vector lentiviral vectors perfectly suited every application sometimes becomes necessary researcher try work different lentiviral vector one offer desired transgene expression times may necessary use another viral vector altogether options choose lentiviral vectors though many popular lentiviral vectors either human immunodeficiency virus equine infectious anemia virus although lentiviral raav vectors provide high efficiency gene transfer cells vivo raav vectors slight disadvantages would preclude use certain diseases raav vectors example allow genes less kb bases insertion vector many genetic diseases retina genes larger kb length thus allow use raav vectors one disease stargardts disease omim involve mutation atpbinding cassette transporter gene gene contains exons coding region spanning kb thus requires viral vector capable handling relatively large insert lentiviral vectors unlike raav vectors capable efficiently incorporating allowing expression transgene fragments large kb previous work suggests lentiviral vector possible therapeutic option patients stargardts disease see suggest lentiviral vectors efficiently transduce cells vivo well raav vectors transcripts less kb though results lentiviral gene transfer mice indicate gene therapy using lentiviral vectors effective using decision use lentiviral vector versus raav vector may simply matter preference transgene vectors risk causing moderate severe side effects respect immune system lentiviral vectors exception laboratory clinical trials one indication immune reaction vector drop transgene expression often sudden loss transgene expression due simple silencing transgene loss vector cell loss cell body multiple methods targeting ridding cells infected lentivirus falling either activity innate immune system adaptive immune system cases lentiviral vectors immune responses innate immune response tolllike receptors tlrs found many cells recognize particles molecules normally produced retroviruses like genomic dna typically found viruses genomic rna found retroviruses doublestranded rna found still tlrs initiate downstream effects eventually result loss infected cell complications treated patient work researchers suggests interferon may play important role preventing successful infection target cell although researchers suggest treating interferon receptors patient immunosuppressive drugs allow greater response lentiviral vector treatment still little data suggest approach would work expression transgene may cause adaptive immune response addition innate immune response initiated lentivirus transgene produces protein either produced cell normally produces protein great quantity compared normal body may form antibodies specific transgene producing although immune system responses may present hurdles future medical treatments researchers may manage issue different methods lentiviral vectors may offer substantial promise treatment many genetic disorders manifesting retina stargardt diseasecitation needed example involves loss function copies gene known normal healthy retina protein acts isomerase converting alltransretinol visual cycle loss protein results earlyonset retinal degeneration affected patients become swiss researchers used lentiviral vector containing copy human gene control bp fragment human promoter maintain cone visual function mice although appears relatively narrow treatment window birth retinal degeneration becomes severe mice showed expression cone function four months addition functional protein cones helps slow rate visual loss halt reverse damage treatment humans may help prolong functional vision patients diseasecitation needed stargardt disease patients may also one day benefit lentiviral gene therapy unlike raav vectors carry relatively small genes lentiviral vectors carry larger genes making vector choice possible therapy functional copy gene functional stargardt disease patients two copies nonfunctional gene result buildup retinoid compound known believed act like detergent inside cells causing massive cellular buildup photoreceptor cells collects retinal pigment epithelium severe visual loss occurs researchers treated stargardt diseaseaffected mice lentiviral vector containing functional gene buildup retinal pigment epithelium decreased importantly mice regained loss future lentiviral vector
