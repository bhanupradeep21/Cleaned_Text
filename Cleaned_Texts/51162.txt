organizational information theory oit communication theory developed karl weick offering systemic insight processing exchange information within organizations among members unlike past structurecentered theory oit focuses process organizing dynamic informationrich environments given contends main activity organizations process making sense equivocal information organizational members instrumental reduce equivocality achieve sensemaking strategies enactment selection retention framework interdisciplinary nature organizational information theorys desire eliminate ambiguity complexity workplace messaging builds upon earlier findings general systems theory phenomenology general systems theory general systems theory basic premise describes phenomenon cohesive group interrelated parts one part system changed affected affect system whole weick uses theoretical framework influence organizational information theory likewise organizations viewed system related parts work together towards common goal vision applying weicks organizational information theory organizations must work reduce ambiguity complexity workplace maximize cohesiveness efficiency weick uses term coupling describe organizations like system composed interrelated dependent parts coupling looks relationship people work two types coupling loose coupling loose coupling describes people within organization system connected often work together depend one another continue fully complete individual work dependencies weak workflow flexible example whole science department completely shuts teachers sick whatsoever reason school still continue operate departments still tight coupling tight coupling describes connections within organization strong dependent one part organization operating

organizations able plan alter strategies accordance constant need organizing sense making survive successful however notable difference animal evolution survival fittest organizations given animal variation comes mutation nature organization change members alter human organizations exist information environment unlike senders receivers models oit stands situational karl weick views human

accomplish goals current prospective information organization receives differs terms equivocality weick posits numerous feasible interpretations reality exist organizations process varying levels understandability lead different outcomes information academic works scholars tend say messages uncertain ambiguous according oit messages described equivocal believes people proactively exclude

true objective interpretation also weick emphasizes equivocality engine motivates people maitlis christianson states equivocality trigger sensemaking three reasons environment jolts organizational crises threats identity planned change human organizations engage information processing reduce equivocality information based upon first two assumption oit proposes information processing within organizations social activity sharing key feature organizational information particular context members jointly make sense reality reducing words sensemaking joint responsibility includes numerous interdependent people process organizations members combine actions attributions together order find balance complexity thoughts simplicity weick also proposes people create environment though enactment action making sense people different perceptual schemas selective perception people create different information environments creating different information environments people arrive close understanding solution different thought processes overall understanding order place weicks vision regarding organizational information theory proper working context exploring view regarding

organizational information theory provides us robust platform explore communication process literally unfolds important note flow equivocal information organizations constant ongoing organizing process making sense information continuous cycle organizations weick prefers use verbs describing organizations nouns give stationary fixed connotation example instead word management weick would prefer use verb using verbs advocates reflects fluidity sensemaking process changing opposed using nouns nouns reflect stationary fixed entities weick proposing developing organizational information theory weick took social psychological stance notes individual behavior function situation personal traits role definitions therefore people loosely connected organizations large latitude way formalizing phenomenon invites us use metaphor loose coupling order better understand organizations aspects organizations particularly variant kinds connections exist within organizationsthat either
