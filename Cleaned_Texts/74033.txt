patients undergoing intensive provides strong support idea plastic changes brain mechanism recovery occur patients suffering hemiparetic often lose ability stand upright hold posture without ability control posture lose ability move freely voluntarily necessary activities daily living adl studies conducted see sensory stimulation could improve functionality stroke occurs study compared two groups group undergoing standard physical therapy group group given sensory stimulation acupuncture physiotherapy adl training group groups began study within ten days initial stroke group achieved stimulation via traditional chinese acupuncture needles placed according traditional chinese acupuncture points kept place minutes alongside manual stimulation electric stimulation hz also given four ten needles treatment continued four ten days average six half days twentyone patients group mean age mean age group patients group postural recordings could made patients suffered hemiparetic lesion left side lesions right patients group lesion left side right upon testing subjects stood platform heels together arms crossed chests subjects exposed perturbations via vibratory stimulus calf muscles caused anteroposterior movement galvanic stimulation vestibular nerves causing lateral movement three different tests done patients eyes open results study found major differences group control group group treatment group patients treatment group control group able maintain healthy stance perturbations groups treated post stroke symptoms thought perturbations would enhance posture motor movements naturally among subjects survived years hemiparetic stroke treatment group group withheld better postural control furthermore patients additional sensory stimulation comparable acquired values approaching normal agematched healthy subjects postural control measured sensory stimulation tests enhanced least partial recovery postural function years stroke treatment testing deduced improved recovery sensory stimulation accomplished patients regaining near normal dynamics human postural control postural control one important issues rehabilitation stroke thus concluding sensory stimulation obtained study may enhance functional plasticity sensory stimulation therapy developing technique aimed recovering sensory loss strokes restoring losses ageing proven sensory stimulation therapy
