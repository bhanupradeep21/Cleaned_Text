association psychology refers mental connection concepts events mental states usually stems specific associations seen throughout several schools thought psychology including behaviorism associationism psychoanalysis social psychology structuralism idea stems plato aristotle especially regard succession memories carried philosophers john locke david hume david hartley james finds place modern psychology areas memory learning study neural associative learning subject creates relationship stimuli eg auditory visual behavior original stimulus higher concreteness stimulus items likely evoke sensory images function mediators associative learning memory ability learn new information essential daily life thus critical component healthy aging substantial research documenting agingrelated decline forming retrieving episodic memories acquisition associations basis learning seen classical operant conditioningcitation needed edward thorndike research area developed law effect associations stimulus response affected consequence example behaviors increase strength andor frequency followed reward occurs association behavior mental representation reward food conversely receiving negative consequence lowers frequency behavior due negative example would rat cage bar lever pressing lever results food pellet rat learn press lever receive food pressing lever resulted electric shock floor cage rat would learn avoid pressing levercitation needed classical conditioning example learned association classical conditioning process consists four elements unconditioned stimulus ucs unconditioned response ucr conditioned stimulus cs conditioned response without conditioning already relationship unconditioned stimulus unconditioned response second stimulus paired unconditioned stimulus response becomes associated stimuli secondary stimulus known conditioned stimulus elicits conditioned strength response conditioned stimulus increases period learning cs becomes associated ucs strength response diminish cs presented without famous experiment pavlov used unconditioned response dogs salivating sight food ucs paired sound bell cs receiving food later dog salivated cr bell alone indicating association established bell operant conditioning behaviors changed due experienced outcomes behaviors stimuli cause behavior classical conditioning instead associations created stimulus consequence extension thorndike law bf skinner well known studies reinforcers behavior studies included aspect contingency refers connection specific action following consequence skinner described three contingencies positive reinforcement negative reinforcement punishment reinforcements create positive association action consequence order promote continuation action done one two ways positive reinforcers introduce rewarding stimulus whereas negative reinforcers remove aversive stimulus make environment less aversive punishments create negative relationship action consequence action overall content moods compared emotions feelings affects less specific likely provoked stimulus event present studies investigated constituents occurrent experience specific moods like sad angry mood states moods typically defined contrasting emotions several criteria exist distinguishing moods emotions widely shared consensus core differentiating feature moods contrast emotions diffuse watson introduced white fluffy rabbit infant created connection rabbit loud noise experience little albert associated feeling fear acquired equivalence defined learning generalization paradigm prior training stimulus equivalence increases amount generalization two stimuli even superficially dissimilar therefore two different stimuli share consequence predict outcome let us suppose two girls anna sarah nothing common love pets learn sarah dog immediately predict anna love sarah dog area brain responsible acquired equivalence hippocampus hence cases hippocampal region damaged deficits acquired equivalence acquired equivalence stimuli categorized based characteristics physical emotional based functional characteristic preference thing paradigm learned create compositions different categories reason researchers agree acquired equivalence synonym categorization humans nonhumans ability acquired equivalence example acquired equivalence studies geoffrey hall colleagues conducted one study pigeons trained peck see light different colors researchers paired certain colors appear sequence provided food pigeons peck sequences thus pigeons learned sequences peck certainly receive food sequences something special pigeons could also learn certain two colors followed food followed certain one color two colors somewhat equivalent let us assume six colors red green followed yellow led food similarly blue brown followed white also led food way pigeons learned red way equivalent green blue brown paired color next step teach pigeons pecking red alone leads food pecking blue alone point researchers presented pigeons second colors ie green brown paired color ie yellow white first colors also paired ie red blue made colors pairing color ie red green pairing yellow blue brown pairing white equivalent pigeons eyes third step pigeons presented green light brown light researchers surprise pigeons showed quick response strong pecking first color responding second result shows pigeons learned equivalence two colors cooccurring similar consequence one occurrence idea equivalence showed effect pigeons totally different context saw one two colors leading certain consequence believed color would also lead consequence equivalent first pigeons learned generalize one color another history cooccurring memory seems operate sequence associations concepts words opinions intertwined stimuli person face call associated understanding effects mood memory central several issues psychology primary topic theories relation affect cognition moods effect memory may mediate influence mood variety behaviors judgements associated decision making helping person perception understanding relationships different items fundamental episodic memory damage hippocampal region brain found hinder learning associations associations humans measured implicit association test psychological test measures implicit subconscious relation two concepts created anthony g greenwald used investigations subconscious racial bias gender sexual orientation bias consumer preferences political preferences personality traits alcohol drug use mental health test measures associations different ideas race crime reaction time used distinguish associations faster reaction time indicator stronger score used represent participants mean reaction time participants mean
