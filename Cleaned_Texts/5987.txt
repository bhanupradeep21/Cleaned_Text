thermolabile refers substance subject decomposition change response heat term often used describe biochemical example many bacterial exotoxins thermolabile easily inactivated application moderate heat enzymes also thermolabile lose activity temperature rises loss activity toxins enzymes likely due change threedimensional structure toxin protein exposure heat pharmaceutical compounds heat generated grinding may lead degradation thermolabile compounds particular use testing gene done intentionally creating mutants thermolabile growth permissive temperature allows normal protein function increasing temperature permissive temperature ablates activity likely denaturing protein thermolabile enzymes also studied applications dna replication techniques pcr thermostable enzymes necessary proper dna replication enzyme function higher temperatures may enhanced trehalose opens possibility using normally thermolabile enzymes dna biology article stub help wikipedia expanding httpsenwikipediaorgwikithermolabile
