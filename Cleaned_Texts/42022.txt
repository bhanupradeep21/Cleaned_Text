esthesiometer british spelling aesthesiometer device measuring tactile sensitivity skin mouth eye etc measure degree tactile sensitivity called aesthesiometry device invented edward henry sieveking different types aesthesiometers depending particular function simplest manual tool adjustable points similar caliper determine short distance two impressions skin distinguished differentiate two points one point equal area sum areas two points equals area third point dr sidney weinstein created threepoint esthesiometer scale instrument gives readings millimeter gradients another type manual aesthesiometer used test lower thresholds touch pain tool uses nylon monofilaments varying calibrated diameters force needed cause monofilament buckle determines tactile reading filaments calibrated force applied rather pressure ratings sensation follows force stimulated area small von frey hair type aesthesiometer designed maximilian von frey von frey filaments rely principle elastic column compression buckle elastically specific force dependent length diameter modulus material buckled force imparted column fairly constant irrespective degree buckling filaments may therefore used provide range forces skin test subject order find force subject reacts sensation painful type test called mechanical nociceptive threshold test buckling force inversely proportional length column shorter column higher force required buckle proportional cube diameter increasing diameter filament small amount increases buckling force considerably sets normally made nylon hairs length various diameters provide range forces typically grams force grams force von frey filaments diagnostic research screening tool used human animal medicine readily used study skin areas normal responsiveness well hyper hyposensitive areas determination mechanical threshold using von frey filaments requires number discrete tests using filaments different bucking forces two commonly used algorithms updown method percent response method updown method commonly usually requiring minimum four tests first response detected first measurement made filament buckling force close expected mean population errors may result testing commenced long way mean errors evaluated combination experimentation mathematical semmesweinstein aesthesiometer variant weinstein enhanced sensory test west eg westhand present nylon monofilaments approximately length mm varying diameters diameter length used control force applied whereas dr weinstein used numbers reflect force semmesweinsein aesthesiometer digit number equals common log force measured tenths milligram west esthesiometers also created weinstein group use grams eg g describe force smallarea stimulating instruments like west force rather area appropriate measure approximately equal area skin indented heavy light forces see weinstein et al evaluation sensory methods neuropathy tendon nerve surgery third decade hunter et al area stimulation semmesweinstein aestheiometer correctly described area stimulating nylon nylon twists skin pushing sharp edge skin therefore unit descriptive geometry function west esthesiometer bulb contacting tip tip bends presents contacting face nonintrusive device called corneal aesthesiometer used test cornea nerve sensitivity using controlled pulse air stimulation device gives readouts millibars also thermal aesthesiometer used determine sensitivity thermal stimuli weinstein group created airbased corneal esthesiometer using gramforce tens micrograms force also created airbased oral esthesiometer example smokers upper throats much less sensitive nonsmokers httpsenwikipediaorgwikiesthesiometer
