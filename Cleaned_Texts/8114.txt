vegetation subandean forest andean forest subparamo grass paramo located andes plant diversity elevation increased throughout vegetations pollen diversity positively correlated diversity lower findings able see changes plant diversity past years hot temperatures pollen diversity increased higher elevations plant species moving cooler temperatures saw pollen diversity lower elevations study explains temperature influences plant diversity ecoregions hotspot include hotspot identified area great biological diversity high endemism location must also lost significant amount land threatened

amount land reduced million million land leaves great biodiversity limited percent earths land source needed little hotspots recorded used research hotspots include caribbean islands himalaya japan due hotspots great diversity endemic species conservation biology many sources conduct research locations research also needed considering amount threatened species hotspots researchers opportunity preserve many species along habitats within hotspots organizations use hotspots research world conservation monitoring centre birdlife international conservation international world wildlife fund research also done humans impact hotspots land species reside funding hotspot conservation estimated million accumulated past fifteen yearswhen focusing research hotspots many species helped one specific research studies fires impact vegetation northern ecuador tropical andes locations variety vegetation includes different forests land used agricultural p치ramo tropical alpine found meters

lot land compared hotspots largest large land area shows tropical andes provide biodiversity diverse landscape many endemic plant animal species currently threatened tropical andes example threatened plant species andean bromelilad endemic plant takes years mature common diet species forage plant species include many crops tobacco potatoes endemic animals andean condor almost became extinct hunting thanks conservation reintroduction program numbers growing another threatened endemic bird tropical andes yelloweared parrot one threat species faces loss vulnerable wax palm yelloweared parrot uses wax palm nesting roosting however humans especially colombia removing vulnerable wax palm wild palm sunday conservation programs helping situation educate churches use resources besides vulnerable wax palm yellowtailed monkey another endemic animal endangered one rarest mammals recorded population found cloud forests peru threatened humans causing habitat loss fragmentation habitat slow maturity low population densities help programs tried relocate secondary forests attempts failed many species reside tropical andes threatened severely amen sister many threats tropical andes faces every day one main threats human activities especially increasing population activities include mining logging construction humans also use land agriculture keep relocating land used valleys severely degraded due humans living hydroelectric dams also put tropical andes negatively pressured cloud forests percent land protected still poorly managed little help public lack education invasive species also threat tropical andes land species possibly brought humans invasive species include american bullfrog certain grasses used cattle humans ability cause habitat loss habitat fragmentation species forest habitats threatened tropical andes modified destroyed percent faster lower tropical fragmentation causes separation within species decreases diversity genes possibility inbreeding increase well article also looked fragmentation causing certain phenotypes arise organisms studying feathers individual bird species within nine forests observation showed asymmetry linked fragmentation asymmetry lowest forest continued highest small medium suggest asymmetry bird feathers influenced stress fragmentation changing environments one outcome fragmentation tropical andes study niall odea looks bird communities general habitat degradation impacts compared bird communities reside primary forests secondary forests edge habitat agricultural land modified humans diversity found secondary forests edge habitats different species agricultural land primary forest held lowest study suggests within andean montane forests preserving secondary forests offers benefit threatened birds another serious threat tropical andes global warming effect much greenhouse gasses trapped air hold heat locations increasing temperature others decreasing change temperatures major effect tropical andes saywho negative deforestation one serious issue melting glaciers mountains estimated percent freshwater comes mountains melting half earths population world glaciers melting mountains tropical andes susceptible said quarter tropical andes glacier already begun retreating glaciers make many species water supply location could crisis melt away glaciers andes provide two main functions decrease seasonal discharge variability provide greater specific article bryan mark predicts increase discharge glaciers melt ability trace glacier water melting watersheds using global warming lead extinction many species especially hotspots study done jay malcolm predicts less percent percent endemic biota become extinct due global warming also believes tropical andes top six vulnerable hotspots possibility plant extinction exceeding global warming also causing increase diseases among amphibians considering tropical andes recorded amphibians restricted location diseases could decrease diversity greatly another factor amphibian species already threatened deadly fungi actually linked extinction one chytrid fungus infecting amphibians batrachochytrium dendrobatidis fungus impair amphibians skin reduce ability absorb one example amphibian tropical andes genus atelopus species critically endangered due increase temperature fungus ability spread rapidly thrive living amphibians new threat researched effect nitrogen deposition studies done europe shown diversity among plants decreased due nitrogen deposition current models estimating could happen hotspots across world nitrogen deposition keeps increasing comparing past research nitrogen deposition already increased percent since estimation future shows increase percent considering great plant diversity tropical andes especially many endemics nitrogen deposition could severe threat decrease plant diversity could cause chain reaction species depend plants threats tropical andes faces daily basis
