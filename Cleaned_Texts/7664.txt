techniques equipment decreased incidence intra postoperative study compared effects surgery conservative approach calcaneal fractures found significant differences surgical conservative treatment functional ability health related quality life three years reported greater risk major complications surgery update rehabilitation calcaneal fractures dependent whether surgery required types rehabilitation require three phases first phase differentcitation needed exercises used range motion phase include eversion inversion ankle flexion extension ankle combination two motions create circular foot motion exercises allow slight full body weight used final phases include stepping forward back sidestepping leg standcitation needed first phase rehabilitation surgery includes keeping foot elevated iced first days operation days using crutches wheelchair weight applied affected foot recommended getting around operation performed foot submitted frequent range motion second phase occurs weeks consists keeping foot elevated iced resting performing exercises slight weight applied affected area next two weeks others recommend six weeks phase range motion exercises implemented
