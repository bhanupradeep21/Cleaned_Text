first galesaurus specimen originally discovered karoo basin south africa described naturalist sir richard owen owen named specimen galesaurus planiceps incorrectly classified galesaurus new species dinosaur owen assumed galesaurus reptilian skull resembled rhopalodon synapsid also misclassified dinosaur despite classifying galesaurus dinosaur owen noted galesaurus remarkably mammallike owens galesaurus type specimen considerably crushed teeth poorly preserved recently articulated skeletons galesaurus found whose wellpreserved postcranial bones yield better understanding galesaurus morphology considered galesaurus planiceps fossils initially identified glochinodon detinens glochinodontoides gracilis synonymized subjectively galesaurus planiceps galesaurus member clade epicynodontia within infraorder cynodontia ancestor group mammals galesaurus also member family galesauridae includes closest relatives galesaurus cynosaurus gorgonopsidae lycosuchus dvinia procynosuchus cynosaurus progalesaurus galesaurus bolotridon platycraniellus thrinaxodon lumkuia trirachodon cynodont locomotion axial skeleton unlikely flexed extended sagittal plane mammals instead cynodonts believed moved lateral undulation typical axial movement reptiles imbricating coastal plates cynodonts may analogous expanded ribs certain edentates may represent musculoskeletal adaptation adopt characteristically mammalian posture lifting trunk ground cynodonts also believed propulsive movements humerus typical mammal locomotion presence reptile mammal features cynodont locomotion indicative transition two galesaurus often compared thrinaxodon derived basal cynodont thrinaxodon best known galesaurus thrinaxodon also similar morphology early triassic found karoo basin south africa though galesaurus thrinaxodon similar appearance number differences skulls galesaurus zygomatic arch height positive allometry indicates older individuals galesaurus larger developed masseter muscles thrinaxodon development angulation zygomatic arch adult galesaurus indicates superficial masseter muscle also became developed comparison thrinaxodon timing development posterior sagittal crest occurs later galesaurus thrinaxodon posterior sagittal crest develops thrinaxodon late juvenile stage appears adult stage galesaurus adult thrinaxodon develop anterior sagittal crest structure absent galesaurus specimens absence anterior sagittal crest indicates anterior fibers temporalis muscle developed galesaurus thrinaxodon skull width indicates lateral expansion zygomatic arches varies galesaurus thrinaxodon galesaurus positively allometric skull width skull width isometric thrinaxodon indicates galesaurus developed adductor musculature taking differences adductor musculature large medial shift mandible within temporal fenestra hypothesized galesaurus highly developed masseters external occipital crest galesaurus increased growth though absent juvenile thrinaxodon poorly developed adults size external occipital crest indicates enlarged stronger nuchal muscles galesaurus relatively weaker nuchal muscles thrinaxodon galesaurus also larger maximum skull size thrinaxodon presence comparatively thicker peripheral lamellar tissue thrinaxodon excelerated ontogenetic development posterior sagittal crest suggests galesaurus reached sexual maturity later ontogeny galesaurus thrinaxodon undergo changes posterior projection postorbital posterior sagittal crest external occipital crest ontogenetic changes unique galesaurus include large shift relative position mandible
