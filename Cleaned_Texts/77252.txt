heart problems common people hivaids left ventricular dysfunction median survival days compared days people aids healthy hiv major cause cardiomyopathy problems heart muscle reduce efficiency heart pumps blood common type hiv induced cardiomyopathy dilated cardiomyopathy also known eccentric ventricular hypertrophy leads impaired contraction ventricles due volume overload annual incidence hiv associated dilated cardiomyopathy introduction highly active antiretroviral therapy however study found hiv patients dilated cardiomyopathy meaning incidence greatly signs symptoms malabsorption diarrhea respectively may occur hiv infection causing many hiv patients nutritional deficiencies altered levels vitamin carnitine growth thyroid hormones associated left ventricular lowered bmi hiv patients also associated dilated cardiomyopathy due pericardial effusion infective endocarditis especially intravenous drug users common hiv however researched cause cardiomyopathy myocarditis myocardial inflammation infection caused main subtype hiv greater likelihood transmission shorter period infection illness virions infect cardiomyocytes patches direct correlation viral infection dysfunction cardiomyocytes hivrelated cardiomyopathy often associated specific opportunistic infection approximately patients experienced opportunistic infection onset cardiac myocarditis documented autopsy patients died aids introduction toxoplasma gondii common opportunistic infectious agent associated myocarditis aids occurring deaths aids one autopsy myocardial toxoplasmosis causes increase myocardial fraction creatine kinase ckmb situ hybridization polymerase chain reaction studies illustrate high frequency cytomegalovirus aids patients lymphocytic myocarditis severe left ventricular thus supports hypothesis pathogenetic action influences dilated cardiomyopathy coinfection viruses usually coxsackievirus cytomegalovirus seems important effect gisca autopsy records show patients myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy coinfected invades myocardium endothelial cells micropinocytosis infecting perivascular macrophages produce additional virus cytokines tumour necrosis factorα tnfα induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis either signalling entry cardiomyocytes binding ganglioside addition protein gp may induce apoptosis mitochondrioncontrolled pathway activating inflammatory tnfα produced infected macrophages interaction dendritic cells presenting antigen killer causes negative inotropic effect interfering intracellular calcium ion concentrations perhaps inducing synthesis nitric oxide also decreasing intensity stains tnfα inducible nitric oxide synthase inos myocardium greater patients hiv associated cardiomyopathy opposed idiopathic cardiomyopathy myocardial viral infection inversely correlated count antiretroviral therapy effectcitation needed cardiac autoimmunity affects pathogenesis hivrelated heart disease hivinfected patients dilated cardiomyopathy likely cardiacspecific autoantibodies antiαmyosin autoantibodies hivinfected patients healthy hearts hivnegative addition patients echocardiographic evidence left ventricular dysfunction higher chance cardiac autoantibodies furthermore impaired myocardial growth left ventricular dysfunction may immunologically mediated monthly intravenous immunoglobulins ivig hivinfected children reduces left ventricular dysfunction increases left ventricular wall thickness reduces peak left ventricular wall stress perhaps immunoglobulins inhibit cardiac autoantibodies competing fc receptors alternatively immunoglobulins reduce effects secretions cytokines cellular growth hivinfected patients encephalopathy likely die congestive heart failure without encephalopathy hazard ratio cardiomyopathy

damagecitation needed zidovudine example nucleoside analogue shown cause myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy well increase total cholesterol triglycerides ldl hdl insulin protease inhibitors another group drugs eg ritonavir cause range problems lipodystrophy atherosclerosis increase total cholesterol triglyceride hdl ldl insulin resistance amphotericin b cause dilated cardiomyopathy hypertension bradycardia whereas ganciclovir cause ventricular tachycardia interferonalpha cause arrhythmia myocardial mortality hivinfected patients cardiomyopathy increased independently count age sex hiv risk therapy similar therapy nonischemic cardiomyopathy medical therapy begun serial echocardiographic studies performed intervals function continues worsen clinical course deteriorates biopsy haart
