vocal register range tones human voice produced particular vibratory pattern vocal folds registers include modal voice normal voice vocal fry falsetto whistle registers originate laryngeal function occur vocal folds capable producing several different vibratory patterns vibratory patterns appears within particular range pitches produces certain characteristic speech pathology vocal register three components certain vibratory pattern vocal folds certain series pitches certain type sound although view also adopted many vocal pedagogists others define vocal registration loosely sciences using term denote various theories human voice changes subjectively objectively moves pitch many divergent theories vocal registers within vocal pedagogy making term somewhat confusing times controversial within field singing vocal pedagogists may use term vocal register refer manuel garcia ii late nineteenth century one first develop scientific definition registers definition still used pedagogues vocal teachers today another definition clifton ware register consists homogeneous tone qualities produced mechanical system whereas registration process using combining registers achieve artistic singing example skilled singer moves range dynamics smoothly unaware register changes process could described good clean term register originated sixteenth century recognized different voices teachers started notice different ranges either side passaggi breaks voice compared different sets pipes organ clusters pipes called registers term adopted vocal registers arise different vibratory patterns produced vocal cords research speech pathologists vocal pedagogists revealed vocal cords capable producing least four distinct vibratory forms although persons produce first vibratory forms known natural normal another name modal voice widely used speech pathology vocal pedagogy publications usage modal refers natural disposition manner action vocal cords three vibratory forms known vocal fry falsetto whistle four registers vibratory pattern pitch range although overlap characteristic sound arranged pitch ranges covered vocal fry lowest register modal voice next falsetto finally whistle speech pathologists scholars phonetics recognize four registers vocal pedagogists divided indiscriminate use word register led confusion controversy number registers human voice within vocal pedagogical circles controversy exist within speech pathology sciences vocal registers viewed purely physiological standpoint concerned laryngeal function writers concerned art singing state anywhere one seven registers present diversity opinion wide prevailing practice within vocal pedagogy divide men womens voices three registers mens voices designated chest head falsetto womens voices chest middle head way classifying registers however universally accepted many vocal pedagogists blame confusion incorrect use terms chest register head register professionals argue since registers originate laryngeal function meaningless speak registers produced chest head vibratory sensations felt areas resonance phenomena described terms related resonance registers vocal pedagogists prefer terms chest voice head voice term register many problems described register problems actually problems resonance adjustment helps explain multiplicity registers vocal pedagogists information resonance see vocal resonation confusion exists concerning definition number registers due part takes place modal register person sings lowest pitches register highest pitches frequency vibration vocal folds determined length tension mass pitch rises vocal folds lengthened tension increases thickness decreases words three factors state flux transition lowest highest singer holds factors constant interferes progressive state change laryngeal function tends become static eventually breaks occur obvious changes tone quality breaks often identified register boundaries transition areas registers distinct change break registers called passaggio vocal pedagogists teach study singer move effortlessly one register another ease consistent tone registers even overlap singing teachers prefer theory blending registers usually help students passage one register another hiding lift voice changes however many pedagogists disagree distinction boundaries blaming breaks vocal problems created static laryngeal adjustment permit necessary changes take place difference opinion affected different views vocal vocal fry register lowest vocal register produced loose glottal closure permit air bubble popping rattling sound low frequency chief use vocal fry singing obtain pitches low frequency available modal voice register may used therapeutically improve lower part modal register register used often singing male quartet pieces certain styles folk music men women known modal voice usual register speaking singing vast majority done register pitch rises register vocal folds lengthened tension increases edges become thinner welltrained singer speaker phonate two octaves modal register consistent production beauty tone dynamic variety vocal freedom possible singer speaker avoids static laryngeal adjustments allows progression bottom top register carefully graduated continuum falsetto register lies modal voice register overlaps modal register approximately one octave characteristic sound falsetto flutelike overtones present essential difference modal falsetto registers lies amount type vocal cord involvement falsetto voice produced vibration ligamentous edges vocal cords whole part main body fold less relaxed contrast modal voice involves whole vocal cord glottis opening bottom first top falsetto voice also limited dynamic variation tone quality modal whistle register highest register human whistle register called timbre notes produced register similar whistle upper notes flute whereas modal register tends warmer less shrill timbre
