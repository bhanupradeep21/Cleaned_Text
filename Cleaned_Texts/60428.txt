plant appropriate amount enhances enzymatic activity roots hormone functionality increasing overall performance triacontanol basically operates enhancing basic functionality plant like increasing rate photosynthesis producing sugar glucosecitation needed photosynthesis operates efficiently plant produce sugars absorb sunlight plant send sugars rhizosphere via root system growth respiration nutrient exchange take place vicinity availability sugars lead respiration nutrient exchange plants microorganisms soil microbes receive sugars plant increases microbial activity root zone perform efficiently mining nutrients like case nitrogen fixation microorganisms particularly trace nutrients essential soil nutrients used plants build complex nutrients compounds essential rapid growth defence certain microbes complex compoundswhich maximize yield crop overall despite benefits adequate amounts triacontanol effect enhanced photosynthesis may increase plant outcomescitation needed several chemical pathways via triacontanol artificially synthesized one method includes organic compound succinic anhydride carboxylic acid docosanoic acid used attach different carbon chains positions thiophene via two acylation sequences later substituted thiophene reacted desulphurization using raney nickel produces triacontanoic acid reduced lithium aluminium hydride lah produce another method synthesizing triacontanol focuses high yield easily available feasible compounds form triacontanol chemical reactions laboratory settings stearyl alcohol using phase transfer system converted octadecanal hand goes
