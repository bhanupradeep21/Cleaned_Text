nicrosaurus nɪkroʊˈsɔrəs extinct genus phytosaur reptile existing late triassic period although looked like crocodile probably lived like terrestrial crocodylomorphs closely related creatures instead example parallel evolution main difference nicrosaurus phytosaurs modern crocodiles position nostrils nicrosauruss nostrils external nares placed directly front forehead whereas crocodiles nostrils positioned end snout study also found ilium nicrosaurus quite distinctive genus named german paleontologist dr eberhard fraas possibly neckar river southwestern germany near found distinguishing anatomical features nicrosaurus external nares skull roof level dorsoventrally compressed rounded posterior squamosal processes broad heavy rostrum strong prenarial nicrosaurus may terrestrial phytosaurs occurring marginallacustrine outrightly terrestrial settings bears longer limb bones straighter femur deeper pelvis phytosaurs combined unusually deep upper jaw heterodont teeth likely secondarily terrestrial predator probably dissimilar terrestrial crocodilymorphs like nicrosaurus dentition highly heterodont tooth shapes varying wide laterally compressed blade teeth cylindrical recurved caniniform terms jaw morphology full prenarial crest distinctive anatomical feature nicrosaurus kapffi upper lower jaw dentition five morphologically separated arrays teeth tipofsnout set

acetabulum also longer relative phytosaurs compared leptosuchus angle pubis ischium also greater nicrosaurus proximal end humerus resemblance modern crocodiles initially thought phytosaurs also semiaquatic animals slender jaws suggested diet containing fish earlier study explained massive nicrosaurus could also diet consisting large land reptiles came near waters amphibians streams comes phytosaurs inferences ecology comparison modern day crocodilians however genera within phytosaurs may also different ecological preferences case nicrosaurus mystriosuchus biggest distinguishing factor
