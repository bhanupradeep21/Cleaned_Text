societies sororities even small group kinsey would ask president leader group agree interview leaders influence would get initial batch volunteers group second batch want seen volunteering would agree interviewed third batch brought essentially peer participants still volunteers got interviews thus samples would otherwise gotten addition groups though one representative population whole provided random element encouraging greater percent groups made quarter kinseys overall recent researchers also criticized kinseys sampling methods believe overestimated frequency nonheterosexual behaviors attractions kinsey reports show higher frequencies homosexuality modern studies may explained part kinseys interview style focused indepth conversations subjects carried highly trained members team
