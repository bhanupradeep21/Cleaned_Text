adrenalism describes condition excessive substandard secretion hormones related adrenal glands found directly superior adrenalism distinguished hyperadrenalism referring excessive secretion hormones hypoadrenalism referring insufficient secretion hormones symptoms related hyperadrenalism known cushings syndrome caused overproduction corticosteroids aldosterone androgenic steroids symptoms related hypoadrenalism addisons disease caused underproductions hormones listed furthermore adrenalism may caused external factors discussed article adrenal glands produce important hormones specific roles homeostasis body regulated glands hormones include aldosterone mineralocorticoid regulates amount salt tissue body fluids cortisol glucocorticoid regulates metabolism usage macronutrients body sex hormones androgens estrogen promote development secondary sex adrenal glands also produce epinephrine adrenaline norepinephrine production cortisol regulated axis hormones produced axis namely corticotropinreleasing hormone crh adrenocorticotropic hormone acth crh produced hypothalamus stimulates pituitary gland produce acth stimulates adrenal gland produce cortisol negative feedback loop formed high levels cortisol inhibit hormones produced axis production aldosterone regulated via reninangiotensin iialdosterone system system composed baroreceptors juxtaglomerular changes homeostasis human body osmolality detected system causes chain reaction ends adrenal gland either increasing suppressing production hyperadrenalism refers overactivity adrenal glands usually indicated excessive production hormones produced adrenal glands hormones produced regulated range systems body overactivity adrenal glands caused different systemic dysfunctions leading overproduction specific hormones body exposed excess level cortisol generalized symptoms referred cushings syndrome appear however condition may temporary known pseudocushings syndrome pcs therefore important understand cause syndrome differentiate pcs hcm also many causes adrenal adenomas carcinomas causing adrenal gland unresponsive negative feedback loop increase acth production could due pituitary adenoma ectopic acth production tumors growing outside hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis also secrete difference primary hyperaldosteronism secondary hyperaldosteronism lies causation excess aldosterone primary hyperaldosteronism refers overproduction aldosterone adrenal glands secondary hyperaldosteronism refers overactivation raas system primary hyperaldosteronism presents tumor gland known conn syndrome secondary hyperaldosteronism may occur reninproducing tumor edematous disorders affect baroreceptors juxtaglomerular hypoadrenalism adrenal insufficiency condition indicated underproduction hormones related adrenal glands underactivity adrenal gland also caused adrenal glands systemic dysfunctions leading insufficient production hormones classified primary adrenal insufficiency damaged adrenal glands produce hormones secondary adrenal insufficiency pituitary gland produce enough acth stimulate adrenal gland produce important note type adrenal insufficiency affect hormones hypocortisolism caused autoimmune disorders cancer fungal infections tuberculosis infection adrenal glands inherited disorders endocrine gland primary adrenal insufficiency damaged glands unable produce cortisol lack cortisol initiate negative feedback loop cause pituitary gland continue producing acth crh leading symptoms related addisons secondary adrenal insufficiency pituitary gland produce enough acth stimulate production cortisol hypocortisolism lead hypoglycemia hypoaldosteronism occurs primary adrenal insufficiency secondary adrenal insufficiency secondary adrenal insufficiency related pituitary gland ability produce acth hormone regulates production aldosterone adrenal gland however primary adrenal insufficiency caused damage adrenal glands leads underproduction hormones primary adrenal insufficiency causes hypoaldosteronism along hyperaldrenalism also known cushings syndrome often causes remarkable symptoms patients including obesity upper body thin limbs weak skeleton hypertension besides changes physical health patients mental health also affected generally prone anxiety fatigue hand hypoadrenalism often referred addisons disease cause stronger fatigue patients reduction body weight appetite hypotension hypoglycemia nausea also treatment adrenalism varies surgery radiotherapy medications choices therapy depend cause adrenalism listed descending order invasiveness treatment patient general idea treatment replenish lowered cortisol level direct supplement increasing production level cortisol human body case hypoadrenalism reduce cortisol level killing suppressing adrenal gland case hyperadrenalism medical practitioners usually recommend surgical treatment adrenalism caused tumors since one direct ways cure disease permanently solid tumor overstimulating suppressing normal function adrenal glands surgeons locate tumor remove using traditional surgical method tumor found pituitary gland neurosurgeons would perform surgery either craniotomy skull opened whole pituitary gland exposed tumor cleaning microsurgery surgical tools placed brain nasal cavity microscopes used locate tumor removed positive aspect undergoing adrenal surgery still currently fastest solution adrenalism permanently cure disease disadvantage side removing adrenal gland patients would need undergo cortisol replacement medication months lifelong restore bodys normal hormone level well risk invasive surgery radiotherapy also prompt option treating adrenalism employed standard surgery work tumors patient suitable surgery therapy useful treating earlystage adrenalism caused cancer effectively penetrate small cancer cells across large area result still effective situations cancers spread normal adrenal levels usually restored within weeks common ways treat adrenalism radiation namely conventional external beam stereotactic radiosurgery former administers high dose radiation around gland aiming destroy reduce size tumor kill cell directly inhibiting cellular proliferation cells exposure radiation hand stereotactic radiosurgery utilizes series gamma radiation precisely adrenal gland induce cell death greatly lowering side effect therapy surrounding organs damaging neighboring cells normal functions leading hormonal dysregulation however postsurgical followups neurological impact high risk cell mutations recorded since ionizing radiation employed stereotactic radiotherapy physicians usually recommend medications patients whose adrenalism caused cancer since chemotherapy proven common use medications include drugs suppress cortisol production adrenal gland inhibiting hydroxylase ketoconazole metyrapone fall drug besides mediating function adrenal glands medications may also given destroy gland internally hyperadrenalism lower hormone levels mitotane administered promote apoptosis adrenal gland downregulation enzymes accumulation free cholesterol direct cell oxidation rapidly causing permanent cell death moreover doctors may prescribe hydrocortisone prednisolone patients hormone replacement therapy replenish depleted adrenal level patients addisons benefits medications noninvasive risk treatment greatly lowered hand downsides medications low therapeutic effectiveness relatively longer time required illustrate therapeutic effect moreover past experiences observe side effects medication including vomiting muscle pain hypertension hypokalemia httpsenwikipediaorgwikiadrenalism
