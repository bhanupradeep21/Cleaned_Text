laryngeal papillomatosis also known recurrent respiratory papillomatosis rrp glottal papillomatosis rare medical condition benign tumors papilloma form along aerodigestive two variants based age onset juvenile adult laryngeal tumors caused human papillomavirus hpv infection throat tumors may lead narrowing airway may cause vocal changes airway laryngeal papillomatosis initially diagnosed indirect laryngoscopy upon observation growths larynx confirmed treatment laryngeal papillomatosis aims remove papillomas limit due recurrent nature virus repeated treatments usually laryngeal papillomatosis primarily treated surgically though supplemental nonsurgical andor medical treatments may considered evolution laryngeal papillomatosis highly though total recovery may observed often persistent despite number new cases laryngeal papillomatosis cases approximately cases per children cases per adults common symptom laryngeal papillomatosis change voice quality specifically hoarseness consequence narrowing laryngeal tracheal parts airway shortness breath chronic cough stridor ie noisy breathing sound like whistle snore disease progresses occurrence secondary symptoms dysphagia pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome failure thrive recurrent upper respiratory infections risk laryngeal papillomatosis spreading lungs higher juvenileonset children symptoms usually severe often mistaken manifestations diseases asthma croup bronchitis therefore diagnosis usually laryngeal papillomatosis caused human papillomavirus hpv infection frequently types although genotypes also associated aggressive forms papillomatosis may involve distal parts tracheobronchial mode viral inoculation hypothesized vary according age disease presence hpv respiratory tract necessarily result development laryngeal papillomatosis factors could involved include immunodeficiency similar infections example laryngeal papillomatosis may become aggressive due presence certain viruses eg herpes simplex virus disease occurs two forms juvenile adult papillomatosis based whether develops years juvenile form generally transmitted contact mothers infected vaginal canal less known transmission adult form disease though oral sex implicated potential mode however uncertain whether oral sex would directly transmit activate dormant virus transmitted general physicians unsure certain people exposed hpv types implicated disease develop laryngeal papillomatosis case juvenile form disease likelihood child born infected mother developing laryngeal papillomatosis low even mothers infection risk factors higher likelihood transmission childbirth include first birth vaginal birth teenaged three major risk factors affect acquisition juvenile variant laryngeal papillomatosis diagnosed visualization lesions using one several indirect laryngoscopy indirect laryngoscopy tongue pulled forward laryngeal mirror rigid scope passed mouth examine another variation indirect laryngoscopy involves passing flexible scope known fiberscope endoscope nose throat visualize larynx procedure also called flexible fiberoptic appearance papillomas described multiple rarely single white growths lumpy texture similar papillomas usually present larynx especially vocal folds space vocal folds called spread parts larynx throughout aerodigestive tract mouth lower respiratory spread regions beyond larynx common children growths tend located normal junctions squamous ciliated epithelium tissue junctions arising confirmatory diagnosis laryngeal papillomatosis obtained biopsy involving microscopic examination hpv testing sample biopsy samples collected general anesthesia either direct laryngoscopy fiberoptic little known terms effective means prevention mother infected hpv hpv vaccination prevent infections mother thereby eliminate possibility virus infecting due low likelihood transmission even infected mother recommended expose mother child additional risks caesarean section prevent transmission disease vaginal opting caesarean section guarantee transmission still permanent cure laryngeal papillomatosis treatment options aimed remove limit recurrence repeated treatments often needed recurrent nature virus especially children juvenile form laryngeal papillomatosis often triggers aggressive relapses adult recurrences voice therapy may used restore maintain persons voice first line treatment surgery remove typically performed using laryngeal endoscopy surgery protect intact tissues individuals voice well ensure airway remains unobstructed however surgery prevent recurrences lead number serious laser technology carbon dioxide laser surgery particular used since removal papillomas however laser surgery without risks associated higher occurrence respiratory tract burns stenosis severe laryngeal scarring tracheoesophagyeal tracheotomies offered aggressive cases multiple debulking surgery failures led airways tracheotomies use breathing tubes reroute air around affected area thereby restoring persons breathing function although intervention usually temporary people must use tube method avoided possible since breathing tube may serve conduit spread disease far tracheobronchial microdebrider tool suction tissue blade cuts tissue microdebriders gradually replacing laser technology treatment choice laryngeal papillomatosis due ability selectively suction papillomas relatively sparing unaffected addition lower risk complications microdebrider surgery also reportedly less expensive less timeconsuming likely give person better voice quality traditional laser surgery people surgery sufficient control laryngeal papillomatosis additional nonsurgical andor medical treatments treatments alone sufficient cure laryngeal papillomatosis considered supplemental varieties nonsurgical treatments include interferon antiviral drugs especially cidofovir also ribavirin acyclovir photodynamic monoclonal antibody vascular endothelial growth factor vegf bevacizumab shown promising result adjuvant therapy management recurrent respiratory although vaccines normally used prevent infections happening hpv vaccines used therapeutically infection patients hpv vaccine significantly increases length time needed evolution laryngeal papillomatosis highly unpredictable characterized modulation severity variable rate progression across
