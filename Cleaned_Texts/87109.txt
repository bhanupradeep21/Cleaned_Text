close relationships frequently referred back one harold kelley colleagues book close asserts close relationship one strong frequent diverse interdependence lasts considerable period time kelley et al p definition indicates even personal relationships may considered close close relationships include family relationships eg parentchild siblings grandparentgrandchild inlaws etc defines relationship

theory focuses drawbacks rewards found directly behavior interactions eg distant vs displays affection opposed broad costs context close intimate relationships emphasizes partners behaviors eg

science relied variety methods data collection includes limited crosssectional data longitudinal data selfreport study observational study experimental study repeated measures design mixedmethods relationship science relies predominantly individuals selfreported evaluations descriptions relationship method data collection often comes form answering questionnaire requires either selection set fixed responses providing openended often simplest way study relationships researchers cautioned solely relying form issues arise use selfreport data difficulty accurately answering retrospective questions questions require recently particularly light antifalse positive movement psychology relationship scientists encouraging use multiple methods eg selfreport data observational data study similar constructs different however identified benefit using specifically selfreport questionnaires many measures used study relationships standardized therefore used multiple different studies findings across studies provide insight earliest studies conducted relationship science done using laboratory field since used experimental methods order infer causality relationship phenomenon requires identification dependent variable measured effect eg performance stressful task independent variable manipulated eg social support vs social however common concern experimental study relationship phenomena potential lack generalizability laboratory setting findings realworld observational behavioral data relationship science method making inferences relationship processes relies observers reports rather participants reports often done videotaping audio recording participants interactions one another outside observers systematically identify ie code aspects interest dependent
