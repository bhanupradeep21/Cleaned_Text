fecal impaction impacted bowel solid immobile bulk feces develop rectum result chronic related term fecal loading refers large volume stool rectum fecal impaction common result neurogenic bowel dysfunction causes immense discomfort pain treatment includes laxatives enemas pulsed irrigation evacuation pie well digital removal condition resolves without direct treatment symptoms fecal impaction include following complications may include necrosis ulcers rectal tissue untreated cause death many possible causes include long period physical inactivity failure consume adequate dietary fiber dehydration deliberate retention fecal matter medications fentanyl buprenorphine methadone codeine oxycodone hydrocodone morphine hydromorphone well certain sedatives reduce intestinal movement may cause fecal matter become large hard andor dry expel specific conditions irritable bowel syndrome certain neurological disorders paralytic ileus gastroparesis diabetes enlarged prostate gland distended colon ingested foreign object inflammatory bowel diseases crohns disease colitis autoimmune diseases amyloidosis celiac disease lupus scleroderma cause fecal impaction hypothyroidism also cause chronic constipation sluggish slower weaker colon contractions iron supplements increased blood calcium levels also potential causes spinal cord injury common cause constipation due ileus reducing opiatebased medication possible tolerable safe prescription medication changes done supervision physician adequate intake liquids water dietary fiber daily treatment fecal impaction requires remedy impaction treatment prevent recurrences decreased motility colon results dry hard stools case fecal impaction become compacted large hard mass stool expelled rectum various methods treatment attempt remove impaction softening stool lubricating stool breaking pieces small enough removal enemas osmotic laxatives used soften stool increasing water content stool soft enough expelled osmotic laxatives magnesium citrate work within minutes eight hours onset action even may sufficient expel stool osmotic laxatives cause cramping even severe pain patients attempts evacuate contents rectum blocked fecal mass polyethylene glycol peg may used increase water content stool without crampingcitation needed may take hours however well suited cases impaction needs removed immediately due risk complications severe pain enemas hyperosmotic saline suppositories glycerine suppositories work increasing water content stimulating peristalsis aid expulsion work much quickly oral laxatives enemas work minutes allow sufficient time large fecal mass soften even enema successful dislodging impacted stool impacted stool may remain large expelled anal canal mineral oil enemas assist lubricating stool easier passage cases enemas fail remove impaction polyethylene glycol used attempt soften mass hours immediate removal mass needed manual disimpaction may used manual disimpaction may performed lubricating anus using one gloved finger scooplike motion break fecal mass often manual disimpaction performed without general anaesthesia although sedation may used involved procedures general anaesthesia may used although use general anaesthesia increases risk damage anal sphincter treatments fail surgery may necessary another treatment method makes use enema manual disimpaction via pulsed irrigation evacuation pie using pulsating water enter colon soften break dense mass pie treats fecal impaction individuals one fecal impaction high risk future impactionscitation needed therefore preventive treatment instituted patients following removal mass increasing dietary fiber increasing fluid intake exercising daily attempting regularly defecate every morning eating promoted patientscitation needed often underlying medical conditions cause fecal impactions conditions treated reduce risk future impactions many types medications notably opioid pain medications codeine reduce motility colon increasing likelihood fecal impactions possible alternate medications prescribed avoid side effect constipationcitation needed given opioids cause recommended patient placed opioid pain medications given medications prevent constipation occurs daily medications also used promote normal motility colon soften stools daily use laxatives enemas avoided individuals cause loss normal colon motility however patients chronic complications daily medication direction physician may needed polyethylene glycol taken daily soften stools without significant risk adverse effects common laxatives particular stimulant laxatives used frequently cause dependence individual loses normal colon function unable defecate without taking frequent use osmotic laxatives avoided well cause electrolyte imbalances research shows pulsed irrigation evacuation pie med device successful tested patients studies making pulsed irrigation evacuation effective reliable form fecal impaction fecaloma extreme form fecal impaction giving accumulation appearance fecaloma develop fecal matter gradually stagnates accumulates intestine increases volume intestine becomes may occur chronic obstruction stool transit chronic constipation diseases chagas disease hirschsprungs disease others damage autonomic nervous system colons mucosa auerbachs plexus may cause extremely large giant fecalomas must surgically removed disimpaction rarely fecalith form around hairball trichobezoar absorbent desiccant core diagnosed distal sigmoid fecalomas often disimpacted digitally catheter carries flow disimpaction fluid water solvent lubricant surgical intervention form sigmoid proctocolectomy may required conservative measures evacuation fail attempts removal severe even lethal effects rupture colon wall catheter acute angle fecaloma stercoral perforation followed sepsis may also lead stercoral perforation condition characterized bowel perforation due pressure necrosis fecal
