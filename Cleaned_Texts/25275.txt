savaging term used study ethology refers aggressive behaviour displayed mother towards offspring aggressive behaviour includes rough injuring biting attacking crushing killing maternal infanticide offspring savaging behaviour seen multiple species predominantly demonstrated domestic pigs sus scrofa domesticus definition savaging broad research prevalence savaging behaviour varies reports little
