academy sciences showed point masses also minimise action point masses bodies treated purposes analysis certain amount matter mass concentrated single point major debate early part eighteenth century concerned behaviour bodies collisions cartesian newtonian physicists argued collisions point masses conserved momentum relative velocity leibnizians hand argued also conserved called live force vis
