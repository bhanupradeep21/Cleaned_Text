disease alzheimers patients demonstrate comparable abilities encode information healthy elderly adults suggesting impairments encoding associated however seen korsakoffs patients confabulation alzheimers patients higher prompted questions investigating episodic memory researchers suggest due damage posterior cortical regions brain symptom characteristic alzheimers disease schizophrenia psychological disorder confabulation sometimes observed although confabulation usually coherent presentation confabulations schizophrenic patients often researchers noted patients tend make delusions spot often fantastic become increasingly elaborate unlike patients korsakoffs alzheimers patients schizophrenia likely confabulate prompted questions regarding semantic memories opposed episodic memory addition confabulation appear related memory deficit schizophrenic patients contrary forms confabulation also confabulations made schizophrenic patients often involve creation new information instead involve attempt patient reconstruct actual details past event traumatic brain injury tbi also result confabulation research shown patients damage inferior medial frontal lobe confabulate significantly patients damage posterior area healthy suggests region key producing confabulatory responses memory deficit important necessary confabulation additionally research suggests confabulation seen patients frontal lobe syndrome involves insult frontal lobe result disease traumatic brain injury finally rupture anterior posterior communicating artery subarachnoid hemorrhage encephalitis also possible causes confabulation believed result damage right frontal lobe particular damage localized ventromedial frontal lobes structures fed anterior communicating artery acoa including basal forebrain septum fornix cingulate gyrus cingulum anterior hypothalamus head caudate recent literature suggested older adults may susceptible younger counterparts false memories majority research forced confabulation centers around children particularly susceptible forced confabulations based high forced recall confabulated events children less likely remember previously confabulated situations likely adult counterparts come remember confabulations real events research suggests inability distinguish past confabulatory real events centered developmental differences source monitoring due underdeveloped encoding critical reasoning skills childrens ability distinguish real memories false memories may impaired may also younger children lack metamemory processes required remember confabulated versus nonconfabulated childrens metamemory processes may also influenced expectancies biases believe highly plausible false scenarios however knowingly tested accuracy children likely respond dont know rate comparable adults unanswerable questions ultimately misinformation effects minimized tailoring individual interviews specific developmental stage often based age evidence support different cognitive mechanisms provoked spontaneous one study suggested spontaneous confabulation may result amnesic patients inability distinguish chronological order events memory contrast provoked confabulation may compensatory mechanism patient tries make memory deficiency attempting demonstrate competency recollection confabulation events situations may lead eventual acceptance confabulated information instance people knowingly lie situation may eventually come believe lies truthful interview setting people likely confabulate situations presented false information another person opposed selfgenerate people likely accept false information true interviewed later time event question interviewed immediately soon affirmative feedback confabulated responses also shown increase confabulators confidence instance culprit identification witness falsely identifies member lineup confident identification interviewer provides affirmative feedback effect confirmatory feedback appears last time witnesses even remember confabulated information months rare occasions confabulation also seen normal currently unclear completely healthy individuals produce confabulations possible individuals process developing type organic condition causing confabulation symptoms uncommon however general population display mild symptoms provoked confabulations subtle distortions intrusions memory commonly produced normal subjects remember something poorly spontaneous confabulations due involuntary nature manipulated laboratory however provoked confabulations researched various theoretical contexts mechanisms found underlie provoked confabulations applied spontaneous confabulation mechanisms basic premise researching confabulation comprises finding errors distortions memory tests individual confabulations detected context paradigm using participants listen audio recordings several lists words centered around theme known critical word participants later asked recall words list participant recalls critical word never explicitly stated list considered confabulation participants often false memory critical word confabulations also researched using continuous recognition tasks often used conjunction confidence ratings generally recognition task participants rapidly presented pictures pictures shown others shown multiple times participants press key seen picture previously following period time participants repeat task errors second task versus first indicative confusion representing false memories confabulations also detected using free recall task selfnarrative participants asked recall stories semantic autobiographical highly familiar stories recalled encoded errors could classified distortions memory distortions could include falsifying true story elements including details completely different story errors would indicative confabulations treatment confabulation somewhat dependent cause source identifiable example treatment syndrome involves large doses vitamin b order reverse thiamine known physiological cause general cognitive techniques may used treat confabulation case study published showed selfmonitoring training reduced delusional confabulations furthermore improvements maintained threemonth followup found generalize everyday settings although treatment seems promising rigorous research necessary determine efficacy smt general confabulation population although significant gains made understanding confabulation recent years still much learned one group researchers particular laid several important questions future study suggest information needed regarding neural systems support different cognitive processes necessary normal source monitoring also proposed idea developing standard neuropsychological test battery able discriminate different types confabulations considerable amount debate regarding best approach organizing combining neuroimaging pharmacological cognitivebehavioral approaches understand recent review article another group researchers contemplate issues concerning distinctions delusions confabulation question whether delusions confabulation considered distinct overlapping disorders overlapping degree also discuss role unconscious processes confabulation researchers suggest unconscious emotional motivational processes potentially important cognitive memory problems finally raise
