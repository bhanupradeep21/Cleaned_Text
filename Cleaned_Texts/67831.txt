needed genes commonly mutated aldosterone producing adenomas aldosterone effects cells body clinically important actions kidney cells late distal convoluted tubule medullary collecting duct principal cells aldosterone increases activity basolateral membrane sodiumpotassium atpase apical epithelial sodium channels enac well potassium channels romk actions increase sodium reabsorption potassium secretion since sodium reabsorbed potassium secreted also makes lumen electrically negative causing chloride follow sodium water follows sodium chloride osmosis conn syndrome actions cause increased extracellular sodium fluid volume reduced extracellular potassium aldosterone also acts intercalated cells stimulate apical proton atpase causing proton secretion acidifies urine alkalizes extracellular fluidcitation needed summary hyperaldosteronism causes hypernatremia hypokalemia metabolic finer notes aldosterone include fact stimulates sodiumpotassium atpase muscle cells increasing intracellular potassium also increases sodium reabsorption along intestine nephron possibly due widespread stimulation sodiumpotassium atpase finally epithelial cells sweat gland ducts distal colon surface respond exactly principal cells nephron responses important climate adaptation cause constipation elevated aldosteronecitation needed sodium retention leads plasma volume expansion elevated blood pressure increased blood pressure lead increased glomerular filtration rate cause decrease renin released granular cells juxtaglomerular apparatus kidney decreasing sodium reabsorption returning sodium renal excretion near normal levels allowing sodium escape effect mineralocorticoids also known aldosterone escape mechanism primary hyperaldosteronism also contributed increased anp level primary hyperaldosteronism decreased renin subsequent decreased angiotensin ii lead decrease aldosterone levels helpful clinical tool diagnosis primary screening may considered people high blood
