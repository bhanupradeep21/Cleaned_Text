polyoxyethylene poe depending molecular weight structure peg commonly expressed peg considered biologically inert safe us fda however growing body evidence shows existence detectable level antipeg antibodies approximately population never treated pegylated drugs based plasma samples explanation needed due ubiquity multitude products large percentage population antibodies peg hypersensitive reactions peg increasing allergy peg usually discovered person diagnosed allergy increasing number seemingly unrelated products including processed foods cosmetics drugs substances contain peg manufactured peg peo poe refer oligomer polymer ethylene oxide three names chemically synonymous historically peg preferred biomedical field whereas peo prevalent field polymer chemistry different applications require different polymer chain lengths peg tended refer oligomers polymers molecular mass gmol peo polymers molecular mass gmol poe polymer molecular pegs prepared polymerization ethylene oxide commercially available wide range molecular weights gmol peg peo liquids lowmelting solids depending molecular weights peg peo different molecular weights find use different applications different physical properties eg viscosity due chain length effects chemical properties nearly identical different forms peg also available depending initiator used polymerization process common initiator monofunctional methyl ether peg methoxypolyethylene glycol abbreviated mpeg lowermolecularweight pegs also available purer oligomers referred monodisperse uniform discrete highpurity peg recently shown crystalline allowing determination crystal structure xray since purification separation pure oligomers difficult price type quality often fold polydisperse peg pegs also available different geometries numbers often included names pegs indicate average molecular weights eg peg n would average molecular weight approximately daltons would labeled peg pegs include molecules distribution molecular weights ie polydisperse size distribution characterized statistically weight average molecular weight mw number average molecular weight mn ratio called polydispersity index đm
