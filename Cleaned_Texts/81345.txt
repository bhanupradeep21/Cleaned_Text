grandmother hypothesis hypothesis explain existence menopause human life history identifying adaptive value extended kin networking builds previously postulated mother hypothesis states mothers age costs reproducing become greater energy devoted activities would better spent helping offspring reproductive suggests redirecting energy onto offspring grandmothers better ensure survival genes younger generations providing sustenance support kin grandmothers ensure genetic interests met also enhance social networks could translate better immediate resource effect could extend past kin larger community networks benefit wider group one explanation presented gc williams first menopause might adaptation williams suggested point became advantageous women redirect reproductive efforts increased support existing offspring since females dependent offspring would die soon argued older mothers stop producing new offspring focus existing would avoid agerelated risks associated reproduction thereby eliminate potential threat continued survival current offspring evolutionary reasoning behind driven related theories kin selection provides framework adaptive strategy altruistic behavior bestowed closely related individuals easily identifiable markers exist indicate likely reciprocate kin selection implicit theories regarding successful propagation genetic material reproduction helping individual likely share ones genetic material would better ensure survival least portion hamiltons rule suggests individuals preferentially help related costs minimal modeled mathematically r b c displaystyle rbc grandmothers would therefore expected forgo reproduction benefits helping individuals b multiplied relatedness individual r outweighed costs grandmother reproducing c evidence kin selection emerged correlated climatedriven changes around million years ago female foraging food sharing adjustments increased juvenile dependency forcing mothers opt lowranked common food source tubers required adult skill harvest demands constrained female ibis inter birth intervals thus providing opportunity selection favor grandmother hypothesis parental investment originally put forth robert trivers defined benefit parent confers offspring cost ability invest theory serves explain dynamic sex difference investment toward offspring observed species evident first gamete size eggs larger far energetically expensive sperm females also much sure genetic relationship offspring birth serves reliable marker relatedness paternity uncertainty males experience makes less likely females invest since would costly males provide sustenance another males offspring translates grandparental generation grandmothers much likely grandfathers invest energy offspring children offspring daughters sons evolutionary theory dictates organisms invest heavily reproduction order replicate genes according parental investment human females invest heavily young number mating opportunities available many offspring able produce given amount time fixed biology sex inter birth interval ibi limiting factor many children woman extended developmental period human children experience extended childhood like extended postreproductive lifespan females unique correlation human grandmothers wellpoised provide supplemental parental care offsprings children since grandchildren still carry portion genes still grandmother genetic interest ensure children survive reproduction mismatch rates degradation somatic cells versus gametes human females provides unsolved paradox somatic cells decline slowly humans invest somatic longevity relative since natural selection much stronger influence younger generations deleterious mutations later life become harder select female placentals number ovarian oocytes fixed embryonic development possibly adaptation reduce accumulation mature degrade life course birth typically one million ova however menopause approximately eggs would actually humans rate follicular atresia increases older ages around reasons chimpanzees closest nonhuman genetic relatives similar rate oocyte atresia age point humans experience far accelerated rate compared however chimpanzee females unlike humans usually die still reproductive aging process humans leaves dilemma females live past ability reproduce question poised evolutionary researchers becomes human bodies live robustly long past reproductive potential could adaptive benefit abandoning ones attempts reproduction assist kin practice dividing parenting responsibilities among nonparents affords females great advantage dedicate effort energy toward increased number offspring practice observed several especially successful strategy humans rely extensively social networks one observational study aka foragers central africa demonstrated allomaternal investment toward offspring increased specifically times mothers investment subsistence economic activities grandmother effect true postmenopausal women continue work cessation fertility use proceeds preferentially provision kin studies hadza women provided evidence modern huntergatherer group tanzania postmenopausal hadza women often help grandchildren foraging food staples younger children inefficient acquiring children therefore require assistance adult gain crucial version sustenance often however mothers inhibited care younger offspring less available help older children regard hadza grandmothers become vital care existing grandchildren allow reproductiveage women redirect energy existing offspring younger offspring reproductive efforts however commentators felt role hadza men contribute mean daily intake protein though authors addressed criticism numerous studies also demonstrated reservations behavioral similarities hadza grandmothers expected provide preferential treatment offspring certain relationship differences help provides grandchild according relationship studies found maternal paternal relationship grandparent affect whether much help grandchild receives also kind help paternal grandmothers often detrimental effect infant also maternal grandmothers concentrate offspring survival whereas paternal grandmothers increase birth finding consistent ideas parental investment paternity uncertainty equally grandmother could maternal paternal grandmother thus division resources daughter offspring favored studies focused genetic relationship grandmothers grandchildren studies found effects maternal paternal grandmothers grandsons granddaughters may vary based degree genetic relatedness paternal grandmothers positive effects granddaughters detrimental effects paternity uncertainty may less important chromosome critics cast doubt hypothesis addresses grandparental care could maintained longer female postreproductive lifespans provide explanation would evolved first place versions grandmother hypothesis asserted helped explain longevity human senescence however demographic data shown historically rising numbers older people among population correlated lower numbers younger suggests point grandmothers helpful toward survival grandchildren explain first grandmother would forgo reproduction help offspring grandchildren addition variations mother grandmother effect fail explain longevity continued spermatogenesis males another problem concerning grandmother hypothesis requires history female philopatry though studies suggest huntergatherer societies mounting evidence shows residence fluid among married women least one patrilineal society visit kin times kinbased support especially beneficial womans reproductive one study suggest however maternal kin essential fitness sons fathers patrilocal also fails explain detrimental effects losing ovarian follicular activity continued postmenopausal synthesis estrogen occurs peripheral tissues adrenal women undoubtedly face increased risk conditions associated lower levels estrogen osteoporosis osteoarthritis alzheimers disease coronary artery however crosscultural studies menopause found menopausal symptoms quite variable among different populations populations females recognize may even experience high level variability menopausal symptoms across populations brings question plausibility menopause sort culling agent eliminate nonreproductive females competition younger fertile members species also faces task explaining paradox typical age menopause onset life expectancy female humans httpsenwikipediaorgwikigrandmotherhypothesis
