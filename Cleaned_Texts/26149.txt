cranial kinesis term significant movement skull bones relative addition movement joint upper lower jaws usually taken mean relative movement upper jaw vertebrates form kinetic cranial kinesis lack thereof usually linked feeding animals must exert powerful bite forces crocodiles often rigid skulls little kinesis maximum strength animals swallow large prey whole snakes grip awkwardly shaped food items parrots eating nuts often feed water via suction feeding often kinetic skulls frequently numerous mobile joints case mammals akinetic skulls except perhaps hares lack kinesis likely related secondary palate prevents relative turn consequence need able create suction suckling ancestry also plays role limiting enabling cranial kinesis significant cranial kinesis rare mammals human skull shows cranial kinesis birds varying degrees cranial kinesis parrots exhibiting greatest degree among reptiles crocodilians turtles lack cranial kinesis lizards possess often minor degree kinesis

neurokinesis iordansky movement braincase palate basipterygoid joint first example cranial kinesis chondrichthyans sharks attachment hyomandibular quadrate instead hyoid arch suspends two sets jaws like pendulums allows sharks swing jaws outwards forwards prey allowing synchronous meeting jaws avoiding deflecting prey comes close actinopterygii ray finned fish possess huge range kinetic mechanisms general trend phylogenetic trees tendency liberate bony elements allow greater skull motility actinopts use kinesis rapidly expand buccal cavity create suction suction feeding early dipnoi lungfishes upper jaws fused braincase implies feeding hard substrates many crossopterygian fishes kinesis also early tetrapods inherited much suction feeding ability crossopterygian ancestors skulls modern lissamphibians greatly simplified many bones fused otherwise reduced mobility premaxilla snout allowing amphibians open close nasal caecilians gap parietal bone squamosal bone enables skull
