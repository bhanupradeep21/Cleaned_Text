autoimmune urticaria also known chronic autoimmune urticaria type chronic urticaria characterized presence autoantibodies patients immune system target bodys mast cells leading episodes hives immunologically distinct type urticaria considered autoimmune immune system normally protects body foreign organisms mistakenly attacks bodys cells causing inflammation condition chronic meaning persists six weeks last many symptoms include recurrent episodes hives red itchy swollen areas skin episodes triggered various factors including heat stress identifiable autoimmune urticaria relatively rare condition affecting small percentage however significantly impact quality life affected due unpredictability discomfort exact cause autoimmune urticaria fully understood believed involve complex interplay genetic environmental diagnosis typically based clinical history physical examination confirmed laboratory treatment primarily involves managing symptoms includes use antihistamines corticosteroids monoclonal antibodies omalizumab cases immunosuppressive despite ongoing research many aspects autoimmune urticaria remain poorly understood continues challenging condition manage economic burden significant costs high per year per patient united urticaria commonly known hives recognized medical condition centuries descriptions characteristic skin lesions appearing ancient medical texts however understanding urticaria autoimmune condition relatively recent development medical term autoimmune urticaria refers subset chronic spontaneous urticaria csu cases immune system appears play significant role understanding began evolve mid late century advances immunology revealed complex interactions immune system various concept autoimmunity bodys immune system attacks cells widely accepted understanding immune system role disease evolved researchers began explore possibility cases chronic urticaria could driven autoimmune first article discussed urticaria type hypersensitivity researchers discovered significant proportion patients csu circulating autoantibodies particularly highaffinity ige receptor fcεri ige autoantibodies found capable activating mast cells basophils key effector cells urticaria leading release histamine inflammatory mediators cause characteristic hives itching one key studies shaped current understanding autoimmune urticaria published hide et al study demonstrated sera patients csu could induce histamine release basophils cutaneous mast cells effect mediated igg autoantibodies alpha subunit highaffinity ige receptor subsequent research refined understanding autoimmune urticaria example study sabroe et al showed intradermal injection autologous serum caused wheal flare reaction hallmark urticaria majority patients csu providing evidence role autoantibodies recent research focused identifying triggers production autoantibodies exploring role genetic environmental factors developing new treatments target underlying autoimmune process despite advances many questions remain precise mechanisms underlying autoimmune urticaria research area ongoing autoimmune urticaria characterized presence autoantibodies antibodies immune system mistakenly produces bodys cells case autoimmune urticaria autoantibodies primarily target highaffinity ige receptor fcεri mast cells basophils less commonly ige healthy immune system antibodies produced identify neutralize foreign bodies bacteria viruses however autoimmune conditions like autoimmune urticaria immune system mistakenly identifies cells foreign produces antibodies leads immune response body attacks tissues causing inflammation autoimmune urticaria autoantibodies bind fcεri receptors ige surface mast cells basophils autoantibodies crosslink dimerise fcεri leading mast cell basophil activation triggers cascade events lead degranulation cells release histamine inflammatory mediators surrounding mediators include preformed substances like histamine proteases tumor necrosis factorα tnfα well newly synthesized mediators leukotrienes prostaglandins cytokines chemokines substances cause increased expression cell adhesion molecules endothelium post capillary venules leading leukocyte recruitment including eosinophils characterize late phase reaction mast cells also ability behave antigen presenting cells activating cells maintaining duration wheals mhc class iidependent signaling autoimmune urticaria often associated range comorbidities include autoimmune diseases atopic diseases like atopic dermatitis asthma antithyroid antinuclear antibodies anas often found well thyroid diseases particularly prevalent well one study found increased prevalence gastroesophageal reflux disease autoimmune urticaria psychiatric disorders including anxiety depression somatoform disorders also common among patients overall prevalence psychiatric comorbidity estimated disorders especially hypersomnia mood disorders trauma stressorrelated disorders among prevalent psychiatric autoimmune urticaria persists prevalence comorbidities rheumatic diseases inflammatory diseases psychiatric disorders tends increase diagnosing autoimmune urticaria involves combination clinical evaluation diagnostic criteria various testing process aims confirm presence disease identify potential triggers rule conditions may present similar symptoms diagnosis autoimmune urticaria primarily based clinical presentation duration symptoms condition considered chronic hives persist six weeks addition clinical presentation presence autoantibodies highaffinity ige receptor fcεri ige support diagnosis autoimmune urticaria several testing methods used support diagnosis identify potential triggers skin tests autologous serum skin test asst used detect presence functional autoantibodies test small amount patients serum injected skin positive reaction formation wheal flare indicates presence functional blood tests also used detect presence autoantibodies enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa common method used detect autoantibodies fcεri ige test involves adding patients serum plate coated antigen interest autoantibodies present bind antigen enzymelinked antibody added binds autoantibodies substrate added enzyme converts produce color change indicating presence differential diagnosis autoimmune urticaria includes conditions cause hives similar skin include allergic reactions types urticaria physical urticaria triggered physical stimuli pressure cold heat conditions mastocytosis mast cell activation syndrome also important rule systemic diseases cause hives vasculitis urticarial vasculitis schnitzlers syndrome gleichs syndrome thyroid specific symptoms triggers results skin blood tests help differentiate autoimmune urticaria conditions treatment autoimmune urticaria aims alleviate symptoms improve quality life prevent exacerbations involves combination pharmacological interventions lifestyle modifications choice treatment depends severity symptoms patients response previous treatments presence comorbidities primary goal treating autoimmune urticaria control symptoms significantly impact patients quality involves reducing frequency severity hives itchiness another important goal prevent exacerbations identifying avoiding triggers treatment strategy typically involves stepwise approach starting firstline treatments progressing aggressive therapies symptoms firstline treatments autoimmune urticaria primarily involve use medications work blocking action histamine substance body causes allergic symptoms antihistamines effective controlling symptoms urticaria usually first choice treatment two types antihistamines firstgeneration diphenhydramine cause drowsiness secondgeneration cetirizine loratadine less likely cause drowsiness doxepin also sometimes antihistamines effective symptoms severe secondline treatments may considered include immunosuppressants biologics immunosuppressants corticosteroids reduce inflammation suppress immune systems however significant side effects especially used longterm usually used short periods biologics omalizumab antiige antibody used cases chronic autoimmune urticaria respond medication works reducing immune systems overreaction triggers addition medication lifestyle modifications play crucial role managing autoimmune urticaria include avoiding known triggers certain foods although food allergy rarely alcohol stress extreme temperatures regular exercise healthy diet good sleep hygiene also help manage symptoms improve overall appropriate treatment prognosis autoimmune urticaria generally good patients achieve good control symptoms firstline treatments however patients may persistent symptoms despite treatment may require secondline relapse also common patients severe symptoms important note autoimmune urticaria chronic condition managing may involve addressing physical symptoms also emotional psychological impact
