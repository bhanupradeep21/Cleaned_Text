vocal hygiene practices include three components regulating quantity quality voice use improving vocal fold hydration reducing behaviours jeopardize vocal nodules resolve likely smaller onset treatment vocal fold nodules usually involves behavioural intervention therapy administered pathologist severe cases surgery remove lesions recommended best children vocal fold nodules common males adults common one major perceptual signs vocal fold nodules change quality voice may perceived due aperiodic vibrations vocal may also perceived due incomplete closure vocal folds upon degree hoarseness breathiness perceived may vary severity variability may due size firmness common symptoms include difficulty producing vocal pitches higher increased phonatory vocal may sensation soreness

increase mechanical stress subsequent vocal fold gender may another predisposing factor vocal fold nodules occur frequently presence dehydration respiratory infection inflammatory factors may also act predisposing aggravating factors inflammatory factors may include allergies tobacco alcohol use laryngopharyngeal reflux environmental vocal fold nodules often alter mechanical properties vocal folds interfere vibratory nodules may increase mass vocal folds especially along medial edge typically found increased mass may result aperiodic irregular vibration perception greater pitch loudness perturbations increased nodules may also affect mucosal wave vocal folds changing configuration vocal fold closure pattern often cause incomplete closure vocal folds resulting hourglass incomplete closure allows air escape vocal folds often results perception degree nodules affect mucosal wave vibratory characteristics vocal folds depends highly size smaller nodules may still allow vocal folds achieve complete diagnosing vocal fold nodules typically includes comprehensive analysis medical voice history physical examination head neck perceptual evaluation voice visualization vocal

implicated vocal fold nodules include poor sleeping habits poor two main methods treating vocal fold nodules voice therapy behavioural treatment laryngeal microsurgery surgical general risks surgery eg scar formation posed general behavioural treatment usually recommended behavioural voice therapy typically carried behavioural treatments methods vary greatly generally effective improving vocal quality decreasing size vocal fold complete resolution nodules behavioural treatment behavioural techniques indirect indirect approaches focus improving vocal hygiene introducing andor maintaining safe voice practices thereby reducing opportunities phonotrauma occasionally implementing vocal direct approaches involve reducing physiological strain vocal system voice used eg speaking singing reducing collision forces vocal folds ensuring sufficient pulmonary support speaking eg changing individuals breathing pattern optimizing resonance larynx structures vocal behavioural treatments also vary delivery traditional therapy distribution eg eight sessions within eight weeks intensive approaches eg eight session within three weeks remote therapy ie telehealth shown effectiveness treating vocal fold assessment outcomes behavioural treatments also varies effects measured eg methods typically used confirm presence vocal fold nodules video endoscopy video eg measuring parameters transglottal pressure glottal airflow eg rating voice terms dimensions roughness breathiness asthenia terms effect quality life using combination finally recurrence vocal fold nodules behavioural
