larger holotype specimen immature owing unossified neurocentral along redondavenator cm another undescribed species carnufex among largest triassic crocodylomorphs three among earliest crocodylomorphs casting doubt hypothesis characteristic crocodylomorph features evolved reduction body size rather carnufex possesses myriad features characteristic crocodylomorphs distant ancestors reptiles like postosuchus however also highly autapomorphic meaning possessed many features completely unique distinguishing close skull large elongated heavily textured areas forelimbs low premaxilla possessed least six teeth notch rear tooth row similar dromicosuchus like archosaurs premaxilla palatal process internallyoriented projection forms front palate roof mouth conspicuous gap process may manifested small hole palate hole also observed certain early crocodylomorphs may accommodate enlarged fourth tooth lower jaw premaxillary teeth slender serrated recurved maxilla long ascending process upper branch remains consistent height throughout length pseudosuchians either much shorter ascending process early crocodylomorphs one expands rauisuchids tapers basal taxa towards rear posterior process lower branch maxilla even longer holding least teeth maxillary teeth serrated knifelike front edge significantly convex rear side slightly concave posterior process maxilla low circular crosssection front deepens thins towards rear proportional change unique carnufex among loricatans posterior process also supports sharp ridge terminates rear lower corner antorbital fenestra antorbital fenestra takes form large elongated triangular hole distinctly upper rear corner fenestra carnufex situated lower rear corner making rear edge antorbital fenestra vertical rather slanted forwards early crocodylomorphs lacrimal deeply incised antorbital fossa basin surrounding antorbital fenestra fossa rimmed rough ridge possessing small characteristic forward prong similar seen theropod dinosaurs outer surface jugal also covered pits ridges anterior process front portion jugal tall unusually smooth rounded shape jugals posterior process rear branch bifurcated large tapering main portion smaller triangular branch forking bifurcated posterior jugal present early crocodylomorphs well dinosaurs latter group two portions equal size unlike case angular thin slender subtle branched texturing pronounced ridge crops outer rear portion bone ridge likely supports pterygoideus ventralis muscle although similarly distinct ridge rare among crocodylomorphs known junggarsuchus otherwise angular similar sphenosuchus articular generally similar crocodylomorphs saddleshaped jaw facet deep groove chorda tympani nerve small upwards projection rear bone also possesses medial process inwards branch akin earlier pseudosuchians like postosuchus although medial process carnufex small conical peak rather large cervical neural arch complex bone adorned nine laminae platelike ridges various regions twelve fossae deep pits laminae neural spine tall rising short distance bending backwards degree angle diapophyses rib facets vertically extended project laterally though far rear edge postzygapophyses rear articular processes thin dip downwards though converge instead bases separated small ushaped gap various archosaurs similar postzygapophyseal projection known hyposphene though differ carnufex postzygapophyses converge base early pseudosuchians preserve enough atlas properly compare crescentshaped atlantal intercentrum dorsal neural arch similar cervical differences diapophyses much shorter zygapophyses level dorsal also less complex cervical laminae fossae include less prominent hyposphene possibly intermediate stage reptiles like postosuchus prominent hyposphene dorsals crocodylomorphs lack structure entirely neural spine slightly expanded anteroposteriorly tip like noncrocodylomorphs spine table lateral expansion asymmetrical extension visible underside neural arch may pathological feature preserved ribs similar humerus short constricted shaft similar postosuchus crocodylomorphs result several features include distal end approximately three
