thrifty gene hypothesis gianfrancos hypothesiscitation needed attempt geneticist james v neel explain certain populations subpopulations modern day prone diabetes mellitus type proposed hypothesis resolve fundamental problem diabetes clearly harmful medical condition yet quite common already evident neel likely strong genetic basis problem understand disease likely genetic component negative effects may favoured process natural selection neel suggested resolution problem genes predispose diabetes called thrifty genes historically advantageous became detrimental modern world words rendered

several modified alternative hypotheses proposed james neel professor human genetics university michigan medical school proposed thrifty genotype hypothesis paper diabetes mellitus thrifty genotype

existence allowing humans fatten rapidly profoundly times feast order might better survive times famine would advantageous current hypothesis proposed clear distinction different types diabetes neel later stated hypothesis applied noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus original form theory specifically stated diabetes may due rapid insulin response would prevent loss glucose urine furthermore made use popular theory later disproven argued specific insulin antagonists released response insulin causing decades following publications first paper thrifty genotype hypothesis neel researched

hypothesis propensity develop diabetes evolutionary adaptation diabetes would disease long standing populations currently experiencing high frequency diabetes however neel found evidence diabetes among populations earlier tested younger members populations glucose intolerance might indicated predisposition diabetes found neel published review research based thrifty genotype hypothesis introduction noted following data rather soft hypothesis based largely collapsed however neel argued concept thrifty genotype remains viable first advanced went advance thrifty genotype concept thought context compromised genotype affects several metabolicallyrelated neel review described expanded form original hypothesis diabetes caused thrifty genes adapted specifically intermittent starvation complex theory several related diseases diabetes obesity hypertension see also metabolic syndrome caused physiological systems adapted older environment pushed beyond limits environmental changes thus one possible remedy diseases changing diet exercise activity closely reflect ancestral thrifty genotype hypothesis used explain high rapidly escalating levels obesity diabetes among

gene million years human paleolithic history assumption contradicted anthropological many populations later developed high rates obesity diabetes appeared discernible history famine starvation example pacific islanders whose tropicalequatorial islands luxuriant vegetation year round surrounded lukewarm waters full however implies period humans migrated africa would provided sufficient time reverse preexisting famineadapted alleles little evidence one criticism thrifty gene idea predicts modern hunter gatherers get fat periods famines data body mass index huntergatherer subsistence agriculturalists show famines deposit large fat however genes promote limited fat deposition context preindustrialized lifestyles diets may promote excessive fat deposition obesity caloric intake

removed risk predators probably key factor selecting fatness drifty gene hypothesis presented part presidential debate obesity society meeting new orleans counterarguments favouring thrifty gene presented british nutritionist andrew prentice main thrust prentices argument drifty gene idea speakmans critique thrifty gene hypothesis ignores huge impact famines fertility argued prentice famine may actually force driving evolution thrifty genes past years since invention agriculture famines exert effects survival fertility selection pressure may sufficient even short timescale generate
