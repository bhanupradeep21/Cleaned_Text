epididymitis medical condition characterized inflammation epididymis curved structure back onset pain typically day pain may improve raising symptoms may include swelling testicle burning urination frequent inflammation testicle commonly also young sexually active gonorrhea chlamydia frequently underlying older males men practice insertive anal sex enteric bacteria common diagnosis typically based conditions may result similar symptoms include testicular torsion inguinal hernia testicular ultrasound useful diagnosis treatment may include pain medications nsaids recommended antibiotics young sexually active ceftriaxone among older ofloxacin may complications include infertility chronic people aged commonly affected people within age group affected per year united aged commonly acute form usually develops course several days pain swelling frequently one testis hang low often recent history dysuria urethral fever also common symptom chronic version patient may painful point tenderness may may irregular epididymis upon palpation though palpation may reveal indurated epididymis scrotal ultrasound may reveal problems epididymis ultrasound may also show nothing unusual majority patients present chronic epididymitis symptoms five untreated acute epididymitiss major complications abscess formation testicular infarction chronic epididymitis lead permanent damage even destruction epididymis testicle resulting infertility andor hypogonadism infection may spread organ system body chronic pain also associated complication untreated chronic though urinary tract infections men rare bacterial infection common cause acute bacteria urethra backtrack urinary reproductive structures epididymis rare circumstances infection reaches epididymis via sexually active men chlamydia trachomatis responsible twothirds acute cases followed neisseria gonorrhoeae e coli bacteria cause urinary tract infection particularly among men age cause e coli epididymitis commonly due urinary tract less common microbes include ureaplasma mycobacterium cytomegalovirus cryptococcus patients hiv infection e coli common boys puberty elderly men sex men majority cases bacteria cause one side scrotum locus noninfectious causes also possible reflux sterile urine urine without bacteria ejaculatory ducts may cause inflammation obstruction children may response following infection enterovirus adenovirus mycoplasma pneumoniae rare noninfectious causes chronic epididymitis include sarcoidosis prevalent black men beh√ßets form epididymitis caused genitourinary surgery including prostatectomy urinary catheterization congestive epididymitis longterm complication chemical epididymitis may also result drugs diagnosis typically based conditions may result similar symptoms include testicular torsion inguinal hernia testicular ultrasound useful diagnosis epididymitis usually gradual onset typical findings redness warmth swelling scrotum tenderness behind testicle away middle normal position epididymis relative testicle cremasteric reflex elevation testicle response stroking upper inner thigh remains useful sign distinguish testicular torsion pain relieved elevation testicle called prehns sign however nonspecific useful advent sophisticated medical imaging techniques surgical exploration standard care today doppler ultrasound common test demonstrate areas blood flow distinguish clearly epididymitis torsion however torsion sources testicular pain often determined palpation alone studies suggested real benefit ultrasound assure person testicular nuclear testicular blood flow testing rarely usedcitation needed additional tests may necessary identify underlying causes younger children urinary tract anomaly frequently found sexually active men tests sexually transmitted infections may done may include microscopy culture first void urine sample gram stain culture fluid swab urethra nucleic acid amplification tests amplify detect microbial dna nucleic acids tests syphilis hiv epididymitis classified acute subacute chronic depending duration chronic epididymitis epididymitis present months chronic epididymitis characterized inflammation even infection present tests needed distinguish chronic epididymitis range disorders cause constant scrotal pain including testicular cancer though often painless enlarged scrotal veins varicocele possible cyst within epididymis research found much visits urologist scrotal pain chronic complication nerves scrotal area closely connected abdomen sometimes causing abdominal pain similar hernia see referred pain chronic epididymitis commonly associated lower back pain onset pain often cooccurs activity stresses low back ie heavy lifting long periods car driving poor posture sitting activity interferes normal curve lumbar lordosis acute chronic forms antibiotics used infection suspected treatment choice often azithromycin cefixime cover gonorrhoeae chlamydia fluoroquinolones longer recommended due widespread resistance gonorrhoeae doxycycline may used alternative azithromycin chronic epididymitis four sixweek course antibiotics may prescribed ensure complete eradication possible bacterial cause especially various chlamydiae cases caused enteric organisms e coli ofloxacin levofloxacin children fluoroquinolones doxycycline best avoided since bacteria cause urinary tract infections often cause epididymitis children cotrimoxazole suited penicillins example cephalexin usedcitation needed household remedies elevation scrotum cold compresses applied regularly scrotum may relieve pain acute cases painkillers antiinflammatory drugs often used treatment chronic acute forms hospitalisation indicated severe cases checkups ensure infection cleared surgical removal epididymis rarely necessary causes sterility gives relief pain approximately however acute suppurating epididymitis acute epididymitis discharge pus epididymotomy may recommended refractory cases full epididymectomy may required cases unrelenting testicular pain removal entire also warranted generally believed cases chronic epididymitis eventually burn patients system left untreated though might take years even however
