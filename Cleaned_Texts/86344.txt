forensic palynology subdiscipline palynology study pollen grains spores etc aims prove disprove relationship among objects people places may pertain criminal civil pollen reveal person object regions world countries even different parts single garden distinctive pollen pollen evidence also reveal season particular object picked palynology study palynomorphs microscopic structures animal plant origin resistant decay includes spermatophyte pollen well spores fungi bryophytes ferns dinoflagellates various organic microorganisms living variety ways study microscopic walled particles applied criminal forensics areas new zealand demand field high forensic palynology used evidence many different case types range anywhere nonviolent extremely violent pollen used trace activity mass graves pinpoint scene catch burglar brushed hypericum bush pollen distinct morphology relatively indestructible likely adhere variety surfaces often without notice even become part ongoing research forensic bullet forensic palynology evolving forensic science application mostly utilized countries new zealand australia united relatively small disparate fragmented compared approaches thus thorough guide achieve best practice forensic moreover limit forensic palynologists skilled palynologists enter forensic palynology becoming forensic palynologist requires rigorous training education one must attain phd sufficient background studies forensic science botany ecology geography importantly must receive training field quaternary terms criminal investigation forensic palynologist services requested cases forgery rape homicide genocide terrorism drug dealing assault usually consist single individual works polynomial case course palynologist could still consult professionals furthermore palynologist given significant information one person handling analysis samples important duties note ensure paperwork dated signed filed archived order maintain good records forensic palynologists usually visit crime scene survey vegetation example identify plants characteristics qualities size vigor obtain plant samples allow analysis like ground sampling scrubbing scraping washing essential retrieval palynomorphs various materials utilize methods like police photographers cartographers botanists vital forensic palynologist visit crime scene crime science investigators csi scenes crime officers socos avoid disturbance environmental evidence pollen similar spores generally less microns across resulting easy unnoticeable transportation pollen grains variety shapes sizes colors structures numbers identification keys exist reference largescale collections pollen specimens reside museums university herbaria also serve resource forensic palynologists identify classify samples collect sample pollen crime scene help identify specific plant species may contact victim point evidence ecologically belong area pollen assemblage sample pollen variety plant species represented identifying species relative frequency point specific area time year could aid determination whether scene pollen found primary scene secondary scene pollen made great numbers large variety plants designed dispersed either via wind insect another method throughout immediate environment pollen also found soil clothing hair drugs stomach contents ropes rock places would difficult suspect remove pollens adhesion cases pollen plant absent fungi fungal spores may able detect plants presence cases presence rarely reported fungi fungal spores helped identify information forensic one main disadvantages field lack trained academic centers training facilities use pollen forensics crucial expertise required identify palynomorphs apply data geolocation many things could go wrong invalidate samples collected especially personnel handling experienced subject experience contamination another major problem invalidate use sample evidence therefore important samples collected early collection sites identified depending limited access international databases also prove issue comes time analyst identify pollen evidence specific family genus currently database austria called paldat exists known databases exist north pollen easily picked anyone important pollen samples collected soon possible prevent contamination outside samples need prepared placed slides order fully safe process preparing samples identifying timeconsuming collecting sample paired site surveys photos scene provide context later example pollen evidence used court additional context would useful sample collection methods vary depending case investigation due lack palynologists forensic field forensic scientists present may collect raises issues terms quality sample since collection sites sample determined depending discussion investigation team necessary order establish best sampling collection sites determined samples retrieved clean instruments placed tightly sealed sterile examples sterile ziplock plastic bags screwtop plastic preference glass sample instruments thoroughly cleaned replaced prevent cases collection hand gloves used replaced samples labeled sample history documentation maintained keep track people access analyzing samples palynomorphs extracted allow identification used forensic case relate person object crime scene even determine whether scene pollen found primary secondary samples chemically processed mix acids sodium hydroxide acetic anhydride water washes neutralized extracts stained mounted onto slides microscopic helps identification help available reference collections make comparisons pollens scanning electron microscope sem used traditionally since primary identification palynomorphs timeconsuming tedious ideal routine compared sem semiautomated pollen grain imaging techniques transmitted light microscopy tlm widefield fluorescent method structured illumination apotome found higher speed accuracy came identification pollen dna barcoding another method used differentiate pollen grains comparing dna pollen grain micrometers length sample collected prepared genetic markers placed dna isolated finally dna sequenced usually high throughout sequencing hts faster less expensive traditional methods dna one earliest document cases pollen plays key role took place austria man went missing presumed murdered body found authorities

rock deposits would contain fossilized species suspect presented information willingly confessed lead authorities sites murder body inside region indicated dr first cases involved forensic palynology united states honeybee pollination studies issued time honey pollen analysis began growing united states department agriculture usda insured beekeepers higher world market price honey premisses honey produced usa grounds thus honey samples sent pollen analysis confirmation honey produced usa concluded generally cases time involved lawsuits concerning beekeepers example michigan beekeeper arose suspect importing beehives southeastern usa werent inspected mites led usda inspecting honey samples concluded imported southeastern region usa due honey contained floral types common southeastern region found example concerning forensic palynology united kingdom took place handled patricia involved murder case body laid soil preserved pollen wiltshire found traces walnut pollen soil suspects shoes however walnut pollen found unusual walnut site nearby however later discovered walnut tree cut thirty years walnut pollen remained pollen analyzed linked suspect crime scene thus walnut pollen provided significant role solving home invasion two burglars brushed past hypericum bush outside house one burglars brought suspect evidence circumstantial man confess analysis clothes revealed
