genetics especially genetic engineering deletion mapping technique used find mutation sites within gene principle deletion mapping involves crossing strain point mutation gene multiple strains carry deletion different region gene wherever recombination occurs two strains produce wildtype gene regardless frequency point mutation lie within region deletion recombination produce wildtype genes reasonable conclude point mutation deletion found within stretch dna example demonstrate principle works suppose gene x wildtype form shown linearly like gene x suppose strain organisms point mutation gene called gene x denote longer wildtype gene x suppose two strains organisms deletions gene x different sites called respectively dotted line indicates site deletion point mutation lies within deletion wildtype recombinants point mutant mutant however cross point mutant mutant could successful wildtype recombinant produced genetic recombination mutant allele donor within sequence corresponding region deleted recipient recombinants obtained cross repair deletion recombination donor must wildtype dna sequence region corresponding dna deleted recipient cross words feasible recombination possibility point mutant length dna could made contained neither point mutation deletion indicating mutations two strains region note crossovers point mutant yield recombinants case crossover events occur point mutant end deletion would inherit wildtype sequence genetics article stub help wikipedia expanding article biological engineering stub help wikipedia expanding httpsenwikipediaorgwikideletionmapping
