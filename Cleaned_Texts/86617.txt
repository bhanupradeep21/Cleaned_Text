spiral plater instrument used dispense liquid sample onto petri dish spiral pattern commonly used part cfu count procedure purpose determining number microbes setting spiral plating petri dish incubated several hours number colony forming microbes cfu determined spiral platers also used research clinical diagnostics method covering petri dish bacteria placing antibiotic discs ast spiral plater rotates dish simultaneously dispensing liquid either linearly moving dish dispensing tip creates common spiral pattern movements done constant speed spiral created would lower concentration outside plate inside advanced spiral platers provide different options spiral patterns constant concentration slowing spinning lateral movements exponential concentration speeding spinning lateral movements spiral plating used extensively microbiological testing food milk milk products cosmetics approved method advantage spiral plating less plates used versus plating manually different concentrations present also makes harder count colonies requires special techniques spiral platers either available standalone instruments fed manually plates samples fed automatically using dedicated stackers alternatively spiral platers available integrated devices part larger automated platforms case larger workflow often automated eg plating incubation counting httpsenwikipediaorgwikispiralplater
