chemicals cigarettes interfere bodys ability create estrogen hormone regulates folliculogenesis ovulation also cigarette smoking interferes folliculogenesis embryo transport endometrial receptivity endometrial angiogenesis uterine blood flow uterine damage irreversible stopping smoking prevent smokers likely infertile smoking reduces chances ivf producing live birth increases risk ivf pregnancy miscarrying also female smokers earlier onset menopause approximately sexually transmitted infections leading cause infertility often display visible symptoms risk failing seek proper treatment time prevent decreased twelve percent infertility cases result woman either underweight overweight fat cells produce addition primary sex organs much body fat causes production much estrogen body begins react birth control limiting odds getting little body fat causes insufficient production estrogen disruption menstrual overweight women irregular cycles ovulation occur proper nutrition early life also major factor later study us indicated approximately infertile women past current eating disorder five times higher general lifetime prevalence review concluded overweight obese subfertile women reduced probability successful fertility treatment pregnancies associated complications higher costs hypothetical groups women undergoing fertility care study counted approximately live births normal weight live births overweight obese anovulatory women ovulatory women study counted approximately live births normal weight live births overweight live births obese women increase cost per live birth anovulatory overweight obese women respectively higher normal weight counterparts ovulatory women higher exposure radiation poses high risk infertility depending frequency power exposure duration radiotherapy reported cause amount radiation absorbed ovaries determine becomes infertile high doses destroy eggs ovaries might cause infertility early menopause chemotherapy poses high risk infertility chemotherapies high risk infertility include procarbazine alkylating drugs cyclophosphamide ifosfamide busulfan melphalan chlorambucil drugs medium risk include doxorubicin platinum
