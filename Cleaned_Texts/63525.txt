intervertebral disc intervertebral fibrocartilage lies adjacent vertebrae vertebral column disc forms fibrocartilaginous joint symphysis allow slight movement vertebrae act ligament hold vertebrae together function shock absorber spine intervertebral discs consist outer fibrous ring anulus annulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis surrounds inner gellike center nucleus anulus fibrosus consists several layers laminae fibrocartilage made type type ii collagen type concentrated toward edge ring provides greater strength stiff laminae withstand compressive forces fibrous intervertebral disc contains nucleus pulposus helps distribute pressure evenly across disc prevents development stress concentrations could cause damage underlying vertebrae endplates nucleus pulposus contains loose fibers suspended mucoprotein gel nucleus disc acts shock absorber absorbing impact bodys activities keeping two vertebrae separated remnant one disc pair vertebrae except first cervical segment atlas

pulposus nucleus pulposus disc functions distribute hydraulic pressure directions within intervertebral disc compressive loads nucleus pulposus consists large vacuolated notochord cells small chondrocytelike cells collagen fibrils aggrecan proteoglycan aggregates binding hyaluronan attached aggrecan molecule glycosaminoglycan gag chains chondroitin sulfate keratan sulfate increasing amount negatively charged aggrecan increases oncotic pressure resulting shift extracellular fluid outside inside nucleus pulposus amount glycosaminoglycans hence water decreases age anything arising intervertebral disc may termed discogenic particular referring associated pain discogenic spinal disc herniation commonly referred slipped disc happen unbalanced mechanical pressures substantially deform anulus fibrosus allowing part nucleus obtrude events occur peak physical performance traumas result chronic deterioration typically accompanied poor posture associated propionibacterium acnes deformed anulus gellike material nucleus pulposus forced laterally posteriorly distorting local muscle function putting pressure nearby nerve give symptoms typical nerve root entrapment vary paresthesia numbness chronic andor acute pain either locally along dermatome served entrapped nerve loss muscle tone decreased homeostatic performance disc physically slipped bulges usually one direction another kind herniation nucleus pulposus happen result formation schmorls nodes intervertebral referred vertical disc herniation age approximately people show evidence disc degeneration one levels beyond age people show evidence disc degeneration one levels magnetic resonance imaging degenerative changes normal part ageing process correlate one effect aging disc degeneration nucleus pulposus begins dehydrate concentration proteoglycans matrix decreases thus limiting ability disc absorb shock general shrinking disc size partially responsible common decrease height humans age anulus fibrosus also becomes weaker age increased risk tearing addition cartilage endplates begin thinning fissures begin form sclerosis subchondral since fissures formed anulus fibrosus due osteoarthritic bones degeneration general inner nucleus pulposus seep put pressure number vertebral herniated disc cause mild severe pain sciatica treatment herniated discs range physical therapy also intervertebral disc arthroplasty degeneration vertebral column includes diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis calcification ossification ligaments surrounding vertebrae degeneration causes stiffness sometimes even curvature lumbar thoracolumbar spinal region burgeoning evidence suggests longterm running may mitigate agerelated degeneration within lumbar intervertebral discs may cause pain people others may cause chronic pain spinal disorders affect morphology intervertebral discs example patients scoliosis commonly calcium deposits ectopic calcification cartilage endplate sometimes disc herniated discs also found higher degree cellular senescence nonherniated addition scoliosis lateral curvature spine fused vertebrae also experience abnormalities hunchback shows old
