euchambersia extinct genus therocephalian therapsids lived late permian south africa china genus contains two species type species e mirabilis named paleontologist robert broom skull missing lower jaw second skull belonging probably immature individual later described second species e liuyudongi named jun liu fernando abdala wellpreserved skull member family akidnognathidae historically also referred synonymous euchambersiidae named euchambersia euchambersia small shortsnouted therocephalian possessing large canines typical group however notable among therocephalians possessing ridges canines large indentation side skull proposed structures supported venom delivery mechanism statement turns true would one oldest known tetrapods characteristic recently internal structure skull euchambersia used stronger evidence favour hypothesis venomous possibilities indentation supporting sort sensory organ still remain plausible type specimen euchambersia mirabilis euchambersia overall found robert broom south african farm vanwyksfontein owned mr greathead near town norvalspont consists single distorted skull catalogued nhmuk described broom second smaller skull specimen number found described james kitching specimens missing lower jaw originated general layer rock upper cistecephalus assemblage zone beaufort group within karoo cistecephalus az dated wuchiapingian stage late million years broom named genus euchambersia considered remarkable therocephalian ever discovered eminent scottish publisher evolutionary thinker robert chambers whose vestiges natural history creation considered broom remarkable work though sneered second species e liuyudongi named jun liu fernando abdala based wellpreserved skull associated lower jaw originated naobaogou formation inner mongolia dated broadly lopingian epoch contains wuchiapingian formation divided three members based cycles sedimentation numbere members ii iii oldest youngest e liuyudongi originates member liu colleagues previously described number new species middle portion naobaogou formation among specimens excavated least three field seasons e mirabilis small shortsnouted snout half skull length therocephalian type skull reconstructed length approximately cm accounting crushing deformation fossil second known skull belonged smaller individual length cm probably immature judging lack fusion type skull e liuyudongi measures cm length shorter snout less skull according initial description eye socket e mirabilis rather small branches postorbital jugal usually surround back bottom eye socket therocephalians appear either reduced absent entirely meanwhile top eye socket formed prefrontal frontal also small skull bear pineal foramen like whaitsia pterygoid palatine palate separated transpalatine side jaw sort e liuyudongi differs e mirabilis several details bones frontal bone separates prefrontal contacting postorbital postorbital fenestrae back skull slitlike instead rounded additionally epipterygoid prootic braincase disconnected e although skulls e mirabilis incompletely preserved ct scanning suggests premaxilla held five incisors sockets becoming progressively larger first fifth incisor like theriodonts crowns incisors conical also lack serrations unlike gorgonopsians scylacosaurian therocephalians interior edge incisors seems slightly concave back edge appears ridge smaller specimen displaced incisor preserved within nasal cavity strongly recurved wear marks top edge suggesting probably lower incisor fourth incisor also replacement tooth growing behind accompanied resorption type specimen e mirabilis preserves right like therocephalians canine large resulting specialized predatory lifestyle incorporates sabertooth bite prey round bears prominent ridge side front surface immediately beside ridge shallow depression becomes wider near top tooth probably structure groove interpreted unlike e mirabilis however canines e liuyudongi neither ridges theriodonts usually replace teeth distichial canine tooth always functional skulls e mirabilis show sign replacement canines developing suggesting reliant canines present functional behind incisors canines additional teeth upper lower jaws confirmed e teeth would located therocephalians teeth behind canines instead large depression fossa side maxilla also bounded part lacrimal possibly part fossa length jaw type specimen e mirabilis second skull skulls fossa divided two parts shallower ridge top larger deeper depression bottom wide furrow beginning behind canine contacts bottom fossa passes interior mouth bottom portion fossa strongly pitted bears small opening foramen front back e liuyudongi fossa deeper still bar maxilla caps top fossa contacts jugal inner wall fossa large opening nasal cavity fossa nearly reaches midheight ct scanning shows openings e mirabilis lead canals connect trigeminal nerve controls facial sensitivity forwarddirected canal also splits three main branches infraorbital connect socket canine junction occurs millimetres along canal another point variation two skulls top branch external nasal ramus splits four branches type skull split second skull therapsids like thrinaxodon bauria olivierosuchus external nasal ramus generally splits three branches canals would brought nerves nutrientrich tissue root canines rest upper euchambersia assigned newly named family euchambersiidae lieuwe dirk boonstra initially misspelt name euchambersidae improper latin subsequently corrected friedrich von huene euchambersiidae initially considered separate families moschorhinidae annatherapsididae christiane mendez recognized groups closely related subfamilies renamed annatherapsidinae moschorhininae euchambersiinae within wider group redefined moschorhinidae although also referred phylogenetic analysis james hopson herb barghusen supported mendezs hypothesis three subfamilies within moschorhinidae elected use name euchambersiidae adam huttenlocker colleagues argued names annatherapsididae moschorhinidae euchambersiidae junior synonyms akidnognathidae since akidnognathus also belongs family named first member name reached wider acceptance among huttenlocker colleagues also later redefined moschorhininae akidnognathidae save annatherapsidus mikhail ivakhnenko included akidnognathidae euchambersiidae sister group family whaitsiidae superfamily however researchers include akidnognathidae whaitsioidea phylogenies huttenlocker colleagues found akidnognathidae instead closest chthonosauridae two forming sister group group containing whaitsioidea liu abdala performed new phylogenetic analysis description e liuyudongi found two species form unified group within akidnognathidae rest topology similar one found huttenlocker colleagues topology recovered analysis shown group labels following huttenlocker lycosuchus gorynychus scylacosauridae scylacosuchus ophidostoma hofmeyria ictidostoma mirotenthes

liuyudongi large maxillary fossae euchambersia continual subjects debate regarding function however researchers agree held sort secretory gland broom initially argued fossae may contained parotid salivary proposal rejected boonstra jp lehman noted parotid glands tend placed behind eye respectively suggested fossae held modified lacrimal glands harderian however latter also unlikely harderian glands usually placed inside eye socket franz nopcsa suggested maxillary fossae housed venom glands may derived lacrimal glands ridged canines notches behind canines allowing venom flow passively victims hypothesis widely accepted throughout characteristic morphology euchambersia used support possible venombearing adaptations among various prehistoric including related therocephalians much acceptance based erroneous assumption canines grooved instead grooved canines euchambersia would parallel fangs various venomous snakes well venomdelivering incisors living interpretation consistently appeared literature published determined julien benoit result propagation brooms overly reconstructed diagram skull without context actual specimens thus considered necessary reevaluate hypothesis venomous bite additionally benoit argued grooved ridged canines necessarily associated venomous animals either shown presence hippopotami muntjacs baboons play role grooming sharpening latter two ridged canines also accompanied distinct fossa front eye entirely unconnected furthermore grooved ridged teeth nonvenomous snakes used reduce suctional drag capturing slippery prey like fish ct scanning known specimens euchambersia benoit colleagues subsequently used provide concrete support favour venom hypothesis canals leading maxillary fossae revealed scans would primarily supported trigeminal nerve well blood however fact canals also directly lead root canines would suggest secondary role venom delivery euchambersia seems venom gland housed maxillary fossae delivery mechanism venom maxillary canals instrument wound venom delivery inflicted ridged canines satisfy criteria venomous animal defined wolfgang benoit et al noted conclusively demonstrate euchambersia actually venomous especially given previously stated objections additionally living animals delivery system analogous proposed system euchambersia deliver venom lower snakes specialized alternate hypothesis suggested benoit et al involves kind sensory organ occupying maxillary fossa uniquely among canal within maxilla exposed back side maxillary fossa implies canal carrying trigeminal nerve would probably extended across fossa outside outline skull benoit et al hypothesized fossa may supported specialized sensory organ analogous pit organ pit vipers alternatively ganglion nerve cells also possible organ functioned replacement parietal eye euchambersia like pit organ pit however expanded sensory organ would unprecedented among tetrapods therocephalians also lack parietal eye maxillary fossa thus benoit et al considered venom hypothesis however wellpreserved specimen second species e liuyudongi neither snout orbit showed signs venomous gland preorbital scent glands found supporting scent gland hypothesis although ct scans required knowledge regarding new species dentition cistecephalus assemblage zone e mirabilis known represents floodplain covered many small relatively straight
