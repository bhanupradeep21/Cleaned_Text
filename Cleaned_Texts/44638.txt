inoculation theory social psychologicalcommunication theory explains attitude belief made resistant persuasion influence analogy body gains resistance theory uses medical inoculation explanatory analogy instead applying disease used discuss attitudes applicability public campaigns targeting misinformation fake news theory developed social psychologist william j mcguire explain attitudes beliefs change specifically keep existing attitudes beliefs consistent face attempts change inoculation theory functions confer resistance counterattitudinal influences sources media advertising interpersonal communication peer pressure theory posits weak counterarguments generate resistance within receiver enabling maintain beliefs face future stronger challenge following exposure weak counterarguments eg counterarguments paired refutations receiver seek supporting information strengthen threatened position held attitude belief becomes resistant stronger counterargument hence medical analogy vaccine inoculating messages topic threatening message refutational similar topic refutational different effect inoculating message amplified making message vested immediate importance receiver based jack brehms psychological reactance theory postinoculation talk spread innovation effects social network act talking others additionally strengthen resistance attitude change therapeutic inoculation recent extension inoculation message presented without targeted belief attitude applied way inoculation message change existing position make new position resistant future attacks inoculation theory explains attitudes beliefs made resistant future challenges inoculation message successful recipient experiences threat recognition held attitude belief vulnerable change exposed andor engages refutational preemption preemptive refutation defenses potential counterarguments arguments presented inoculation message must strong enough initiate motivation maintain current attitudes beliefs weak enough receiver able refute inoculation theory studied tested decades scholarship including experimental laboratory research field studies inoculation theory used today part suite tools engaged shaping manipulating public opinion contexts include health science among inoculation process analogous medical inoculation process draws name analogy served inaugural exemplar inoculation confers resistance mcguire initially medical inoculation works exposing body weakened form enough trigger response production antibodies strong overwhelm bodys resistance attitudinal inoculation works way expose receiver weakened counterarguments triggering process counterargument confers resistance later stronger persuasive messages process works like metaphorical vaccination receiver becomes immune attacking messages attempt change attitudes beliefs inoculation theory suggests one sends messages weak counterarguments individual build immunity stronger messages strengthen original attitudes toward issue inoculation theory research treats inoculation preemptive preventive prophylactic messaging exposure strong challenges recently scholars begun test inoculation therapeutic inoculation treatment administered wrong target application treatment messages persuade like flu shot cures already infected flu protects future threats research needed better understand therapeutic inoculation field research takes inoculation outside laboratory another shift inoculation research moves largely cognitive intrapersonal internal process process cognitive affective intrapersonal interpersonal example contrast explanations inoculation focused nearly entirely cognitive processes like internal counterarguing refuting persuasive attempts silently ones mind recent research examined inoculation messages motivate actual talk conversation dialogue target scholars confirmed exposure inoculation message motivates postinoculation talk pit example tweets containing native advertising disclosures type inoculation message likely include negative commentary sign resistance influence consistent william mcguire set conduct research ways encourage opposition persuasion others created experiments mcguire motivated study inoculation persuasion result aftermath korean war mcguire concerned forced certain situations main inspiration theory nine us prisoners war given opportunity elected remain captors many assumed brainwashed mcguire social scientists turned ways conferring resistance change extant persuasion research almost exclusively concerned make messages persuasive way around theory inoculation derived previous research studying onesided twosided messages onesided messages supportive messages strengthen existing attitudes mention counterpositions onesided messages frequently seen political campaigns candidate denigrates opponent mudslinging method effective reinforcing extant attitudes derision toward opposition support mudslinging candidate audience supports opposition however attack message ineffective twosided messages present counterarguments refutations counterarguments gain compliance source credibility twosided message must demonstrate senders position oppositions position followed refutation oppositions argument finally senders position mcguire led series experiments assessing inoculations efficacy adding nuance understanding early studies limited testing inoculation theory cultural truisms beliefs accepted without consideration eg people brush teeth daily meant primarily used toward attitudes rarely ever attacked opposing forces early tests inoculation theory used noncontroversial issues eg brushing teeth good refute brushing ones teeth good habit therefore external opposing arguments tooth brushing would change ones opinion would strengthen support brushing ones studies inoculation theory currently target less popular common attitudes whether one buy mac windowsbased pc computer one support gay marriage implementing inoculation theory studies contemporary social issues mundane controversial social issues variety resurgence studies helps bolster effectiveness utility theory provides support used strengthen andor predict attitudes later developments theory extended inoculation controversial contested topics contexts marketing contexts people different preexisting

vulnerability existing position eg attitude belief establishes threat initiates defenses future attacks idea weak argument presented inoculation message processes refutation means protection prepare use stronger arguments later critical attack strong enough keep receiver defensive weak enough actually change preexisting ideas hopefully make receiver actively defensive allow create arguments favor preexisting thoughts active receivers become defense strengthen attitudes beliefs least four basic key components successful inoculation threat refutational preemption preemptive refutation delay

processing could lead talk others receiving inoculation message threat authors found message processing leads postinoculation talk could potentially lead stronger resistance attack messages postinoculation talk acts virally spreading inoculation talk others issues involve negative cognitions affect previous research assumption talk subvocal existing intrapersonally prevalent without concern impact vocal talk individuals authors deem vocal talk important incubation process study concluded individuals receive inoculation message contains threat talk others message talk frequently individuals receive inoculation message additionally act postinoculation talk bolsters attitudes increases resistance message well increasing likelihood talk generate potentially viral inoculation others act vocal due nature attitudinal inoculation form psychological manipulation counterarguments used process necessarily need accurately representative opposing belief order trigger inoculation

refutation post hoc refutation another form building resistance arguments however instead building resistance prior future arguments like inoculation attempts restore original beliefs attitudes counterarguments made results research reinforced prior conclusions refutational different treatments increase resistance attacks importantly results also indicated inoculation superior post hoc refutation attempting protect original beliefs attitudes examples studies showing possible inoculate political supporters candidate campaign influence opponents attack inoculate citizens fledgling democracies spiral silence fear isolation thwart expression minority much research conducted health attempting create campaigns encourage people stop unhealthy behaviors eg getting people stop smoking prevention teen compton jackson dimmock reviewed studies inoculation theory applied healthrelated messaging many inoculation studies intent inoculate children teenagers prevent smoking drugs drinking alcohol much research shows targeting young age help resist peer pressure high school college important example inoculation theory usage protecting young adolescents influences peer pressure lead smoking underage drinking harmful godbold pfau used sixth graders two different schools applied inoculation theory defense peer pressure drinking hypothesized normative message message tailored around current social norms would effective informative message informative message message tailored around giving individuals information pieces case information drinking alcohol bad second hypothesis subjects receive threat two weeks later resistant receiving immediate attack results supported first hypothesis partially normative message created higher resistance attack necessarily effective second hypothesis also supported therefore time lapse create resistance teenagers drinking one major outcome study resistance created utilizing normative message another study conducted duryea results far supportive study also attempted find message use educational training help prevent teen drinking driving teen subjects given resources combat attempts persuade drink drive get vehicle drunk driver subjects shown film participated question answer role playing exercises slide show results showed combination four methods training effective combating persuasion drink drive get vehicle drunk driver trained group far prepared combat persuasive arguments additionally parker ivanov compton found inoculation messages effective deterrent pressures engage unprotected sex binge one issues mentioned health compton jackson dimmock discuss important future research preparing new mothers overcoming health concerns eg breastfeeding sleep deprivation postpartum depression inoculation theory applied prevention smoking heavily studied studies mainly focused preventing youth seems effective young children example pfau et al examined role inoculation attempting prevent adolescents one main goals study examine longevity persistence inoculation elementary school students watched video warning future pressures smoke first year resistance highest among low end second year students group showed attitudinal resistance smoking previously pfau van bockern importantly study followup demonstrate longlasting effects inoculation treatments grover researched effectiveness truth antismoking campaign smokers truth adverts aimed show young people smoking unhealthy expose manipulative tactics tobacco companies grover showed inoculation works differently smokers nonsmokers ie potential smokers groups truth adverts increased antismoking antitobaccoindustry attitudes effect greater smokers strength attitude change partly mediated controlled aversion branded tobacco industry products however counterintuitively exposure prosmoking adverts increased aversion branded tobacco industry products least sample general grover demonstrated initial attitude plays major role ability inoculate individual future healthrelated studies extremely beneficial communities research areas include presentday issues example inoculationbased strategies addiction intervention assist sober individuals relapsing well promoting healthy eating habits exercising breastfeeding creating positive attitude towards area underdeveloped mental health awareness large number young adults teens dying suicide due bullying inoculation messages could effective dimmock et al studied inoculation messages used increase participants reported enjoyment interest physical exercise study participants exposed inoculating messages given intentionally boring exercise routine messages cause reinforcement individuals positive attitude towards exercise result increase likelihood continue exercise inoculation theory used combat misinformation regarding vaccine related beliefs vaccinations helped stop spread many infections diseases effectiveness become controversial topic western studies show misinformation regarding science played major role hesitancy vaccinations common misconceptions include influenza vaccine giving flu link mmr vaccine autism regardless many scientific studies debunking claims people still cling study conducted see inoculation theory combat vaccine participants study group young women completed doses human papillomavirus vaccine hpv study wanted see effect attack messages questioned importance safety specific vaccine vaccines making arguments vaccines brief lapse time control group exposed inoculation messages favor arguments made participants asked take part posttest
