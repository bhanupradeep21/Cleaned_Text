gilbert syndrome gs syndrome liver affected individuals processes bilirubin slowly many people never occasionally jaundice slight yellowish color skin whites eyes may gilbert syndrome due genetic variant gene results decreased activity bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase typically inherited autosomal recessive pattern occasionally autosomal dominant pattern depending type episodes jaundice may triggered stress exercise menstruation diagnosis based higher levels unconjugated bilirubin blood without either signs liver problems red blood cell typically treatment gilbert syndrome associated decreased cardiovascular health jaundice significant phenobarbital may used aids conjugation gilbert syndrome affects people united males often diagnosed often noticed late childhood early condition first described augustin nicolas gilbert syndrome produces elevated level unconjugated bilirubin bloodstream normally consequences mild jaundice may appear conditions exertion stress fasting infections condition otherwise usually severe cases seen yellowing skin tone yellowing conjunctiva gilbert syndrome reported contribute accelerated onset neonatal jaundice syndrome cause severe indirect hyperbilirubinemia neonates may summative effect rising bilirubin combined example presence increased red blood cell destruction due diseases situation especially dangerous quickly treated high bilirubin causes irreversible neurological disability form enzymes defective gs udp glucuronosyltransferase family polypeptide also responsible livers ability detoxify

levels unconjugated bilirubin adults however substances glucuronidized affected enzymes gilberts syndrome could theoretically toxic levels cause consequently debate exists whether gs classified however gilbert syndrome linked increased risk mutations gene lead gilbert gene provides instructions making bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase bilirubinugt enzyme found liver cells responsible removal bilirubin bilirubinugt enzyme performs chemical reaction called glucuronidation glucuronic acid transferred unconjugated bilirubin yellowish pigment made body breaks old red blood converted conjugated bilirubin reaction conjugated bilirubin passes liver intestines bile excreted stool people gilbert syndrome approximately percent normal bilirubinugt enzyme function contributes lower rate glucuronidation unconjugated bilirubin substance accumulates body causing mild gilbert syndrome phenotypic effect mostly associated increased blood bilirubin levels also sometimes characterized mild jaundice due increased unconjugated bilirubin arises several different genotypic variants gene enzyme responsible changing bilirubin conjugated formcitation needed gilberts syndrome characterized reduction glucuronidation activity enzyme gene located human chromosome polymorphisms gene known designated n general chronological order discovery either gene promoter region associated tata box promoter region region commonly contains genetic sequence variant accounts alleles many populations however several allelic polymorphic variants region occur common results adding another dinucleotide repeat ta promoter region resulting called common variant accounts alleles populations seen less often around alleles southeast east asian people pacific islanderscitation needed
