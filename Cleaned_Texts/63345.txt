study neurology neurosurgery dates back prehistoric times academic disciplines begin century observational science developed systematic way approaching nervous system possible interventions neurological disease trepanation similar techniques used today oldest surgical procedure known practised stone age many parts areas may quite widespread main pieces archaeological evidence forms cave paintings human remains one third skulls found site france dating bce undergone also practised widely precolumbian procedures mostly performed combatants evidence skeletal remains revealing earliest methods usually resulted however incas proved skilled surgeons survival rates rose infection rates following procedure low evidence found showing individuals survived surgery multiple incan surgeons
