nerve predicts correctly infarcts affecting dorsal pons level abducens nucleus also affect facial nerve producing ipsilateral facial palsy together lateral rectus palsy anatomy also predicts correctly infarcts involving ventral pons affect sixth nerve corticospinal tract simultaneously producing lateral rectus palsy associated contralateral hemiparesis rare syndromes interest primarily useful
