snakeskin may either refer skin live snake shed skin snake molting type leather made hide dead snake snakeskin scales varying patterns color formations providing protection via camouflage colors iridescence scales largely determined types amount chromatophores located dermis snake snakes skin scales also important feature locomotion providing protection minimizing friction gliding living snake skin often deals various forms abrasion combat rough substrates snakes formed specialized multilayered organizational epidermal structures provide safe efficient sliding locomotion maneuvering rough snakes ornately patterned striped banded solid green blue yellow red black orange brown spotted unique pattern color schemes serve many functions including camouflage heat absorption reflection may play less understood roles melanin cells skin often overlap form complex patterns sheets highly sometimes soft integument snake colored differently hard scales often utilized method predator coloration snakes largely due pigment cells distribution scales lightly colored centers arise regions reduced cuticle thinner cuticle indicates sensory organ scales general numerous coat epidermis come shapes colors helpful identification snake species chromatophores dermis yield coloration light shines corneal layer many kinds chromatophores melanophores yield brown pigmentation paired guanophores yield grey paired guanophores lipophores yellow results guanophores allophores added melanophores red pigment carotenoids also help produce orange red dark snakes dark brown black color appear due melanocytes active epidermis melanin absent albino individuals result snakes possess blue green pigments instead arise guanophores also called iridocytes iridocytes reside dermis responsible iridescent appearance many darkcolored snakes males females may show varied coloration might hatchlings adults snakeskin integument patterns scales scales patterning features snakeskin derived soft complex integument scale patterns unique species scales help locomoting providing friction buffer snake reptiles including snakes possess extensive keratinization epidermis form epidermal snakes epidermis composed four layers outer layer snakes skin shed periodically therefore temporary layer highly keratinized beneath outer layer corneal layer stratum corneum thickened flexible corneal layer intermediary zone stratum granulosum basal layer stratum basale respectively dermis snake resides beneath dermis snakes generally fibrous nature dermis houses pigment cells nerves collagen fibers nerve fibers extend snake epidermis anchor near scales generally rostral head end snake specifically nerves anchor sensory spines pits touch thermal detection organs respectively hypodermis dermis layer mainly stores skin snake physically protective layer helps prevent injury prevents drying helps snakes minimize snakeskin composed soft flexible inner layer alphalayer well hard inflexible outer surface due lack limbs snake bodies contact surface times causing large amount result minimize friction order move forward generate friction order create enough propulsion move scale skin orientation helps accomplish demonstrated nanostructures scales may play role specifically inner alphalayer contains alphakeratins serve cytoskeletal proteins mechanical form resistance additionally reduce friction snakes polish scales secrete oily substance nasal passage rub secretion scales done varying intervals depending species snake sometimes frequently times shedding molting thought scale polishing used method waterproofing may also play role chemical messaging friction lastly scales snake skin provide protection form found betakeratins aid formation scales keratin proteins produce precorneous layer densely packed epidermal scales creating thick corneous protective layer skin permeability may change seasonally snakes help problem drying known desert snakes generally impermeable skins aquatic snakes permeable skin sometimes trap water prevent drying snakes may change environment throughout year may subsequently change skins permeability result instance aquatic snakes may latch water environment drying attracting layer water many glands present snake skin snake glands holocrine glands meaning glands cells secreted along substance gland makes holocrine glands snakes blood supply thus lie closely vascularized connective tissue snakes also possess glands aid attracting mates marine snake species possess salt gland helps remove excess salt glands reptiles poorly understood due skin lies beneath snakes scales also responsible snakes regions snake scales made soft integument called alphalayer composed alphakeratin allows flexibility snake mobility dependent skins contact friction surface tribological behavior snake skin allows quick precise changes smooth gliding occur snakeskin composed sharp spines interlocking longitudinal ridges snakeskin also contains highly organized microhairs along ventral underneath surface oriented caudal towards back direction features snake able efficiently slide forward surfaces low friction create high friction needing retreat snakes belong group reptiles called lepidosauria reptiles overlapping scales grouped squamata includes snakes lizards two species lepidosauria belong rynchocephalia tuatara species belonging subgroups likewise share similar skin features snakes unique adaptations features molting skin occurs regularly molting common results entire outer layer epidermis case snakes called shedding ecdysis snakes rub rough surfaces shed skin shed skin much longer snake shed skin covers top bottom scale skin shed intact scale unwrapped top bottom side scale almost doubles
