mechanism action meldonium act fatty acid oxidation inhibitor presumably inhibiting enzymes carnitine biosynthesis pathway γbutyrobetaine although initial reports suggested meldonium noncompetitive nonhydroxylatable analogue studies identified meldonium substrate gammabutyrobetaine xray crystallographic vitro biochemical studies suggest meldonium binds substrate pocket γbutyrobetaine hydroxylase acts alternative substrate therefore competitive normally enzymes action substrates γbutyrobetaine gives presence substrate oxygen products lcarnitine succinate carbon dioxide presence alternate
