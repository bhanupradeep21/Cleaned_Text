chains bud hyphae youngest conidia farthest sexual state known c cladophialophora carrionii cause disease called chromoblastomycosis individuals normal functioning immune system unlike many pathogenic fungi cause disease immunocompromised one common agents fungus changes states invades animal host mycelial state muriform cells spread outward dimorphism suggested increase tolerance c carrionii extreme conditions high temperature acidity human muriform cells increase cell number septum formation within hyphae rather chromoblastomycosis results subcutaneous crusty lesions spread large areas different parts body legs arms treated lesions continue increase size body usually pose risk lesions grow take multiple forms resemble nodes tumours resemble cauliflowers infection causes inflammation

predominant agricultural industry rural areas deforestation must carried provide agricultural land directly work plants commonly colonized c chromoblastomycosis infection occurs subcutaneous puncture thorn splinter infected c carrionii decaying cacti scratching lesions worsens infection spreading fungus larger distal areas field workers work without foot protection clothing covering legs arms greater risk inoculation material colonized c immunocompromised individuals also risk ability produce antibodies fungal proteins critical minimizing fungal c carrionii may penetrate deeper muscle bone layers patient even individual immunocompetent may risk carry antigen since presence may increase individual susceptibility contracting histology tests skin biopsy identify muriform cells commonly found identifying specific agent caused chromoblastomycosis done pcr culturing fungus growing agar plate observing colony morphology sporulation however c carrionii grows quite slowly culture

strengthens fungal cell wall neutralize enzymes produced macrophages normally function break targeted minor cases chromoblastomycosis resolved surgery antifungal cold therapy cryosurgery applying cool
