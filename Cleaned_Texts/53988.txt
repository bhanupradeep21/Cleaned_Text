violet wands madeforplay units purposes sexual stimulation electrostimulation associated bdsm activities erotic electrostimulation evolution practice electrostimulation general cause tissue damage even death common problems arising electrostimulation tend burns lack sufficiently wide surface contact ie bad contact electrode skins even relatively low current voltage also risk interference normal heart function potentially including cardiac arrest risk higher use artificial pacemaker similar device heart advisable place electrical contacts way current passes chest international standard basic safety medical nerve muscle stimulators advises stimulation applied across head directly eyes covering mouth front neck especially carotid sinus electrodes placed chest upper back crossing standard also notes electrodes current densities exceeding may require special attention operator imposes following limits output parameters stimulators therapeutic purposes erotic electrostimulation devices avoid dc currents entirely order avoid electrolytic effects usually achieved biphasic waveforms positive current pulse followed equivalent negative current pulse devices multiple channels eg several users body regions small pulse isolation transformer galvanic isolation channel currents flow across body channels pulse frequency duration amplitude selected achieve desired stimulation least amount power delivered body example avoiding current refractory period action potential neurons respond stimuli typical erotic electrostimulation devices use pulse frequencies range hz skin nerves sensitive

stimulation units also used electrostimulation first devices manufactured specifically erotic electrostimulation became available particular titillator pleasure box later known pes power box experimenters noticed bare speaker wires could deliver jolt began using recorded live sound electrostimulation time professionally made attachments play people built copper plumbing parts metal pieces attention resistors placed series human parts control current safety although early estim units used simple pulsed sinusoidal wave newer units use complex wave forms also allow use ambient sound prerecorded wave forms like music specially designed computer files specific types stimulation sites dedicated creation files specifically erotic journeys symphonies include routines rewards
