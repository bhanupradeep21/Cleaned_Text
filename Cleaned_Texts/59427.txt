myelography type radiographic examination uses contrast medium detect pathology spinal cord including location spinal cord injury cysts tumors historically procedure involved injection radiocontrast agent cervical lumbar spine followed several xray projections today myelography largely replaced use mri scans although technique still sometimes used certain circumstances though usually conjunction ct rather xray projections procedure used look level spinal cord disease occurs compression spinal cord neck region unable unwilling undergone mri scan procedure look level spinal cord disease lumbar nerve root compression cauda equina syndrome conus medullaris lesions spinal stenosis done unwilling unable mri scan spine lumbar puncture done injected contrast thecal sac however dangerous lumbar puncture raised intracranial pressure recently done lumbar puncture one week time may cerebrospinal fluid csf accumulates subdural space thus needle maybe mistakenly inserted subdural space rather targeted subarachnoid ap lateral oblique radiographic views lumbar spine taken oblique view used examine exiting nerve roots cauda image thoracic spine lumbar puncture done contrast medium injected puncture site subject lie one side head table lowered subjects head supported bolster pad prevent contrast flowing contrast media injected thecal sac subject rotated longitudinally times ensure even coating contrast around spinal cord reduce possibility layering contrast media ct general anesthesia required children years old children years old children spinal cord diseases lumbar puncture may damage spinal cord due possibility tethered spinal cord syndrome spinal cord located usual spinal termination therefore lumbar puncture done lowest position possible cases however spinal cord injury rare also possibility herniation cerebellar tonsils puncture done watersoluble nonionic iodinated contrast agent used nowadays cause little complication unlike oilbased dye used previously cause arachnoiditis however history allergy iodine contraindicated use iodinated ct scan typically performed radiographic contrast media dye placed fluoroscopic guidance saclike lining first hardest outermost layer spinal meninges spinal dura mater surrounding spinal cord nerves material typically watersoluble largely replaced nonsoluble oilbased fluids ct largely replaced conventional xray projections used image acquisition past process usually involves lying face table lower extremities secured tightly straps table skin area numbed dye injected thecal sac table slowly rotated circular motion first head end approximately minutes rotated head end duration several minutes lying flat process complete movement ensures contrast sufficiently worked way spinal cord followed xrays ct scan postprocedure care centers around ensuring infection especially skin subcutaneous infections myelitis meningitis encephalitis sepsis set plug site spinal tap become dislodged patients usually instructed avoid strenuous activity heavy lifting example patients given instructions keep heads elevated least degrees specified number hours complications surgery cause loss cerebrospinal fluid csf could cause severe headaches corrected returning medical facility perform blood patch procedure small amount blood taken arm injected exact spinal tap location stop leaking csf nowadays mri replaced mri preferable injection contrast medium spinal canal infrequently needed better images however ct myelogram may useful patients undergo mri eg pacemakers cochlear implants ct preferred mri images limited metallic artifact titanium disc replacement implants screws metals reactive mri device components prior late iofendylate trade names pantopaque myodil radiocontrast agent typically employed procedure iodinated oilbased substance physician performing spinal tap usually attempted remove end procedure step difficult painful complete removal could always achieved process removing contrast agent necessitated removing patients csf along resulting deficiency csf gave rise severe headache patient raised prone position requiring bed rest laying position moreover iofendylates persistence body might sometimes lead arachnoiditis potentially painful debilitating lifelong disorder led extensive litigation around world since substance administered millions myelography patients course three
