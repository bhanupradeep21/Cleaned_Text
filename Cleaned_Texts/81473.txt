explanatory style psychological attribute indicates people explain experience particular event either positive negative aspect covers degree person attributes cause event internal external sources optimist might attribute bad experience stroke bad luck whereas pessimist might unreasonably assume fault punishment person might also attribute responsibility actions external forces maladaptive unhealthy way eg choice get violent aspect covers characteristics considered stable versus unstable across time optimist would tend define failures unstable didnt study enough particular test whereas pessimist might think example im never good tests distinction covers global versus local andor specific extent effect pessimist might example think everywhere misery optimist think dealings mostly honest people people generally tend blame negative events believe events continue indefinitely let events affect many aspects lives display called pessimistic explanatory conversely people generally tend blame outside forces negative events believe events end soon let events affect many aspects lives display called optimistic explanatory research suggested pessimistic explanatory style may
