toyotamaphimeia named toyotamahime genus extinct gavialid crocodylian lived japan taiwan pleistocene specimen recovered osaka university construction new science building dated around thousand years old based stratum toyotamaphimeia fairly large crocodylian measuring approximately metres ft long two species named machikanensis japan taiwanica taiwan originally described members genus tomistoma first bones belonging toyotamaphimeia discovered may construction new school building grounds ôsaka university field survey conducted shortly afterwards confirming presence fossils however yet identifying crocodilian nature following survey several digs organized starting june skull found september second dig third excavation held december yielded material toyotamaphimeia well fossil shellfish insects plant remains finally fourth excavation took place january following analysis fossils material assigned genus tomistoma named tomistoma years initial discovery skull redescribed deemed different enough tomistoma erect new genus toyotamaphimeia creating comb nov toyotamaphimeia machikanensis turn aoki also changed species name machikanense machikanensis new genus name similar remains also known taiwan classified tomistoma taiwanicum toyotamaphimeia sp respectively study concluded belonged single taxon taiwanese form retained species name placed toyotamaphimeia creating new combination generic name derives toyotamahime goddess japanese mythology ability change appearance species epithet machikanensis means mountain machikane ja待兼山 taiwanica derives holotype

vertebra making difficult determine exact length animal first research paper described type species tentatively suggested body length estimate metres ft based assumption caudal vertebrae total would

katsura suggests may result intraspecific fights furthermore hypothesizing could mean osaka university specimen may although holotype toyotamaphimeia first substantial best preserved evidence

features shows toyotamaphimeia member tomistominae related false crocodylinae cairense tomistoma schlegelii false gharial lusitanicum coppensi based morphological studies extinct taxa tomistomines including living false gharial long thought classified crocodiles closely related however recent molecular studies using dna sequencing consistently indicated false gharial tomistoma inference related extinct forms tomistominae actually belong gavialoidea following interpretation iijima et al found toyotamaphimeia basal member gavialinae clading together miocene penghusuchus newly named resulting group later supported study following inclusion geologically older species toyotamaphimeia taiwanica although resulting tree poorly resolved contained large polytomy said study cho tsai argued toyotamaphimeia originated taiwan evolved acquire large body size gigantothermic physiology eventually migrated taiwan dispersed farther north japan also stated tomistomines variably recovered either
