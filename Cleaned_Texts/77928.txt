mainstream neuroscience research initially creating experimentally verifiable predictions today cementing tools essential component data modelling arsenal rajan completed phd rajan worked postdoctoral research fellow princeton university theoretical biophysicist william bialek neuroscientist david w princeton colleagues developed employed broad set tools physics engineering computer science build new conceptual frameworks describing relationship cognitive processes biophysics across many scales biological rajans postdoctoral work bialek explored innovative method modelling neural phenomenon feature feature selectivity idea neurons tuned respond specific discrete components incoming sensory information later individual components merged generate overall perception sensory understand brain might receive complex inputs detect individual features rajan treated problem like dimensionality reduction instead typical linear model rajan showed using quadratic forms features stimulus maximally informative variables found without prior assumptions approach allows unbiased estimates receptive fields rajan worked david tank show sequential activation neurons common feature working memory decision making demonstrated starting neural network models random process termed partial innetwork training used model match real neural data posterior parietal cortex rather feedforward connections neural sequences model propagate network via recurrent synaptic interactions well guided external modelling highlighted potential learning derive highly unstructured network work uncovered sensitivity natural stimuli arises neurons selectivity influences sensorimotor learning neural sequences observed different brain regions arise minimally plastic largely disordered circuits published june rajan became assistant professor department neuroscience friedman brain institute icahn school medicine mount sinai principal investigator rajan lab brain research ai ny work focuses integrative theories describe behavior emerges cooperative activity multiscale neural processes gain insight fundamental brain processes learning memory multitasking reasoning rajan develops theories based neural network architectures inspired biology well mathematical computational frameworks often used extract information neural behavioral theories use neural network models flexible enough accommodate various levels biological detail neuronal synaptic circuit levels uses crossdisciplinary approach provides critical insights neural circuits learn execute functions ranging working memory decision making reasoning
