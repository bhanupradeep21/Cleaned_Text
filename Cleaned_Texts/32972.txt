anesthetic american english anaesthetic british english see spelling differences drug used induce anesthesia words result temporary loss sensation awareness may divided two broad classes general anesthetics result reversible loss consciousness local anesthetics cause reversible loss sensation limited region body without necessarily affecting wide variety drugs used modern anesthetic practice many rarely used outside anesthesiology others used commonly various fields healthcare combinations anesthetics sometimes used synergistic additive therapeutic effects adverse effects however may also anesthetics distinct analgesics block sensation painful local anesthetic agents prevent transmission nerve impulses without causing unconsciousness act reversibly binding fast sodium channels within nerve fibers thereby preventing sodium entering fibres stabilising cell membrane preventing action potential propagation local anesthetics suffix names local anesthetics either ester amidebased ester local anesthetics procaine amethocaine cocaine benzocaine tetracaine generally unstable solution fastacting rapidly metabolised cholinesterases blood plasma liver commonly induce allergic reactions amide local anesthetics lidocaine prilocaine bupivacaine levobupivacaine ropivacaine mepivacaine dibucaine etidocaine generally heatstable long shelf life around two years amides slower onset longer halflife ester anesthetics usually racemic mixtures exception levobupivacaine bupivacaine ropivacaine sropivacaine amides generally used within regional epidural spinal techniques due longer duration action provides adequate analgesia surgery labor symptomatic reliefcitation needed preservativefree local anesthetic agents may injected intrathecally pethidine also local anesthetic properties addition opioid volatile agents typically organic liquids evaporate readily given inhalation induction maintenance general anesthesia nitrous oxide xenon gases considered volatile agents ideal volatile anesthetic nonflammable nonexplosive lipidsoluble possess low blood gas solubility endorgan heart liver kidney toxicity sideeffects metabolized irritate respiratory pathwayscitation needed anaesthetic agent currently use meets requirements anaesthetic agent considered completely safe inherent risks drug interactions specific every agents widespread current use isoflurane desflurane sevoflurane nitrous oxide nitrous oxide common adjuvant gas making one longlived drugs still current use low potency produce anesthesia frequently combined agents halothane agent introduced almost completely replaced modern anesthesia practice newer agents partly side effects enflurane never gained widespread theory inhaled anesthetic agent used induction general anesthesia however halogenated anesthetics irritating airway perhaps leading coughing laryngospasm overall difficult inductions volatile agents used alone combination medications maintain anesthesia nitrous oxide potent enough used sole agent volatile agents frequently compared terms potency inversely proportional minimum alveolar concentration potency directly related lipid solubility known meyeroverton hypothesis however certain pharmacokinetic properties volatile agents become another point comparison important properties known bloodgas partition coefficient concept refers relative solubility given agent blood agents lower blood solubility ie lower partition coefficient eg desflurane give anesthesia provider greater rapidity titrating depth anesthesia permit rapid emergence anesthetic state upon discontinuing administration fact newer volatile agents eg sevoflurane desflurane popular due potency minimum alveolar concentration due versatility faster emergence anesthesia thanks lower partition coefficient many drugs used intravenously produce anesthesia sedation common two barbiturates mentioned thiopental methohexital ultrashortacting used induce maintain however though produce unconsciousness provide analgesia pain relief must used benzodiazepines used sedation surgery used induce maintain general benzodiazepines used induce general anesthesia midazolam benzodiazepines also used sedation procedures require general like barbiturates benzodiazepines painrelieving propofol one commonly used intravenous drugs employed induce maintain general also used sedation procedures like agents mentioned renders patients unconscious without producing pain favorable physiological effects etomidate primarily used sick ketamine infrequently used anesthesia unpleasant experiences sometimes occur emergence anesthesia include vivid dreaming extracorporeal experiences however like etomidate frequently used emergency settings sick patients produces fewer adverse physiological unlike intravenous anesthetic drugs previously mentioned ketamine produces profound pain relief even doses lower induce general also unlike anesthetic agents section patients receive ketamine alone appear cataleptic state unlike states anesthesia resemble normal sleep ketamineanesthetized patients profound analgesia keep eyes open maintain many opioids produce unconsciousness unreliably significant side rarely used induce anesthesia frequently used along agents intravenous nonopioid anesthetics inhalational furthermore used relieve pain patients surgery following opioids short onset duration action frequently used general anesthesia following agents longer onset duration action frequently used postoperative pain relief muscle relaxants render patients unconscious relieve pain instead sometimes used patient rendered unconscious induction anesthesia facilitate intubation surgery paralyzing skeletal musclecitation needed another potentially disturbing complication neuromuscular blockade employed anesthesia awareness situation patients paralyzed may awaken anesthesia due inappropriate decrease level drugs providing sedation pain relief missed anesthesia provider patient may aware surroundings incapable moving communicating fact neurological monitors increasingly available may help decrease incidence awareness monitors use proprietary algorithms monitoring brain activity via evoked potentials despite widespread marketing devices many case reports exist awareness anesthesia occurred despite apparently adequate anesthesia measured neurologic monitorcitation needed
