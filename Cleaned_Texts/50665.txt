sequencing hybridization class methods determining order nucleotides occur strand dna typically used looking small changes relative known dna binding one strand dna complementary strand dna doublehelix known hybridization sensitive even singlebase mismatches hybrid region short specialized mismatch detection proteins present exploited variety ways notably via dna chips microarrays thousands billions synthetic oligonucleotides found genome interest plus many known variations even possible singlebase type sequencing hybridization described largely displaced methods including sequencing synthesis sequencing ligation well porebased methods however hybridization oligonucleotides still used sequencing schemes including hybridizationassisted porebased sequencing reversible httpsenwikipediaorgwikisequencingbyhybridization
