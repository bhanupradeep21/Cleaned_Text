propel electric eels get oxygen breathing air using buccal enables live habitats widely varying oxygen levels including streams swamps uniquely among gymnotids buccal cavity lined frilled mucosa rich blood supply enabling gas exchange air every two minutes fish takes air mouth holds buccal cavity expels opercular openings sides unlike airbreathing fish tiny gills electric eels ventilate taking air

calcium help regulate voltagegated sodium channels create electrical organs also rich sodium potassium atpase ion pump used create potential difference across cell maximum discharge main organ least volts making electric eels powerful electric freshwater fishes like electric eel require high voltage give strong shock freshwater high resistance powerful marine electric fishes like torpedo ray give shock much lower voltage far higher current electric eel produces strong discharge extremely rapidly rate much hertz meaning shock lasts two generate high voltage electric eel stacks electrocytes
