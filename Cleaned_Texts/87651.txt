fertilizer small collection bones recovered included number bird species namely two extinct hawks extinct owl remains crow woodpecker latter two similar forms found modern cuba remains described alexander wetmore later year named one two extinct hawks new species titanohierax gloveralleni species diagnosis based single tarsometatarus wetmore noted similar great black hawk buteogallus urubitinga time known hypomorphnus urubitinga also assigned partial metacarpal genus based massive size similarity morphology element b wetmore mistakenly noted fossils coming island great exuma paper max hecht first evidence appear hecht noted sites matching description given wetmore fossiliferous soils removed remains holotype titanohierax likely found upper pasture cave located fifty feet sea level facing western side little although much uncertainty estimating age aforementioned cave deposits though considerable antiquity predating european arrival americas pierce brodkorb gives first confident dating extinct bahaman avifauna titanohierax part discovery fossil material deposit new providence island bahamas site sinkhole limestone western side island found dr j c dickinson jr carried preliminary excavations together dr walter auffenberg august year due presence large banana tree growing sinkhole designated site banana hole based number lines evidence geological faunal nature age site estimated wisconsin glacial stage specifically prepamlico portion puts age site around years brodkorb noted accumulation remains banana hole site must caused activity large raptor would proven right publication storrs olson colleagues tentatively attributed nearly complete right ulna fragment left ulna site titanohierax referral made mostly based large size specimens publication would also refer mostly complete tarsometatarsus another site animal referrals would extend known range titanohierax islands new providence publication would also refer specimens collected cuban deposits titanohierax material consisted two distal portions tibiotarsi femur lacking distal end pedal phalanges named aquila borrasi oscar arredondo however notes arredondos late collaborator bryan patterson would reveal already suspicion remains species titanohierax leading new combination titanohierax next significant mention titanohierax would come publication gary morgan assigned two mandibular symphyses cave grand cayman titanohierax based size morphological similarity william su√°rez published paper would refute referral aquila borrasi titanohierax based new wellpreserved material establishing even though borrasi valid species belong genus titanohierax reduced range animal considerably cuban material referred would describe animal formally together storrs olson referring genus buteogallus paper would also see material referred titanohierax morgan taken instead listed accipitridae gen et sp paper david steadman colleagues listed referred material hispaniola much long gracile belong titanohierax large hawk estimated weight around kg lb making roughly equal size females largest living animal solely known tarsometatarsus partial metacarpal two titanohieraxs tarsometatarsus much larger living buteogalline closest relatives wetmore description animal directly compares buteogallus urubitinga noting number differences bone broader distal end number differences noted trochlea connection shaft also robust pronounced besides surface hallux articulates extends higher shaft also robust wetmore also described partial metacarpal referred species based similarity b urubitinga massive size based size tarsometatarsus metacarpal wetmore estimated titanohierax would nearly twice size b ulna animal also considerable size total length specimen florida state museum estimated mm long mm wide broadest though originally noted closely related genus hypomorphnus buteogallus wetmore later studies would indicate gloveralleni closely related taxa genus extinct crabhawk buteogallus borrasi formerly placed titanohierax genus gloveralleni assigned genus buteogallus pleistocene titanohierax apex predator bahaman brodkorb noted remains found banana hole site probably accumulated feeding activities raptorial birds already hinting fact filled major predatory niche olson colleagues would go note extinction titanohierax large raptors west indies likely linked decline presence rodent geocapromys assumed preferred prey jessica oswald steadman would corroborate publication listing loss preferred habitat another possible factor decline eventual extinction animal go mention decrease size caribbean islands following end last glaciation event probably play substantial part titanohierax alive years ago bahamas much different today islands cays make archipelago would linked together due drop sea level consolidating five major islands handful minor islands time also referred wisconsinan glacial stage temperature islands would lower today estimates suggesting decrease degrees celsius bahaman fossil record provides evidence altered floral community well latter line altered conditions throughout westindies even first description titanohierax evident avifauna bahamas extended caribbean much richer recent past modern brodkorb writes avifauna appeared around richer modern day bahamas faunal tie greater antilles stronger today tie florida weaker modern day relatively meager avifauna modern day bahamas explained small surface area group compared landmasses caribbean like cuba hispaniola florida also explains avifauna recent past diverse considering fact island group greatly increased surface area periods httpsenwikipediaorgwikititanohierax
