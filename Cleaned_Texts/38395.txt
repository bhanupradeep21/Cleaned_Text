choroideremia kɒˌrɔɪdɪˈriːmiə chm rare xlinked recessive form hereditary retinal degeneration affects roughly males disease causes gradual loss vision starting childhood night blindness followed peripheral vision loss progressing loss central vision later life progression continues throughout individuals life rate change degree visual loss variable among affected even within choroideremia

cell death gradual deterioration retinal pigment epithelium rpe photoreceptors treatment choroideremia however retinal gene therapy clinical trials demonstrated possible since chm gene located x chromosome symptoms seen almost exclusively men exceptions female carriers noticeable lack pigmentation rpe experience female carriers chance either affected son carrier daughter male choroideremia carrier daughters unaffected sons even though disease progression vary general trends first symptom many individuals choroideremia notice significant loss night vision begins peripheral vision loss occurs gradually starting ring vision loss continuing tunnel vision individuals choroideremia tend maintain good visual acuity eventually lose sight point age study individuals choroideremia found patients age visual acuity better patients years old visual acuity worse severe visual acuity impairment able count fingers worse occur seventh decade life study found mean rate visual acuity loss logmar per years roughly row snellen diagnosis choroideremia made based family history symptoms characteristic appearance however choroideremia shares several clinical features retinitis pigmentosa similar broader group retinal degenerative diseases making specific diagnosis difficult without genetic testing choroideremia often initially misdiagnosed retinitis variety different genetic testing techniques used make differential nothing currently done stop reverse retinal degeneration steps taken slow rate vision loss uvblocking sunglasses outdoors appropriate dietary intake fresh fruit leafy green vegetables antioxidant vitamin supplements regular intake dietary verylongchain fatty acids one study found dietary supplement lutein increases macular pigment levels patients choroideremia long period time elevated levels pigmentation could slow retinal additional interventions may needed include surgical correction retinal detachment cataracts low vision services counseling help cope depression loss independence anxiety job gene therapy currently treatment option however human clinical trials choroideremia lebers congenital amaurosis lca produced somewhat promising clinical trials gene therapy patients lca began three different general studies found therapy safe somewhat effective promising future treatment similar retinal diseases first gene therapy treatment choroideremia surgery performed robert maclaren professor ophthalmology university oxford leader clinical ophthalmology research group nuffield laboratory ophthalmology study doses vector injected subretinally patients choroideremia study objectives despite retinal detachment caused injection study observed initial improved rod cone function warranting study researchers optimistic positive results choroideremia patients treated four half years gene therapy four countries could women carry mutation chm gene preimplantation genetic diagnosis used invitro fertilization process select unaffected embryos process call applied monogenic disease choroideremia ideal candidate gene potential therapies could restore vision lost later life foremost stem cell therapy clinical trial published found subretinal injection human embryonic stem cells patients agerelated macular degeneration stargardt disease safe improved vision patients patients vision improved improved remained decreased patient improvement seen untreated eyes study found evidence adverse proliferation rejection serious ocular systemic safety issues related transplanted study used repair mutations patientderived induced pluripotent stem cells cause xlinked retinitis study suggests patients repaired cells could used therapy reducing risk immune rejection ethical issues come use embryonic stem cells choroideremia first
