chronic endothelial injury hypothesis one two major mechanisms postulated explain underlying cause atherosclerosis coronary heart disease chd lipid hypothesis although ongoing debate involving connection dietary lipids chd sometimes portrays two hypotheses opposed way mutually exclusive moreover since discovery role ldl cholesterol ldlc pathogenesis atherosclerosis two hypotheses become tightly linked number molecular cellular ross glomset initially proposed endothelial cell uncovering first step development hypotheses associated role infectious agents eg cytomegalovirus chlamydia pneumoniae helicobacter pylori inflammatory responses arterial currently research seems focus inflammatory processes associate endothelial dysfunction lipoprotein accumulationcitation needed first phase inflammatory process marked accumulation lipid lowdensity lipoprotein ldl particles beneath endothelium followed attachment leukocytes monocytes tlymphocytes endothelial cell surface leukocytes migrate subendothelial space aggregate within intima presence elevated levels oxidized ldl oxldl monocytes converted activated macrophages macrophages accumulate modified lipid particles become foam cells formation foam cells continued accumulation intima lead formation fatty streaks continued cell migration proliferation eventually result formation fibrous ldl accumulates subendothelial space tends become modified oxidized ldl plays several key roles furthering course inflammatory process chemotactic monocytes oxidized ldl causes endothelial cells secrete molecules cause monocytes penetrate endothelial cells accumulate oxidized ldl promotes death endothelial cells augmenting apoptosis also activation collagenases oxldl contributes process may lead rupture fibrous oxidized ldl decreases availability endothelial nitric oxide turn increases adhesion monocytes moreover involved paracrine signalling endothelium smooth muscle maintains vascular tone without muscle relax blood vessel remains constricted thus oxidized ldl also contributes hypertension often seen atherosclerosis role ldl plays suggests two different approaches treatment prevention first approach involves discouraging accumulation ldl lowering levels serum ldl idea closely associated lipid hypothesis major breakthrough involved discovery statins class drugs help clear ldl bloodstream demonstrated conclusively elevated levels ldl associated higher risk mortality coronary heart disease chd also shown statins substantially lower risk mortality patients high ldlcitation needed second approach would discourage oxidation ldl thereby breaking inflammatory cycle lipoproteins consist packaging triglycerides esterified cholesterol within monolayer shell consisting phospholipids class proteins called apolipoproteins phospholipids amphipathic consisting hydrophobic tail faces inwards binding triglycerides cholesterol hydrophilic head faces outwards making lipoproteins polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa contained outer shell make lipoproteins especially susceptible oxidation however lipoproteins also contain antioxidants protect components vitamin e carotenoids two major naturally occurring antioxidants human although studies shown positive results following antioxidant therapy vitamin vitamin e therapy attracted public attention positive though recent studies shown benefit antioxidant therapy mortality among patients risk early incarnation lipid hypothesis focused hypercholesterolemia lead suggestion mortality chd might reduced controlling dietary input cholesterol studies demonstrated increasing dietary cholesterol leads increase total cholesterol tc ldl cholesterol ldlc however also leads increases level highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol hdlc offsetting effect increase ldlc epidemiological studies attempted correlate dietary cholesterol risk mortality chd produced mixed recent studies focused ratio saturated fatty acids sfas polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas diet demonstrated intake sfa raises tc humans whereas pufa lowers tc however sfa also increases level hdlc offsetting effect increased tc studies individual fatty acids show sfas eg stearic acid palmitic acid little effect ldlc levels stearic acid actually lowers ldlhdl ratio due greater increase hdlc levels relative epidemiological studies designed test relationship high sfapufa

promulgate set dietary guidelines included recommendation replace saturated fats found dairy meat products polyunsaturated fats found natural vegetable oils derived corn cottonseed soya first set recommendations published journal circulation specifically sanctioned use products containing partially hydrogenated vegetable oils ie margarine vegetable despite lack uncontrovertable epidemiological evidence effectiveness initial guidelines received widespread acceptance among medical community us suggestion replace saturated animal fats partially hydrogenated vegetable oils lead reaction discussed however important note ahas dietary guidelines undergone several revisions since initial report although recent guidelines still recommend reducing consumption saturated fat longer suggest switching polyunsaturated fats moreover guidelines recommend minimizing intake partially hydrogenated fats increasing consumption fish sources rich fatty thus position aha much closer critics critics aha dietary guidelines point incidence chd us increased markedly period beginning period consumption saturated fat fell consumption processed vegetable oils rose much evidence presented support claim large increase incidence chd early part century anecdotal statistics covering period show mortality chd us although much higher countries began decline slowly mortality uk although initially much lower us rose continuously period mortality figures downward trend us probably reflects improvements survival rate decrease observation led critics invert aha guidelines stress benefits dietary sfa
