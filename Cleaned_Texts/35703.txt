emotional responsivity ability acknowledge affective stimuli exhibiting sharp change emotion according persons emotional increased emotional responsivity refers demonstrating response stimulus reduced emotional responsivity refers demonstrating less response response exhibited exposure stimulus whether appropriate would considered emotional response although emotional responsivity applies nonclinical populations typically associated individuals schizophrenia autism emotional responsivity connected broader psychology concepts emotions people exhibit emotions response outside stimuli positive affective stimuli trigger feelings pleasure happiness negative affective stimuli trigger feelings displeasure disgust emotional responses include limited facial expressions neurophysiological activities example people display smile exposed positive stimuli frown exposed negative stimuli feeling associated emotion called affect categorized valence arousal valence describes degree feeling pleasure displeasure arousal describes degree person awoken outside clinical studies emotional responsivity involve two essential procedures first researchers try stimulate emotions participants engaging participants specific tasks researchers measure degree participants respond stimuli tasks used stimulate emotional responses include exposing participants affective stimuli researchers typically use following methods measure record sometimes code emotional responsivity autism associated decreased emotional responsivity study involving twentysix children autism fifteen children learning disabilities adult displayed form emotion study children respond focused attention hedonic tone latency changes tone emotional contagion summery made studies show correlations measures joint attention emotional contagion severity autism results demonstrate children autism demonstrate changes affect however responses occurred much less comparison another study involving twentyone autism patients facs analysis demonstrates people autism display less facial responsivity watching evocative films specifically compared control group autism group demonstrate complex muscular movements displayed less differentiated facial responses exposed stimuli study confirms autism impedes social interaction schizophrenia impacts emotional responsivity reducing person hedonic capacity producing blunted affect patients usually increased emotional response displeasure decreased emotional response pleasure study involving outpatients demonstrates schizophrenia increases emotional responsivity low arousing negative stimuli decreases emotional responsivity high arousing positive stimuli people schizophrenia exhibit fewer facial expressions watching evocative differences arousal level stimuli paranoid nonparanoid schizophrenia nonparanoid patients increased negative emotional responsitivity decreased positive emotional disregarding arousal levels comparison paranoid schizophrenia increased emotional responsivity low arousing stimuli reduced responsivity high arousing stimuli study supports schizophrenia disturbs emotional traumatic brain injury associated reduced responsivity negative affective stimuli study involving twentyone tbi individuals uses picture stimuli demonstrate people tbi normal emotional responsivity pleasant pictures show limited responses unpleasant pictures potential explanation tbi damages ventral surfaces frontal temporal lobes areas associated emotional math anxiety describes situation person overly distressed math stimuli study involving fmri techniques students demonstrates people math anxiety increased emotional responsivity math stimuli study suggests exposed mathrelated stimuli amygdala activity increases participants brain lowers threshold responding potential threat moreover participants math anxiety disengage avoid math stimuli images negative valence bleeding arm study suggests math anxiety resembles types phobia increased vigilance responsivity specific posttraumatic stress disorder impacts emotional responsivity study showed people high ptsd severity abuse much substances others difficulties controlling emotions able regulate emotions found symptoms ptsd problems alcohol drug using cocaine pregnancy creates neurological damage fetus neurobehavioral problems infants infants participated study infants prenatal exposure cocaine results demonstrate compared control group cocaineexposed infants decreased emotional responsivity exhibit fewer expressions joy interest surprise anger sadness specifically cocaineexposed group reduced response positive affective stimuli suggesting cocaineexposure pregnancy decreases feelings alcohol consumption impairs affective processing therefore leads abnormal responses environmental stimuli study involving abstinent alcoholics nonalcoholic demonstrates alcoholics usually lower emotional responsivity erotic happy aversive gruesome stimuli however indepth analysis fmri images reveals gender differences alcoholic men reduced emotional responsivity alcoholic women increased emotional responsivity positive affective stimuli study suggests gender difference associated different functional abnormalities emotional processing cortical subcortical cerebellar regions opioids shown help decrease negative emotional responsivity study involving people using opioids people using opioids found using drug decreased levels depression elation compared group using drug tend show less emotional responsivity said unique association social interaction studies suggest social interaction especially home influence way child responds emotional stimuli example child grew home emotional displays resulted punishment negative criticism child would tendency find ways hide sleeping issues children linked many physical mental health problems later adulthood created greater risk emotional behavioral issues children studies havent able link physiological functions sleeping disturbances psychological emotional liability responsivity psychological responses positive negative picture stimuli result sleep deprivation doctors today using neuroimaging connect relationship sleep neural mechanisms cause emotional responsively children studies resulted general largest extensive sleeprelated correlations emotion found disgust developed treatment
