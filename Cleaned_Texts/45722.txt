stewart cohen noted description suitable human minds grasp must type lietochildren truth much complicated limited concept gained greater exposure coauthored science discworld author terry pratchett book authors acknowledge people might dispute applicability term lie defending grounds best possible reasons still interview promoting book pratchett cautioned us need enough knowledge sciences delivered us metaphors analogies bite us bum think theyre typical example lietochildren found physics bohr model atomic electron shells still often used introduce atomic structure moving complex models based matrix mechanics similarly chemistry students often introduced arrhenius definitions acids bases taught technically correct complex model followed lewis model order teaching chemistry concepts also reflects historical progression development models high school teachers university instructors often explain outset model present incomplete example given gerald sussman video recording
