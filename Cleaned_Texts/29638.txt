mitral valve ˈmaɪtrəl also known bicuspid valve left atrioventricular valve one four heart valves two cusps flaps lies left atrium left ventricle heart heart valves oneway valves allowing blood flow one direction mitral valve tricuspid valve known atrioventricular valves lie atria normal conditions blood flows open mitral valve diastole contraction left atrium mitral valve closes systole contraction left ventricle valve opens closes pressure differences opening greater pressure left atrium ventricle closing greater pressure left ventricle abnormal conditions blood may flow backward valve mitral regurgitation mitral valve may narrowed mitral stenosis rheumatic heart disease often affects mitral valve valve may also prolapse age affected infective endocarditis mitral valve named mitre bishop resembles mitral valve typically square centimetres sq area sits left heart left atrium left two cusps anterior one posterior opening mitral valve surrounded fibrous ring known mitral annuluscitation needed anterior cusp attaches one third circumverence annulus posterior cusp attaches remaining two thirds circumference occasionally anterior posterior cusps close orifice incompletely small additional accessory cusp present fill interval anterior cusp thicker rigid posterior covers approximately twothirds valvecitation needed anterior cusp intervenes mitral aortic although anterior leaflet takes larger part ring rises higher posterior leaflet larger surface areacitation needed carpentiers classification mitral valve posterior anterior mitral valve leaflets divided eight segments medial scallop middle scallop lateral scallop anteromedial segment anteromedial anterolateral pmc posteromedial commissure alc anterolateral mitral leaflet thickness usually mm sometimes range valve leaflets prevented prolapsing left atrium action chordae tendineae chordae tendineae inelastic tendons attached one end papillary muscles left ventricle valve cusps papillary muscles fingerlike projections wall left ventricle left ventricle contracts pressure ventricle forces valve close tendons keep leaflets coapting together prevent valve opening wrong direction thus preventing blood flowing back left atrium chord different thickness thinnest ones attached free leaflet margin whereas thickest ones strut chords attached free margin disposition important effects systolic stress distribution mitral annulus fibrous ring attached mitral valve leaflets unlike prosthetic valves continuous mitral annulus saddle shaped changes shape throughout cardiac annulus contracts reduces surface area systole help provide complete closure leaflets expansion annulus result leaflets join soundly together leading functional mitral normal diameter mitral annulus centimetres circumference centimetres microscopically evidence annular structure anteriorly mitral valve leaflet contiguous posterior aortic left ventricular diastole pressure drops left ventricle due relaxation ventricular myocardium mitral valve opens blood travels left atrium left ventricle blood travels across mitral valve occurs early filling phase left ventricle early filling phase due active relaxation ventricular myocardium causing pressure gradient allows rapid flow blood left atrium across mitral valve early filling across mitral valve seen doppler echocardiography mitral valve e wave e wave period slow filling ventricle left atrial contraction left atrial systole left ventricular diastole causes added blood flow across mitral valve immediately left ventricular systole late flow across open mitral valve seen doppler echocardiography mitral valve wave late filling left ventricle contributes volume left ventricle prior ventricular systole known atrial kick mitral annulus changes shape size cardiac cycle smaller end atrial systole due contraction left atrium around like sphincter reduction annulus size end atrial systole may important proper coapting leaflets mitral valve left ventricle contracts pumps leaking valves corrected mitral valve annuloplasty common surgical procedure aims restoring proper leaflet adjustment valvular heart diseases affect mitral valve mitral stenosis narrowing valve heard opening snap heart sound normally present classic mitral valve prolapse caused excess connective tissue thickens spongiosa layer cusp separates collagen bundles fibrosa weakens cusps adjacent tissue resulting increased cuspal area lengthening chordae tendineae elongation chordae tendineae often causes rupture commonly chordae attached posterior cusp advanced commonly involving posterior leaflet folding inversion displacement toward left valve prolapse result mitral insufficiency regurgitation backflow blood due incomplete closure valve rheumatic heart disease often affects mitral valve valve may also affected infective endocarditis also rarer forms congenital mitral valve disease often associated congenital heart anomalies parachute mitral valve occurs chordae tendineae mitral valve abnormally attached single fused papillary muscle straddling mitral valve occurs mitral valves chordal attachments straddles goes ventricular septal defect vsd chordae originating sides ventricular septum mitral valve agenesis rare defined absence minimal presence mitral valve leaflets complete agenesis one leaflets partial surgery performed replace repair damaged valve less invasive method mitral valvuloplasty uses balloon catheter open stenotic valve rarely severe form calcification mitral valve annulus mistaken intracardiac mass mitral disease classified using carpentier classification based leaflet motion type pertains normal leaflet motion whereas disease valve categorized primary mitral regurgitation secondary mitral regurgitation based regurgitant etiology type ii pertains excessive leaflet motion leading leaflet prolapse common causes include limited barlow disease myxomatous degeneration inflammation papillary muscle rupture type iii pertains restrictive motion leaflets type iiia pertains restrictive motion systole diastole type iiib pertains restrictive motion closing mitral valve tricuspid valve constitutes first heart sound
