duodenaltype follicular lymphoma dfl form lymphoma certain lymphocyte types bcellderived centrocytes centroblasts form lymph node folliclelike structures principally duodenum parts small intestine indolent disease rare occasions progresses aggressive lymphoma spreads beyond originally involved disorder termed dfl considered follicular lymphoma develops one sites gi tract ie stomach duodenum jejunum small intestine large intestine rectum well various sites outside gi tract contrasts forms follicular lymphoma involve gi disorder regarded subtype follicular lymphoma termed primary intestinal follicular lymphomas primary gastrointestinal tract follicular however follicular lymphomas duodenum parts small intestine differ forms primary intestinal lymphomas indolent highly localizes disorders low rate progression systemic disease consequence world health organization kept widespread primary intestinal lymphomas within follicular lymphoma category reclassified duodenalsmall intestinallocalized lymphoma distinct disease entity dfl currently considered malignant disease many clinical features similar benign predecessor follicular lymphomas viz situ follicular lymphoma follicular like situ follicular lymphoma dfl commonly symptomfree disease diagnosed incidentally patients undergoing endoscopy also like situ follicular lymphoma dfl may rare cases regress progress serious aggressive dfl commonly afflicts middleaged adults male female ration disease usually asymptomatic diagnosed unexpected finding examining patients upper gi tract endoscopy conducted minority patients present vague abdominal rarely specific serious symptoms obstructive jaundice caused tumors duodenum occlude bile endoscopic examination typically reveals one polyps nodules confluent whitish granules located various parts gi study patients conducted japan distributed follows first ie superior bulbus part duodenum patients second ie descending part duodenum patients combined third ie horizontal inferior fourth ie ascending part duodenum patients jejunum patients ileum patients cecum patients colon rectum patients stomach esophagus patients lesions limited second part duodenum cases lesions may dfl due accumulation monoclonal ie cells descendent single ancestral cell centrocytes precursor centroblasts form folliclelike structures duodenum parts small intestine virtually cases disease cells bear pathological genomic abnormality typical forms follicular lymphoma ie translocation position long ie q arm chromosome position chromosome q arm translocation juxtaposes bcell lymphoma gene chromosome position near immunoglobulin heavy chain locus igh chromosome position consequence causes overexpression genes product protein apoptosis regulator ie functions inhibit programmed cell death thereby prolonging cell overexpression bcells isfl thought critical factor pathological accumulation subsequent malignant gene expression profiling studies find tissues involved dfp highly express certain genes unlike expressed tissues forms follicular lymphoma closely match expressed tissues malt lymphoma lymphoma involving mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue gi tract airways conjunctiva vulvovagina tract skin highly express genes disorders include chemokine chemoattractant lymphocytes cell adhesion protein mucosal vascular endothelial cells binds homing receptor cc chemokine receptor type lymphocyte receptor working together genomic abnormalities thought deliver virtually immortalized centrocytes centroblases involved gi tract tissues duodenaltype follicular furthermore malignant cells dfl express immunoglobulin heavy chains made specific rather various gene segments igh region chromosome one study example heavy chains made form segments expressed higher percentage dfl cases expected findings along showing similarities profiles highly expressed genes dfl mantle cell lymphoma suggest dfl like mantle cell lymphoma develops consequence chronic inflammation specific antigen stimulation support possibility reports dfl regresses patients successfully treated concurrent helicobacter pylori infestation gi histological examination lesions dfl usually reveals localized gi tract mucosa lesions consist abnormal germinal centercontaining lymphoid follicles overcrowded uniformlysized population malignant centrocytes rare lesions classified low grade ie lugano classification grades cases immunochemical analyses indicate latter cells express low proliferation rate defined intensity expression also overexpress consequence translocation findings similar follicular lymphoma malignant cells dfl generally fewer genomic abnormalities follicular lymphoma profile overexpressed genes dfl tissues closely resemble marginal zone follicular lymphoma tissues diagnosis dfl depends finding cited histological immunolochemical abnormalities translocation evidence disease ranges outside gi tract evidenced negative results eg bone marrow biopsy ct scan abdomen thereby rule involvement bone marrow mesenteric well abdominal lymph node follicular lymphoma differs dfl lesions commonly lie outside gi tract sites outlined presentation histology often categorized grade malignant cells express activationinduced cytidine cc chemokine receptor type malt lymphoma differs dfl lesions commonly lie stomach tissues outside gi tract sites outlined presentation except special subtype malt lymphoma termed immunoproliferative small intestinal disease endemic middle involvement malignant bcells express commonly translocation chromosomes ie associations chronic inflammatory diseases chronic antigen mantle cell lymphoma differs dfl occasional involvement gi tract polyps histologic examination may involve lamina propria often infiltrate rather replacing intestinal glands malignant cells commonly express cyclin translocation chromosomes ie dfl generally indolent disease progresses aggressive form watchandwait strategy generally recommended treatment disease united however numerous approaches used treat disease patients disease contained within limited radiation field treated radiation therapy attain overall year survival rates however one study found radiationtreated patients relapse rate retrospective analysis conducted small number ie patients found complete regression rates watchandwait tactic radiotherapy rituximab monoclonal antibody directed respectively complete regression rate chop chemotherapy regimen chop plus rituximab regimen radiotherapy plus rituximab regimen pancreaticoduodenectomy ie surgical removal duodenum pancreas chemotherapeutic regimens combined single group two patients study diseases progressed outside gi tract watchandwait group studies conducted define optimal regimens treating dfl patients disease initially treated watchandwait approach order avoid toxic sideeffects cited alternate httpsenwikipediaorgwikiduodenaltypefollicularlymphoma
