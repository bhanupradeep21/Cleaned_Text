nasal surgery medical procedure designed treat various conditions cause nasal blockages upper respiratory tract example nasal polyps inferior turbinate hypertrophy chronic rhinosinusitis encompasses several types techniques including rhinoplasty septoplasty sinus surgery turbinoplasty respective postoperative treatments furthermore nasal surgery also conducted cosmetic purposes potential risks complications associated advancement medical instruments enhanced surgical skills helped mitigate history nasal surgery separated three periods first nasal operations consisted repair minimal external nose injuries second period characterised need restoring amputated noses several countries third period marks current era nasal surgery development first period nasal surgery dated back bc attempts treat nasal damage leading complete loss nose nose amputation served penalisation war criminals women deemed indecent resulting demand nasal reconstruction view situation sushruta regarded father plastic surgery initiated second period nasal surgery ideologies ayurveda bc used leaves template damaged nose together cheek skin flap reconstruct wounded noses laid solid foundation evolution nasal surgery emerging idea nasal surgery spread roman empire parts world third period nasal surgery continues day subcategories rhinoplasty septoplasty sinus surgery turbinoplasty coupled culmination advanced plastic technology ongoing surgical nasal surgery specialty including removal nasal obstruction achieved medication nasal reconstruction currently comprises four approaches namely rhinoplasty septoplasty sinus surgery turbinoplasty targeted different sections nasal cavity order external internal positions rhinoplasty one common cosmetic approaches despite intricacy rhinoplasty categorised surgical rhinoplasty nonsurgical rhinoplasty surgical rhinoplasty emphasises application grafting techniques nonsurgical rhinoplasty provides noninvasive options surgical rhinoplasty intervention aimed modifying nasal appearance patients procedure targets upper nasal bone lower cartilage first incision carried nasal floor local general anaesthesia process nasal bones cartilage carefully readjusted duration depending amount bone cartilage needs removed added flaps tissue grafts surgeons retrieve smaller tissue grafts interior nose larger ones may taken ribs implants long bones patient additionally another factor consideration patient ethnicity two main strategies involved surgical rhinoplasty open rhinoplasty closed rhinoplasty open rhinoplasty offers accessible passage surgeon incise outer nasal skin may introduce external scarring nose contrarily closed rhinoplasty utilises endoscopic approach nostril require incision observable eye decision two depends extent growth abnormalities patients preference nonsurgical rhinoplasty liquid rhinoplasty method incorporates hyaluronic acid dermal fillers nonsurgical devices act alternatives minor nasal reconstructions proven treat minor external nasal injuries costeffectively comparison surgical rhinoplasty respect reduced intraoperative loss tissue blood nonsurgical rhinoplasty capable preventing occurrence ischemia even sepsis septoplasty surgical procedure involving correction nasal septum refers bone cartilage dividing space nostrils nasal septum bent crooked indicates narrowing blockage airway leading breathing difficulties worsened sinus infections due poor drainage septoplasty surgeon first lifts mucous membrane enclosing septum visualise assess cartilage bone surgeon trims reshapes even replaces deviated parts straighten nasal septum septoplasty typically takes one three hours coupled nasal surgeries ameliorate defect nasal septum hence repositioned along midline one nose septoplasties typically done closed procedure utilises thin flexible endoscope tiny camera light certain cases septorhinoplasty combination rhinoplasty septoplasty requires open procedure headlight nasal speculum fix nasal septum techniques sinus surgery vary ethmoidectomy balloon sinuplasty treat chronic sinusitis nasal polyps reopening sinus passageways ethmoidectomy treats ethmoid sinusitis removing inflamed mucosal lining ethmoid sinus method conducting ethmoidectomy classified based location incision namely external intranasal transantral approaches surgeon carries incision skin medial canthus medial palpebral ligament ligament may repositioned afterwards surgeon dissects periosteum portion anterior ethmoid perforating lamina papycracea floor ethmoidal bulla subsequently resected opening posterior ethmoid

tumours maxillary sinus operation begins puncture canine fossa allowing surgeon view bulging ethmoid bulla maxillary sinus aperture inferior nasal meatus created intranasal counter drainage surgeon eventually dissects inflamed anterior posterior ethmoid cells balloon sinuplasty optimal treatment chronic rhinosinusitiscitation needed flexible balloon catheter initially inserted inflamed sinus next inflation balloon widens sinus preserving lining consequently expanded opening aids mucosal drainage removal balloon irrigation catheter sprays saline inflamed sinus expel pus given simplicity process around balloon sinuplasty conducted outpatient procedure duration approximately thirty minutes recovery one two days turbinoplasty intervention aiming treat turbinate hypertrophy reducing turbinate volume turbinate hypertrophy commonly characterised enlarged nasal turbinates arising allergic rhinitis procedure success rate carried clinic sameday procedure turbinoplasty classified intraturbinoplasty extraturbinoplasty intraturbinoplasty involves resection soft tissue extraturbinoplasty also removes portion inferior turbinate bone intraturbinoplasty conducted improved mucosalsparing approach microdebrider radiofrequency thus alleviating postoperative complications turbinoplasty performed different equipment shown follows coblation turbinoplasty incorporates radiofrequency vapourise disintegrate soft erectile tissue turbinate lowering turbinate size causing tissue fibrosis reduction turbinate volume alleviates conditions inferior turbinate hypertrophy since fibrosis stiffens attachment mucosa periosteum remedies shortcomings possible sequela according review technique outcompetes conventional counterpart terms safety effectiveness first incision carried inferior turbinate bone allow insertion piezo using electric current piezo reduces turbinate volume prevents direct damage followed lateralisation turbinate mayo scissors ameliorate intraoperative bleeding bipolar cautery used along insertion merocell sponge turbinate nasal septum notably distinctive coblation turbinoplasty absence saline use microdebrider maintains continuous blood drainage creating precise visual field also facilitates specific elimination submucosal tissue without damaging turbinate bone besides preserving mucosa shorter operative time lower blood loss improved accuracy significant advancements brought microdebrider also research found effective mitigating nasal blockade radiofrequency turbinoplasty emerging novel technique sinus surgery principle
