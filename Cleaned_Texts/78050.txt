expectancy theory expectancy theory motivation proposes individual behave act certain way motivated select specific behavior others due expect result selected behavior essence motivation behavior selection determined desirability outcome however core theory cognitive process individual processes different motivational elements done making ultimate choice outcome sole determining factor making decision expectancy theory mental processes regarding choice choosing explains processes individual undergoes make choices study organizational behavior expectancy theory motivation theory first proposed victor vroom yale school management theory emphasizes need organizations relate rewards directly performance ensure rewards provided deserved wanted victor h vroom defines motivation process governing choices among alternative forms voluntary activities process controlled individual individual makes choices based estimates well expected results given behavior going match eventually lead

vroom developed expectancy theory study motivations behind decisionmaking theory relevant study management expectancy theory motivation explains behavioral process individuals choose one behavioral option theory explains individuals motivated towards goals believe positive correlation efforts performance outcome favorable performance result desirable reward reward performance satisfy important

expectations indirectly affect childrens achievement teacher expectations could also affect student outcomes indirectly leading differential teacher treatment students would condition student attitudes expectations model includes following sequence teachers form differential expectations students early school year based expectations behave differently toward different students result behaviors students begin understand teacher expects students accept teachers expectations behavior toward likely act ways confirm teachers initial expectations process ultimately affect student achievement teachers initial expectancies discussing work related model brophy made several important observations teacher expectation effects first foremost argued beliefs teachers hold student accurate expectations usually reflect students actual performance levels result brophy contended selffulfilling prophecy effects relatively weak effects student achievement changing achievement although note effects usually negative expectation effects rather positive effects second pointed various situational individual difference factors influence extent teacher expectations act selffulfilling prophecies instance brophy stated expectancy effects may larger early elementary grades teachers oneonone interactions students attempt socialize children student role upper elementary grades wholeclass teaching methods used may minimize expectation evidence supports claim expectancy effects rosenthal jacobsons study strongest earlier raudenbushs metaanalysis findings different teacher expectancy studies expectancies induced giving teachers artificial information childrens intelligence showed expectancy effects stronger grades grades grade especially information given teachers first weeks findings particularly relevant show form expectancy theory teachers certain expectations students treat students differently critics expectancy model include graen lawler criticisms theory based upon expectancy model simplistic nature critics started making adjustments vrooms edward lawler claims simplicity expectancy theory deceptive assumes employer makes reward financial bonus promotion enticing enough employees increase productivity obtain however works employees believe reward beneficial immediate needs example increase salary may desirable employee increase pushes tax bracket believes net pay actually reduced belief typically fallacious especially united states similarly promotion provides higher status requires longer hours may deterrent employee values evening weekend time children additional example person armed forces security agencies promoted possibility transferred locations cases new posting far permanent residence family
