complex activities play seen relatively intelligent learning may occur consciously without conscious awareness learning aversive event avoided escaped may result condition called learned evidence human behavioral learning prenatally habituation observed early weeks gestation indicating central nervous system sufficiently developed primed learning memory occur early play approached several theorists form learning children experiment world learn rules learn interact play lev vygotsky agrees play pivotal childrens development since make meaning environment playing educational games vygotsky however play first form learning language communication stage child begins understand rules led view learning organisms always related often associated representational nonassociative learning refers relatively permanent change strength response single stimulus due repeated exposure definition exempt changes caused sensory adaptation fatigue nonassociative learning divided habituation sensitization habituation example nonassociative learning one components innate response eg response probability response duration stimulus diminishes stimulus repeated thus habituation must distinguished extinction associative process operant extinction example response declines longer followed reward example habituation seen small song stuffed owl similar predator put cage birds initially react though real predator soon birds react less showing habituation another stuffed owl introduced one removed reintroduced birds react though predator demonstrating specific stimulus habituated namely one particular unmoving owl one place habituation process faster stimuli occur high rather stimuli occur low rate well weak strong stimuli habituation shown essentially every species animal well sensitive plant mimosa large protozoan stentor concept acts direct opposition sensitization example nonassociative learning progressive amplification response follows repeated administrations based notion defensive reflex stimulus withdrawal escape becomes stronger exposure different harmful threatening everyday example mechanism repeated tonic stimulation peripheral nerves occurs person rubs arm continuously stimulation creates warm sensation eventually turn painful pain results progressively amplified synaptic response peripheral nerves sends warning stimulation needed sensitization thought underlie adaptive well maladaptive learning processes needed active learning occurs person takes control hisher learning experience since understanding information key aspect

studentcentered learning conversely passive learning direct instruction characteristics teachercentered learning traditional education associative learning process person animal learns association two stimuli classical conditioning previously neutral stimulus repeatedly paired reflexeliciting stimulus eventually neutral stimulus elicits response operant conditioning behavior reinforced punished presence stimulus becomes less likely occur presence stimulus operant conditioning way behavior shaped modified according desires trainer head individual operant conditioning uses thought living things seek pleasure avoid pain animal human learn receiving either reward punishment specific time called trace conditioning trace conditioning small ideal period time subject performing desired behavior receiving positive reinforcement result performance reward needs given immediately completion wanted operant conditioning different classical conditioning shapes behavior solely bodily reflexes occur naturally specific stimulus rather focuses shaping wanted behavior requires conscious thought ultimately requires punishment reinforcement two principal ways operant conditioning occurs punishment used reduce unwanted behavior ultimately learners perspective leads avoidance punishment necessarily avoidance unwanted behavior punishment appropriate way increase wanted behavior animals humans punishment divided two subcategories positive punishment negative punishment positive punishment aversive aspect life thing added subject reason called positive punishment example parent spanking child would considered positive punishment spanking added child negative punishment considered removal something loved desirable subject example parent puts child time reality child losing opportunity friends enjoy freedom pleases example negative punishment removal childs desired rights play friends reinforcement hand used increase wanted behavior either negative reinforcement positive reinforcement negative reinforcement defined removing undesirable aspect life thing example dog might learn sit trainer scratches ears ultimately removing itches undesirable aspect positive reinforcement defined adding desirable aspect life thing example dog might learn sit receives treat example treat added dogs typical paradigm classical conditioning involves repeatedly pairing unconditioned stimulus unfailingly evokes reflexive response another previously neutral stimulus normally evoke response following conditioning response occurs unconditioned stimulus unrelated stimulus referred conditioned stimulus response conditioned stimulus termed conditioned response classic example ivan pavlov pavlov fed dogs meat powder naturally made dogs reflexive response meat powder meat powder unconditioned stimulus us salivation unconditioned response ur pavlov rang bell presenting meat powder first time pavlov rang bell neutral stimulus dogs salivate put meat powder mouths began salivate numerous pairings bell food dogs learned bell signaled food come began salivate heard bell occurred bell became conditioned stimulus cs salivation bell became conditioned response cr classical conditioning demonstrated many species example seen honeybees proboscis extension reflex recently also demonstrated garden pea another influential person world classical

knowledge genetically inherited example horse born immediately walk horse learned behavior simply knows scenarios innate knowledge beneficial learned knowledge however scenarios opposite must learn certain behaviors disadvantageous specific innate behavior situations learning evolves species changing environment animal must constantly gain new information survive however stable environment individual needs gather information needs rely rest life therefore different scenarios better suit either learning innate knowledge essentially cost obtaining certain knowledge versus benefit already determines whether animal evolved learn given situation whether innately knew information cost gaining knowledge outweighs benefit animal evolve learn instead nonlearning evolves however benefit certain information outweighs cost obtaining animal far likely evolve learn nonlearning likely evolve two scenarios environment static change rarely occurs learning simply unnecessary need learning learning could prove disadvantageous due time took learn evolves similarly environment constant state change learning also disadvantageous anything learned immediately irrelevant changing learned information longer applies essentially animal would successful took guess learned situation nonlearning evolves fact study drosophila melanogaster showed learning actually lead decrease productivity
