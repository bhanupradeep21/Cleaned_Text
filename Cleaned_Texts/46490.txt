fractures acetabulum occur head femur driven pelvis injury caused blow either side front knee often occurs dashboard injury accompanied fracture acetabulum cavity situated outer surface hip bone also called coxal bone innominate bone made three bones ilium ischium pubis together acetabulum head femur form hip joint fractures acetabulum young individuals usually result high energy injury like vehicular accident feet first fall older individuals osteoporosis trivial fall may result acetabular fracture french surgeons robertt judet jean judet emile letournel first described mechanism classification treatment acetabular fracture classified fractures elementary simple two part associated complex three part fractures fracture may associated fracture posterior wall well making complex fracture typically occurs injuring force applied side greater trochanter femur fall side hit side force may combined dashboard injury well fracture best seen anteroposterior view iliac obturator oblique views posterior column posterior wall fracture occurs due dashboard injury anteroposterior view may give clues injuries judet views ct scans help knowing extent injury occurs due combined dash board injury direct injury hip side typically caused combination forces acting hip femoral head three xray views plus ct scan must diagnosis management complex injury injury nonoperative treatment rarely gives satisfactory results surgical management ideal choice approach rests surgeon going front anterior approach necessary posterior injury may tacked anterior approach experienced surgeon patient unfit undergo major surgery due reason longitudinal traction achieve secondary congruence hip may help restore hip function though partially variety fracture innominate bone broken upper part consists ilium weight bearing dome lower part consists ischium pubic bones typically occurs injuring force applied side greater trochanter femur bone fall side hit side two part fracture though columns broken true bothcolumn fracture weight bearing dome still attached main ilium depending level fracture line passes relation weight bearing area transverse fracture subdivided types xray visualization best done antero posterior view iliac obturator oblique views ct scan characteristic feature fracture line runs front back ct scan also helps identifying impaction bone pieces pieces

treatment rarely gives satisfactory results surgical management ideal choice approach rests surgeon going front anterior approach must posterior injury may tacked anterior approach experienced surgeon patient unfit undergo major surgery due reason longitudinal traction achieve secondary congruence hip may help restore hip function though partially broken bone pieces dislocated head femur may injure sciatic nerve causing paralysis foot patient may may recover sensation foot depending extent injury nerve posterior wall fragment may one large piece multiple pieces may associated impaction bone sciatic nerve injury stoppage blood supply femoral head time accident surgery treat injury may occur deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism complications may occur type injury acetabulum common postoperative complication heterotopic ossification around injured hip understand fracture pattern fractured acetabulum essential minimum three xray views though use ct scan reconstruction images made understanding fractures easier tiles classification acetabular fracture ideal xray visualization elementary fracture depend fracture type cases ct scan assist identifying impacted bone pieces may found within joint mri may done identify extent potential injury sciatic nerve femur head dislocated reduced soon possible prevent damage blood supply preferably done anaesthesia following leg kept pulled applying traction prevent joint dislocating final management depends size fragments stability congruence joint cases traction six eight weeks may treatment required however surgical fixation using screws plates may required injury complex latter treatment called bone fragments fall place found joint joint unstable depending stability achieved via initial treatment patient may allowed stand walk help support within six eight weeks full function may return three months site injury stabilizing injured person resuscitation quick examination done check injury vital organs one suspects injury hip imperative immobilise limb using kind support prevent movements injured limb prevent damage trained paramedic may able diagnose hip dislocation noticing position injured limb essential document status nerves vessels starting treatment protect oneself litigation arrival hospital trained trauma surgeon assess patient prescribe necessary tests including xrays described earlier nonsurgical management consists reducing dislocated joint maneuver anaesthesia applying traction limb maintain position joint fractured bones non surgical management preferred may require six weeks months recovery surgical management requires high degree training well equipped centre carried experienced surgical team get best results principles laid management innominate bone flat bone many curves part bone thick enough broad surfaces amenable primary fixation using lag screws neutralize forces across bone one needs add plates surface fractured fragments heal without deformity surgery patient needs tests check fitness surgery anaesthesia surgery may performed either regional anaesthesia general anaesthesia surgical approaches following common approaches implants normally lag screws reconstruction plates preferred implants post operative management would involve initial period bed rest followed mobilisation trained therapist total time recover may months elderly patients worse
