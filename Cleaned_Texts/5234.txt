statedependent memory statedependent learning phenomenon people remember information physical mental state time encoding time recall statedependent memory heavily researched regards employment regards synthetic states consciousness effects psychoactive drugs well organic states consciousness mood statedependent memory may seem rather similar contextdependent memory contextdependent memory involves individuals external environment conditions room used study take test statedependent memory applies individuals internal conditions use substances mood french aristocrat named marquis de puys√©gur realized people put hypnotic state awoken recollection told however put back hypnosis state would able recall everything last man named morton prince came realization dreams hypothesized reason hard time remembering dreams wake due fact unable dreams like real university illinois edward girden elmer culler conducted experiment conditioned responses dogs influence drug curare experiment dogs taught conditioned muscular response draw paw away ground heard buzzer buzzer often accompanied small electric shock motivated response dogs influence curare first learned response curare longer system less likely remember draw paw away hearing buzzer given curare response result indicated dogs ability recall responses connected state consciousness girden cullers research opened door investigation influences state consciousness organisms ability encode memory following discovery researchers looked effect different states ability learn remember responses information donald overton conducted study direct response girden cullers experiment study tested effects sodium pentobarbital rats abilities learn remember certain taught responses rats randomly assigned one two groups substance administered substance administered control condition placed simple maze taught escape electrical shock overton found rats administered mg sodium pentobarbital could longer remember proper escape response later placed maze without drug however rats administered sodium pentobarbital placed maze recalled escape response taught similarly overton taught rat escape response control condition sodium pentobarbital administered could recall behavior administered drug asked perform later results strongly indicated rats performed learned response efficiently either sodium pentobarbital control state first learned regard idea study specifically stated response learned influence particular drug subsequently reoccur maximum strength drug condition hoine bremer stern conducted test two main parts participants given time study tested asked consume ounces vodka next day thing except intoxicated others remained sober results found whether students sober intoxicated well state studied tested words intoxicated studied better taking test state sober studied got best results later years similar studies confirmed learning could statedependent terry devietti raymond larson conducted similar study rats seeing memory affected various levels electric shock results supported idea rats ability remember learned response influenced phenomenon continued studied thirty years later mohammadreza zarrindast ameneh rezayof studied mice see memory learning affected morphine found mice learned response influence morphine later performed efficiently influence morphine mice learned response free morphine recalled best similarly sober mice taught response influence morphine drug wore suffered amnestic effects could longer remember learned results studies points existence statedependent memory phenomenon research subject continues carried today order discover implications statedependent memory situations statedependent memory might take place reus post weingartner found person depressed find nearly impossible think time past happy longer depressed impossible task became attributed mind taking control person felt person feels nothing misery therefore whole life must like depression hold psychiatry journal published topic spouse abuse main topic discussion men would abuse wives sometimes even killing memory event afterward first thought lies later findings found many convicts said thing remember time attack memory attack one man described everything going red though blacked journal discussed statedependent memory might blame thought process behind theory individuals experience known limited amnesia form amnesia specific towards one event forgotten idea person got madangry spouse recall character could attributed person choosing remember losing memory due alcohol usually consumed study collegeaged women age given questionnaires daily access alcohol effect memories past sexual assault sa women intoxicated assault half women intoxicated assaults would experience intrusive thoughts flashbacks sa whereas women intoxicated time assault experienced flashbacks intrusive thoughts usual common alcohol attributed forgetting encoding happens specifically influence alcohol make memory basic statedependent memory product strengthening particular synaptic pathway neural synapse space brain cells neurons allows chemical signals passed one neuron another chemicals called neurotransmitters leave one cell travel across synapse taken next neuron neurotransmitter receptor creates connection two neurons called neural pathway memory relies strengthening neural pathways associating one neuron another learn something new pathways made neurons brain communicate chemical signals cells history sending certain signals specific chemical conditions within brain primed work effectively similar statedependent memory happens new neural connection made brain specific chemical state instance child adhd learns multiplication tables stimulant medicationcitation needed brain created new connections related multiplication tables brain chemically affected stimulant medication neurons primed future remember facts best levels medication present brain strong evidence existence statedependent memory less clear advantage circumstance might researcher lorena pomplio team tackled question investigated presence statedependent memory invertebrates specifically grasshoppers point vertebrates used study statedependent memory study found invertebrates indeed experience phenomenon well particularly regard conditions low high nutritional intake pomplio associates concluded results demonstrated potential adaptive advantage statedependent learning explains intrinsic presence wide variety species statedependent memory recalls time organism similar condition informs decisions make present grasshoppers low nutritional state sparked cognitive connections similar states duress primed insects make decisions made faced low nutrition previous conditions paper suggests phenomenon allows quick decisions made organism time neural capability carefully process every research shown evidence roles numerous substances play statedependent memory example stimulants like ritalin produce statedependent memory effects children hyperactive additionally statedependent memory effects found regard substances morphine caffeine substantial amounts research conducted effects clear description statedependent memory found john elliotsons human physiology dr abel informed says mr combe presumably george combe irish porter warehouse forgot sober done drunk drunk recollected transactions former state intoxication one occasion drunk lost parcel value sober moments could give account next time intoxicated recollected left parcel certain house address remained safely got calling man must two souls one sober state one research shows individuals less likely remember information learned intoxicated however information learned memories created intoxicated effectively retrieved individual similar state alcoholism enhance statedependent memory well study comparing statedependent memory effects alcohol subjects alcoholism subjects without alcoholism researchers found alcoholic subjects showed greater effects statedependent memory tasks recall free association alcohol better produces associations person alcoholism lives larger portion life influence produces changes cognition person alcoholism drinks intoxication primes brain towards certain associations made similar states essentially intoxicated sober states alcoholic fact different intoxicated sober states nonalcoholic person whose body used processing large amounts reason see slightly larger effects statedependent memory intoxicated chronic drinkers drink contrast studies show lack effects caffeine statedependent memory subjects either consuming beverage caffeinated coffee time memorizing word list undergoing treatment recall significant difference either groups ability recall memorized word list effects marijuana shown unclear results regarding individuals cognitive ability recall information regardless state encoding recalling study wide array subjects varying levels thc exposure given dosage compound asked perform tasks relating memory function final results produce sufficient evidence make strong argument regarding cannabis state dependent memory hypothesized throughout years intoxicated people remember drunk state euphoria whereas day day life average person quite happy become intoxicated reach higher mood begin piece together nights statedependent memory influenced mood subject controversy within psychological field though research seemed show evidence existence mooddependence memory came question later researchers suggested results actually result mood congruent memory phenomenon individual recalls information associated example person asked learn list words cold might remember words associated illness tissue congestion later asked recall words learned researchers since conducting experiments unearth truth mooddependent memory though remains difficult completely eliminate unreliability studies studies investigated existence mooddependent memory especially individuals bipolar disorder generally vacillate time mood extremes specifically depression mania found individuals bipolar disorder performed better verbal association test similar mood state state verbal associations recent study similarly studied group individual bipolar disorder found evidence mooddependent memory visual task recognition inkblots observed subjects better recall inkblots mood state first saw inkblots however researchers find similar effect verbal two studies agree effects mood regard verbal recall tasks research needed clarify existence mooddependent memory verbal visual recall tasks well investigate mooddependent memory suffering mood disorders individuals without mood disorders kind study conducted man named jonah suffered multiple personality disorder asked series questions various subject matter wasnt asked personal emotional questions alternate personalities seemed surface personality appeared completely distinct next study jonah asked remembered day could remember questions asked prior surfacing alternative personalities asked emotionally saturated questions multiple personality disorder complex subject aside simply state dependent memory possible varying levels memory personality experienced relationship mood dependent experiment subjects asked memorize list words pain related others either submerged hand warm ice cold water subjects underwent pain submerging hand ice water subsequently memorizing list demonstrated better recall words related pain warm water counterparts though worth mentioning warmwater group remembered words list overall one example statedependent learning memory observed subjects underwent pain condition better able recall memorized words relevant condition hypothesized state dependent memory coincides pain trauma could yield negative cognitive results dissociative amnesia inability recall personal information would ordinarily forgotten thought disorder arises painful moment misinterpreted allowed detached time goes also theorized level memory failure attributed overwhelming stress prevents adequate integration trauma relief mechanisms well encoding normal conscious experiences furthermore inability perfectly recall traumatic memory yet still fully affected trauma causes individuals undergo sort cognitive relapse could cause intense memory failure leading individual huge gaps cognitive autobiographical memory negative results regarding dissociative amnesia state dependent memory include anxiety depression social dysfunction psychosis study done sixty year old man whose house burned showed effects series therapeutical sessions patient experienced episodes epilepsy conveyed feelings distress given retrieval cues alluding house fire studies shown simply creating internal state time encoding sufficient serve retrieval therefore putting mindset time encoding help recall way situation helps recall effect called context reinstatement demonstrated fisher craik matched retrieval cues way information statedependent memory widespread effects play roles everyday example statedependence affect performance test job interview affect memory left car keys however power statedependent memory also harnessed improve performance school learning disabilities outcomes statedependent memory implications effectiveness psychological treatment evidence also found idea individuals state regard substance influence impact psychological patients responded better phobia exposure therapy one treatment session another consistent states consciousness study found patients similar levels caffeine system session consistently caffeine system exhibited greater rates improvement fewer phobia relapses patients came various states caffeine influence one treatment session results show statedependent learning used advantage undergoing psychological treatment remaining consistent state consciousness sessions patients improve likelihood success decrease possibility relapse future directions kind research might test substances caffeine similar effects patient performance psychological treatment evidence statedependent learning found children hyperactivity taking drug methylphenidate drug often prescribed treatment adhd symptoms commonly known ritalin children hyperactivity taking drug periods learning better retained information subsequent periods methylphenidate use illustrating effectiveness methylphenidate facilitating learning children diagnosed hyperactive however statedependent learning effect stimulant medication applies children diagnosed hyperactivity children diagnosed hyperactivity show change retention rates due use stimulants methylphenidate studies validate prescription stimulants individuals hyperactive disorders results show state consciousness produced use drugs improves cognitive focus hyperactive disorders taken consistently
