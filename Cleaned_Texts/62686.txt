retribution claims mccullough worthington rachal defined forgiveness set motivational changes whereby one becomes decreasingly motivated retaliate offending relationship partner b decreasingly motivated maintain estrangement offender c increasingly motivated conciliation goodwill offender despite offender hurtful actions essence relational partners choose constructive behaviors show emotional commitment willingness sacrifice order achieve state forgiveness link reconciliation forgiveness involves exploring two dimensions forgiveness intrapsychic interpersonal intrapsychic dimension relates cognitive processes interpretations associated transgression ie internal state whereas interpersonal forgiveness interaction relational partners total forgiveness defined including intrapsychic interpersonal components brings return conditions prior change ones internal state silent forgiveness interpersonal interaction considered hollow forgiveness however scholars contend two dimensions intrapsychic interpersonal independent complexities associated forgiveness involve gradations example partner may relinquish negative emotions yet choose remain relationship factors eg children financial concerns etc conversely one may grant forgiveness release negative emotions directed toward partner still exit relationship trust restored given complexity research explored whether transformation negative emotions positive emotions eliminates negative affect associated given offense conclusions drawn research suggest correlation exists forgiveness put simply forgiveness may granted given transgression negative affect may reduced corresponding amount mccullough et al outlined predictors forgiveness four broad categories personality variables characteristics relationship preexisting occurrence forgiveness nature offense socialcognitive determinants become apparent time forgivingness defined ones general tendency forgive however tendency differs forgiveness response associated specific transgression listed characteristics forgiving personality described emmons terms personality traits agreeableness neuroticism ie instability anxiousness aggression show consistency predicting forgivingness since forgiveness requires one discard desire revenge vengeful personality tends offer forgiveness may continue harbor feelings vengeance long transgression research shown agreeableness inversely correlated motivations revenge avoidance well positively correlated benevolence one demonstrates personality trait agreeableness prone forgiveness well general disposition forgivingness conversely neuroticism positively correlated avoidance vengefulness negatively correlated benevolence consequently neurotic personality less apt forgive disposition forgivingness though personality traits offended predictive value forgiveness personality offender also effect whether forgiveness offered offenders show sincerity seeking forgiveness persuasive downplaying impact transgression positive effect whether offended offer narcissistic personalities example may categorized persuasive transgressors driven narcissist downplay transgressions seeing perfect seeking save face dynamic suggests personality determinants forgiveness may involve personality offended also offender quality relationship offended offending partners affect whether

activities critical component maintaining high quality relationships heavily invested tends lead forgiveness one may skewed relationship partner heavily invested actually benefitted leads benefitted partner likely take relationship granted prone exhibit relationship repair behaviors mindful quality relationship best position partners address transgressions stronger willingness forgive seek normalize another relationship factor affects forgiveness history past conflict past conflicts ended badly ie reconciliationforgiveness either achieved achieved much conflict partners less prone seek offer noted earlier maintaining balanced relationship ie partner overunder benefitted positive effect relationship quality tendency forgive vein partners likely offer forgiveness partners recently forgiven however transgression repeated resentment begins build adverse effect offended partners desire offer notable feature transgression effect forgiveness seriousness transgressions perceived serious considered counter negative affect associated severe transgression offender may engage repair strategies lessen perceived hurt transgression offenders communication immediately following transgression greatest predictive value whether forgiveness consequently offenders immediately apologize take responsibility show remorse greatest chance obtaining forgiveness selfdisclosure transgression yields much greater results partner informed transgression third taking responsibility ones actions forthright selfdisclosure offense partners may actually form closer bonds reconciliation associated serious transgression noted section personality repeated transgressions cause relationship repair strategies muted effect resentment begins build trust erodes attributions responsibility given transgression may adverse effect forgiveness specifically transgression viewed intentional malicious offended partner less likely feel empathy based notion forgiveness driven primarily empathy offender must accept responsibility seek forgiveness immediately following transgression apologies shown elicit empathy offended resulting feelings empathy elicited offended partner may cause better relate guilt loneliness partner may feel result transgression state mind offended partner likely seek normalize relationship granting forgiveness restoring closeness prior sections offered definitions forgiveness along determinants forgiveness perspective partner experienced hurtful transgression noted earlier swift apologies utilization repair strategies offender greatest likelihood eliciting empathy offended ultimately receiving forgiveness transgression sections address remedial strategies offenders may use facilitate state offended likely offer forgiveness seek normalize relationship common remedial strategies apology straightforward means admit responsibility express regret seek noted earlier apologies effective provided timely manner involve selfdisclosure apologies occurring discovery transgression third party much less though apologies range simple sorry elaborate forms offenders successful offering complex apologies match seriousness rather accepting responsibility transgression form apology transgressor explains engaged behavior engaging excuses excuses justifications aim minimize blame transgressor two address blame minimization completely opposite perspectives excuses attempt minimize blame focusing transgressors inability control actions eg would known exgirlfriend going party displace blame third party eg went lunch exgirlfriend want hurt feelings conversely justification minimizes blame suggesting actions surrounding transgression justified transgression example transgressor may justify lunch past romantic interest suggesting current partner lunch meeting major consequence eg friends refusals transgressor claims blame perceived departure apologies excusesjustifications involve varying degrees blame acceptance case refusal transgressor believes done anything wrong situation points complexity relational transgressions perception partners must taken account recognizing addressing transgressions example bob sally started date addressed whether mutually exclusive bob finds sally date someone else confronts sally sally may engage refusal blame bob sally explicitly noted whether mutually exclusive problem situations transgressor shows sensitivity offended offended less apt exhibit empathy key towards forgiveness research shown refusals tend aggravate situations rather serve meaningful repair appeasement used offset hurtful behavior transgressor ingratiating ways promising never commit hurtful act overly kind appeasement may elicit greater empathy offended soothing strategies exhibited transgressor eg complimenting attentive spending greater time together however danger appeasement risk actions transgressor viewed artificial example sending partner flowers every day resulting infidelity committed may viewed downplaying severity transgression sending flowers coupled soothing strategies cause greater immediacy avoidance involves transgressor making conscious efforts ignore transgression also referred silence avoidance effective apology sought forgiveness granted ie minimizing discussion around unpleasant subjects closure obtained however total avoidance transgression hurt offended recognized forgiveness granted result problems future relational transgressions tend develop nature relationship drawing new rulesboundaries avoidance transgression allow development surprisingly avoidance ineffective repair strategy particularly instances infidelity relationship talk remediation strategy focuses discussing transgression context aune et al identified two types relationship talk relationship invocation relationship invocation involves using relationship backdrop discussion transgression example committed relationship let fail relationship much better previous
