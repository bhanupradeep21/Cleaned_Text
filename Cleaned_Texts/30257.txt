schramms model communication early influential model communication first published wilbur schramm includes innovations previous models inclusion feedback loop discussion role fields experience schramm communication sharing information common attitude towards signs model based three basic components source destination message process starts idea mind source idea encoded message using signs sent destination destination needs decode interpret signs reconstruct original idea response formulate message encode send back form feedback feedback key part many forms communication used mitigate processes may undermine successful communication external noise errors phases encoding decoding success communication also depends fields experience participants field experience includes past life experiences well attitudes beliefs affects processes encoding decoding interpretation take place successful communication message located overlap fields experience participants message outside receivers field experience unable connect original idea often case big cultural differences schramm holds sender usually goal wish achieve communication discusses conditions needed effect audience gaining attention motivating act towards goal also applies model mass communication one difference forms communication successful mass communication difficult since little feedback schramm proposed many revisions earlier model focus additional factors make communication complex example relation sender receiver influences goal communication roles played participants schramms criticism linear models communication lack feedback loop influential one shortcoming schramms model assumes communicators take turns exchanging information instead sending messages simultaneously another objection schramm conceives information meaning preexisting entities rather seeing communication process creates meaning schramms model communication published wilbur schramm one earliest interaction models conceived response improvement earlier attempts form linear transmission models like model lasswells models communication simplified presentations process communication try explain discussing main components schramm central aspect communication participants trying establish commonness sharing idea regard communication defined sharing orientation toward set informational signs based relation person calls fire department report fire home attempt share information fire sharing happens schramm messages made signs sign corresponds element experience like sign dog stands generalized experience dogs sign meaningless someone never experienced dogs associate sign experiences theories psychologist charles osgood significant influence inspired schramm formulate model according osgood meaning located message also social psycholinguistic approach focuses external stimuli elicit internal responses form interpretations responses mediate stimulus osgoods ideas influenced schramm two important ways posited field shared experience acting background communication added stages encoding decoding internal responses influences theorists refer schramms model theorists identify schramms model book process effects mass communication present reaction earlier models developed late however marketing scholar jim blythe argues schramms model earlier origin already present schramms book mass schramm communication basic form three parts source message destination source individual organization like newspaper television station true process starts senders mind message originates form idea share information source needs encode first symbolic form since idea transmitted directly mind happen various ways signs linguistic like written spoken words nonlinguistic like pictures music animal transmitted channel example sounds facetoface conversation ink paper letter electronic signals case text messaging stage noise may interfere transmission distort message reaches receiver reverse process decoding applied receiver attaches meaning signs according field experience way try reconstruct senders original idea process continues receiver returns new message feedback original process communication fail various ways example message may distorted external noise errors also occur stages encoding decoding source use correct signs pattern decoding match pattern encoding problem posed original information faulty begin effective communication negative influences need schramms model based model according model communication interaction various components source translates message signal using transmitter signal sent channel receiver receiver translate signal back message makes available destination steps encoding decoding schramms model perform role transmitter receiver emphasis communication circular process main focus schramms model behavior senders receivers reason involve detailed technical discussion channel influences noise unlike role feedback one innovation schramms model comparison earlier schramm sees communication dynamic interaction two participants exchange means process communication end receivers mind instead upon receiving message communicator returns feedback formulate new message form idea encode convey original sender process starts communication endless process sense people constantly decode interpret environment assign meaning encode possible responses models without feedback loop like model lasswells model called linear transmission models contrast interaction models also known nonlinear circular transmission schramm rejects idea passive audience present linear models communication argues instead audience understood full feedback vital aspect many forms communication used confirm message received mitigate influence noise example message may get distorted way receiver may misinterpret cases feedback loop makes possible assess whether errors occurred repeat message ensure understood schramm also discusses another form feedback depend person happens sender pays attention message example reading letter one wrote check style another innovation schramms model role fields field experience mental frame includes past life experiences well attitudes values beliefs participant field experience determines processes encoding decoding interpretation take example american unable encode message russian never learned language person indigenous tribe never heard airplane unable accurately decode messages participants alike fields experience overlap communication successful message located within fields experience ie bigger cultural differences difficult effective communication becomes especially relevant communication across national blythe cites lack overlap example failed communication case foreign advertisements may appear incomprehensible unintentionally lack overlap also happen people within culture example amateur tries read specialist scientific literature cases problems avoided sender able encode message using easy expression accessible concept field experience similar later models refer social cultural communication usually tied intended effect putting advertisement newspaper scolding child engaging job interview forms communication directed different goals communication always successful message may fail achieve intended schramm lists four conditions successful communication message must designed gain attention destination understandable get meaning across additionally must arouse needs destination suggest way needs get attention audience message must accessible talking example one must talk loud enough heard ensure message understandable sender must aware field experience audience order choose words examples familiar relation destinations needs message unfold effect motivating depending message intended effect address needs like security status love aspect plays central role forms advertisement good knowledge ones audiences character required understand need arouse arouse depends also specific situation circumstances example whether audience right mood whether intended response socially acceptable given situation unfold effect form action audience perform satisfy need usually many actions available sender may use message suggest action tune effect intend provoke example political party may use campaign event spread fear external threat order arouse audiences need security party may promise eliminate threat get audience act tune intended goal secure mass communication source usually individual rather organization like newspaper broadcasting network basic steps like encoding decoding performed single person group people like employed reporters editors destinations mass communication individual people like readers newspaper hallmark mass communication message reaches large number people stands contrast facetoface communication taking place two small number people another difference little direct feedback mass communication example happens seldom viewer contacts broadcast network reader writes letter editor feedback often indirect people may stop buy service view program satisfied usually without providing reason sender decision lack feedback makes effective communication difficult since directly obvious sender whether message intended effect one reasons mass communication providers often conduct audience research way obtain vital information target audience formulate messages difficult predict effects mass communication since effect differs lot person person based personality mood current situation additional factor regard effects restricted direct effects person receiving message instead also indirect receiver part social environment may share criticize reflect message people schramm proposed revisions model explained many developments field communication studies since first model shown communication complex phenomenon agreed initial model simple justice tried address shortcomings developing relational model communication changes influenced david berlos model communication focus effects communication berlo argued goal communication influence behavior schramms relational model focuses relation sender receiver relation includes totality past experiences communicators based past facetoface contact party meeting friend dinner need would case reading newspaper article reporter one never met even case past experiences shape reader expects newspaper reporter expects schramm relation basic requirement communication since communication sharing information attitudes sense tune determines many aspects communication like goal roles played participants expectations bring goal communicators intend achieve communicating instructional context goal transmit information performance arts entertaining audience relation also affects role participants instruction involves roles teacher student roles determine participants expected contribute communicative goal example teachers may share explain information students may listen ask clarifying questions background communication relation also affects messages interpreted example seeing person actor stage leads one interpretation messages interacting business negotiations results different interpretation schramms model influential criticism linear transmission models innovations trying overcome schramm one first scholars challenge model according shortcomming model linear transmission models assume communicative process ends message reaches terms bullet theories communication since communication seen magic bullet goes active senders passive receivers form sending ideas receivers schramm rejects idea audience passive receiver assigns active role audience respondes generates new message sends back original form feedback many scholars followed schramms criticisms linear transmission models agree communication dynamic exchange involving active audience feedback schramms innovations also influential like concept field experience development relational models later common criticism schramms model focuses fact describes communication turnbased exchange information means simultaneous messaging first one participant sends message conveys message form feedback later first participant responds etc however processes often happen simultaneously many forms example facetoface conversations like first date listener usually uses facial expressions body posture signal agreement interest happens speaker talking listener wait speaker finish engaging form nonverbal shortcoming schramms model addressed socalled transaction models allow simultaneous messaging weight objection depends type communication analyzed forms like pen pals exchanging letters instant messaging disregarding simultaneous messages little impact cases important another criticism schramms model argues schramm information meaning exist prior communicative act communication understood exchange messages meaning view characteristic transmission models rejected constitutive models constitutive models hold meaning exist communication created process regard dialog acts cooperative process meaning approach proposed everett rogers thomas steinfatt elaborate schramms interactive approach combine assumption communicators create share meaning goal reaching mutual similar approaches communication focusing coconstruction meaning presented deetz g limitation schramms model restricted communication two parties however forms group communication parties
