vocabulary development process people acquire words babbling shifts towards meaningful speech infants grow produce first words around age one year early word learning infants build vocabulary slowly age months infants typically produce words begin make word combinations order build vocabularies infants must learn meanings words carry mapping problem asks infants correctly learn attach words referents constraints theories domaingeneral views socialpragmatic accounts emergentist coalition model account mapping problem early age infants use language communicate caregivers family members use language teach children act society interactions peers children opportunity learn unique conversational roles pragmatic directions adults often offer children cues understanding meaning words throughout school years children continue build vocabulary particular children begin learn abstract words beginning around age word learning takes place conversation reading word learning often involves physical context builds prior knowledge takes place social context includes semantic support phonological loop serial order shortterm memory may play important role vocabulary development infants begin understand words mommy daddy hands feet approximately months initially words refer mother father hands feet infants begin produce first words approximately one year infants first words normally used reference things importance objects body parts people relevant actions also first words infants produce mostly singlesyllabic repeated single syllables months age childrens vocabularies often contain words kitty bottle doll car eye childrens understanding names objects people usually precedes understanding words describe actions relationships one two first number words children learn ages one infants must able hear play sounds environment break various phonetic units discover words related meanings studies related vocabulary development show childrens language competence depends upon ability hear sounds infants perception speech distinct six ten months age infants discriminate sounds used languages months infants longer discriminate speech sounds used languages among sixmonthold infants seen articulations ie mouth movements observe others make talking actually enhance ability discriminate sounds may also contribute infants ability learn phonemic infants phonological register completed ages months childrens phonological development normally proceeds weeks cooing appears weeks laughter vocal play appear months reduplicated canonical babbling appears

important aspect vocabulary development infants since appears help practice producing speech babbling begins five seven months age stage babies start play sounds used express emotional physical states sounds consonants babies begin babble real syllables bababa nehnehneh ages seven eight months known canonical jargon babbling includes strings sounds type babbling uses intonation doesnt convey meaning phonemes syllabic patterns produced infants begin distinctive particular languages period eg increased nasal stops french japanese babies though sounds shift babbling use words infant children get older rate vocabulary growth increases children probably understand first words produce age eighteen months children typically attain vocabulary words production two three times greater switch early stage slow vocabulary growth later stage faster growth referred vocabulary young toddlers acquire one three words per month vocabulary spurt often occurs time number words learned accelerates believed children add new words ages months children learn combine two words byebye threeword fourword combinations appear childs utterances twoword productions addition children able form conjoined sentences using suggests vocabulary spurt time childs first word appears child able form two words eventually sentences however arguments whether spurt acquisition words one study children five children inflection point rate word acquisition opposed quadratic learning mechanisms involved language acquisition specific oral languages developmental stages learning sign language oral language generally deaf babies exposed sign language birth start babbling hands months oral languages manual babbling consists syllabic structure often reduplicated first symbolic sign produced around age young children simplify complex adult signs especially difficult handshapes likely due fine motor control fully developed yet signs movement also often proximalized child articulate sign body part

sociocultural factors affect rate vocabulary children must learn use words appropriately strategically social flexible powerful socialcognitive skills allow understand communicative intentions others wide variety interactive situations children learn new words communicative children rely pragmatic skills build extensive aspects pragmatic behaviour predict later literacy mathematical achievement children pragmatically skilled often function better school children also generally better children use words differently objects spatial relations actions children ages one three often rely general

misuses words word overextension governed perceptual similarities children notice among different referents misuses words indirectly provide ways finding meanings children attached particular children come contact spatial relations talk location one object respect another name object located use deictic term location name object located location also use general purpose locative marker preposition postposition suffix depending language linked way word childrens earliest words actions usually encode action result children use small number general purpose verbs make large variety actions resources limited children acquiring second language seem use production strategies talking actions sometimes children use highly specific verb instead general purpose verb cases children stretch resources communicate want infants use words communicate early life communication skills develop grow older communication skills aid word learning infants learn take turns communicating adults preschoolers lack precise timing rely obvious speaker cues older children precise timing take fewer long children get better initiating sustaining coherent conversations age toddlers preschoolers use strategies repeating recasting partners utterances keep conversation going older children add new relevant information conversations connectives frequently used children get giving responding feedback preschoolers inconsistent around age six children mark corrections phrases head nods indicate continued attention children continue age provide constructive interpretations back listeners helps prompt caregivers use language help children become competent members society culture birth infants receive pragmatic information learn structure conversations early interactions caregivers actions speech organized games peekaboo provide children information words phrases caregivers find many ways help infants interact respond children advance participate actively interactions caregivers adapt interactions caregivers also prompt children produce correct pragmatic behaviours provide input children expected say speak speak stay topic caregivers may model appropriate behaviour using verbal reinforcement posing hypothetical situation addressing childrens comments evaluating another family members contribute pragmatic development different ways fathers often act secondary caregivers may know child less intimately older siblings may lack capacity acknowledge childs needs result fathers siblings may pressure children communicate clearly often challenge children improve communication skills therefore preparing communicate strangers unfamiliar topics fathers breakdowns communicating infants spend less time focused objects actions infants siblings directive less responsive infants motivates infants participate conversations older limitations studies focus influences fathers siblings research descriptive correlational reality many variations family configurations context influences parent behaviour parent gender majority research field conducted motherchild pairs peers help expose children multiparty conversations allows children hear greater variety speech observe different conversational roles peers may uncooperative conversation partners pressures children communicate effectively speaking peers different speaking adults children may still correct peers peer interaction provides children different experience filled special humour disagreements conversational culture context infants linguistic environment shape vocabulary development english learners found map novel labels objects reliably actions compared mandarin learners early noun bias english learners caused culturally reinforced tendency english speaking caregivers engage significant amount ostensive labelling well nounfriendly activities picture book adult speech provides children grammatical input mandarin cantonese languages category grammatical function word called noun classifier also common across many genetically unrelated east asian languages cantonese classifiers obligatory specific situations mandarin accounts research found mandarinspeaking children outperforming cantonesespeaking children relation size pragmatic directions provide children additional information speakers intended meaning childrens learning new word meanings guided pragmatic directions adults offer explicit links word adults present young children information words related connections part kind belongs used pragmatic directions provide children essential information language allowing make inferences possible meanings unfamiliar also called inclusion children provided two words related inclusion hold information children hear adult say incorrect word repair mistake stating correct word children take account repair assigning meanings two vocabulary development school years builds upon child already knows child uses knowledge broaden vocabulary children gained level vocabulary knowledge new words learned explanations using familiar old words done either explicitly new word defined using old words implicitly word set context old words meaning new word children reach schoolage context implicit learning common ways vocabularies continue time children learn new vocabulary mostly conversation throughout schooling adulthood conversation reading main methods vocabulary develops growth tends slow person finishes schooling already acquired vocabulary used everyday conversation reading material generally engaging activities require additional vocabulary first years life children mastering concrete words car bottle dog cat age children likely able learn concrete words without need visual reference word learning tends accelerate around children reach schoolage learn abstract words eg love freedom broadens vocabulary available children learn helps account increase word learning evident school age children tend expressive vocabulary words age approximately words expressive vocabulary words receptive claim children experience sudden acceleration word learning upwards words per tends much gradual age average child school learning words per day age approximately words per exposure conversations engaging conversation others help schoolage children develop vocabulary fast mapping process learning new concept upon single exposure used word learning infants toddlers preschool children adults principle useful word learning conversational settings words tend explained explicitly conversation may referred frequently throughout span conversation reading considered key element vocabulary development schoolage children able read children learn others reading learning vocabulary experiences includes using context well explicit explanations words andor events may done using illustrations book guide explanation provide visual reference comparisons usually prior knowledge past interactions adult child often include childs repetition new word back child begins learn read print vocabulary oral vocabulary tend children use vocabulary knowledge match verbal forms words written forms two forms vocabulary usually equal grade written language much diverse spoken language print vocabulary begins expand beyond oral age childrens vocabulary development reading moves away learning concrete words learning abstract generally conversation reading involve least one four principles context used word learning vocabulary development physical context prior knowledge social context semantic physical context involves presence object action also topic conversation use physical context child exposed words visual reference word frequently used infants toddlers beneficial schoolage children especially learning rare infrequently used physical context may include props toy play engaging play adult childs vocabulary developed discussion toys naming object eg dinosaur labeling use rare word eg sorts interactions expose child words may otherwise encounter daytoday conversation past experiences general knowledge often called upon conversation useful context children learn words recalling past experiences allows child call upon visual tactical oral andor auditory example child went zoo saw elephant know word elephant adult could later help child recall event describing size color animal big ears trunk sound made using word elephant refer animal calling upon prior knowledge used conversation often book reading well help explain happening story relating back childs social context involves pointing social norms violations form context commonly found conversation opposed reading word learning environments childs understanding social norms help infer meaning words occur conversation englishspeaking tradition please thank taught children early age familiar child schoolage example group people eating meal child present one person says give bread another responds rude say person responds please child may know meaning rude infer meaning social context understanding necessity saying semantic support obvious method vocabulary development schoolage children involves giving direct verbal information meaning time children school active participants conversation capable willing ask questions understand word concept example child might see zebra first time ask parent might respond zebra like horse stripes wild ride memory plays important role vocabulary development however exact role plays disputed literature specifically shortterm memory capacities work vocabulary development questioned many researcherswho phonology words proven beneficial vocabulary development children begin school children developed vocabulary utilize sounds already know learn new phonological loop encodes maintains manipulates speechbased information person encounters information stored phonological memory part shortterm memory research shows childrens capacities area phonological memory linked vocabulary knowledge children first begin school age years old memory capabilities tend increase age age adolescence individuals ability learn complex serialorder shortterm memory may critical development lexical knowledge increases phonological representations become precise determine differences similar sound words ie calm come theory specific order sequence phonological events used learn new words rather phonology
