oral polio vaccine opv aids hypothesis nowdiscredited hypothesis aids pandemic originated live polio vaccines prepared chimpanzee tissue cultures accidentally contaminated simian immunodeficiency virus administered one million africans experimental mass vaccination campaigns data analyses molecular biology phylogenetic studies contradict opv aids hypothesis consequently scientific consensus regards hypothesis nature article described hypothesis two vaccines used throughout world combat poliomyelitis first polio vaccine developed jonas salk inactivated poliovirus vaccine ipv consisting mixture three wild virulent strains poliovirus grown type monkey kidney tissue culture vero cell line made noninfectious formaldehyde treatment second vaccine oral polio vaccine opv liveattenuated vaccine produced passage virus nonhuman cells subphysiological temperature passage virus produces mutations within viral genome hinders viruss ability infect nervous vaccines used decades induce immunity polio stop spread infection however opv several advantages vaccine introduced gastrointestinal tract primary site poliovirus infection replication closely mimics natural infection opv also provides long lasting immunity stimulates production polio neutralizing antibodies pharynx hence opv prevents paralytic poliomyelitis also given sufficient doses stop threatening epidemic benefits opv include ease administration low cost suitability mass vaccination oral polio vaccines developed late several groups including led albert sabin hilary koprowski h r poliovirus type strain called sm reported less virulent version sm strain reported koprowski name vaccine strain chat charlton name child donor precursor sabin koprowski cox vaccines clinically tested millions individuals found safe effective monkey trials found fewer side effects sabin vaccine early sabin vaccine licensed us use supported world health koprowskis vaccine administered roughly one million people belgian territories

clarification praised koprowski stated editors rolling stone wish clarify never intended suggest article scientific proof know scientific proof dr koprowski illustrious scientist fact responsible introducing aids human population father rolling stone ordered pay damages whilst incurring around legal fees scientists notably evolutionary biologist w hamilton thought hypothesis required serious investigation received little support scientific example science refused publish letter hamilton sent replied koprowski hamilton kept position said theory rather sadly gone strength strength proven

royal society held meeting discuss data origin aids opv aids hypothesis central topic discussion meeting three independent labs released results tests remaining stocks koprowskis vaccine edward hooper demanded river tests confirmed koprowskis contention vaccine made monkey rather chimpanzee kidney found evidence siv hiv contamination additional epidemiologic phylogenetic data presented conference undermined aspects opv aids hypothesis according report hooper challenge results simply dismissed three articles published nature examined various aspects opv aids hypothesis article published science every case studies findings argued strongly link polio vaccine evidence cited included multiple independent studies dated introduction humans occurring probably results confirmed later study using
