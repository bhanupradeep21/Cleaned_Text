gingival grafting also called gum grafting periodontal plastic generic term performance number periodontal surgical procedures gum tissue grafted aim may cover exposed root surfaces merely augment band keratinized tissue soft tissue oral cavity classified either keratinized nonkeratinized based presence keratin health soft tissue immediately around teeth keratinized referred keratinized tissue gingiva alveolar mucosa non keratinized oral epithelium located apical keratinized tissue delineated mucogingival junction mgj also pointed mucosa surround tooth nonkeratinized tissue also lines cheeks buccal mucosa underside tongue floor mouth lips contain nonkeratinized tissue inside keratinized tissue outside demarcated vermillion border dorsum tongue keratinized features many papillae contain taste exposure tooth root due loss keratinized tissue around neck tooth referred gingival recession result sensitivity pain exposed tooth root surface dentin permeable soft compared enamel dentin makes tooth recession may also cause unasthetic appearance especially located anterior dentition front teeth cases gingival recession require surgical correction various options patient reinforced recession left untreated result tooth loss contrary popular belief also recession left untreated maintained inflammation kept bay proper brushing oral hygiene update hand one desires pursue corrective therapy wide variety techniques ranging autograft tissue usually taken palate allograft someone elses tissue cadaver xenograft animal usually porcine bovine simply repositioning tissue native benefits corrective therapy often result decreased sensitivity coverage root surface addition gain keratinized tissue mentioned beforehand gum grafting also known gingival graft periodontal plastic surgery surgical procedure reverse gum recession gum recession exposes roots lead sensitivity put teeth higher risk damage due loosening attachment within gums bones jaw gum recession continue bone keratinized tissue greater risk damaged permanently lost around teeth aim gum graft extend keratinized tissue gums cover tooth restores firm placement within jaw prevents damage traditional gum

roof mouth use allografting tissue following procedure patients improved quality recovery require less recovery time due enhanced healing coronally apically positioned flaps although technically grafting procedures forms pedicle grafts gingival tissue freed moved either coronally apically requires adequate thickness width gingival tissue base recession defect free gingival graft dental

ingrowth desired area utilizes either resorbable nonresorbable metallic membranes supported titanium tested successful acellular dermal matrix used barrier membrane demineralized freezedried bone allograft advent microsurgical procedures procedures become predictable comfortable patients gum grafts usually performed periodontists trained procedures though generalpurpose dentists may offer procedures outcome comparisons highly variable though periodontists speciallytrained periodontists generally recommend patients seeking services generalpractice dentists literature review showed
