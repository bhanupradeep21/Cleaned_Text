authored second article species describing additional nipponosaurus described member trachodontidae however trachodon considered invalid nomen family known hadrosauridae among relatives nagao thought possibly closest taxa cheneosaurus tetragonosaurus even suggesting species might later prove congeneric one however later determined juvenile forms hypacrosaurus corythosaurus lambeosaurus distinct
