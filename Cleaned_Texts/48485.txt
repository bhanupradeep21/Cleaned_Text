home rare tropical montane grasslands shrublands since islands oceania never connected land continent flora fauna islands originally reached across ocean though height last ice age sea levels much lower today many current seamounts islands isolated islands less isolated reached islands ancestors oceanias present flora fauna adapted life islands larger islands diverse ecological niches encouraged floral faunal adaptive radiation whereby multiple species evolved common ancestor species adapted different ecological niche various species hawaiian honeycreepers family drepanididae classic example adaptations island ecologies include gigantism dwarfism among birds loss flight oceania number endemic species hawaii particular considered global center endemism forest ecoregions one highest percentages endemic plants world land plants disperse several different means many plants mostly ferns mosses also flowering plants disperse wind relying tiny spores feathery seeds remain airborne long distances notably metrosideros trees new zealand spread wind across oceania plants notably coconut palms mangroves produce seeds float salt water long distances eventually washing distant beaches thus cocos trees ubiquitous across oceania birds also important means dispersal plants produce sticky seeds carried feet feathers birds many plants produce fruits seeds pass digestive tracts birds pandanus trees fairly ubiquitous across oceania botanists generally agree much flora oceania derived malesian flora malay peninsula indonesia philippines new guinea plants australasia americas particularly hawaii easter island plants south america totora reed dispersal across ocean difficult land animals oceania relatively indigenous land animals compared realms certain types

birds whose ancestors may blown sea storms birds evolved flightless species ancestors arrived including several species rails number islands indigenous lizards including geckoes skinks whose ancestors probably arrived floating rafts vegetation washed sea storms exception bats live island groups indigenous nonmarine mammals oceania many animal plant species introduced humans two main waves malayopolynesian settlers brought pigs dogs chickens polynesian rats many islands spread across whole oceania ce seventeenth century onwards european settlers brought animals including cats cattle horses small asian mongoose herpestes javanicus sheep goats brown rat rattus norvegicus introduced species addition overhunting deforestation dramatically altered ecology many oceanias islands pushing
