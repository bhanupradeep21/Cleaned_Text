information centre hypothesis ich theory states bird species live communal roosts primarily advantage gaining information others community regarding location unevenly distributed food hypothesis first proposed peter ward israeli biologist amotz zahavi stated birds join assemblages order gain information food resources increase foraging using strategy would allow unsuccessful birds return population gain information often observing behavioural differences successful following exchange knowledge unsuccessful individuals follow deemed successful back resource hypothesis studied experimentally supported many different types communally roosting birds notably crows vultures strategy regarded evolutionarily adaptive would prevent unsuccessful bird start search food random early information centre hypothesis widely accepted used explain communal roosting behaviour however popularity also led substantial one criticism theory multiple assumptions required fulfill criteria support another criticism theory narrow scope pertains strictly food information additional criticism questions whether information centre hypothesis evolutionarily stable information centre hypothesis first described peter ward amotz zahavi theorized communal roosts evolved maintained result advantage obtained unsuccessful individuals locating food resources information provided successful information centre hypothesis requires two conditions met first successful individuals return communal roost feeding second birds without knowledge food source must recognize individuals successful follow back food primary work ward zahavi studied redbilled quelea cattle egret birds noting individuals unsuccessful morning would return communal roost follow birds away roost mock et al provide seven requirements must fulfilled species information centre hypothesis supported first birds successful foraging must return rewarding second individuals discover rewarding locations others remain unaware third previously unsuccessful individuals must able recognize others successful fourth unsuccessful individuals must leave communal roost successful individuals leave fifth previously unsuccessful individuals must follow successful individuals feeding sixth previously unsuccessful individuals must permitted share food source successful seventh overall net benefit receiving information following must greater individual searching food may seem counterproductive successful individual share resource knowledge information centre hypothesis argues behaviour information centre hypothesis argues behaviour defensive mechanism event sudden resource devaluation destroys food source bird would able obtain new resource information roosting idea supported studies show individuals areas recent heavy snowfall searched longer communal roost compared individuals nonsnowy potentially bird would able upgrade resource knowledge others support information centre hypothesis includes idea individuals living groups resource information available lower cost finding addition multiple studies made note food sources flockliving birds typically consumed quickly predators mammals therefore individuals likely suffer sharing knowledge conspecifics due shortlived nature currently speculation information conveyed suggested successful members first convey knowledge displays unsuccessful members follow unsuccessful members circle air slowly fly proceed join successful members take ward zahavi approached explanation ich several different ways explanation related ability distribute knowledge resources case roosting divided several components advertisement synchronized breeding seasonality mood ward zahavi cited variety species demonstrate behaviors supporting ich species exhibited behaviors redwinged blackbirds agelaius phoeniceus exhibit synchronized breeding patterns well displays attract birds join nesting site observation ward zahavi done redbilled queleas cattle egrets showed altered behavior individually failing find food morning later afternoon however resting secondary roost birds failed joined birds flew completely different direction white wagtails cattle egrets two species proposed demonstrate advertisement coloring pattern making noticeable two species often choosing open places assemblages also large variety finch species large longterm roosting sites well large food searching individual basis many benefits aiding unsuccessful na√Øve clueless members example energetically costly successful forager fly back roost back food source foragers may even risk disease parasitism clueless foragers accompanying successful forager may successful forager expects reciprocal unsuccessful members could provide food knowledge successful forager given size mobility roosts unlikely questions applications ich roost members fly search food possible members leave roost time search food independently afterwards fact large group movement may completely unrelated food may protection predators flying another location prior flying difficult determine transfer information occurs may rather roost transfer occurs locally food site instance individual may notice large movement members towards specific location ich may also apply species variations hunting scavenging behaviors instance piscivorous herons rely stealth opposite group feeding movement several heron species also highly territorial allow conspecific feeding studies gulls also show colony members follow knowledgeable gulls cases gull foraging behavior might better explained local transfer information centre hypothesis studied hooded crows corvus cornix hooded crows exhibit communal roosting behaviour often feed flocks making good candidate species studies information centre study conducted sonerud smedshaug brathen examined roost feeding behaviours hooded crows three years results supporting information centre sonerud et al created environment unpredictable ephemeral food sources similar natural environment crows study differentiated leader crows knowledgeable food site day well followers roosted overnight leaders naive crows roost overnight leader visit food site day notably found compared naive individuals follower crows visited food patch day significantly likely visit patch day roosted overnight leader crow familiar food patch leader crow returned day indicated crows unfamiliar food patch received information leader crows regarding foraging success followed location following supported compared naive individuals roost overnight leader significantly lower levels finding food source day studies information centre hypothesis conducted using eurasian griffon vulture gyps fulvus test species due communal roosts may function primarily information study harel et al movements behaviour approximately eurasian griffon vultures recorded fiveyear study categorized individual vultures either uninformed indicating knowledge currently available food source informed either food source flown directly prior two study results showed uninformed vultures followed informed vultures successful food sources thereby gained access addition dyad composed informed uninformed vulture departed roost within two minutes spent greater amount airtime spatially closer distance individuals left roost indicating followtheleader studies conducted using vulture species black vultures coragyps atratus turkey vultures cathartes aura results supporting refuting information centre example study neil buckley black vultures observed benefit communal roosting located food following knowledgeable conspecifics previously visited carcass food study communal benefits black vulture observed turkey vulture creation information centre hypothesis gained popularity popularity came information centre hypothesis faced criticism regarding assumptions views primary purpose communal roosting share information regarding location food sources unsuccessful individuals follow successful individuals back location mock et al argue reasons communal roosting birds antipredator multiple studies found one primary cause communal roost development factors equally important evolution communal roosting criticism states information centre hypothesis valid represent evolutionarily stable strategy according heinz richner philipp heeb primary issue information centre hypothesis concept successful forager would return roost help unsuccessful argue issue solved without making assumptions regarding kin benefits thus hypothesis confirmed addition note information centre hypothesis originally proposed ward zahavi requires assumption individuals fluctuate leaders followers therefore relies altruism literature also criticizes assumption made original studies found information centre hypothesis lays correct framework communal roosting species broadened include aspects beyond resource knowledge sharing information regarding mates review paper bijleveld et al suggests broadening hypothesis include information sharing possibilities better explains phenomenon communal example ward zahavi argued dramatic aerial display bird advertisement others regarding knowledge food however may broader implications original ich allows advertisement acting individual signal quality increase advertising individuals chance obtaining high quality example supports broadening hypothesis basis information food resource location shared httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinformationcentrehypothesis
