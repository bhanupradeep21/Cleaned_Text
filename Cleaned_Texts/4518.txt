syndrome genetic disorder xlinked dominant causes severe mental problems sometimes associated abnormalities growth cardiac abnormalities kyphoscoliosis well auditory visual abnormalities symptoms disease severe males generally diagnosed early childhood children cls display cognitive disabilities varying severity additional neuromuscular features include sleep apnea muscular spasticity progressive loss muscle strength tone leading paraplegia partial paralysis affected individuals elevated risk stroke patients experience stimulusinduced drop attacks sidas temporary paralytic episodes without loss consciousness triggered unpredictable environmental stimuli touch scents sounds etc sida episodes become frequent disease progresses become frequent around adolescence males additional clinical physical features include small soft hands tapered fingers distinct facial architecture flattened nose widely separated downward sloping eyes prominent forehead wide mouth large lips reported coincident facial features patients disorder individuals experience hearing loss others display kyphoscoliosis multidirectional curvature spine lead difficulty breathing andor pulmonary hypertension
