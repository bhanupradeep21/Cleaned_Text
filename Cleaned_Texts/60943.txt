clara franziniarmstrong born florence italianborn american electron professor emeritus cell developmental biology university clara franzini born october florence italy along twin brother child world war ii spent time hillside village lived mother father three brothers paolo carlo marco part childhood occurred war consisted competing brothers exhausting mountain hikes roller skating piazzale michelangelo observing entire beautiful city long relaxing times scenic settings like dolomites furthermore franziniarmstrong strongly remembers constant protection affection twin brother showed growing throughout years schooling franziniarmstrong always studied hard driven curious interested field parents firstgeneration scientists franziniarmstrong three brothers always knew wanted pursue careers science father atomic physicist passionate teaching especially regarding children mother one women time earned physics franziniarmstrongs mother pursue science career spent time home raising four children however franziniarmstrongs mother always strongly encouraged pursue science career franziniarmstrong reports mother gave total equality brothers academic three franziniarmstrongs brothers pursued science careers brother paolo became particle physicist carlo medical physician constructed first interference microscope pisa marco accomplished mineralogist franziniarmstrong enrolled biological sciences program university pisa graduated phd degree presented numerous extraordinary opportunities instance ministry education gave first electron microscope university pisa allowed franziniarmstrong access sparked passion microscopy moreover pathology department chair puccinelli gave franziniarmstrong book sent rome multiple days visit em lab gave chance learn electron microscopy wrote first em thesis university later franziniarmstrong encouraged pellegrino one professors study observe changes induced denervation skeletal muscle ever since worked skeletal cardiac muscle electron microscopy continually conducted electron microscopy studies past years additionally keith r porter offered franziniarmstrong postdoctoral training laboratory harvard university reports opportunity opened doors entirely new world cell biology advanced electron microscopy franziniarmstrong described porter charismatic teacher first large milestone discovery took place two weeks left lab first major discovery franziniarmstrongs transverse tubules open cell surface essential discovery understanding muscle activated numerous additional scientists greatly helped influenced franziniarmstrongs work including richard podolsky sir andrew huxley paul franziniarmstrong worked richard podolskys research assistant national institutes health improved foundation physiology muscle activation franziniarmstrong worked sir andrew huxleys lab began fully comprehend contractile machinery appreciate additionally began learn best deal difficulties accompany early stages raising family working field science moreover paul horowitz helped franziniarmstrong big transition trainee faculty member university rochester horowitz provided freedom pursue career science without responsibilities committee work heavy teaching children still franziniarmstrongs primary interest science disposition membranes macromolecular complexes responsible excitationcontraction ec coupling cardiac skeletal engaged four main phases structural work terms career first phase focused calcium cycling especially defining distribution nature two membrane systems involved specific type cycling franziniarmstrongs second phase discovered location channels release calcium muscle activation also demonstrated muscles engage high activity rates limiting factor density pump protein density calcium release furthermore third phase franziniarmstrongs structural work recognized relationship l type calcium channels plasmalemma tubules cardiac skeletal muscles specifically worked cav channels dihydropyridine receptors dhprs calcium release channels sarcoplasmic reticulum fourth phase continues current interest supramolecular complex enables several molecules located sarcoplasmic reticulum regulate calcium release interact one another current work franziniarmstrong continues utilize structural approaches order better comprehend different interactions simona boncompagni researcher dannunzio university italy describes franziniarmstrong scientist strong determination humanity boncompagni states franziniarmstrong career characterized high scientific achievements immense productivity always open new paul allen agrees explains bench biophysical society meeting years ago singlehandedly saved career scientist helped create one successful multicenter group collaborations ever existed knew clara extraordinary reputation world premier expert muscle histology ultrastructure could imagine would want collaborate franziniarmstrong earned multiple degrees gained great deal professional experience throughout many years education research earned laurea degree firstcycle degree equivalent bachelors degree biological sciences university pisa italy franziniarmstrong worked assistant professor pathology university pisa went earn postdoctoral degree cell biology harvard university worked dr k r porters biology lab worked national institutes health dr r j podolsky earned master research degree muscle franziniarmstrong worked research assistant university college london prof f huxley earned another master research degree muscle structure worked research associate physiology duke university franziniarmstrong worked associate physiology university assistant professor physiology university rochester franziniarmstrong associate professor anatomy university pennsylvania worked professor anatomy university pennsylvania worked professor cell developmental biology university pennsylvania present day franziniarmstrong phd working emeritus professor cell developmental biology perelman school medicine university husband clay armstrong md working emeritus professor physiology perelman school medicine university pennsylvania clara franziniarmstrong clay armstrong members national academy sciences married couple hold high additionally five decades research clara franziniarmstrong clay armstrong done recently recognized professional society general named lecture series clara franziniarmstrongs work primarily focused electron microscopy inner workings cells specifically structural bases excitationcontraction coupling clay armstrongs work centered ion channel permeability mechanisms gating processes cell nobel laureate chemistry rod mackinnon presented inaugural keynote lecture series years annual meeting usually held marine biological laboratory woods hole massachusetts furthermore two additional nobel laureates linda buck martin chalfie delivered nowannual societys friends physiology lecture series honoring clara franziniarmstrong clay today clara franziniarmstrong clay armstrong continue add significant new knowledge field science ongoing laboratory work research publications also continue contribute commitment teaching educating upcoming generation franziniarmstrong married clay armstrong channel electrophysiologist professor physiology university one son john three daughters katie sandra cecilia franziniarmstrong decorated scientist numerous honors awards throughout career starters pisa italy held honor fellowship scuola normale superiore pisa italy held honor perfezionamento postdoctoral fellowship scuola
