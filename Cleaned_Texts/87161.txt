lordosis historically defined abnormal inward curvature lumbar however terms lordosis lordotic also used refer normal inward curvature lumbar cervical regions human similarly kyphosis historically refers abnormal convex curvature spine normal outward convex curvature thoracic sacral regions also termed kyphosis kyphotic term comes greek lord≈çsis lordos bent lordosis human spine makes easier humans bring bulk mass pelvis allows much efficient walking gait primates whose inflexible spines cause resort inefficient forwardleaning bentknee bentwaist gait lordosis human spine considered one primary physiological adaptations human skeleton allows human gait energetically efficient lumbar hyperlordosis excessive extension lumbar region commonly called hollow back saddle back similar condition affects horses sway back different condition different cause glance mimic outward appearance lumbar hyperlordosis lumbar kyphosis abnormally straight severe cases flexed lumbar region normal lordotic curvatures also known secondary curvatures result difference thickness front back parts intervertebral disc lordosis may also increase puberty sometimes becoming evident early needed radiology lordotic view xray taken patient leaning lumbar hyperlordosis condition occurs lumbar region lower back experiences stress extra weight becomes arched normal sometimes leading muscle pain spasms common postural position natural curve lumbar region back slightly dramatically accentuated commonly known swayback common imbalances muscle strength length one cause excessive stress lower back weak hamstrings tight hip flexors psoascitation needed major feature lumbar hyperlordosis forward pelvic tilt resulting pelvis resting top thighs health conditions disorders cause hyperlordosis achondroplasia disorder bones grow abnormally result short stature dwarfism spondylolisthesis condition vertebrae slip forward osteoporosis common bone disease bone density lost resulting bone weakness increased likelihood fracture common causes hyperlordosis causes include obesity hyperkyphosis spine curvature disorder thoracic curvature abnormally rounded discitis inflammation intervertebral disc space caused infection benign juvenile factors may also include rare diseases including ehlers danlos syndrome eds joints throughout body hyperextensible become unstable ie problematically much flexible normal frequently point partial full dislocation hyperextensibility also quite common norm muscles surrounding unstable joint compensate instability contracting excessive lordotic curvature lumbar hyperlordosis also called hollow back saddle back similar condition affects horses swayback usually refers nearly opposite postural misalignment initially look quite common causes lumbar hyperlordosis include tight low back muscles excessive visceral fat pregnancy rickets vitamin deficiency children cause lumbar hyperlordosis less common lumbar hyperlordosiscitation needed hypolordosis also known flatback occurs theres less curve lower back flattening lower back occurs vertebrae oriented toward back spine stretching disc towards back compressing front cause narrowing opening nerves potentially pinching lumbar hyperlordosis also known anterior pelvic tilt noticeable impact height individuals medical issue height loss inches centimeters example height loss

noticed trans women weaker muscles lower back due increased estrogen intake treatmentscitation needed however cause height loss situations little different even though impact similar first scenario due genetic condition trauma spine pregnancy women increased abdominal fat sedentary lifestyle sitting much causes muscle imbalances common reason issue second scenario estrogen weakens muscles
