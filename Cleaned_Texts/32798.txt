psychoactive drugs caffeine amphetamine mescaline lysergic acid diethylamide lsd cannabis chloral hydrate theophylline ibmx others strong effects certain animals believed plants developed caffeine chemical defense swiss pharmacologist peter n witt started research effect drugs spiders initial motivation study request colleague zoologist h peters shift time garden spiders build webs decidedly inconvenient peters earlier witt tested spiders range psychoactive drugs including amphetamine mescaline strychnine lsd caffeine found drugs affect size shape web rather time built small doses caffeine µgspider webs smaller radii uneven regularity circles unaffected higher doses µgspider shape changed web design became irregular drugs tested reduced web regularity except small doses µg lsd increased web drugs administered dissolving sugar water drop solution touched spiders mouth later studies spiders fed drugged qualitative studies welldefined volume solution administered fine syringe webs photographed spider witts research discontinued became reinvigorated paper ja nathanson journal discussed nasa research group repeated witts experiments effect caffeine benzedrine marijuana chloral hydrate european garden spiders nasas results qualitatively similar witt novelty pattern spider web quantitatively analyzed modern statistical tools proposed sensitive method drug nathanson reported effect methylxanthines larvae tobacco hornworm administered solutions finely powdered tea leaves coffee beans larvae observed concentrations coffee tea inhibition feeding associated hyperactivity tremor higher concentrations larvae killed within hours repeated experiments purified caffeine concluded drug responsible effect concentration differences coffee beans tea leaves originated times higher caffeine content latter similar action observed ibmx mosquito larvae mealworm larvae butterfly larvae milkweed bug nymphs inhibition feeding death higher doses flour beetles unaffected ibmx concentrations longterm experiments revealed suppression reproductive nathanson fed tobacco hornworm larvae leaves sprayed psychoactive drugs caffeine formamidine pesticide didemethylchlordimeform ddcdm ibmx theophylline observed similar effect namely inhibition feeding followed death nathanson concluded caffeine related methylxanthines could natural pesticides developed plants protection worms caffeine found many plant species high levels seedlings still developing foliage lacking mechanical caffeine paralyzes kills certain insects feeding upon high caffeine levels also found soil surrounding coffee bean seedlings therefore understood caffeine natural function natural pesticide inhibitor seed germination nearby coffee seedlings thus giving better chance coffee berry borers seem unaffected caffeine feeding rate change given leaves sprayed caffeine solution concluded beetles adapted study developed changing solvent caffeine although aqueous caffeine solutions indeed effect beetles oleate emulsions caffeine inhibit feeding suggesting even certain insects adjusted caffeine forms tricked changing minor details drug results conclusions confirmed similar study slugs snails cabbage leaves sprayed caffeine solutions fed veronicella cubensis slugs zonitoides arboreus snails cabbage consumption reduced time followed death inhibition feeding caffeine also

animal weighing roughly one hundred times much humannote within five minutes collapsed ground one hour forty minutes later died believed lsd cause death although speculate drugs researchers used attempt revive may contributed psychologist ronald k siegel repeated experiment two elephants using lsd bottlenose dolphins administered lsd part nasafunded experiments john c lilly study communication drug caused animals become vocal enable meaningful macaque monkeys administered antipsychotics haloperidol olanzapine month period showed reduced brain volume results observed humans also take drug due lack available scientific study researchers looked different drugs selfadministered squirrel monkeys drugs studied included cocaine others similarities cocaine affect brain trained monkeys give drugs injections observed behavior wanted see drugs similar effects monkeys results showed cocaine drugs similar effects maintaining monkeys selfadministration behavior however one drugs mazindol didnt effect monkeys suggests drugs similar effects may work similar ways brain affecting monkeys behavior comparable manner study also indicated reinforcing addictive stimulating effects drugs might related interact specific areas brain overall research provides insights drugs affect behavior potential researchers used residentintruder model simulate social stress focus social rank influenced effects results showed confrontation influenced monkeys response cocaine subordinate monkeys acted intruders selfadministration lowdose cocaine increased doseresponse curve shifted left contrast dominant monkeys experienced decrease cocaine selfadministration rightward shift doseresponse curve brain glucose metabolism measurements revealed differences dominant subordinate monkeys shedding light underlying mechanisms opposing behavioral effects dominant monkeys showed higher activity brain regions related visual processing attention vigilance subordinate monkeys exhibited higher activity areas linked emotional processing anxiety groups showed increased brain activity regions associated reward system stress response dominant monkeys also displayed higher aggression confrontations suggesting opportunity aggress might serve reinforcer study indicated social context strongly influences behavior drug effects offering insights individual differences drug selfadministration emphasized need consider influence social factors developing treatments cocaine use disorders tailoring interventions individuals based responses social environmental stressors understanding neural behavioral mechanisms play scenarios lead effective personalized treatments individuals cocaine use zebrafish long acted model humans test effects various psychoactive substances one study conducted research society alcoholism concluded given moderate dose ethanol zebrafish became active swam faster dose alcohol increased zebrafish became sluggish another study institute found drunk blood alcohol concentration zebrafish introduced group sober ones sober fish follow drunk individual study testing effects thc memory zebrafish researchers found thc impairs spatial memory effect associative memory zebrafish able remember color patterns associated getting fed put influence thc unable remember spatial pattern associated getting fed put influence zebrafish also used test medicinal benefits certain psychoactive drugs particularly used treat mental health study looking antidepressant properties ketamine using zebrafish subjects found exposed small amounts ketamine mgl zebrafish displayed aggressive behavior however zebrafish exposed higher doses ketamine mgl mgl aggressive behavior subsided moreover highest dose ketamine increased locomotion circling another study testing behavioral effects lsd zebrafish found zebrafish exposed substance demonstrated increased interfish distance shoaling increased cortisol levels could show possible side effects lsd used
