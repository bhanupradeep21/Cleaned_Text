chain survival refers series actions properly executed reduce mortality associated sudden cardiac arrest like chain chain survival strong weakest six interdependent links chain survival early recognition sudden cardiac arrest access emergency medical early cpr early defibrillation early advanced cardiac life support physical emotional recovery first three links chain performed lay bystanders second three links designated medical currently cardiac arrest patients die reach however cardiac arrest lethal bystanders take right steps according american heart association outofhospital cardiac arrest affect people united states three minutes onset cardiac arrest lack blood flow starts damage brain minutes chances survival therefore bystanders minutes act optimize persons chances survival recoverycitation needed improve survival outcomes people experienced outofhospital cardiac arrest american heart liaison committee resuscitation recommended chain survival concept early originally chain consisted four steps early access emergency medical care first link second link early cpr early defibrillation third link final link early advanced cardiac life years american heart association added two new links chain postresuscitation care physical emotional recovery also american heart association issued new pediatric chain survival infants children mary newman cofounder presidentceo sudden cardiac arrest sca foundation previous executive director national center early defibrillation university developed chain survival metaphor first described article wrote journal emergency medical services promoted editorial wrote first issue currents emergency cardiac care american heart association later adopted concept elaborated guidelines cardiopulmonary resuscitation emergency cardiac international liaison committee resuscitation ilcor echoed concept links chain survival described ideally someone must recognize impending cardiac arrest otherwise witness cardiac arrest activate ems system early possible immediate call emergency services unfortunately many persons experiencing symptoms example angina may lead cardiac arrest ignore warning symptoms recognizing warning symptoms correctly fail activate ems system preferring contact relatives instead eg elderly often contact adult offspring rather contact emergency servicescitation needed effective bystanders provide cpr immediately patient collapses guidelines american heart association reemphasized importance bystanders performing handsonly cpr ems personnel arrive present fewer people outofhospital cardiac arrest receive cpr guidelines recommend lay rescuers start cpr person presumed cardiac arrest overall risk harm patients cpr low even heart hasnt stopped properly performed cpr keep heart shockable rhythm minutes longercitation needed adults saved cardiac arrest ventricular fibrillation pulseless ventricular tachycardia means heart fallen early defibrillation link chain likely improve survival since defibrillation help shock heart back regular early rapid defibrillation considered important link chain rapid defibrillation outside hospital improves chances survival much involves using automated external defibrillator aed shock patients cpr keeps blood flowing rapid defibrillation way restart heart reset healthy adults experiencing cardiac arrest receive cpr fewer receive shocks aed ems chances patients survival decrease much every minute receive rapid aeds becoming common businesses schools even home public becomes aware importance rapid aeds come prerecorded instructions easy aed available bystanders need continue cpr emergency responders arrive defibrillator important recognize cardiac arrest call help public access defibrillation may key improving survival rates outofhospital cardiac greatest value links chain fail early advanced cardiac life support paramedics another critical link chain survival communities survival rates minimum two rescuers trained advanced levelcitation needed acls ambulance providers administer medications manage pain arrhythmias shock pulmonary congestion monitor heart rhythm identify potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias initiate transcutaneous acls ambulance providers use mnemonic mona morphine oxygen nitroglycerin aspirin reflect outofhospital therapies use cardiac often acls ambulance providers attach electrocardiogram patient transmit findings receiving hospital care facility leads earlier diagnosis heart attack significantly reduces time treatment prearrival ecg notification shown improve patient event complication scene event way hospital acls ambulance providers administer life saving therapies including cpr rapid defibrillation airway management intravenous october american heart association added recovery phase sixth link chain recovery consists cardiac arrest survivors receiving treatment surveillance rehabilitation also includes assessment anxiety depression posttraumatic stress lead future repeated events discharged hospital american heart association recommends cardiac arrest survivors receive rehabilitation assessment treatment physical neurologic cardiopulmonary cognitive also recommend cardiac arrest survivors caregivers receive comprehensive multidisciplinary discharge planning include medical rehabilitative treatment recommendations return activity work patients recovery cardiac arrest continues long initial hospitalization following event american heart association recommended guidelines patients formal assessment support physical cognitive
