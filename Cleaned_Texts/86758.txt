rhodopsin also known visual purple protein encoded rho gproteincoupled receptor gpcr opsin rod cells retina lightsensitive receptor protein triggers visual phototransduction rods rhodopsin mediates dim light vision thus extremely sensitive rhodopsin exposed light immediately photobleaches humans regenerated fully minutes rods defects rhodopsin gene cause eye diseases retinitis pigmentosa

friedrich kühne george wald discovered rhodopsin holoprotein consisting retinal apoprotein called opsin today would described narrowly today term opsin refers broadly class gproteincoupled receptors
