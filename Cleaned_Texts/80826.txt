carl richard woese july december american microbiologist biophysicist woese famous defining archaea new domain life pioneering phylogenetic taxonomy ribosomal rna technique revolutionized also originated rna world hypothesis although woese held stanley ikenberry chair professor microbiology university illinois carl woese born syracuse new york july woese attended deerfield academy massachusetts received bachelors degree mathematics physics amherst college time amherst woese took one biology course biochemistry senior year scientific interest plants animals advised william fairbank assistant professor physics amherst pursue biophysics completed phd biophysics yale university doctoral research focused inactivation viruses heat ionizing studied medicine university rochester two years quitting two days pediatrics became postdoctoral researcher biophysics yale university investigating bacterial worked biophysicist general electric research laboratory schenectady new woese joined microbiology faculty university illinois focused archaea genomics molecular evolution areas became professor university illinois carl r woese institute genomic biology renamed honor woese died december following complications pancreatic cancer leaving survivors wife gabriella son woese turned attention genetic code setting lab general electrics knolls laboratory fall interest among physicists molecular biologists begun coalesce around deciphering correspondence twenty amino acids four letter alphabet nucleic acid bases decade following james watson francis crick rosalind franklins discovery structure dna woese published series papers topic one deduced correspondence table known soluble rna dna based upon respective base pair reevaluated experimental data associated hypothesis viruses used one base rather triplet encode amino acid suggested codons correctly predicting one work established mechanistic basis protein translation woeses view largely overlooked genetic codes evolutionary origins woese spent several months visiting researcher pasteur institute paris locus intense activity molecular biology gene expression gene paris met sol spiegelman invited woese visit university illinois hearing research goals visit spiegelman offered woese position immediate tenure beginning fall freedom patiently pursue speculative threads inquiry outside mainstream biological research woese began consider genetic code evolutionary terms asking codon assignments translation amino acid sequence might much century prokaryotes regarded single group organisms classified based biochemistry morphology metabolism highly influential paper roger stanier c b van niel first established division cellular organization prokaryotes eukaryotes defining prokaryotes organisms lacking cell adapted édouard chattons generalization stanier van niels concept quickly accepted important distinction among organisms yet nevertheless skeptical microbiologists attempts construct natural phylogenetic classification however became generally assumed life shared common prokaryotic implied greek root πρό pro front carl woese george e fox experimentally disproved universally held hypothesis basic structure tree woese fox discovered kind microbial life called archaebacteria reported archaebacteria comprised third kingdom life distinct bacteria plants defined archaea new urkingdom later domain neither bacteria eukaryotes woese redrew taxonomic tree threedomain system based phylogenetic relationships rather obvious morphological similarities divided life main divisions incorporated within three domains bacteria archaea acceptance validity woeses phylogenetically valid classification slow process prominent biologists including salvador luria ernst mayr objected division criticism restricted scientific level decade laborintensive oligonucleotide cataloging left reputation crank woese would go dubbed microbiologys scarred revolutionary news article printed journal growing body supporting data led scientific community accept archaea today scientists cling idea unified prokarya woeses work archaea also significant implications search life planets discovery woese fox scientists thought archaea extreme organisms evolved microorganisms familiar us believe ancient may robust evolutionary connections first organisms organisms similar archaea exist extreme environments may developed planets harbor conditions conducive extremophile notably woeses elucidation tree life shows overwhelming diversity microbial lineages singlecelled organisms represent vast majority biospheres genetic metabolic ecologic niche microbes crucial many biogeochemical cycles continued function biosphere woeses efforts clarify evolution diversity microbes provided invaluable service ecologists conservationists major contribution theory evolution knowledge history woese wrote evolutionary concerns center bacteria archaea whose evolutions cover planets history using ribosomal rna sequence evolutionary measure laboratory reconstructed phylogeny groups thereby provided phylogenetically valid system classification prokaryotes discovery archaea fact product woese also speculated era rapid evolution considerable horizontal gene transfer occurred first described woese fox paper explored microbiologist jane gibson paper organisms progenotes imagined protocells low complexity due errorprone translation apparatus noisy genetic transmission channel produced high mutation rates limited specificity cellular interaction size early translation apparatus would produced group structurally similar functionally equivalent proteins rather single furthermore reduced specificity cellular components susceptible horizontal gene transfer rapid evolution occurred level transition modern cells darwinian threshold occurred organisms evolved translation mechanisms modern levels fidelity improved performance allowed cellular organization reach level complexity connectedness made genes organisms much less able displace individuals later years woeses work concentrated genomic analysis elucidate significance horizontal gene transfer hgt worked detailed analyses phylogenies aminoacyltrna synthetases effect horizontal gene transfer distribution key enzymes among goal research explain primary cell types archaeal eubacterial eukaryotic evolved ancestral state rna woese shared thoughts past present future biology current important questions century biology faces stem single question nature generation biological organization yes darwin back company scientists see much depths biology possible heretofore longer species birds view seen procession forms concern process evolution see question biological organization taking two prominent directions today first evolution proteinaceous cellular organization includes subquestions evolution translation apparatus genetic code origin nature hierarchies control finetune precisely interrelate panoply cellular processes constitute cells also includes question number different basic cell types exist earth today modern cells come single ancestral cellular second major direction involves nature global ecosystem bacteria major organisms numbers total mass importance global balances thus microbial ecology need development terms facts needed understand terms framework interpret woese considered biology allimportant role society view biology serve broader purpose pursuit engineered formally recognized physics needs recognized biology science serves dual function one hand societys
