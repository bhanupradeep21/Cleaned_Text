fetal origins hypothesis differentiated developmental origins health disease hypothesis emphasizes environmental conditions immediately birth proposes period gestation significant impacts developmental health wellbeing outcomes individual ranging infancy adulthood effects fetal origin marked three characteristics latency wherein effects may apparent much later life persistency whereby conditions resulting fetal effect continue exist given individual genetic programming describes switching specific gene due prenatal research areas economics epidemiology epigenetics offer support

women infecting one third american women pregnant children born mothers infected gestation experienced many handicaps later life born experienced wage drop often found lower educational achievement overall children also likely disabled comparable cohorts early late experience utero study conducted found utero exposure pandemic led higher chances developing coronary heart disease kidney disease
