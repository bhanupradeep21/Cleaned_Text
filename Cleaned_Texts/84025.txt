mutation breeding sometimes referred variation breeding process exposing seeds chemicals radiation order generate mutants desirable traits bred cultivars plants created using mutagenesis sometimes called mutagenic plants mutagenic seeds mutagenic plant varieties derived either direct mutants progeny crop plants account released mutagenic species remaining ornamentals decorative however although faoiaea reported mutant varieties major staple crops grown unclear many varieties currently used agriculture horticulture around world seeds always identified labeled mutagenic according garden historian paige johnson wwii concerted effort find peaceful uses atomic energy one ideas bombard plants radiation produce lots mutations hoped would lead plants bore heavily disease coldresistant unusual colors experiments mostly conducted giant gamma gardens grounds national laboratories us also europe countries different kinds mutagenic breeding using chemical mutagens like ethyl methanesulfonate dimethyl sulfate radiation transposons generate mutants mutation breeding commonly used produce traits crops larger seeds new colors sweeter fruits either found nature lost exposing
