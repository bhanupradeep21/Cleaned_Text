cultural essentialism argue justified assume culture simplified traceable distinguishable statistically quantifiable factors everything outside factors must biological since cultural influences mixed including parents teachers also peers friends media cultural influence different effects depending earlier cultural influences critical psychiatrists argue persons belief unshaken one influence prove
