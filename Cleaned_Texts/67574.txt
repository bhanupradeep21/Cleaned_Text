adipsia also known hypodipsia symptom inappropriately decreased absent feelings involves increased osmolality concentration solute urine stimulates secretion antidiuretic hormone adh hypothalamus kidneys causes person retain water ultimately become unable feel thirst due rarity disorder subject many research studies adipsia may seen conditions diabetes may result occur result abnormalities hypothalamus pituitary corpus well following pituitaryhypothalamic possible hypothalamic dysfunction may result adipsia present without physical lesions hypothalamus although four reported cases also cases patients experiencing adipsia due psychiatric disease rare psychogenic cases patients normal levels urine osmolality well typical adh dopamine neurotransmitter linked feeding behaviors experiment scientists measured much food water mice consumed born without dopamine systems found without dopamine mice would starve dehydrated point death scientists injected mice without dopamine precursor ldopa mice started eating even though mice born without dopamine systems still capacity control feeding drinking behaviors suggesting dopamine play role developing neural circuits instead dopamine closely related drive hunger thirst although lack dopamine resulted adipsia rats low levels dopamine necessarily cause adipsia findings support role dopamine thirst regulation involved nigrostriatal pathway completely degenerating pathway animal becomes adipsic aphagic loses interest exploring although dopamine plays role adipsia research involving exclusively relationship adipsia dopamine changes dopamine simultaneously mediate changes eating curiosity addition area brain regulates thirst located anterior part hypothalamus anterior hypothalamus close proximity osmoreceptors regulate secretion antidiuretic hormone adh adh secretion one primary mechanisms sodium osmolar homeostasis regulated adh also secreted small increases serum osmolality thirst triggered increases serum osmolality along increases adh secretion serum osmolality adh maintain normal ranges serum osmolalitycitation needed adipsia tend result lesions hypothalamic regions involved thirst regulation lesions congenital acquired trauma even surgery lesions injuries hypothalamic regions cause adipsia lesions cause defects thirst regulating center lead adipsia lesions region also cause adipsia extremely close anatomical proximity hypothalamus adhrelated diagnosing adipsia difficult set concrete physical signs adipsia specific changes brain indicative adipsia include hyperpnea muscle weakness insomnia lethargy convulsions although uncommon except extreme cases incredibly rapid rehydration patients history brain tumors congenital malformations may hypothalamic lesions could indicative adults type adipsia anorexic addition initial testing adipsia involves electrolyte blood urea nitrogen bun creatinine levels serum urine osmolality blood hormone levels like vasopressin avp patients defects thirst regulation vasopressin secretion serum vassopressin levels low measurements urine electrolytes osmolality critical determining central rather renal nature defect water homeostasis adipsia fractional excretion sodium less unless coexisting defect avp secretion present salt intoxication urine sodium concentrations high fractional excretion sodium greater initial test results may suggestive diabetes insipidus circulating avp levels tend high indicate appropriate response pituitary hyperosmolality patients may mild stable elevations serum sodium concentrations along elevations bun creatinine levels buncreatinine type essential hypernatremia syndrome involves increase level solvent molecules pass cell membranes osmotic threshold vasopressin release activation feeling thirst characterized subtype adipsia however known cause type adipsia debate whether osmoreceptor resetting could lead increase threshold studies shown loss osmoreceptors resetting cause change patients type adipsia risk seizures rapidly rehydrate quickly add significant amount sodium bodies treated type adipsia could result decrease size brain bleeding type b adipsia occurs vasopressin responses decreased levels presence osmotic stimuli although minimal still secretion avp type may due elimination type c adipsia type c osmoreceptor dysfunction involves complete elimination osmoreceptors result vasopressin release normally would type c generally adipsia type found patients adipsic diabetes type least commonly diagnosed researched type adipsia avp release subtype occurs normally functioning levels people affected adipsia lack ability feel thirst thus often must directed drink adipsic persons may undergo training learn necessary drink water currently medicine available treat adipsia people adipsia hypothalamic damage surgical medicinal option fix damage cases adipsia caused growths thirst centers brain surgical removal growths successful treating adipsia although adipsic persons must maintain strict water intake schedule diets participation physical activities limited people affected diabetes insipidus option using intranasal oral hormone desmopressin acetate ddavp molecularly similar enough vasopressin perform function case desmopressin helps kidneys promote reabsorption doctors reported success treating psychogenic adipsic patients electroconvulsive therapy although results mixed reason success still additionally patients successfully complete behavioral therapy may require nasogastric tube order maintain healthy levels
