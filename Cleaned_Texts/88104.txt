aftertaste taste intensity food beverage perceived immediately food beverage removed aftertastes different foods beverages vary intensity time unifying feature aftertaste perceived food beverage either swallowed spat neurobiological mechanisms taste aftertaste signal transduction taste receptors mouth brain yet fully understood however primary taste processing area located insula observed involved aftertaste characteristics foods aftertaste quality intensity quality describes actual taste food intensity conveys magnitude taste duration describes long foods aftertaste sensation lasts foods lingering aftertastes typically long sensation durations taste perception unique every person descriptors taste quality intensity standardized particularly use scientific taste quality foods described commonly used terms sweet sour salty bitter umami taste description aftertaste perception relies heavily upon use words convey taste sensed food removed mouth description taste intensity also subject variability among individuals variations borg category ratio scale similar metrics often used assess intensities scales typically categories range either zero one ten sometimes beyond ten describe taste intensity food score zero one would correspond unnoticeable weak taste intensities higher score would correspond moderate strong taste intensities prolonged moderate strong taste intensities persist even food longer present mouth describe aftertaste sensation foods distinct aftertastes distinguished temporal profiles long tastes perceived consumption sample testing procedure measure foods temporal profile would entail first recording time onset initial taste perception food consumed recording time longer perceived difference two values yields total time taste perception match intensity assessments time interval representation foods taste intensity time obtained respect aftertaste type testing would measure onset taste perception point food removed mouth categorization people tasters nontasters based sensitivity bitterness propylthiouracil expression fungiform papillae tongues suggested genetic basis variations observed taste perception person might imply activities specific genes affect individuals perception different foods sensations aftertaste could also affect individuals perception different foods example intensity aftertaste sensations nontasters experienced caffeine consumption found diminish faster sensations tasters may imply tastebud profiles tasters may sensitive tastes different foods thus experience persistent sensation foods tastes lingering taste sensation intrinsic aftertaste molecular mechanisms underlie aftertaste presumed linked either continued delayed activation receptors signaling pathways mouth involved taste processing current understanding foods taste communicated brain context aftertaste combination receptordependent receptorindependent processes proposed explain signal transduction mechanisms foods distinct aftertastes particularly receptordependent process described however receptorindependent process involves diffusion bitter amphiphilic chemicals like quinine across taste receptor cell membranes inside taste receptor cell compounds observed activate intracellular gproteins proteins involved signaling pathways routed bitter compounds thus activate taste receptors cell surface well signaling pathway proteins intracellular space intracellular signaling may slower taste cell receptor activation since time necessary bitter compounds diffuse across cell membrane interact intracellular proteins delayed activation intracellular signaling proteins response bitter compounds addition extracellular receptor signaling proposed related lingering aftertaste associated bitter combination mechanisms leads overall longer response taste receptor cells bitter foods aftertaste perception subsequently occurs primary taste perception areas cerebral cortex located insula regions somatosensory cortex nucleus solitary tract located brainstem also plays major role taste regions identified human subjects exposed taste stimulus cerebral blood flow measured magnetic resonance imaging although regions identified primary zones taste processing brain cortical areas also activated eating sensory inputs signaled cortex aftertaste much unclear cortical processing related perception first neuroimaging study evaluate temporal taste profile aspartame artificial sweetener humans published insula observed activated longer period time sensory processing areas brain aftertaste profile aspartame measured subjects administered solution aspartame specific amount time instructed swallow solution functional magnetic resonance images blood flow subjects brains recorded swallowed aspartame solution swallowing amygdala somatosensory cortex thalamus basal ganglia activated swallowing insula remained activated response brain regions evident suggests insula may primary region aftertaste sensation activated even aspartame solution longer present mouth finding aligns insulas identification central taste processing area simply expands function explanation less activation amygdala reward center brain less reward would experienced subjects prolonged exposure aspartame solution flavor emergent property combination multiple sensory systems including olfaction taste flavor food perceived whether unpleasant satisfying stored memory next time similar food encountered previous experience recalled decision made consume food process multisensory inputs brain eating followed learning eating experiences central idea flavor richard stevenson mentions psychology flavour people often realize foods flavor described foods smell taste texture instead claims people perceive flavor unitary percept descriptor either taste smell used describe foods consider terms used describe flavors foods instance food may taste sweet often flavor described considering smell sensory characteristics example honey tastes sweet smell associated descriptor sweet also used describe flavor fact sweetness one four basic taste qualities comprises part foods flavor unlike flavor aftertaste solely gustatory event considered involve major senses distinction based one aftertaste versus multiple flavor sensory inputs separates two phenomena lowcalorie artificial sweeteners like saccharin acesulfamek known bitter recently butanoic acid chemical blocks saccharin acesulfamek activation multiple bitter taste receptors study addition bitter taste receptor antagonist saccharin acesulfamek solutions resulted significantly lower taste intensity ratings compared solutions treated suggests inhibits normal functions bitter taste receptors saccharin acesulfameks bitter aftertastes observed ability inhibit activation bitter taste receptors farreaching effects bitter aftertastes two artificial sweeteners also foods beverages even pharmaceuticals minimized wine tasting aftertaste finish wine important part tasting wine taster determine wines aftertaste major determinant wines quality aftertaste wine described bitter persistent short sweet smooth even nonexistent included assessing aftertaste wine consideration aromas still present swallowing high quality wines typically long finishes accompanied pleasant assessing combination olfactory aftertaste sensations wine tasting actually determines aftertaste profile wine flavor profile well httpsenwikipediaorgwikiaftertaste
