aldehyde reuterin inhibits growth harmful gramnegative grampositive bacteria along yeasts fungi researchers found l reuteri secrete sufficient amounts reuterin achieve desired antimicrobial effects furthermore since four five times amount reuterin needed kill good gut bacteria ie l reuteri lactobacillus species bad would allow l reuteri remove gut invaders without harming gut studies questioned
