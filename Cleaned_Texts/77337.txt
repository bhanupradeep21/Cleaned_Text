impossible transport sodium potassium across membrane results raising intracellular concentration na accumulation intracellular sodium ions cause increase intracellular calcium calciumsodium exchange pump activity decreases calciumsodium exchange pump exchanges na without use exchanger essential maintaining sodium calcium homeostasis exact mechanism exchanger works unclear known calcium sodium move either direction across membrane muscle cells also known three sodium ions exchanged calcium increase intracellular sodium concentration exchange mechanism leads increase intracellular calcium concentration intracellular sodium increases concentration gradient driving sodium cell across exchanger reduced result activity exchanger reduced decreases movement calcium cellcitation needed thus inhibiting nakatpase cardiac glycosides cause intracellular sodium concentration increase leads accumulation intracellular calcium via system following effects conformational change nakatpase plays
