psychology art relationship art emotion newly subject extensive study thanks intervention esteemed art historian alexander nemerov emotional aesthetic responses art previously viewed basic stimulus response new theories research suggested experiences complex able studied emotional responses often regarded keystone experiencing art creation emotional experience argued purpose artistic research shown neurological underpinnings perceiving art differ used standard object instead brain regions involved experience emotion goal setting show activation viewing evolutionary ancestry hardwired humans affective responses certain patterns traits predispositions lend responses looking certain visual arts well identification subject matter first step understanding visual image presented visual stimuli creates initial methods stimulating initial interest lead emotion involves pattern recognition symmetry often found works art human brain unconsciously searches symmetry number reasons potential predators bilaterally symmetrical potential prey bilateral symmetry also exists humans healthy human typically relatively symmetrical attraction symmetry therefore advantageous helped humans recognize danger food mates art containing symmetry therefore typically approached positively valenced another example observe paintings photographs bright open landscapes often evoke feeling beauty relaxation happiness connection pleasant emotions exists advantageous humans todays society able see far distance brightly lit vista similarly visual images dark andor obscure typically elicit
