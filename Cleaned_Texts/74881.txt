described named two mountains near discovery site wapta mountain mount field although bears remarkable resemblance modern crustaceans taxonomic affinities long unclear comprehensive redescription published classified member hymenocarina contains numerous bivalved arthropods within mandibulata known specimens waptia range length millimetres vast majority millimetres long bivalved carapace saddle shaped thin non mineralised likely flexible life carapace laterally compressed distinct boundary two halves carapace attached body small section near front head body divided three main segments cephalothorax head postcephalothorax abdomen front head bore pair reniform kidney shaped eyes millimetre across born short stalks one specimen preserved ommatidia shows density ommatidia eye per square millimetre suggested allowed good side forward vision pair small lobes millimetre long protrude near eyes similar structures known related canadaspis well mandibulates thought correspond hemiellipsoid bodies crustaceans thus likely olfactory function eyes triangular structure dubbed median triangular projection probably homologous anterior sclerite cambrian arthropods head bears pair antennae composed elongate cylindrical segmentspodomeres sequentially reduce width towards tip antenna front ends podomere bear setae orientated angle relative antennae axis mandibles threesegmented projection covered setae mandibles shows evidence sclerotisation toward edge two mandibles contacted toothed margin mandibles likely biting grinding function maxillae composed least six probably nine podomeres end podomere bears pair claws along numerous setae likely assisted food manipulation alongside mandibles cephalothorax four additional pairs uniramous leglike appendages first three well

waptia referred waptia cf fieldensis also found recovered middle cambrian spence shale utah specimens associated three dimensionally preserved waptia fieldensis species accepted genus waptia classified family waptiidae established walcott authors suggested waptia may allied crustaceans others proposed may distantly related crustaceans least member stem group crustaceans even waptia comprehensively redescribed placed part clade hymenocarina within mandibulata closely related crustacea due clear presence mandibles apparently similar species described lower cambrian million years ago maotianshan shale lagerstätte chengjiang china originally placed within ostracodlike genus mononotella mononotella ovata hou xianguang jan bergström reclassified new genus chuandianella additional discoveries complete specimens made resemblance w fieldensis apparent like w fieldensis chuandianella ovata bivalved carapace median ridge pair caudal rami single pair antennae stalked eyes junyuan chen tentatively transferred genus waptia however c ovata eight abdominal somites contrast five w fieldensis limbs biramous undifferentiated unlike w authors deemed differences enough separate waptia chuandianella redescribed shown lack mandibles thus probably closely related waptia despite similar second similar species pauloterminus spinodorsalis recovered lower cambrian sirius passet lagerstätte buen formation northern greenland also identified possible waptiid like c ovata biramous undifferentiated appendages also five abdominal somites like w fieldensis however poor preservation p spinodorsalis specimens particularly appendages head make difficult ascertain taxonomic placement difficulty compounded evidence fossils p spinodorsalis may fact moults exuviae actual historically considered deposit feeding sifting sea bottom edible organic reexamination considered waptia actively swimming predator softbodied prey items using first three pairs cephalothorax leglike appendages capture manipulate prey moving lamellated appendages rhythmic motion propel water movement abdomen tail fan likely used move vertically within water column may used claws cephalothoracic leglike appendages occasionally rest egg clutches identified six specimens burgess shale clutch sizes small containing eggs egg relatively large average diameter mm attached along inner surface bivalved carapace along kunmingella douvillei chuandianella chengjiang biota around million years older burgess shale also fossilized eggs preserved inside carapace constitute oldest direct evidence brood care
