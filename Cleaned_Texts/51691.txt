sexual cannibalism animal usually female cannibalizes mate prior trait observed many arachnid orders several insect crustacean several hypotheses explain seemingly paradoxical behavior proposed adaptive foraging aggressive spillover mistaken identity among proposed hypotheses explain sexual cannibalism evolved behavior believed evolved manifestation sexual conflict occurring reproductive interests males females many species exhibit sexual cannibalism female consumes male upon detection females cannibalistic species generally hostile unwilling mate thus many males species developed adaptive behaviors counteract female sexual cannibalism common among insects also evidence sexual cannibalism gastropods sexual cannibalism common among species prominent sexual size dimorphism ssd extreme ssd likely drives trait sexual cannibalism different hypotheses proposed explain sexual cannibalism namely adaptive foraging aggressive spillover mate choice mistaken identity adaptive foraging hypothesis proposed precopulatory explanation females assess nutritional value male compared males value starving females usually poor physical condition therefore likely cannibalize male mate among mantises cannibalism female pseudomantis albofimbriata improves fecundity overall growth body study chinese mantis found cannibalism occurred among spiders dolomedes triton females need additional energy nutrients egg development choose consume closest nutritional source even means cannibalizing potential agelenopsis pennsylvanica lycosa tarantula significant increase fecundity egg case size hatching success survivorship offspring observed hungry females choose cannibalize smaller males copulating larger genetically superior reproductive success largely due increased energy uptake cannibalizing males investing additional energy development larger higherquality egg triton postcopulatory sexual cannibalism observed females limited food source females copulated males cannibalized adaptive foraging hypothesis criticized males considered poor meals compared crickets however recent findings discovered hogna helluo males nutrients crickets lack including various proteins h helluo females higher protein diet cannibalizing males consuming house studies show argiope keyserlingi females highproteinlowlipid diets resulting sexual cannibalism may produce eggs greater egg energy density yolk aggressive spillover hypothesis suggests aggressive female concerning prey likely female cannibalize potential decision female cannibalize male defined nutritional

cannibalistic species result sexual mechanism male approaches female imperative survival female unable detect presence male less likely face cannibalization evident mantid species tenodera aridifolia male alters approach utilizing surrounding windy conditions male attempts avoid detection approaching female wind impairs ability hear praying mantid species pseudomantis albofimbrata males approach female either slow mounting rear slow approach front position remain male alters approach utilization surrounding windy conditions thus risk facing cannibalization sexual cannibalism impaired ability orbweaving spider n fenestrata perform mate guarding male successfully mates female exhibits mate guarding inhibiting female remating thus ensuring paternity eliminating sperm guarding refer blockage female genital openings prevent insertion competing males pedipalps physical guarding potential mates guarding decrease female remating fifty males experience genital mutilation sometimes exhibit gloves hypothesis states males body weight endurance inversely proportional thus males body weight decreases substantially endurance increases result allowing guard female mate increased mate binding refers precopulatory courtship behavior male deposits silk onto abdomen female simultaneously massaging order reduce aggressive behavior action allows initial subsequent copulatory chemical tactile cues important factors reducing cannibalistic behaviors latter functions resource calm female exhibited orbweaver spider species nephila additional hypotheses suggest male silk contains pheromones seduce female submission however silk deposits necessary successful primary factor successful subsequent copulation lies tactile communication male female spider results female acceptance male mounts posterior portion females abdomen rubbing spinnerets abdomen attempt mate binding necessary initiation copulation golden orbweaving spider except female resistant mating subsequent copulatory bouts imperative males ability copulate due prolonged sperm transfer therefore increasing probability courtship displays sexually cannibalistic spiders imperative order ensure female less aggressive additional courtship displays include precopulatory dances observed redback spider vibrant male coloration morphologies function female attraction mechanisms seen peacock spider maratus nuptial gifts play vital role safe copulation males species males present meals female facilitate opportunistic mating female subsequent improvements male adaptive mating success include web reduction seen western black widow latrodectus mating occurs males destroy large portion females web discourage female future mating thus reducing polyandry observed australian redback spider latrodectus species spiders agelenopsis aperta male induces passive state female prior hypothesized cause quiescent state males massaging females abdomen following male vibratory signals web female enters passive state males risk facing cannibalism reduced state likely induced result male volatile chemical structure pheromone utilized male aperta currently unknown however physical contact necessary induced passive state eunuch males males partially fully removed palps unable induce passive state females distance induce quiescence upon physical contact female suggests pheromone produced potentially related sperm production since male inserts sperm pedipalps structures removed adaptation likely evolved response overly aggressive nature female spiders order avoid consumed female male spiders may utilize silk

significant role copulation longer leg lengths male p mira generally favored shorter lengths physiological impacts cannibalism male fitness include inability father offspring unable mate female males species arachnids n plumipes sire offspring male cannibalized mating copulation prolonged sperm transfer species orbweaving spider argiope arantia males prefer short copulation duration upon first palp insertion order avoid cannibalism upon second insertion however male remains inserted female male exhibits programmed death function fullbody genital plug causes become increasingly difficult female remove genital openings discouraging mating additional benefit cannibalization idea wellfed female less likely mate female desire mate male already mated paternity ensured copulating females certain males spider species superfamily araneoidea become half full eunuchs one pedipalps male genitals severed behavior often seen sexually cannibalistic spiders causing exhibit eunuch due chance may eaten copulation male spiders use genital mutilation increase chances successful mating male increase chances paternity females copulatory organs blocked decreases sperm competition chances mating males one study females mating plugs lower chance additionally male successfully severs pedipalp within female copulatory duct pedipalp serve plug continue release sperm female spermathacae increasing males chances paternity referred remote occasionally cases study nephilidae spiders palp severance partial due copulation interruption sexual cannibalism partial palp severance result successful mating plug extent full palp males orbweaving spider argiope arantia found spontaneously die within fifteen minutes second copulation male dies pedipalps still intact within female well still swollen copulation programmed death male able utilize entire body genital plug female causing much difficult remove copulatory species males voluntarily selfamputate pedipalp prior mating thus mutilation driven sexual cannibalism hypothesized due increased fitness advantage half full eunuchs upon losing pedipalp males experience significant decrease body weight provides enhanced locomotor abilities endurance enabling better search mate mateguard mating referred glovesoff males females also seen roles reversed terms genital mutilation cyclosa argenteoalba males mutilate female spiders genitals detaching females scape making impossible another male mate male reproductive success determined number fathered offspring monogyny seen quite often sexually cannibalistic species males willing sacrifice lose reproductive organs order ensure paternity one mating whether spontaneous programmed death male catapulting mouth female selfsacrificing males die order prolonged copulation occur males many species replenish sperm stores therefore must exhibit extreme behaviors order ensure sperm transfer fathered offspring one mating instance example behavior seen redback spider males species somersault mouths female copulation occurred shown increase paternity sixtyfive percent compared males cannibalized majority males species likely die search mate male must sacrifice offering means prolonged copulation doubled paternity many species cannibalized males mate longer thus longer sperm although females often instigate sexual cannibalism reversed sexual cannibalism observed spiders micaria allocosa laboratory experiment sociabilis males preferred eat older females behavior may interpreted adaptive foraging older females low reproductive potential food may limited reversed cannibalism sociabilis may also influenced size dimorphism males females similar size bigger males likely brasiliensis males tend cannibalistic mating seasons mated gone burrows search food left mates burrows females cross period likely little reproductive value may also interpreted adaptive also observed crab ovalipes catharus reversed sexual cannibalism also observed reptilian species called malpolon monspessulanus commonly known montpellier snakes behavior may occur due opportunistic feeding habits lack availability prey competition resources among individuals species species exhibits
