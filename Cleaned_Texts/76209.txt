models abnormality general hypotheses nature psychological abnormalities four main models explain psychological abnormality biological behavioural cognitive psychodynamic models attempt explain causes treatments psychological illnesses different approach biological model abnormality model based psychological principles based assumptions brain neuroanatomy related biochemicals physical entities work together mediate psychological processes treating mental abnormality must physicalbiological part theory stems much research major neurotransmitter serotonin seems show major psychological illnesses bipolar disorder anorexia nervosa caused abnormally reduced levels serotonin model also suggests psychological illness could treated like physical illness caused chemical imbalance microbes physical stress hence treated surgery drugs electroconvulsive therapy also proved successful shortterm treatment depressive symptoms bipolar disorder related illnesses although reasons success almost completely unknown also evidence genetic factor causing psychological main cures psychological illness model electroconvulsive therapy drugs surgery times good results restoring normality biology shown play sort role psychological illness however also consequences whether biology responsible drugs always chance causing allergic reactions addiction electrotherapy cause unnecessary stress surgery dull personality part brain responsible emotion hypothalamus often altered even completely removed diagnosis mental illness implies person way responsible abnormality functioning blame concept blame generally thought humane likely elicit much sympathetic response others however zarate pointed even physical illness mental illness something people fear largely something understand general people know respond someone diagnosed mentally ill may also fears persons behaviour might unpredictable potentially dangerous therefore sympathy likely give way avoidance person turn leads person feeling shunned huge amount research carried within framework medical model greatly increased understanding possible biological factors underpinning psychological disorders however much evidence inconclusive findings difficult interpret example family studies difficult disentangle effects genetics effects environment also difficult establish cause effect example raised levels dopamine may consequence rather cause schizophrenia many psychologists criticise psychiatry focusing attention primarily symptoms assuming relieving symptoms drugs cures problem unfortunately many cases drug treatment ceased symptoms recur suggests drugs addressing true cause behavioural model assumes maladaptive behaviour essentially acquired ones environment therefore psychiatrists practising beliefs model would prioritise changing behaviour identifying cause dysfunctional behaviour main solution psychological illness model aversion therapy stimulus provokes dysfunctional behaviour coupled second stimulus aims produce new reaction first stimulus based experiences second also systematic desensitisation used especially phobias involved using phobia currently causes dysfunctional behaviour coupling phobia produces intense reaction meant make first phobia seem less fearsome etc put comparison second phobia model seems quite successful phobias compulsive disorders concerned doesnt focus cause illness problem risks recurrence problem behavioural model overcomes ethical issues raised medical model labeling someone ill abnormal instead model concentrates behaviour whether adaptive maladaptive model also allows individual cultural differences taken account provided behaviour presenting problems individual people need regard behaviour mental disorder support psychodynamic model however claim behavioural model focuses symptoms ignores causes abnormal behaviour claim symptoms merely outward expression deeper underlying emotional problems whenever symptoms treated without attempt ascertain deeper underlying problems problem manifest another way different symptoms known symptom substitution behaviourists reject criticism claim need look beyond behavioural symptoms symptoms disorder thus nothing gained searching internal causes either psychological physical behaviourists point success behavioural therapies treating certain disorders others note effects treatments always longlasting another criticism behavioural model ethical issues raises claim therapies dehumanising unethical example aversion therapy imposed people without consent cognitive model abnormality focuses cognitive distortions dysfunctions thought processes cognitive deficiencies particularly absence sufficient thinking model holds variables cause many psychological disorders psychologists following outlook explain abnormality terms irrational negative main position thinking determines cognitive model abnormality one dominant forces academic psychology beginning appeal partly attributed way emphasizes evaluation internal mental processes perception attention memory problemsolving process allows psychologists explain development mental disorders link cognition brain function especially develop therapeutic techniques comes treatment abnormal behavior mental disorder cognitive model quite similar behavioural model main difference instead teaching patient behave differently teaches patient think differently hoped patients feelings emotions towards something influenced change induce external behavioural change though similar ways behavioural model therapists working model use differing methods cures one key assumption cognitive therapy treatment include helping people restructure thoughts think positively life one main treatments rational emotive therapy ret based principle activating emotional event cause change thoughts toward situation even illogical thought therapy therapists job question change irrational thoughts similar behavioural model success concerned also proved quite successful treatment compulsive disorders phobias although deal cause problem directly attempt change situation broadly behavioural model due respective characteristics similarities instances psychologists combine cognitive behavioural models treat mental psychodynamic model fourth psychological model abnormality based work sigmund freud based principles psychological illnesses come repressed emotions thoughts experiences past usually childhood result repression alternative behaviour replaces repressed patient believed cured admit currently
