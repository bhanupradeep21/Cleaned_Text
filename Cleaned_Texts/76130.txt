glutamate receptors domoic acid excitatory amino acid analogue glutamate neurotransmitter brain activates glutamate receptors domoic acid strong affinity receptors results excitotoxicity initiated integrative action ionotropic glutamate receptors sides synapse coupled effect blocking channel rapid desensitization addition synergistic effect endogenous glutamate nmethyldaspartate receptor agonists contribute excitotoxicity brain domoic acid especially damages hippocampus amygdaloid nucleus damages neurons activating ampa kainate receptors causing influx calcium although calcium flowing
