phylogenetic trees specifying time constraints one nodes tree early methods clock calibration used single fossil constraint eg nonparametric rate newer methods allow use multiple fossils calibrate molecular clocks oldest fossil clade used constrain minimum possible age node representing recent common ancestor clade however due incomplete fossil preservation factors clades typically older oldest order account nodes allowed older minimum constraint node calibration analyses however determining much older node allowed challenging number strategies deriving maximum bound age clade including based birthdeath models fossil stratigraphic distribution analyses taphonomic alternatively instead maximum minimum probability density used represent uncertainty age clade calibration densities take shape standard probability densities eg normal lognormal exponential gamma used express uncertainty associated divergence time estimates determining shape parameters probability distribution trivial
