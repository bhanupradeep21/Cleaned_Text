hocketts design features set features characterize human language set apart animal communication defined linguist charles f hockett called characteristics design features language hockett originally believed design features primate communication utilizes first features final features displacement productivity cultural transmission duality reserved humanscitation needed hockett later added prevarication reflexiveness learnability list uniquely human characteristics asserted even basic human languages possess features charles hockett american linguist anthropologist lived hockett graduated yale later taught cornell rice hockett made significant contributions structural linguistics well study native american chinese fijian languages work focused mainly detailed linguistic analysis particularly morphology phonology concepts tools facilitated language largely viewed socialbehavioral phenomenon hockett challenged belief noam chomsky argued language biologically based innate chomsky believed humans share universal grammar ties languages together hockett staunchly opposed chomskyan concept nature language however hockett famous defining called design features language demonstrated beliefs commonalities among human vocalauditory channel refers idea speakinghearing mode humans use language hockett first defined feature take sign language account reflects ideology orality prevalent feature since modified include channels language tactilevisual chemicalolfactory broadcast transmission directional reception humans speak sounds transmitted directions however listeners perceive direction sounds coming similarly signers broadcast potentially anyone within line sight watching see signing characteristic forms human animal communication transitoriness also called rapid fading transitoriness refers temporary quality language language sounds exist brief period time longer perceived sound waves quickly disappear speaker stops speaking also true signs contrast forms communication writing inka khipus knottying permanent interchangeability refers idea humans give receive identical linguistic signals humans limited types messages sayhear one say boy even one girl confused lying prevarication importance speaker physically create messages regardless truth relation speaker words anything one hear one also say species possess feature example order communicate status queen ants produce chemical scents ants produce see animal communication total feedback speakers language hear speech control modify saying say similarly signers see feel control signing specialization purpose linguistic signals communication biological function humans speak sign generally intentional example nonspecialized communication dog panting dog pants often communicates owner hot thirsty however dog pants order cool biological function communication secondary matter semanticity specific sound signals directly tied certain meanings arbitrariness languages generally made arbitrary iconic symbols spoken languages iconicity takes form onomatopoeia eg murmur english mƒÅo cat mandarin vast majority symbols intrinsic logical connection sound form signal refers almost names human language attributes object thus arbitrary word car nothing like actual car spoken words really nothing like objects represent demonstrated fact different languages attribute different names object signed languages transmitted visually allows certain degree iconicity cup updown etc asl example asl sign house hands flat touch way resembles roof walls however many signs iconic relationship form meaning arbitrary thus hockett account possibility nonarbitrary formmeaning relationships principle still generally applies discreteness linguistic representations broken small discrete units combine rulegoverned ways perceived categorically continuously example english marks number plural morpheme added end noun plural morpheme perceived categorically continuously express smaller larger quantities varying loudly pronounce displacement displacement refers idea humans talk things physically present even exist speakers talk past future express hopes dreams humans speech limited displacement one features separates human language forms primate communication productivity productivity refers idea languageusers create understand novel utterances humans able produce unlimited amount utterances also related productivity concept grammatical patterning facilitates use comprehension language language stagnant constantly changing new idioms created time meaning signals vary depending context situation traditional transmission also known cultural transmission traditional transmission idea humans born innate language capabilities language learned birth social setting differs critically chomskys idea universal grammar rather purports people learn speak interacting experienced language users significantly language culture woven together construct functioning hand hand language acquisition duality patterning meaningful messages made distinct smaller meaningful units words morphemes made distinct smaller meaningless units phonemes prevarication prevarication ability lie deceive using language humans make false meaningless statements important distinction made human communication ie language compared animal communication animal communication display design features proposed hockett animal communication unable lie make something exist referents reflexiveness humans use language talk language also defining feature human language reflexiveness trait shared animal communication reflexiveness humans describe language talk structure language discuss idea language others using language learnability language teachable learnable way speaker learns first language speaker able learn languages worth noting young children learn language competence ease however language acquisition constrained critical period becomes difficult children pass certain age hockett distinguished language communication almost animals communicate way communication system considered language possesses characteristics animal communication systems impressively sophisticated sense possess significant number design features proposed hockett ants make use chemicalolfactory channel communication ants produce chemicals called pheromones released body glands received tips antenna ants produce twenty different pheromone scents unique signal used communicate things location food danger even need defend relocate colony ant killed releases pheromone alerts others potential danger pheromones also help ants distinguish family members strangers queen ant special pheromones uses signal status orchestrate work let colony know need raise princesses ants even engage warfare protect colony food source warfare involves tactics resemble human warfare marauder ants capture hold enemy another ant crushes ants loyal colony death however queen kill order last one standing level planning among animal species requires intricate bird communication demonstrates many features vocalauditory channel broadcast transmissiondirectional reception rapid fading semanticity arbitrariness bird communication divided songs calls songs used primarily attract mates calls used alert conspecifics food danger coordinate movement flock calls acoustically simple songs longer bird communication discrete nondiscrete birds use syntax arrange songs musical notes act phonemes order notes important meaning song thus indicating discreteness exists bird communication also continuous sense utilizes duration frequency however fact birds phonemes necessarily mean infinitely combine birds limited number songs produce male indigo bunting one song brown thrasher sing birds even unique dialects depending two different bird species southern pied blabber japanese tit observed using duality patterning another feature thought used humans honeybee communication distinct forms animal communication rather vocalauditory bees use spacemovement channel communicate honeybees use dances round dance waggle dance transitional dance depending species round dance used communicate food hive waggle dance food hive transitional dance food distance waggle dance bee moves zigzag line loops back beginning line forming figureeight direction line points food speed dance indicates distance food way bee dancing also continuous rather discrete communication also arbitrary move direction pattern physically points food located honeybee dancing demonstrates displacement generally considered human characteristic animals give foodfound call physical presence food yet bees talk food away
