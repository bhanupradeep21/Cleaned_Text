vetusodon extinct genus cynodonts belonging clade epicynodontia contains one species vetusodon elikhulu known four specimens found late permian daptocephalus assemblage zone south africa skull length centimetres vetusodon largest known cynodont permian convergent evolution possessed several unusual features reminiscent contemporary therocephalian moschorhinus including broad robust jaws large incisors canines small singlecusped postcanine vetusodon known four specimens collected south africa rocks belonging daptocephalus assemblage zone holotype consists wellpreserved skull missing lower

bruce rubidge generic name derived latin word vetus meaning old greek word οδοντος odontos meaning tooth specific name elikhulu means large zulu language alludes animals vetusodon largest known permian cynodont based skull length around centimetres temporal region area behind eye sockets made around percent skull jaws quite robust snout unusually broad compared cynodonts time nostrils bony internarial process formed premaxillae nasal bones process somewhat forwardspointing giving tip snout pointed shape seen back portion nostrils formed small bones known septomaxillae bones bore thin extension intranarial process nearly divided nostril two halves small hole septomaxillary foramen septomaxilla met maxilla nasal bones made upper part snout extended backwards far rear end eye sockets met frontal bones sides snout largely formed maxillae maxilla bore two rows foramina holes diameter around millimetres lower jaw formed primarily dentary bones whereas postdentary bones reduced size extent otherwise seen cynodonts primitive result dentary stretched nearly far back jaw joint symphysis joint two halves lower jaw quite tall creating chinlike structure abdala et al interpreted symphysis fused study huttenlocker sidor reinterpreted back portion dentary projection called coronoid process extended high upper half eye sockets coronoid process fit quite closely postorbital bar bony structure divided eye socket temporal teeth conical singlerooted serrations vetusodon possessed four pairs upper incisors long recurved small gap diastema last incisor canine upper canines large round somewhat elongated crosssection behind canines set relatively small postcanine teeth upper postcanines varied number specimens ranging pairs holotype specimen unlike cynodonts postcanines multiple cusps postcanines vetusodon bore one cusp outer rims eye sockets orbits formed lacrimal bones front prefrontal postorbital bones top jugal bones back bottom eye sockets large gap skull known interorbital vacuity zygomatic arches cheek bones made outer edge temporal fenestrae formed jugal squamosal bones quite tall particularly towards back upper edge zygomatic arch rather thick whereas lower edge thinner like nonprobainognathian cynodonts vetusodon possessed hole known pineal foramen top skull temporal fenestrae running top orbits towards pineal foramen bordering temporal fenestrae two crests formed postorbital bones behind pineal foramen longitudinal ridge known sagittal crest unusually short vetusodon behind sagittal crest two occipital crests formed tabular squamosal bones stretched backwards diagonally joined rear ends zygomatic secondary palate structure making roof mouth cynodonts formed premaxillae maxillae palatine bones vetusodon two halves secondary palate joined together middle rendering vomer prominently visible depending phylogenetic position vetusodon incomplete secondary palate may either autapomorphy derived trait taxon plesiomorphy ancestral trait shared primitive vetusodon first described included phylogenetic analysis test relationships cynodonts found derived member clade epicynodontia closely related eucynodontia several triassic genera

pusch colleagues recovered vetusodon earlydiverging position within epicynodontia sister taxon permian genus cynosaurus placement correct incomplete secondary palate vetusodon may ancestral trait
