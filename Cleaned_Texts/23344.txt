rac also referred simply rac quaternary local anesthetic acts intracellular blockage nakatpase channel quaternary ammonium analogue another local anesthetic rac rac permanently charged cross hydrophobic phospholipid cell membrane diffuse across cell membrane exert inhibitory effects intracellular surface nakatpase exert anesthetic properties injected cytosol nerve fibre inhibition occurs allowing sodium potassium gradients across cell membrane dissipate nakatpase blockage preferentially inhibits firing nociceptive nerve fibres due relatively low cell diameter low tolerance nakatpase inhibitors contrast nonquaternary anesthetics like benzocaine tetracaine cross cell membrane uncharged states induce anesthetic effects upon application extracellular side membrane subsequently become charged activated within cytosol exert inhibitory effects nakatpase nakatpase inhibiting anesthetics must charged state become active
