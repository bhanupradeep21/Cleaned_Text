costly signaling theory evolutionary psychology refers uses costly signaling theory adaptationism explanations psychological traits states often informed closely related fields human behavioral ecology cultural evolution explanations predominantly focused humans emphasize benefits altering perceptions others need ways difficult fake due widespread existence adaptations demand reliable information avoid manipulation dishonest although initially created explain costly morphological traits honest signals individuals underlying quality resulting sexual scope costly signaling theory expanded include signals cooperative intent targets signals often going beyond potential almost organism benefit altering perceptions behavior physiology others environment ways favor particularly true social species result often investment signals enhance one perceived attractiveness formidability cooperative value members signal differs cue signals evolved influence behavior perceptions

favored natural selection due ubiquity conflicts interests among living things creating situations negative impacts others either relevant still worth benefits although substantial risks deceived targets signal may still benefit paying attention information long honest relevant fitnessrelated reason natural selection thought resulted adaptations many species verify validity signals accepting information signaling costly manner thought satisfy antimanipulation adaptations resultant signals comparatively cheaper produce underlying quality compared lack instances individuals quality maximize fitness investing signal relative lack quality possess lesser degree thereby resulting signal often impossible fake tends worth majority costly signaling explanations involve behaviors broadcast beneficial traits oneself many instances signals expected directed towards potential mates males often thought benefit signaling due relatively low levels investment offspring leading greater fitness benefits multiple however importance cooperation human evolutionary history also thought resulted many signals involve showing one potential cooperative partner outside primarily work human behavioral ecologists hunting among humans received much attention potentially serving honest indicator various qualities due potential differential first signaling approaches hunting emphasized although hunting provide important source calories nutrients smallscale societies still practiced less efficient means food production often involves targeting species result less meat given response findings food typically shared widely smallscale societies showoff hypothesis suggests men may hunt difficult prey part due reputational benefits increase likelihood others want good hunters group benefits later models built incorporating costly signaling addition costs inefficiency reported hunts hunting costly terms time needed develop one skill risks involved resources required successful reason proposed honestly signal wide range traits including strength skill ability buffer risk leadership various beneficial cognitive traits increase one attractiveness mates cooperative costly signals due hunting relatively costly lack previously mentioned qualities possess lesser degree individuals likely produce less effective signals become injured deter faking although mutually exclusive showoff hypothesis approaches presented explaining wider range hunting behaviors benefits come signaling one qualities require hunting benefits others thereby better accounting relatively wasteful however models still emphasize benefits providing others meat sharing often public attracts large audiences thereby increasing effectiveness signal increase one status within evidence favor hunting costly signal beneficial qualities primarily come valuation group members benefits good hunters enjoy smallscale societies individuals often tell good hunter bad skilled hunters reported higher status less material benefits also seen good hunters shown increased reproductive success political power support one kin times illness compared existence reputational benefits hunting importance explaining human hunting relative explanations involving kin selection reciprocity controversial primarily seen disagreement amount provisioning happens within family general ability hunters control receives meat bring often invoked costly signaling approaches hunting risktaking suggested result honest signals quality risk increases costs come results greater costs qualities allow greater chances success ability buffer failure relative possess qualities reason risky behaviors may often honest signals individuals lack relevant traits expected avoid risk suffer much damage failures maintain risky many beneficial qualities suggested underlie risktaking behavior example physical skill good judgment bravery argued increase chances success risky similarly social dominance confidence ambition may also help competition among conspecifics social dominance ambition wealth also potentially limiting costs general targets risky signals often thought potential primarily due finding young males age sex class highest reproductive variance take risks group experiments observational undertaking risky endeavors males thought signal previously mentioned qualities may directly related one ability provision protect one however traits like bravery physical prowess may also valued cooperative partners due benefits grouphunting warfare thereby increasing potential audience risk physically attractive traits also hypothesized signals mate quality facial characteristics body type voice characteristics body modification suggested provide information relevant however approaches focus information relevant receiver rather whether information takes form signals two possibilities often hard distinguish although exceptions exist costly signaling theory mainly incorporated explanations attractive male

young adults lengthy courtships also proposed honestly signal ones overall quality particularly nonhuman although often accompanied signals courtship duration create substantial opportunity costs males court females time invest fitness enhancing activities reason may honest signal overall quality due expectation lowquality males suffer opportunity costs per unit time courtship high quality males thereby favoring low quality males drop courtship sooner humans willingness engage lengthy courtships also suggested signal desire longterm relationship opposed casual sex evidence persistent courtship styles attractive females seeking longterm relationships seeking shorterterm addition potentially signaling need means manipulate parents crying human infants suggested serve costly signal meant decrease child risk infanticide something seen across due fact conflicts interests exist offspring parents siblings parents expected sensitive quality offspring determining much investment parental investment one offspring go another potential exists investment new child reduce individual happen offspring unlikely survive thereby favoring investment additionally investment may still

provisioning care offspring signal ones high quality may often enough result beneficial treatment others even instead individuals also expected pay attention likelihood receive benefits cooperating another makes signaling ones willingness provide benefits others important part establishing cooperative relationships something seen observational experimental studies found individuals tend prefer generous less give cooperative partners ability provide benefits often costly signaling often used attempts explain instances public generosity individuals incur costs without immediate although often thought signal ones ability provide benefits behaviors also considered honest signals one willingness cooperate due costs involved food sharing often reported common occurrence many smallscale societies particularly hunted nonsignaling explanations focused either benefits establishing reciprocal relationships others buffer risk limited benefits maintaining control food due either effort

irrelevant blood donations due lack control receives blood signaling explanations allow benefits come one ability alter perceptions others ways benefit proposed involve increased perceptions generosity willingness take risks addition providing reliable information one health due individuals certain health conditions diseases allowed donate blood costly signaling may also involved many forms indirect indirect reciprocity occurs one seemingly altruistic acts increase ones reputation cooperation making others likely help regardless target based game theoretic models evolve absence signaling fixed however species flexibility alter level cooperation response state relevant social variables past behaviors others may enough reliably signal cooperative intent without inclusion means ensure honesty case species ability determine likelihood others cooperate signal cooperative intent costly signaling may important mechanism behind indirect humans proposed take form individuals identifying potential targets signals maintenance welfaretradeoff ratios employing costly signals increase one perceived value cooperator attractive targets cooperation costly signals also suggested important demonstrating commitment initiate maintain dyadic relationships gift giving particular receiving substantial attention individual strategy approaches emphasize risk defection potential friends romantic partners particularly high start relationships due amount private information individuals intentions gifts thought help costs involved large enough worth providing someone value potential longterm costs gift thought result reliable signal almost form gift could signal future cooperative intent however gifts increase receiver fitness prospects may favored result material

acquire resources may also demonstrated larger gifts additionally individuals may also demonstrate one thoughtfulness attentiveness partner matching gift preferences something proposed difficult assuming individuals population behave similarly gift giving may also reduce benefits defection making costly start new something may particularly likely gift giving largely dictated customs inherently costly without intent future costly signaling approaches ritual often emphasize ability ritual behavior honestly signal commitment one group due costs involved resulting signals difficult religious rituals received attention potential costly signals like forms ritual costs involved come time energy material goods physical harm required one fit ritual extreme forms selfharm although costs ritual likely equal among believers nonbelievers skeptics suggested perceive rituals costly due believing power ritual achieve believers expect difference perception makes less likely individual find belief worth faking costlier practices expected provide greater indications one commitment additionally commonality religious rituals often complex means mistakes may easy spot throughout ritual decreasing likelihood someone faking evidence consistent costly signaling explanations religious ritual comes experimental observational studies however examinations exist example members religious kibbutzes shown cooperative compared secular kibbutzes commonpool resource similarly engaging communal religious rituals shown larger cooperative networks studies attempted directly link costs signals effectiveness cooperation one finding number costly requirements commune associated longer commune another finding participation observation costly ritual associated larger donations compared involved less costly addition attempts creating cooperative relationships costly signaling model apology suggests costly signals may also used way restore cooperation since costs honest dishonest verbal apologies identical individual apologizing costs continued victimization may severe target apology unlikely verbal apologies alone often enough convey contrition reason costs may adaptive part apology increasing effectiveness apology apologizer likely remain cooperative venture apology effective model require costs tied harm caused instead signal needs costly enough outweigh benefits defector could gain onetime interaction thereby creating situation interested future cooperation gain net benefits signal honesty established costs apologies consistent model take many forms financial loss selfharm reduction one status documented associated apologies individuals religious apologies may also include gifts benefits however benefits predicted increase honesty instead may simply one way signaler incur costs addition less costly forms nonlethal suicide attempts also suggested serve honest apologies unlike forms costs costs suicide attempt primarily come probability one death riskier attempts seen according costly apology model suicide substantial costs may required honestly signal contrition potential payoff future defection large enough still allow deceivers gain net benefits less costly signals something may occur highly valuable cooperative relationships threat suicide attempts may also increase spread information signal due noteworthy nature something may particularly important transgression made group puts cooperative relationships outside aggrieved risk evidence costly signaling model apology mainly come experiments example multiple vignette studies found costly apologies increase perception sincerity target signal across different countries religions costs gift giving selfpunishment similarly participants study imagine accidental transgression past likely report willingness engage costly apology individual likely important however costly selfpunishment common study forced participants accidentally treat anonymous partner unfairly something consistent idea apologies may also serve maintain one reputation larger infantdirected song suggested costly signal parental attentiveness something thought particularly important infants young walk correctly avoid dangers although parents experience fitness benefits providing attention infants infants gain fitness benefits parents spending time tasks optimal amount resources devoted expected example parentoffspring conflict infants benefiting attention ideal parent due conflict interest infants expected sensitive information relating parental attention come equipped adaptations help elicit

according hypothesis potential costs infantdirected song come multiple nonexclusive forms example singing may require investment planning memory also potentially requiring parent attend infant emotional state alter song match may also prevent one physically demanding activities instances require specific breathing patterns whatever form costs take benefit parent suggested quicker reliable satiation infant demands would allow greater investment wealth influences one access resources directly increasing status possess demonstrations wealth hypothesized substantial benefits often take form costly although wealth alone may worth signaling signals often suggested display information qualities relating one ability acquire defend resources may also signal generosity involves charitable component however benefit often considered one potential means signaling wealth conspicuous consumption conspicuous consumption refers instances individuals purchase luxury goods provide little utility less costly thereby prioritizing selfpresentation economic common across humans regardless class often involves strategic planning maximize audience display strength signaling explanations conspicuous consumption predict targets signal predominately potential signals relating sexual selection males typically expected invest signals due potential greater benefits additional instances information signaled thought go beyond genetic quality signal potential investment attractive seeking longterm shortterm mating although often focused males females also suggested benefit conspicuous consumption mating contexts due hypothesized ability demonstrate commitment one signal one mate quality may help intrasexual competition deter mate poaching despite focus sexual selection conspicuous consumption may also useful problems outside acquiring mates involve attempts attracting cooperative partners stand gain signalers ability confer benefits form mating contexts may also benefits intimidating rivals thereby decreasing likelihood direct competition resources evidence consistent conspicuous consumption costly signal wealth status comes primarily findings females find males expensive items desirable mainly seen experiments manipulated costs items associated males cars clothing typical higher classes found associated increased probabilities females entering various types romantic sexual relationships greater perceptions attractiveness across multiple outside benefits much less research whether conspicuous consumption meets requirements signal possible mismatch exists hypothesized adaptations status signaling modern environments include marketing campaigns might exploit however commonality across cultures class boundaries used argue humans may well suited balancing costs benefits extravagant charitable donations also suggested honestly signal ones wealth due large donations impossible costlier make fewer conspicuous consumption signals also often expected provide information ones underlying quality addition wealth particularly relating ones ability acquire maintain possession due qualities signaled public nature public philanthropy suggested mainly serve attract new reason existing cooperators may view signals threats ongoing relationships put weight private signals evaluate cooperative intent signaler consistent reasoning public displays generosity may often decrease ones perceptions cooperativeness trustworthiness appear strategies meant gain recognition addition signaling qualities meant increase one attractiveness potential mates cooperative partners costly signals also suggested result honest displays need primarily aimed existing cooperators would motivated help given genuine need part signaler signals hypothesized reduce
