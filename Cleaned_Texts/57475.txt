attitudes associated beliefs behaviors towards stable communication behavior people subject change social influences well individuals motivation maintain cognitive consistency cognitive dissonance two attitudes attitude behavior conflict attitudes attitude objects functions affective cognitive components suggested interstructural composition associative network altered activation single node thus activating affective emotional node attitude change may possible though affective cognitive components tend three bases attitude change compliance identification internalization three processes represent different levels attitude compliance refers change behavior based consequences individuals hopes gain rewards avoid punishment another group person individual necessarily experience changes beliefs evaluations attitude object rather influenced social outcomes adopting change individual also often aware urged respond certain way compliance demonstrated series laboratory experiments known asch experiments experiments led solomon asch swarthmore college asked groups students participate vision test reality one participants confederates experimenter study really remaining student would react confederates behavior participants asked pick three line options line length sample asked give answer loud unbeknown participants asch placed number confederates deliberately give wrong answer participant results showed responses line majority influence answers confederates variations experiments showed compliance rates increased number confederates increased plateau reached around confederates likelihood compliance dropped minority opposition even one confederate gave correct answer basis compliance founded fundamental idea people want accurate identification explains ones change beliefs affect order similar someone one admires likes case individual adopts new attitude due specific content attitude object associated desired relationship often childrens attitudes race political party affiliations adopted parents attitudes internalization refers change beliefs affect one finds content attitude intrinsically rewarding thus leads actual change beliefs evaluations attitude object new attitude behavior consistent individuals value system tends merged individuals existing values beliefs therefore behaviors adopted internalization due content attitude expectancyvalue theory based internalization attitude change model states behavior towards object function individuals intent function ones overall attitude towards action emotion plays major role persuasion social influence attitude change much attitude research emphasised importance affective emotion emotion works handinhand cognitive process way think issue situation emotional appeals commonly found advertising health campaigns political messages recent examples include nosmoking health campaigns see tobacco advertising political campaigns emphasizing fear terrorism attitude change based emotions seen vividly serial killers faced major considerable empirical support idea emotions form fear positive enhance attitude change certain important factors influence impact emotional appeals include selfefficacy attitude accessibility issue involvement messagesource features attitudes central ones highly resistant change others less fixed may change new experiences information new attitude eg timekeeping absenteeism quality may challenge existing beliefs norms creating feeling psychological discomfort known cognitive dissonance difficult measure attitude change since attitudes may inferred might significant divergence publicly declared privately held selfefficacy perception ones human agency words perception ability deal important variable emotional appeal messages dictates persons ability deal emotion situation example person selfefficacious ability impact global environment likely change attitude behaviour global warming affective forecasting otherwise known intuition prediction emotion also impacts attitude change research suggests predicting emotions important component decision making addition cognitive feel outcome may override purely cognitive rationales terms research methodology challenge researchers measuring emotion subsequent impacts attitude since see brain various models measurement tools constructed obtain emotion attitude information measures may include use physiological cues like facial expressions vocal changes body rate instance fear associated raised eyebrows increased heart rate increased body methods include concept network mapping using primes word many dual process models used explain affective emotional cognitive processing interpretations messages well different depths attitude change include heuristicsystematic model information processing elaboration likelihood model heuristicsystematic model information processing describes two depths processing attitude change systematic processing heuristic processing information either processed highinvolvement higheffort systematic way information processed shortcuts known heuristics example emotions affectbased heuristics feelings gutfeeling reactions often used

individuals receive message systematic processing usually internalize message resulting longer stable attitude change according heuristicsystematic model information processing people motivated use systematic processing want achieve desired level confidence factors found increase use systematic processing factors associated either decreasing individuals actual confidence increasing individuals perceived confidence factors may include framing persuasive messages unexpected selfrelevancy message systematic processing shown beneficial social influence settings systematic reasoning shown successful producing valid solutions group discussions greater solution accuracy shestowskys research dyad discussions revealed individual dyad high motivation high need cognition greater impact group heuristic processing occurs individuals low motivation andor low cognitive ability process instead focusing argument message recipients using heuristic processing focus readily accessible information unrelated cues authority attractiveness speaker individuals process message heuristic processing internalize message thus attitude change resulting persuasive message temporary unstable example people likely grant favors reasons provided study shows people said excuse five pages xerox may use copier received positive response statement excuse five pages xerox rush may use copier produced success heuristic processing examples include social proof reciprocity authority liking elaboration likelihood model similar concept shares many ideas dual processing models heuristicsystematic model information elaboration likelihood model cognitive processing central route affectiveemotion processing often associated peripheral central route pertains elaborate cognitive processing information peripheral route relies cues feelings elm suggests true attitude change happens central processing route incorporates cognitive affective components opposed heuristicsbased peripheral route suggests motivation emotion alone result attitude change cognitive dissonance theory originally developed festinger idea people experience sense guilt uneasiness two linked cognitions inconsistent two conflicting attitudes topic inconsistencies ones attitude behavior certain topic basic idea cognitive dissonance theory relating attitude change people motivated reduce dissonance achieved changing attitudes cooper fazios also added cognitive dissonance arise simple cognitive inconsistency rather results freely chosen behavior may bring negative negative consequences may threats consistency stability predictability competence moral goodness violation general research suggested multiple routes cognitive dissonance reduced selfaffirmation shown reduce however always mode choice trying reduce dissonance multiple routes available found people prefer reduce dissonance directly altering attitudes behaviors rather people high levels selfesteem postulated possess abilities reduce dissonance focusing positive aspects self also found prefer modifying cognitions attitudes beliefs simple example cognitive dissonance resulting attitude change would heavy smoker learns sister died young lung cancer due heavy smoking well individual experiences conflicting cognitions desire smoke knowledge smoking could lead death desire die order reduce dissonance smoker could change behavior ie stop smoking change attitude smoking ie smoking harmful retain original attitude smoking modify new cognition consistent first onei also work smoking wont harmful thus attitude change achieved individuals experience feelings uneasiness guilt due cognitive dissonance actively reduce dissonance changing attitude beliefs behavior relating order achieve consistency inconsistent cognitions carl hovland band persuasion researchers learned great deal world war later yale process attitude process people change attitudes studied years belief rationalization recognized important aspect understand stability peoples past attitudes influenced hold beliefs inconsistent behaviors influence past behavior current attitudes stable little information conflicts behavior alternatively peoples attitudes may lean radically toward prior behavior conflict makes difficult ignore forces rationalize past attitudes often restructured time people asked report result inconsistencies information enters reconstruction original attitudes produce changes prior attitudes whereas consistency elements often elicits stability prior attitudes individuals need resolve conflict behaviors subsequent beliefs however people usually align attitudes beliefs instead behaviors importantly process resolving peoples cognitive conflicts emerges cuts across selfperception dissonance even associated effect may strong changing prior attitudes human judgment comparative departing identifying peoples need justify beliefs context behaviors psychologists also believe people need carefully evaluate new messages basis whether messages support contradict prior messages regardless whether recall prior messages reach comparative processing mechanism built informationintegration social judgement theories served model peoples attitude change judging new information adequately explained influential factors motivate people integrate information recent work area persuasion explored comparative processing perspective focusing comparing different sets information one single issue object instead simply making comparisons among different issues previous research demonstrated analyzing information one target product may trigger less impact comparative information comparing product product competing people compare different sets information one single issue object effect peoples effort compare new information prior information seemed correlate perceived strength new strong information considered jointly initial information comparison processes enhanced prior evaluations associated information accessible people simply construct current judgment based new information adjust prior judgment able retrieve information prior messages impact comparative process peoples attitude change mediated changes strength new information perceived receivers effects comparison judgment change mediated changes perceived strength information findings wide range applications social marketing political
