dentin ˈdɛntɪn american english dentine ˈdɛnˌtiːn ˌdɛnˈtiːn british english latin substantia eburnea calcified tissue body along enamel cementum pulp one four major components teeth usually covered enamel crown cementum root surrounds entire pulp volume dentin consists mineral hydroxyapatite organic material yellow appearance greatly affects color tooth due translucency enamel dentin less mineralized less brittle enamel necessary support dentin rates approximately mohs scale mineral two main characteristics distinguish dentin enamel firstly dentin forms throughout life secondly dentin become hypersensitive changes temperature due sensory function especially enamel recedes dentin channels become exposed prior enamel formation dentine formation begins process known dentinogenesis process continues throughout persons life even tooth fully developed events tooth decay tooth wear also initiate dentine dentinogenesis initiated odontoblasts pulp odontoblasts specialised cells lay organic matrix known predentine predentine subsequently mineralised dentine mineralisation predentine begins dentinoenamel junction tooth development progresses towards pulp growth predentine maturation dentine cell bodies odontoblasts remain pulp along outer wall project tiny tubules dentine predentine composed type collagen noncollagenous proteins including phosphoproteins proteoglycans growth factors phosphatases alkaline phosphatase matrix metalloproteinases mmps composition significantly altered mineralised see structure section information composition dentine unlike enamel dentin may demineralized stained histological study dentin consists microscopic channels called dentinal tubules radiate outward dentin pulp exterior cementum enamel dentinal tubules extend dentinoenamel junction dej crown area dentinocemental junction dcj root area outer wall outer surface dentin area nearest pulp tubules follow sshaped path diameter density tubules greatest near tapering inner outermost surface diameter μm near pulp μm middle dentin μm dentinoenamel junction density per square millimeter near pulp whereas density half much near enamel within tubules odontoblast process extension odontoblast dentinal fluid contains mixture albumin transferrin tenascin addition branching canalicular systems connect branches categorized size major nm diameter fine nm micro less major branches terminal ends tubules every μm fine branches diverging dentinal tubules degree angles microtubules diverge degree angles dentinal tubules contain cytoplasmic extensions odontoblasts formed dentin maintain cell bodies odontoblasts aligned along inner aspect dentin layer predentin also form peripheral boundary dental dentinal tubules dentin degree permeability increase sensation pain rate tooth decay strongest held theory dentinal hypersensitivity suggests due changes dentinal fluid associated processes type hydrodynamic dentin bonelike matrix porous yellowhued material made weight inorganic materials mainly hydroxylapatite noncrystalline amorphous calcium phosphate organic materials collagen type remaining ground substance includes dentinspecific proteins water adsorbed surface minerals softer enamel decays rapidly subject severe cavities properly treated due elastic properties good support enamel flexibility prevents brittle enamel fracturing areas primary secondary mineralization occurred complete crystalline fusion appear lighter rounded areas stained section dentin considered globular dentin contrast darker arclike areas stained section dentin considered interglobular dentin areas primary mineralization occurred within predentin globules dentin fuse completely thus interglobular dentin slightly less mineralized globular dentin interglobular dentin especially evident coronal dentin near dentinoenamel junction dej certain dental anomalies dentinogenesis different regions dentin recognized due structural differences outermost layer known mantle

pulp leaving behind microtubules filled cytoplasmic extensions depositing intertubular dentin itd itd comprises bulk dentin similarly bone matrix composite tabletshaped hydroxyapatite nanoparticles wrapped around collagen fibers mineralized collagen fibers arranged layers oriented perpendicular direction dentin lined peritubular dentin ptd μm thick layer hydroxyapatite tablets preferred orientation lacks supporting collagen hydroxyapatite tablets within itd found compressed along crystallographic caxis due tight interaction tablets collagen fiber tablets aligned parallel collagen fibers experience significant increase compressive stress around mpa crack formation occur tensile stresses must first overcome residual compressive stress since typical mastication stresses exceed itd prevents cracks forming normal daily use help deflect cracks perpendicular dentin tubule away inelastic deformation dentin primarily happens microcracking crack propagation within dentin travels preferentially along interfaces itd layers since ptd hydroxyapatite tablets preferentially orientated less compressive residual stress causing microtubules act crack initiation sites manifests crosshatched shear microcracks forming microtubules compression ringshaped microcracks tension tip larger crack creates stress concentration help initiate microcracks around microtubules ahead consuming energy resisting damage imperfect linking microcrack larger crack also induce uncracked ligaments help arrest larger comparison enamel display fracture resistance fractures traveling across dej usually stopped within combination residual stress perpendicular orientation itd mineralized collagen fibers significantly increase fracture toughness fatigue endurance limit along microtubule dentin classified three types primary secondary secondary dentin layer dentin formed tooths root fully formed tertiary dentin develops result stimulus carious attack primary dentin prominent dentin

dentin adventitious dentin formed root formation complete normally tooth erupted functional grows much slowly primary dentin maintains incremental aspect growth similar structure primary dentin although deposition always even around pulp chamber appears greater amounts roof floor coronal pulp chamber protects pulp exposure older teeth secondary dentin formed response external stimuli appears much similar primary dentine growth dentin causes decrease size pulp chamber age clinically known pulp recession cavity preparation young patients therefore carries greater risk exposing pulp occurs pulp treated different therapies direct pulp capping previously thought pulp capping successful followed stainless steel crown however procedure times unnecessary children requires unnecessary removal enamel key life tooth adhesive dentistry allows conservative restoration techniques minimize loss tooth structure used order maintain space primary dentition attempts made extract pulpal exposure
