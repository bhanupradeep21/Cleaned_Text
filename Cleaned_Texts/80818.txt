thyrotoxic myopathy tm neuromuscular disorder develops due overproduction thyroid hormone thyroxine also known hyperthyroid myopathy tm one many myopathies lead muscle weakness muscle tissue breakdown evidence indicates onset may caused two known causes hyperthyroidism lead development thyrotoxic myopathy including multinodular goiter graves disease physical symptoms tm may include muscle weakness breakdown muscle tissue fatigue heat physical acts lifting objects climbing stairs may become increasingly untreated tm extremely debilitating disorder extreme rare cases lead death diagnosed treated properly effects controlled cases reversed leaving lasting effects physical symptoms may includecitation needed symptoms chronic tm arise slowly patients usually cite decreased exercise tolerance increased fatigue difficulty completing certain tasks six months chronic tm goes untreated worse symptoms may develop including difficulty swallowing respiratory distress occurrences rare since diagnosis chronic tm usually occurs early stages onset symptoms developcitation needed acute tm rarer chronic tm symptoms appear within days onset acute tm degrades muscle fibers rapidly due rapid degradation muscle fibers patients usually cite severe muscle cramps muscle pain acute tm patients may present symptoms blurred vision bulging eyes due eye muscle degradation inflammation documented cases rare acute tm patients usually weak respiratory muscles often severe respiratory failure tm directly related thyroxine toxicity believed disorder direct result hyperthyroidism specifically hyperthyroidism caused graves disease multinodular goiter cause thyroid gland overproduce thyroxine multinodular goiter condition thyroid develops nodules overproduction thyroxine due enlargement thyroid gland graves disease autoimmune condition immune system chronically stimulates tsh receptor thyroid induces overproduction thyroxine hormonecitation needed excess thyroxine believed bring onset thyrotoxic myopathy eventually cause degradation muscle tissue thyroxine hormone produced thyroid gland regulates growth metabolism nervous system regulates basal metabolic rate many cell types scientists agree thyroxine brings degradation muscle fibers specifically motor end plates neuromuscular junctions debate whether thyroxine degrades motor end plates muscular side nervous system side understand high levels thyroxine toxic lead thyrotoxic myopathy physiologically consider basic neuromuscular junction function normal circumstances muscle contraction occurs electrical impulses travel descending axons brain spinal cord towards neuromuscular junction axon terminal depolarizes releases acetylcholine ach neurotransmitter turn stimulates motor end plate mep muscle fiber nerve innervating mep depolarizes muscle fiber releases calcium initiating process muscle contractioncitation needed onset tm due thyroxine toxicity evidence suggest structural changes meps could lead muscle fiber degradation weakness fatigue research indicates decreased levels acetylcholinesterase ache enzyme breaks ach observed within neuromuscular decrease ache blocks degradation ach causing ach increasingly stimulate mep muscle fiber stimulation mep could cause muscle contractions eventually evoke muscle fiber fatigue weakness finally degradation characteristic symptoms believed decrease ache mep structural changes could result stimulation thyroxin blocking axoplasmic flow trophic factors axon especially considering thyroxines role nervous system growth metabolism regulation research indicates muscle fiber fatigue weakness degradation associated tm direct action thyroxine muscle fibers research suggests thyroxine directly causes decrease protein kinase affinity camp within muscle fibers causes increase camp within muscle fibers since protein kinases inactivating camp increased levels camp within muscle fibers cause increased release muscle fibers sarcoplasmic reticulum eventually leads muscle contractions like nervous system proposal increased muscle contractions eventually evoke muscle fiber fatigue weakness finally degradation characteristic symptoms tm evidence support theories suggested toxic levels thyroxine may ultimately attack muscle fibers directly indirectly motor neurons innervate affected muscle fiberscitation needed thyrotoxic myopathy usually diagnosed neurologist extensive experience diagnosing neuromuscular disorders many types neuromuscular disorders present similar physical symptoms extensive clinical tests performed first determine neuromuscular disorder determine disorder electromyography used diagnose myopathies comparing muscle contraction responses electrical tm results may indicate normal responses myopathic responses depending disorder progressed early detection may indicate normal contractual responses highly progressed tm may show significant decrease contraction responsecitation needed blood tests conducted determine specific myopathy tm blood tests reveal increased thyroxine levels increased thyroxine levels accompanied decreased neuromuscular responses together provide best evidence tm diagnosis creatine phosphokinase levels also examined blood tests normal increased levels may observed tm depending severity tms progression normal levels indicate possible early stages progression increased levels may indicate later stages thyrotoxic myopathy muscle biopsies may also taken examined determine tms progression respect physical degradation like measured creatine phosphokinase levels results muscle biopsy characteristic tm typically show normal severe fiber degradation respective indications severity progressioncitation needed treatment tm typically done collaboration many medical specialists usually neuromuscular specialist endocrinologist surgeon ophthalmologist combine efforts successfully treat patients tm patient develops significant severe muscle degradation result tm physical therapist may consulted rehabilitation since excess thyroxine leads onset tm overall goal treatment reduce overproduction thyroxine thyroid gland restore normal thyroid homeostasis accomplished three ways including using medication radiation surgerycitation needed first choice involves using medications alleviate symptoms reverse damage blocking production thyroxine thyroid gland betablockers used alleviate symptoms associated tm betablockers reduce damage done excess thyroxine medications propylthiouracil methimazole administered block release thyroxine thyroid block damage thyroxine inflicts muscle fiber tissuecitation needed one treatment option use radioactive iodine directly destroys overactive thyroid gland thyroid gland naturally uses iodine produce thyroxine hormones distinguish normal iodine radioactive version administering radioactive isotope causes thyroid take lethal iodine quickly radiation destroys typically overproduction thyroxine using radioiodine blocked one dose drawback treatment thyroid gland completely destroyed patients often develop hypothyroidism months treatment others may affected years hypothyroidism patients must begin lifelong regimen thyroid replacement hormones onset hypothyroidism common radioiodine treatment condition observed patients treated medication series surgerycitation needed last option tm treatment includes surgical removal portions thyroid also performed restore thyroid homeostasis treatment option usually done overproduction tm caused multinodular goiters since goiters enlarge thyroid cause patient become physically disfigured surgical treatment alleviate aesthetic physiological effects simultaneouslycitation needed tm proper diagnosis effective treatment beaten patients diagnosed normal life expectancy ultimately lead healthy lives proper treatment administered typically overproduction thyroxine corrected thyroid function adequately reaches level homeostasis patients begin regain muscle strength two four months depending severity tm progression symptoms may take year completely reverse damage done tm untreated tm eventually cause severe respiratory distress arrest possible leading death yet rarely seencitation needed onset tm requires toxic levels thyroxine hormone due overproduction thyroid gland documented cases diagnosed conjunction patients hyperthyroidism hyperthyroidism common women development tm common among men hyperthyroidism case studies patients diagnosed hyperthyroidism showed half complained symptoms characteristic examination described indicated studied patients showed signs muscle fiber indicates either time study patients early stages tm symptoms insignificant patientscitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikithyrotoxicmyopathy
