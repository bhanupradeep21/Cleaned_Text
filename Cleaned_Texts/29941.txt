phaeton alternatively phaethon ˈfeɪəθən phaëton ˈfeɪətən ancient greek φαέθων romanized phaéthōn pronounced pʰaétʰɔːn hypothetical planet hypothesized law existed orbits mars jupiter destruction supposedly led formation asteroid belt including dwarf planet ceres hypothetical planet named phaethon son sun god helios greek mythology attempted drive fathers solar chariot day disastrous results ultimately destroyed according hypothesized law proposed explain spacing planets solar system planet may existed mars jupiter learning regular sequence discovered german astronomer mathematician johann daniel titius astronomer johann e bode urged search fifth planet corresponding gap sequence ceres largest asteroid asteroid belt considered dwarf planet serendipitously discovered italian giuseppe piazzi found closely match empty position titius sequence led manywho believe missing planet however astronomer heinrich wilhelm matthäus olbers discovered named asteroid pallas second object roughly orbit ceres olbers proposed two discoveries fragments disrupted planet formerly orbited sun predicted pieces would found discovery asteroid juno karl ludwig harding vesta olbers buttressed hypothesis german linguist retired teacher johann gottlieb radlof de called olbers destroyed planet phaëthon linking greek myths legends phaethon franz xaver kugler wrote short book titled sibyllinischer sternkampf und phaëthon naturgeschichtlicher beleuchtung sybilline battle stars phaeton seen natural central idea kuglers book myth phaethon based real event making use ancient sources kugler argued phaeton bright celestial object appeared around bc fell earth long afterwards shower large meteorites causing catastrophic fires floods africa elsewherecitation needed hypotheses regarding formation asteroid belt destruction hypothetical fifth planet today collectively referred disruption theory hypotheses state major planetary member solar system circulating present gap mars jupiter destroyed one following hypothetical processescitation needed soviet russian astronomer ivan putilin suggested phaeton destroyed due centrifugal forces giving diameter approximately kilometers slightly larger mars diameter km rotational speed hours eventually planet became distorted parts near equator spun space outgassing gases stored phaetons interior caused multiple explosions sending material space forming asteroid families however theory widely accepted two years later odesan astronomer konstantin n savchenko suggested ceres pallas juno vesta fragments phaeton rather former moons phaeton additional fifth satellite assumed size ceres orbiting near planets hill sphere thus subject gravitational perturbations jupiter result fifth satellite became tidally detached orbited sun millions years afterward making periodic close misses phaeton slowly increased velocity escaped satellite reentered phaetons hill sphere collided planet high speed shattering ceres pallas juno vesta assumed heliocentric orbits simulations showed ceressized body shatter phaeton would need travelling nearly kilometers per disrupted planet hypothesis also supported mathematician astronomer

astronomer michael ovenden american astronomer donald menzel ovenden suggested planet named krypton destroyed native world superman well believing gas giant roughly eightyfive ninety earth masses mass nearly size today phaeton hypothesis superseded accretion astronomers today believe asteroids main belt remnants protoplanetary disk never formed planet region amalgamation protoplanets planet prevented disruptive gravitational perturbations jupiter formative period solar systemcitation needed scientists nonscientists continue advocate existence destruction phaetonlike planet zecharia sitchin suggested goddess known sumerians tiamat fact relates planet destroyed rogue planet known nibiru creating earth asteroid work widely regarded astronomer author tom van flandern held phaeton
