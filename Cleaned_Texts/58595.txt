aromatase inhibitors ais class drugs used treatment breast cancer postmenopausal women gynecomastia men may also used offlabel reduce estrogen conversion supplementing testosterone exogenously may also used chemoprevention women high risk breast cancer aromatase enzyme catalyzes key aromatization step synthesis estrogen converts enone ring androgen precursors testosterone phenol completing synthesis estrogen ais estrogen synthesis inhibitors hormonepositive breast ovarian cancers dependent estrogen growth ais taken either block production estrogen block action estrogen receptors contrast premenopausal women estrogen produced ovaries postmenopausal women estrogen mainly produced peripheral tissues body breast cancers respond estrogen lowering estrogen production site cancer ie adipose tissue breast aromatase inhibitors proven effective treatment hormonesensitive breast cancer postmenopausal aromatase inhibitors generally used treat breast cancer premenopausal women prior menopause decrease estrogen activates hypothalamus pituitary axis increase gonadotropin secretion turn stimulates ovary increase androgen production heightened gonadotropin levels also upregulate aromatase promoter increasing aromatase production setting increased androgen substrate would counteract effect aromatase inhibitor premenopausal women total estrogen would increase ongoing areas clinical research include optimizing adjuvant hormonal therapy postmenopausal women breast cancer tamoxifen serm traditionally drug treatment choice atac trial arimidex tamoxifen alone combination showed women localized estrogen receptorpositive breast cancer women receiving ai anastrozole better results tamoxifen trials ais used adjuvant therapy given prevent relapse surgery breast cancer show associated better diseasefree survival tamoxifen conventionallyanalyzed clinicals trials shown ais overall survival advantage compared tamoxifen good evidence better aromatase inhibitors approved treatment gynecomastia children ovarian stimulation aromatase inhibitor letrozole proposed ovulation induction order treat unexplained female infertility multicenter study funded national institute child health development ovarian stimulation letrozole resulted significantly lower frequency multiple gestation ie twins triplets also lower frequency live birth compared gonadotropin women side effects include increased risk developing osteoporosis joint disorders arthritis arthrosis joint pain men appear exhibit adverse effects bone bisphosphonates sometimes prescribed prevent osteoporosis induced aromatase inhibitors also another serious side effect osteonecrosis jaw statins bone strengthening effect combining statin aromatase inhibitor could help prevent fractures suspected cardiovascular risks without potential causing osteonecrosis common adverse events associated use aromatase inhibitors include decreased rate bone maturation growth infertility aggressive behavior adrenal insufficiency kidney failure hair liver dysfunction patients liver kidney adrenal abnormalities higher risk developing adverse aromatase inhibitors work inhibiting action enzyme aromatase

aromatase inhibitors shown reverse agerelated declines testosterone including primary extracts certain mushrooms shown inhibit aromatase evaluated enzyme assays white mushroom shown greatest ability
