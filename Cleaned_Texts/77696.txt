ketotifen antihistamine medication mast cell stabilizer commonly used treat allergic conditions conjunctivitis asthma urticaria hives ketotifen available ophthalmic eye drops drugeluting contact lenses oral tablets syrup forms ophthalmic form relieves eye itchiness irritation associated seasonal allergies oral form helps prevent systemic conditions asthma attacks allergic reactions addition treating allergies ketotifen shown efficacy managing systemic mast cell diseases mastocytosis mast cell activation syndrome mcas involve abnormal accumulation activation mast cells throughout body ketotifen also used allergictype conditions like atopic dermatitis eczema food allergies ketotifen acts blocking histamine receptors found various cells body smooth muscle endothelium nerve cells ketotifen prevents binding histamine receptors thus reduces symptoms histaminemediated allergic reactions itching sneezing wheezing swelling ketotifen also prevents release histamine inflammatory substances immune cells called mast cells action helps reduce symptoms allergic conditions blocking activation cells addition antihistaminic activity ketotifen also functions leukotriene antagonist blocks inflammationcausing chemicals known leukotrienes also acts phosphodiesterase inhibitor regulates blood vessel dilation generally welltolerated ketotifen side effects including drowsiness weight gain dry mouth irritability increased nosebleeds taken orally temporary burning stinging sensations eyes used topically ketotifen contraindications individuals certain medical conditions acute porphyrias epilepsy controversies surrounding ketotifen include classification firstgeneration secondgeneration antihistamine due varying criteria classification research ketotifen continues explore impact appetite regulation effectiveness specific medical conditions like irritable bowel syndrome despite inconclusive evidence regarding efficacy asthma treatment compared medications like

medication belonging second generations antihistamine classification vary depending criteria used context studies classify ketotifen firstgeneration others classify secondgeneration classification vary depending criteria used context study classification antihistamines primarily based chemical structure pharmacological properties side effect profiles ketotifen tricyclic benzocycloheptenebased compound chemical structures similar firstgeneration antihistamines azatadine cyproheptadine chlorpheniramine diphenhydramine compounds antihistamine properties pizotifen sedative effects ketotifen also reason differences classification firstgeneration antihistamines well known sedating side effects due ability penetrate ketotifen sedative properties generally considered milder sedative effect compared traditional firstgeneration reduced sedation one reasons ketotifen sometimes classified secondgeneration underlying mechanisms ketotifen similarly antihistamine drugs astemizole may increase appetite lead weight gain people fully different studies shown conflicting results amount weight gain caused ketotifen one study postmarketing found around every people took drug experienced weight gain adults gaining kilogram lb children age one gaining kilograms lb however another adults gained higher amount weight kilograms ketotifen exhibits chemical resemblance pizotifen substance known appetitestimulating one proposed mechanism involves inhibitory effect ketotifen production tnfα cytokine plays role regulating energy metabolism tnfα act directly adipocytes fat cells regulate release leptin leptin hormone produced adipose tissue acts satiety signal binding receptors hypothalamus inhibits appetite reducing tnfα production ketotifen may lead decreased leptin levels reducing appetite control inhibition furthermore ketotifens influence serotonin regulation could involved central serotonin disinhibition serotonin known suppressant effects appetite suggested ketotifen might cause decrease serotonin levels due regulatory influence result decrease serotonin function may lead increased food intake tendency heightened appetite still potential mechanisms hypothesized based limited studies mice suggest citrus aurantifolia may prevent prevent weightgain induced ketotifen confirmed human research directions ketotifen include investigation norketotifen nk metabolite ketotifen vitro studies using human liver microsomes hepatocytes suggest nk may major demethylated hepatic metabolite ketotifen unlike ketotifen nk seem induce severe sedative effects potentially allowing higher doses administered without sedation limiting factor furthermore nk may probably potent dosedependent inhibition release proinflammatory cytokine tnfα suggesting potential antiinflammatory activity thus ketotifen probably considered sedating prodrug converted nk nonsedating metabolite antiinflammatory properties used antiinflammatory ketotifens efficacy asthma remains inconclusive despite extensive however research ongoing longterm administration oral ketotifen prophylaxis asthma shown positive outcomes allowing reduction corticosteroid bronchodilator use improving clinical symptoms maintaining respiratory function still lengthy period weeks needed drug develops antiasthmatic tolerance develop rebound effect upon treatment interruption antihistaminic properties alone account
