antonio micheli viewing fungi microscope micheli reminded shape aspergillum holy water sprinkler latin spargere sprinkle named genus aspergillum asexual sporeforming structure common aspergillus species around onethird species also known sexual species aspergillus known cause fungal infections others commercial importance march aspergillus covered species notable species placed aspergillus include expansive genus aspergillus currently divided six subgenera many split total aspergillus defined group conidial fungi asexual state however known teleomorph sexual state ascomycota dna evidence members genus aspergillus members phylum ascomycotacitation needed members genus possess ability grow high osmotic pressure exists high concentration sugar salt etc aspergillus species highly aerobic found almost oxygenrich environments commonly grow molds surface substrate result high oxygen tension commonly fungi grow carbonrich substrates like monosaccharides glucose polysaccharides amylose aspergillus species common contaminants starchy foods bread potatoes grow many plants treescitation needed addition growth carbon sources many species aspergillus demonstrate oligotrophy capable growing nutrientdepleted environments environments complete lack key nutrients aspergillus niger prime example found growing damp walls major component mildewcitation needed several species aspergillus including niger fumigatus readily colonise favouring warm damp humid areas bathrooms around window aspergillus found millions species aspergillus important medically commercially species

alcoholic beverages japanese sake often made rice starchy ingredients like manioc rather grapes malted barley typical microorganisms used make alcohol yeasts genus saccharomyces ferment starches therefore koji mold aspergillus oryzae used first break starches simpler members genus also sources natural products used development medications treat human aspergillus spp known produce anthraquinone commercial importance due antibacterial antifungal properties perhaps largest application aspergillus niger major source citric acid organism accounts global citric acid production million tonnes million us tons per yearcitation needed niger also commonly used production native foreign enzymes including glucose oxidase lysozyme instances culture rarely grown solid substrate although still common practice japan often grown submerged culture bioreactor way important parameters strictly controlled maximal productivity achieved process also makes far easier separate chemical enzyme importance medium therefore far costeffective nidulans emericella nidulans used research organism many years used guido pontecorvo demonstrate parasexuality fungi recently nidulans one pioneering organisms genome sequenced researchers broad institute seven aspergillus species genomes sequenced industrially useful niger two strains oryzae terreus pathogens clavatus fischerianus neosartorya fischeri flavus fumigatus two fischerianus hardly ever pathogenic closely related common pathogen fumigatus sequenced part better understand fumigatus species aspergilli known sexual however many species likely yet unidentified sexual sexual reproduction occurs two fundamentally different ways fungi outcrossing heterothallic fungi two different individuals contribute nuclei selffertilization selfing homothallic fungi nuclei derived individual recent years sexual cycles discovered numerous species previously thought asexual discoveries reflect recent experimental focus species particular relevance humanscitation needed fumigatus common species cause disease immunodeficient humans fumigatus shown heterothallic fully functional sexual isolates complementary mating types required sex occur flavus major producer carcinogenic aflatoxins crops worldwide also opportunistic human animal pathogen causing aspergillosis immunocompromised individuals sexual state heterothallic fungus found arise strains opposite mating types cultured together appropriate lentulus opportunistic human pathogen causes invasive aspergillosis high mortality rates lentulus found heterothallic functional sexual breeding terreus commonly used industry produce important organic acids enzymes initial source cholesterollowering drug lovastatin terreus found capable sexual reproduction strains opposite mating types crossed appropriate culture findings aspergillus species consistent accumulating evidence studies eukaryotic species sex likely present common ancestor nidulans homothallic fungus capable selffertilization selfing involves activation mating pathways characteristic sex outcrossing species ie selffertilization bypass required pathways outcrossing sex instead requires activation pathways within single among aspergillus species exhibit sexual cycle overwhelming majority nature homothallic observation suggests aspergillus species generally maintain sex though little genetic variability produced homothallic selffertilization fumigatus heterothallic outcrossing fungus occurs areas widely different climates environments also displays little genetic variability either within geographic regions global suggesting sex case outcrossing sex maintained even little genetic variability produced simultaneous publication three aspergillus genome
