speech science refers study production transmission perception speech speech science involves anatomy particular anatomy orofacial region neuroanatomy physiology acoustics production speech highly complex motor task involves approximately orofacial laryngeal pharyngeal respiratory precise expeditious timing muscles essential production temporally complex speech sounds characterized transitions short ms frequency average speaking rate approximately sounds per second speech production requires airflow lungs respiration phonated vocal folds larynx phonation resonated vocal cavities shaped jaw soft palate lips tongue articulators articulation respiration physical process gas exchange organism environment involving four steps ventilation distribution perfusion diffusion two processes inspiration expiration respiration described mechanical process air flowing lungs principle boyles law stating volume container increases air pressure decrease relatively negative pressure cause air enter container pressure equalized inspiration air diaphragm contracts lungs expand drawn pleurae surface tension negative pressure lungs expand air pressure becomes negative compared atmospheric pressure air flow area higher pressure fill lungs forced inspiration speech uses accessory muscles elevate rib cage enlarge thoracic cavity vertical lateral dimensions forced expiration speech muscles trunk abdomen reduce size thoracic cavity compressing abdomen pulling rib cage forcing air lungs phonation production periodic sound wave vibration vocal folds airflow lungs well laryngeal muscle contraction causes movement vocal folds properties tension elasticity allow vocal folds stretched bunched brought together separated prephonation vocal folds move abducted adducted position subglottal pressure builds air flow forces folds apart inferiorly superiorly volume airflow constant velocity flow increase area constriction cause decrease pressure distributed negative pressure pull initially blow open folds back together cycle repeats vocal folds abducted inhibit phonation take breath third process speech production articulation mobile immobile structures face articulators adjust shape mouth pharynx nasal cavities vocal tract vocal fold vibration sound passes producing varying resonant frequencies analysis brain lesions correlation lesion locations behavioral deficits important sources knowledge cerebral mechanisms underlying speech production many seminal lesion studies paul broca indicated production speech relies functional integrity left inferior frontal recently results noninvasive neuroimaging techniques functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri provide growing evidence complex human skills primarily located highly specialized brain areas eg brocas area organized networks connecting several different areas hemispheres instead functional neuroimaging identified complex neural network underlying speech production including cortical subcortical areas supplementary motor area cingulate motor areas primary motor cortex basal ganglia speech perception refers understanding speech beginning process towards understanding speech first hearing message spoken auditory system receives sound signals starting outer ear enter pinna continue external auditory canal ear canal eardrum middle ear consists malleus incus stapes sounds changed mechanical energy converted mechanical energy message reaches oval window beginning inner ear inside inner ear message transferred hydraulic energy going cochlea filled fluid organ corti organ helps sound transferred neural impulse stimulates auditory pathway reaches brain sound processed heschls gyrus associated meaning wernickes area theories speech perception motor auditory theory motor theory based upon premise speech sounds encoded acoustic signal rather enciphered auditory theory puts greater emphasis sensory filtering mechanisms listener suggests speech knowledge minor role thats used hard perceptual conditions speech transmitted sound waves follow basic principles acoustics source sound vibration sound exist source something put vibration medium something transmit vibrations necessary since sound waves produced vibrating body vibrating object moves one direction compresses air directly front vibrating object moves opposite direction pressure air lessened expansion rarefaction air molecules occurs one compression one rarefaction make one longitudinal wave vibrating air molecules move back forth parallel direction motion wave receiving energy adjacent molecules nearer source passing energy adjacent molecules farther source sound waves two general characteristics disturbance identifiable medium energy transmitted place place medium travel two places important basic characteristics waves wavelength amplitude period frequency wavelength length repeating wave shape amplitude maximum displacement particles medium determined energy wave period measured seconds time one wave pass given point frequency wave number waves passing given point unit time frequency measured hertz hz hz cycles per second perceived pitch complete vibration sound wave called cycle two physical properties sound intensity duration intensity measured decibels db perceived loudness two types tones pure tones complex tones musical note produced tuning fork called pure tone consists one tone sounding one frequency instruments get specific sounds timbre sound comes many different tones sounding together different frequencies single note played piano example actually consists several tones sounding together slightly different frequencies httpsenwikipediaorgwikispeechscience
