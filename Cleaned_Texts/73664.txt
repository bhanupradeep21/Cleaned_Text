cognitive reserve minds brains resistance damage brain minds resilience evaluated behaviorally whereas neuropathological damage evaluated histologically although damage may estimated using bloodbased markers imaging methods two models used exploring concept reserve brain reserve cognitive reserve terms albeit often used interchangeably literature provide useful way discussing models using computer analogy brain reserve seen hardware cognitive reserve software factors currently believed contribute global reserve cognitive reserve commonly used refer brain cognitive reserves literature study published annals neurology reporting findings postmortem examinations elderly persons unexpectedly revealed discrepancy degree alzheimers disease neuropathology clinical manifestations participants whose brains extensive alzheimers disease pathology clinical manifestations disease furthermore study showed persons higher brain weights greater number neurons compared agematched controls investigators speculated two possible explanations phenomenon people may incipient alzheimers disease somehow avoided loss large numbers neurons alternatively started larger brains neurons thus might said greater reserve first time term used literature context study sparked interest area try confirm initial findings studies done higher reserve found provide greater threshold clinical deficit furthermore higher capacity showed rapid decline becoming clinically impaired probably indicating failure compensatory systems strategies put place individual greater reserve cope increasing neuropathological brain reserve may defined brains resilience ability cope increasing damage still functioning adequately passive threshold model presumes existence fixed cutoff reached would

found high general cognitive functions low memory adjusting effects education executive function explained genetic study combining twin adoption studies found cognitive functions heritable speed processing highest heritability particular cognitive reserve also indicates resilience neuropathological damage emphasis way brain uses damaged resources could defined ability optimize maximize performance differential recruitment brain networks andor alternative cognitive strategies efficiency model rather threshold model implies task processed using less resources using neural resources efficiently resulting better cognitive performance studies use factors like education occupation lifestyle proxies cognitive reserve tend positively correlate higher cognitive reserve education cognitively complex occupation factors predict higher cognitive abilities old therefore two commonly used proxies study cognitive reserve education occupation education known play role cognitive decline normal aging well degenerative diseases traumatic brain higher prevalence dementia individuals fewer years education suggested education may protect alzheimers moreover level education strong impact adults lifestyle level education measured number years individual spends school alternatively degree possibly level education provides set cognitive tools allow individual compensate pathological cognitive reserve index questionnaire criq devised assess level cognitive reserve order provide better diagnosis treatment takes account years education possible training courses lasting

education correlated greater functional connectivity frontoparietal greater cortical thickness left inferior temporal addition level education shown bilingualism enhances attention cognitive control children older adults delays onset dementia allows brain better tolerate underlying pathologies considered protective factor contributing positively cognitive another proxy cognitive reserve occupation studies suggest occupation may provide additive independent source cognitive reserve throughout persons life last longest job usually taken account occupation values may vary terms cognitive load involved common indices prestige salary also considered working activity measured criq assesses adulthood professions five different levels working activities available differing degree intellectual involvement personal responsibility working activity recorded number years profession occupation proxy cognitive reserve positively correlated local efficiency functional connectivity right medial temporal cognitively stimulating occupations weakly associated greater memory strongly correlated greater executive two proxies typically measured together typically highly correlated genetic study using mendelian randomization analysis demonstrated high occupation levels associated reduced risk alzheimer disease addition study confirmed occupational attainment independent effect risk alzheimer disease even taking educational attainment given level clinical impairment higher degree neuropathological change brains alzheimers disease sufferers involved greater number activities true even education iq controlled suggests differences lifestyle may increase cognitive reserve making individual words everyday experience affecting cognition analogous physical exercise influencing

bilingualism associated delayed onset alzheimers clinical diagnosis dementia perfectly linked levels underlying neuropathology severity pathologies deficit cognitive performance could direct relationship theory cognitive reserve explains phenomenon katzman et al conducted study autopsy results people found pathology related alzheimers however patients showed symptoms alzheimers disease life time pathology emerges brain cognitive reserve helps cope cognitive decline thus individuals high cognitive reserve cope better low cognitive reserve even causes people high cognitive reserve go undiagnosed damage becomes severe cognitive reserve estimated clinically affected many variables cognitive reserve index questionnaire criq measures cognitive reserve three main sources namely education work activities leisure time activities throughout individuals important note cognitive reserve variables associated protect alzheimers disease disease definition cognitive reserve based exactly presence disease pathology means traditional idea education protects alzheimers disease false albeit cognitive reserve protective clinical manifestations insufficient evidence recommend way increase cognitive reserve prevent dementia hand cognitive reserve important impact neurodegenerative diseases patients high cognitive reserve showed delay cognitive decline compared patients low cognitive reserve however symptoms cognitive decline become symptomatic patients high cognitive reserve show rapid cognitive presence cognitive reserve implies people greater reserve already suffering neuropathological changes brain picked standard clinical cognitive testing conversely anyone used instruments clinically knows yield false positives people low reserve point view concept adequate level challenge easily emerges conceivably one could measure cognitive reserve offer specifically tailored tests would pose enough level challenge accurately detect early cognitive impairment individuals high low reserve implications treatment care people high reserve deterioration occurs rapidly threshold individuals careers early diagnosis might provide opportunity plan future care adjust diagnosis still able make decisions cognitive rehabilitation study conducted dementia patients showed patients low cognitive reserve better outcomes cognitive training rehabilitation compared high cognitive reserve due fact patients high cognitive reserve delayed cognitive symptoms therefore disease could longer resist pathology furthermore improvement seen patients low cognitive reserve
