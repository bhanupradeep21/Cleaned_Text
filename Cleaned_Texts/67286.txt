vestibulospinal tract neural tract central nervous system specifically component extrapyramidal system classified component medial pathway like descending motor pathways vestibulospinal fibers tract relay information nuclei motor vestibular nuclei receive information vestibulocochlear nerve changes orientation head nuclei relay motor commands vestibulospinal tract function motor commands alter muscle tone extend change position limbs head goal supporting posture maintaining balance body vestibulospinal tract part extrapyramidal system central nervous system human anatomy extrapyramidal system neural network located brain part motor system involved coordination system called extrapyramidal distinguish tracts motor cortex reach targets traveling pyramids medulla pyramidal pathways corticospinal corticobulbar tracts may directly innervate motor neurons spinal cord brainstem seen anterior ventral horn cells certain cranial nerve nuclei whereas extrapyramidal system centers around modulation regulation indirect control anterior ventral horn cells extrapyramidal subcortical nuclei include substantia nigra caudate putamen globus pallidus thalamus red nucleus subthalamic traditional thought extrapyramidal system operated entirely independently pyramidal system however recent research provided greater understanding integration motor control motor control pyramidal extrapyramidal systems extensive feedback loops heavily interconnected appropriate classification motor nuclei tracts would functions broken function two major pathways medial lateral medial pathway helps control gross movements proximal limbs trunk lateral pathway helps control precise movement distal portion vestibulospinal tract well tectospinal reticulospinal tracts examples components medial vestibulospinal tract part vestibular system cns primary role vestibular system maintain head eye coordination upright posture balance conscious realization spatial orientation motion vestibular system able respond correctly recording sensory information hairs cells labyrinth inner ear nuclei receiving signals project extraocular muscles spinal cord cerebral cortex execute one projections vestibulospinal tract responsible upright posture head stabilization vestibular sensory neurons detect small movements body vestibulospinal tract commands motor signals specific muscles counteract movements restabilize body vestibulospinal tract upper motor neuron tract consisting two subpathways lateral vestibulospinal tract group descending extrapyramidal motor neurons efferent nerve tract found lateral funiculus bundle nerve roots spinal cord lateral vestibulospinal tract originates lateral vestibular nucleus deiters nucleus deiters nucleus extends pontomedullary junction level abducens nerve nucleus lateral vestibulospinal fibers descend uncrossed ipsilateral anterior portion lateral funiculus spinal fibers run total length spinal cord terminate interneurons laminae vii

reflex uses vestibular organs well skeletal muscle order maintain balance posture stability environment gravity reflexes broken timing dynamic reflex static reflex tonic reflex also categorized sensory input either canals otolith term vestibulospinal reflex commonly used sensory input evokes response muscular system neck reflexes important maintenance tonic labyrinthine reflex tlr reflex present newborn babies directly birth fully inhibited reflex helps baby master head neck movements outside womb well concept gravity increased muscle tone development proprioceptive vestibular senses opportunities practice balance consequences reflex early childhood tlr matures developed vestibulospinal reflexes help posture head alignment tonic labyrinthine reflex found two forms righting reflex another type reflex reflex positions head body back normal position response change head body position common example reflex cat righting reflex allows orient order land feet reflex initiated sensory information vestibular visual somatosensory systems therefore vestibulospinal typical person sways side side eyes closed result vestibulospinal reflex working correctly individual sways left side left lateral vestibulospinal tract activated bring body back generally damage vestibulospinal system results ataxia postural example unilateral damage occurs vestibulocochlear nerve lateral vestibular nucleus semicircular canals lateral vestibulospinal tract person likely sway side fall walking occurs healthy side powers weak side way cause person veer fall towards injured potential early onset damage witnessed positive rombergs patients bilateral unilateral vestibular system damage likely regain postural stability weeks months process called vestibular process likely related greater
