great filter idea development life earliest stages abiogenesis reaching highest levels development kardashev scale barrier development makes detectable extraterrestrial life exceedingly great filter one possible resolution fermi paradox concept originates robin hansons argument failure find extraterrestrial civilizations observable universe implies something wrong one arguments various scientific disciplines appearance advanced intelligent life probable observation conceptualized terms great filter acts reduce great number sites intelligent life might arise tiny number intelligent species advanced civilizations actually observed currently one probability threshold could lie past following human extinction might work barrier evolution intelligent life high probability main conclusion argument easier life evolve present stage bleaker future chances humanity probably idea first proposed online essay titled great filter almost past written economist robin hanson first version written august article last updated september hansons formulation received recognition several published sources discussing fermi paradox implications reliable evidence aliens visited earth observed intelligent extraterrestrial life current technology seti found transmissions civilizations universe apart earth seems dead hanson planet solar system however dont look substantially colonized advanced competitive life stars neither anything else see contrary great success explaining behavior planet solar system nearby stars galaxy even galaxies via simple dead physical processes rather complex purposeful processes advanced life life expected expand fill available technology selfreplicating spacecraft niches would include neighboring star systems even longer time scales still small compared age universe galaxies hanson notes advanced life substantially colonized planet would know evidence intelligent life places earth appears process starting star ending advanced explosive lasting life must unlikely implies least one step process must improbable hansons list incomplete describes following nine steps evolutionary path results colonization observable universe according great filter hypothesis least one list improbable early step ie past implication improbable step lies future humanitys prospects reaching step interstellar colonization still bleak past steps likely many civilizations would developed current level human species however none appear made step milky way would full colonies perhaps step unlikely one things appear likely keep us step sort catastrophe underestimation impact procrastination technology increasingly unburdens existence resource exhaustion leading impossibility making step due consumption available resources example highly constrained energy argument finding multicellular life mars provided evolved independently would bad news since would imply steps easy hence unknown step could big although steps occurred earth one may unlikely first seven steps necessary preconditions calculating likelihood using local environment anthropically biased observer infer nothing general probabilities predetermined surroundings paper jacob

life meanwhile evolution telescopes detect technosignatures midinfrared wavelengths could provide insights great filter say planets technosignatures abundant increase confidence great filter past hand finding life commonplace technosignatures absent would increase likelihood great filter lies specific formulation named berserker hypothesis filter exists steps civilization destroyed lethal von

shostak seti institute argues one postulate galaxy filled intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations failed colonize earth perhaps aliens lacked intent purpose colonize depleted resources maybe galaxy colonized heterogeneous manner earth could located galactic backwater although absence evidence generally weak evidence absence absence extraterrestrial megascale engineering projects example might point great filter work mean one steps leading intelligent life according shostak course variant fermi paradox dont see clues widespread largescale engineering consequently must conclude alone possibly flawed assumption say highly visible construction projects inevitable outcome intelligence could engineering small rather large inevitable follows laws inertia smaller machines faster require less energy function well speed light small computers faster internal communication may course advanced societies building small technology little incentive need rearrange stars neighborhoods instance may prefer build nanobots instead also kept mind arthur c clarke said truly advanced engineering would look like magic unrecognizable altogether way weve begun search things like dyson spheres cant really rule
