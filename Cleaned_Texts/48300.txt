immunocontraception use animals immune system prevent fertilizing offspring contraceptives type currently approved human use typically immunocontraception involves administration vaccine induces adaptive immune response causes animal become temporarily infertile contraceptive vaccines used numerous settings control wildlife however experts field believe major innovations required immunocontraception become practical form contraception human thus far immunocontraception focused mammals exclusively several targets mammalian sexual reproduction immune inhibition organized three immunocontraception currently available order immunocontraceptive palatable human use would need meet exceed efficacy rates currently popular forms currently maximum reduction fertility due sperm vaccines laboratory experiments mice lack efficacy due variability immunogenicity one animal another even exposed exact vaccine animals produce abundant antibody titers vaccines antigen others produce

sperm cell produced males species larger gamete ovum produced females species scheme fertilization requires two gametes one individual sex order occur immunocontraception targeting female gamete focused zona pellucida immunocontraception targeting male gamete involved many different antigens associated sperm zona pellucida glycoprotein membrane surrounding plasma membrane ovum zona pellucidas main function reproduction bind immunity zonae pellucidae causes animal produce antibodies bound zona pellucida thus sperm encounters ovum animal immunized zonae pellucidae sperm bind ovum zona
