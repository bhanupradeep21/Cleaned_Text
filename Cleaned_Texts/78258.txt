however publications continue russian language journals possible isolation years cold war seen divergence way science reported russian scientists found challenging adjust strict requirements modern publishing although modern search engines databases provide ready translations research abstracts least certain bias research published russian language english remains lingua franca biomedical sciences access full translations research papers remains challenge unlike majority international journals articles russian journals hard search sources captured citation management systems special
