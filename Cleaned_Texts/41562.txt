cutaneous nerve group nerves termed sural nerve complex eight documented variations sural nerve complex formed sural nerve takes course midline posterior posterolateral around lateral malleolus sural

sensorium posterolateral leg lower lateral ankle via lateral calcaneal branches sural nerve provides cutaneous innervation skin posterior posterolateral leg nerve part sciatic nerve sensorium provides autonomic sensory nerve fibers skin posterolateral leg ankle fibers originate perikaryon located spinal ganglia travel via lumbosacral plexus via nerve roots testing deficits understand often multiple
