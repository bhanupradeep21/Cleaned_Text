cortical granules regulatory secretory organelles ranging um um diameter found within oocytes associated polyspermy prevention event cortical granules found among mammals many vertebrates within oocyte cortical granules located along cortex region furthest cells center following fertilization signaling pathway induces cortical granules fuse oocytes cell membrane release contents oocytes extracellular matrix exocytosis cortical granules known cortical reaction mammals oocytes extracellular matrix includes surrounding layer perivitelline space zona pellucida finally cumulus cells
