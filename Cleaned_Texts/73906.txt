consequently emotions likely play important role moral development however currently little consensus among theorists emotions influence moral development psychoanalytic theory founded freud

comes topics like morality childrens interactions experiences caregivers peers shown influence development moral understanding researchers addressed influence interpersonal interactions childrens moral development two primary perspectives social domain research social domain theory perspective focuses children actively distinguish moral conventional behavior based part responses parents teachers social domain suggests different areas reasoning coexisting development include societal concerns conventions grouping moral fairness justice rights psychological concerns personal goals adults tend respond childrens moral transgressions eg hitting stealing drawing childs attention effect action others consistently across various contexts contrast adults likely respond childrens conventional misdeeds eg wearing hat classroom eating spaghetti fingers reminding children specific rules certain contexts eg school peers respond mainly moral conventional transgressions demonstrate emotional distress eg crying yelling victim moral unconventional research socializationinternalization perspective focuses adults pass standards rules behavior children parenting techniques children internalize perspective moral development involves childrens increasing compliance internalization adult rules requests standards behavior using definitions researchers find parenting behaviors vary extent encourage childrens internalization values effects depend partially childs attributes age instance kochanska showed gentle parental discipline best promotes conscience development temperamentally fearful children parental responsiveness mutually responsive parentchild orientation best promote conscience development temperamentally fearless parental influences exert effects multiple pathways including increasing childrens experience moral emotions eg guilt empathy selfidentification moral development divided multiple stages however first years development usually seen
