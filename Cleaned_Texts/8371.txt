economics finance risk aversion tendency people prefer outcomes low uncertainty outcomes high uncertainty even average outcome latter equal higher monetary value certain risk aversion explains inclination agree situation predictable possibly lower payoff rather another situation highly unpredictable possibly higher payoff example riskaverse investor might choose put money bank account low guaranteed interest rate rather stock may high expected returns also involves chance losing value person given choice two scenarios one guaranteed payoff one risky payoff average value former scenario person receives uncertain scenario coin flipped decide whether person receives nothing expected payoff scenarios meaning individual insensitive risk would care whether took guaranteed payment gamble however individuals may different risk person said average payoff gamble known expected value smallest guaranteed dollar amount individual would indifferent compared uncertain gain specific average predicted value called certainty equivalent also used measure risk aversion individual risk averse certainty equivalent smaller prediction uncertain gains risk premium difference expected value certainty equivalent riskaverse individuals risk premium positive riskneutral persons zero riskloving individuals risk premium negative expected utility theory agent utility function uc c represents

without affecting conclusions agent riskseeking utility function concave instance could might might comparison might expected utility bet chance receiving chance receiving person utility function expected utility bet equals known utility amount hence certainty equivalent risk premium minus proportional terms expected value risky bet displaystyle tfrac risk premium means person would willing sacrifice much expected value order achieve perfect certainty much money received words person would indifferent bet guarantee would prefer anything bet case wealthier individual risk losing would less significant small amounts utility function would likely almost linear instance might might utility function perceived gains two key properties upward slope concavity upward slope implies person feels better larger amount received yields greater utility risky bets person would prefer bet firstorder stochastically dominant alternative bet probability mass second bet pushed right form first bet first bet preferred ii concavity utility function implies person risk averse sure amount would always preferred risky bet expected value moreover risky bets person would prefer bet meanpreserving
