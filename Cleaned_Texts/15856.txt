human microbiome project hmp completed laid foundation investigation role microbiome plays overall health disease one area particular interest role delivery mode plays development infantneonate microbiome potential implications may long term found infants born via vaginal delivery microbiomes closely mirroring mothers vaginal microbiome whereas born via cesarean section tend resemble mothers skin one notable study illustrated abundance lactobacillus typical vaginal genera stool samples infants born via vaginal delivery abundance staphylococcus corynebacterium commonly found skin surfaces stool samples infants born via cesarean section discoveries came concept vaginal seeding also known procedure whereby vaginal fluids hence vaginal microbes applied newborn child delivered caesarean section idea vaginal seeding explored maria gloria dominguezbello discovered birth caesarean section significantly altered newborn childs microbiome compared natural purpose technique recreate natural transfer bacteria baby gets vaginal birth involves placing swabs mothers vagina wiping onto babys face mouth eyes due longdrawn nature studying impact vaginal seeding limited number studies available support refute evidence suggests applying microbes mothers vaginal canal baby cesarean section may aid partial restoration infants natural gut microbiome increased likelihood pathogenic infection child via vertical theodor rosebury began study human microbiota thirty years later published microorganisms indigenous man book discussed importance microbial colonization birth role forming infant roseberys perspective microbial colonization birth elucidated group researchers united states studies performed maria gloria dominguezbello team indicated microbiome child born cesarean section significantly different child delivered natural found infants born via cesarean section lack bacteroide species interestingly study preformed mass general hospital published found significant difference bacteroide species colonization prelabor csections postlabor csections indicating vaginal exposure may sole driving force bacteroides colonization given vaginal microbiome thought influential development neonatal microbiome important understand acknowledge complexity early studies vaginal microbiome revealed predominance lactobacillus species similarly study evaluating impacts maternal vaginal microbiome composition development infant gut microbiome early life found vaginal microbiome pregnant participants dominated one several species lactobacillus four species appearing common around association anaerobic cocci abnormal vaginal discharge first established later gardnerella vaginalis identified causative agent bacterial vaginosis bv complicated several species discovered anaerobic cultures individuals symptoms corresponding bv one commonality remained throughout experiencing symptoms bv depletion lactic acid producing bacterial species presence bv subsequently linked preterm birth well increased risk development sexually transmitted disease thought linked deficiency lactobacillus species produce lactic acid thought protective properties pathogenic bacteriaviruses another interesting component vaginal microbiome comes stability variability time study published science translational medicine investigated temporal dynamics vaginal microbiota found stability vaginal microbiome time highly individual participants tended exhibit higher variability course weeks study three alterations vaginal microbiome time contrast others exhibited almost complete stability throughout course study fluctuations vaginal microbiome demonstrated menstrual cycle intercourse fluctuations brought pregnancy also area interest nearly organ systems change pregnancy promote maintain pregnancy known pregnancy results thickening vaginal mucosa increase cervical secretions turn leads smooth muscle cell hypertrophy relaxation connective tissue addition vaginal epithelium also exhibits hypertrophy subsequently leads crowding epithelial cells rich glycogen throughout duration gestation rising estrogen leads additional increases glycogen metabolized lactic acid causes vagina become acidic turn causes increase lactobacillus growth vagina interestingly study longitudinal analysis vaginal microflora pregnancy found participants initially lactobacillidiminished vaginal microbiomes first trimester pregnancy developed prevalence lactobacilli later pregnancy hinting towards importance genus may play neonate early life animals well humans development immune system metabolism influenced infants microbiota alteration dysbiosis microbiota either prevent cause method birth whether vaginal caesarean section determines exposure colonization infants gut microbiota purpose behind practice vaginal seeding micro birthing allows infant delivered via caesarean section come contact microbes birth canal infants delivered vaginally exposed beneficial microorganisms known microbiota travel birth canal infants exposed critical bacteria via vaginal birth lactobacillus prevotella bacteroides escherichiashigella bifidobacterium bifidobacterium key bacteria nourishment infants development immunity maturation intestinal expectation may boost gut bacteria lessen danger health issues normally associated caesarian infants contributes seeding infants baby exposed mothers vaginal microbes wash child birth canal coves skin enters babys eyes ears nose mouth microbes often travel gut swallowed said microbes important postnatal development immune system event csection done labour starts womans water breaks infant come contact maternal vaginal fluid bacteria instead come contact skin microbes staphylococcus streptococcus veillonella different set differences turn associated increased risks asthma allergies obesity immune deficiencies thus differences appear often infants caesarean delivery vaginal delivery according certain epidemiological fact united states studies found neonatal cases methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus infections skin found occur born via csection evidence suggests cesarean delivery increase risk inflammatory metabolic diseases unclear whether vaginal seeding longterm benefits whether safe small study infants published journal nature medicine look benefits vaginal seeding microbiome four cesarean delivered infants receiving microbial transfer found similar microbiome seven vaginally delivered results study suggest vaginal seeding partially restores neonatal however study authors acknowledged longterm consequences vaginal seeding remain unclear due limited data subsequent study published found big difference six weeks microbes infants born vaginally versus delivered csection without receiving vaginal certain scholars pointed babys exposure bacteria begins even birth research required scientific evidence regarding short longterm benefits vaginal seeding well risks involved limited due widespread clinical advice given performing vaginal seeding insufficient support following nonclinical vaginal seeding procedure reported case localized neonatal herpes simplex virus hsv infection however supported infection due procedure another infants delivered csection lower danger exchange potentially harmful microbes infections birth canal although remains unknown vaginal seeding procedures may take harmful microorganisms including undetected sexually transmitted infections stis unintentionally transfer infant could potentially cause proposed implementing screening protocol potential vaginal pathogens may beneficial considering vaginal editorial written british medical journal advising practitioners parents perform vaginal seeding enough evidence beneficial infants could potentially put babies health american college obstetricians gynecologists acog also encourage recommend vaginal seeding due lack currently establishment infant microbiome including influences associated optimal versus dysbiotic outcomes remains key component health research late studies evaluating potential relationship maternal vaginal microbiome gut microbiome infant species strain level context bacterial baptism hypothesis essential merely reporting genre lactobacillus would fail provide insight assessment vertical presence absence certain species within genre may greatly alter functionality making investigation implication specie variation important component research vaginal microbiome development infant microbiome additionally maternal alterations intestinal microbiome pregnancy may also play role microbial colonization vaginally delivered infants comparing stool samples first third trimester women study host remodeling gut microbiome metabolic changes pregnancy discovered increase proteobacteria pregnancy progresses given potential maternal fecal contamination prone occur vaginal delivery important consider alterations intestinal microbiome pregnancy may influence microbial colonization infant furthermore examination intestinal microbiome infants born via cesarean versus vaginal delivery revealed differences
