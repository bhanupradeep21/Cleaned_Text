paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity psh syndrome causes episodes increased activity sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity sympathetic nervous system manifest increased heart rate increased respiration increased blood pressure diaphoresis previously syndrome identified general dysautonomia considered specific form also referred paroxysmal sympathetic instability dystonia paid sympathetic storm recently however studies adopted name paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity ensure psh observed younger patients older ones also seen commonly men known reason case although suspected pathophysiological links exist patients surviving traumatic brain injury occurrence episodes one every three psh also associated severe anoxia subarachnoid intracerebral hemorrhage characteristics paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity cases psh episodes develop postinjury specifically traumatic brain injury symptoms typically develop quickly usually within week symptom onset seen average days episodes vary duration occurrence episodes last little minutes long ten hours occur multiple times day episode duration seen average minutes occur five six times episodes occur naturally arise external triggers common triggers include pain stimulation body turning movements bladder distention bladder distention observed patients treated intensive care units concurrent use symptoms psh last weeks years following initial onset episodes persist time found become less frequent occurrence last prolonged number events lead development psh symptoms many exact pathways causes development syndrome known traumatic brain injury stroke antinmda receptor encephalitis although associations injury spinal many forms brain injury cause onset psh even obscure diseases intracranial tuberculoma seen cause onset paroxysmal sympathetic observed injuries lead development psh seen conjunction psh pathophysiology behind diseases syndrome well understood considerable number theories exist pathophysiology many theories dealing pathophysiology paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity possible none multiple theories correct research conducted psh focused figuring pathways diagnosing psh difficult due lack common terminology circulation lack diagnostic different systems diagnosis proposed universal system embraced one example proposed system diagnosis requires observation confirmation four six following symptoms fever greater degrees celsius tachycardia classified heart rate bpm higher hypertension classified systolic pressure higher mmhg pulse pressure higher mmhg tachypnea

radiological features observed detected scan various methods used treat psh medications used end episodes prevent occurrence hyperbaric oxygen therapy explored treatments used success measured casebycase basis successful treatments qualitative results efficacy wider ranges patients developed two common medications used treatment paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity morphine sulfate morphine useful helping halt episodes started occur betablockers helpful preventing occurrence sympathetic storms drugs used cases helpful dopamine agonists various opiates benzodiazepines clonidine chlorpromazine haloperidol dopamine antagonists cases worsened psh drugs use currently treatment exact pathways known widerange helpfulness speculative morphine found effective aborting episodes sometimes medication combat sympathetic response morphine helps lower respiration rates hypertension given doses two milligrams eight milligrams administered twenty milligrams nausea vomiting common side effects withdrawal sometimes seen nonselective betablockers effective reducing frequency severity psh episodes help decrease effect circulating catecholamines lower metabolic rates high patients psh episodes betablockers also help reducing fever diaphoresis cases dystonia propranolol common betablocker administered due fact penetrates bloodbrain barrier relatively well typically administered doses twenty milligrams sixty milligrams every four six hours treatment clonidine alpha receptor agonist helps reduces sympathetic activity leaving hypothalamus reduces circulating catecholamines helpful lowering blood pressure heart rate show much effect symptoms may also increase sympathetic inhibition brainstemmedical citation needed bromocriptine dopamine agonist helps lower blood pressure effects modest well understood baclofen gaba agonist helps control muscle spasms proving helpful treating dystonia benzodiazepines bind gaba receptors work muscle relaxants benzodiazepines also combat high blood pressure respiratory rates however associated glaucoma rather serious side effect gabapentin inhibits neurotransmitter release dorsal horn spinal cord various areas central nervous system helps treat mild symptoms tolerated longer periods time compared drug treatments dantrolene helps combat dystonia fever affecting muscle contraction relaxation cycles hinders release calcium
