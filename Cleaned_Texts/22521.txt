cholera anthrax regarded one main founders modern bacteriology popularly nicknamed father microbiology louis father medical discovery anthrax bacterium bacillus anthracis considered birth modern koch used discoveries establish germs could cause specific directly provided proofs germ theory diseases therefore creating scientific basis public saving millions lifes work koch seen one founders modern working private physician koch developed many innovative techniques microbiology first use oil immersion lens condenser microphotography microscopy invention bacterial culture method using agar glass plates later developed petri dish assistant julius richard petri made first grow bacteria laboratory appreciation work appointed government advisor imperial health office promoted senior executive position geheimer regierungsrat director hygienic institute chair professor hygiene faculty medicine berlin university royal prussian institute infectious diseases later renamed robert koch institute death methods koch used bacteriology led establishment medical concept known kochs postulates four generalized medical principles ascertain relationship pathogens specific diseases concept still use situations influences subsequent epidemiological principles bradford hill major controversy followed koch discovered tuberculin medication tuberculosis proven ineffective developed diagnosis tuberculosis death research tuberculosis received nobel prize physiology medicine day announced discovery tuberculosis bacterium march observed world health organization world tuberculosis day every

consisted clinical division beds division clinical research accepted harsh conditions prussian ministry health insisted scandal tuberculin koch discovered intended remedy tuberculosis kochs inventions would unconditionally belong government would compensated koch lost right apply patent moved east africa research cure trypanosomiasis sleeping sickness established bugula research camp people day treated experimental drug robert koch made two important developments microscopy first use oil immersion lens condenser enabled smaller objects addition also first effectively use photography microphotography microscopic observation introduced bedrock methods bacterial staining using methylene blue bismarck vesuvin brown attempt grow bacteria koch began use solid nutrients potato initial experiments koch observed individual colonies identical pure found potato slices suitable media organisms later began use nutrient solutions however soon realized gelatin like potato slices optimal medium bacterial growth remain solid ideal temperature growth human also many bacteria hydrolyze gelatin making liquid suggested postdoctoral assistant walther hesse got idea wife fanny hesse koch started using agar grow isolate pure agar polysaccharide remains solid degraded bacteria results stable transparent kochs booklet published titled zur untersuchung von pathogenen organismen methods study pathogenic known bible described novel method using glass slide agar grow bacteria method involved pouring liquid agar glass slide spreading thin layer gelatin gelatin made culture medium solidify bacterial samples could spread uniformly whole bacterial culture put glass plate together small wet paper koch named container feuchte kammer moist chamber typical chamber circular glass dish cm diameter cm height lid prevent contamination glass plate transparent culture media made observation bacterial growth koch publicly demonstrated plating method seventh international medical congress london august louis pasteur exclaimed cest un grand progrès monsieur great progress using kochs microscopy agarplate culture method students discovered new bacteria friedrich loeffler discovered bacteria glanders burkholderia mallei diphtheria corynebacterium diphtheriae georg theodor august gaffky bacterium typhoid salmonella enterica kochs assistant julius richard petri developed improved method published eine kleine modification des koch schen plattenverfahrens minor modification plating technique culture plate given eponymous name petri often asserted petri developed new culture simply discarded use glass plate instead used circular glass dish directly moist chamber main culture container reduced chances would also appropriate name koch dish robert koch widely known work anthrax discovering causative agent fatal disease bacillus published discovery booklet die ätiologie der milzbrandkrankheit begründet auf die entwicklungsgeschichte des bacillus anthracis etiology anthrax disease based developmental history bacillus anthracis working publication structure anthrax marked first photography discovered formation spores anthrax bacteria could remain dormant specific however optimal conditions spores activated caused determine causative agent dryfixed bacterial cultures onto glass slides used dyes stain cultures observed work anthrax notable first link specific microorganism specific disease rejecting idea spontaneous generation supporting germ theory time government advisor imperial health agency berlin koch became interested tuberculosis research time widely believed tuberculosis inherited disease however koch convinced disease caused bacterium infectious published findings tuberculosis reported causative agent disease slowgrowing mycobacterium published discovery die ätiologie der tuberkulose etiology presented german physiological society berlin march koch said coverglasses exposed staining fluid methylene blue mixed potassium hydroxide hours fine rodlike forms became apparent tubercular mass first time observations showed power multiplication spore formation hence belonging group organisms anthrax bacillus microscopic examination showed previously bluestained cell nuclei detritus became brown tubercle bacilli remained beautiful particular reaction announcement eminent scientists rudolf virchow remained skeptical virchow clung theory diseases due faulty cellular hand paul ehrlich later recollected moment single greatest scientific koch expanded report published title booklet concluded discovery tuberculosis bacterium fulfilled three principles eventually known kochs postulates formulated assistant friedrich loeffler saying factors together allow conclude bacilli present tuberculous lesions accompany tuberculosis rather cause bacilli true agents august german government sent medical team led koch alexandria egypt investigate cholera epidemic koch soon found intestinal mucosa people died cholera always bacterial infection yet could confirm whether bacteria causative pathogens outbreak egypt declined transferred calcutta kolkata india severe outbreak soon found river ganges source cholera performed autopsies almost bodies found bacterial infection identified bacteria water tanks linking source isolated bacterium pure culture january subsequently confirmed bacterium new species described little bent like experiment using fresh blood samples indicated bacterium could kill red blood cells hypothesized sort poison used bacterium cause indian scientist sambhu nath de discovered poison cholera koch reported discovery german secretary state interior february published deutsche medizinische wochenschrift german medical weekly following although koch convinced bacterium cholera pathogen could entirely establish critical evidence bacterium produced symptoms healthy subjects following kochs postulates experiment animals using pure bacteria culture cause disease correctly explained animals immune human pathogen bacterium known comma bacillus scientifically bacillus later realised bacterium already described italian physician filippo pacini also observed catalan physician joaquim balcells pascual around failed identify bacterium causative agent cholera kochs colleague richard friedrich johannes pfeiffer correctly identified comma bacillus pacinis vibrioni renamed vibrio cholera koch gave much research attention tuberculosis throughout career medical expeditions various parts world focussed tuberculosis time imperial health office carrying project disinfection sputum tuberculosis patients koch experimented arsenic creosote possible disinfectants chemicals available drugs report also mentioned failed experiment attempt make tuberculosis koch turned attention synthetic dyes antibacterial chemicals developed method examining antibacterial activity mixing gelatinbased culture media yellow dye auramin notebook indicates february tested hundreds one tests found extract tuberculosis bacterium culture dissolved glycerine could cure tuberculosis guinea pigs based series experiments april july could conclude extract kill tuberculosis bacterium destroyed necrosis infected tissues thereby depriving bacterial growth made vague announcement august tenth international medical congress saying communication made months ago international medical congress

disease tuberculosis longer react upon inoculation tubercle virus bacterium treated substance guinea pigs sick tuberculosis pathological process brought complete november koch able show extract effective humans many patients doctors went berlin get kochs experiments showed tuberculosis infected guinea pigs developed severe symptoms substance inoculated severity development severe immune response known due hypersensitivity known koch chemical nature known among several independent experiments done next year soninlaw eduard pfuhl able reproduce similar nevertheless became medical sensation unknown substance referred kochs lymph koch published experiments january issue deutsche medizinische british medical journal immediately published english version english version also

december arrived part expedition german new guinea protectorate german reich koch serially examined papuan people indigenous inhabitants blood samples noticed contained plasmodium parasites cause malaria bouts malaria mild could even noticed ie subclinical contrary german settlers chinese workers brought new guinea fell sick immediately longer stayed country however seemed develop resistance time government advisor koch published report discovered experimentally showed tuberculosis bacterium pathogen tuberculosis described importance pure cultures isolating diseasecausing organisms explained necessary steps obtain cultures methods summarized kochs four kochs discovery causative agent anthrax led formation generic set postulates used determination cause infectious postulates outlined method linking cause effect infectious disease also established significance laboratory culture infectious agents became gold standard infectious although koch worked principles formulate

tuberculosis cured moment onwards kochs prestige fell apart reason initial secrecy due ambition monetary benefits new drug establishment research since tried leave government service create independent staterun institute following disappointment released university berlin forced work director royal prussian institute infectious diseases newly established institute prohibited working tuberculin claim patent rights subsequent koch initially believed human mycobacterium tuberculosis cattle tuberculosis bacilli called mycobacterium bovis different pathogens made discovery two years later revoked position asserted two bacilli later assumption taken fact veterinary practice based legislations made us inspection meat american veterinarian theobald smith published detailed comparative study found tuberculosis bacteria different based structure growth patterns pathogenicity addition also discovered variations type conclusion made two important points time evidence cattle tuberculosis transmitted humans meat upon reports koch conceded two bacilli different still advocated cattle tuberculosis health concern speaking third international congress tuberculosis held london
