source egyptian word crocodiles sauros σαύρος greek lizard morphology champsosaurus resembles gharials long elongated snout native freshwater environments likely preyed fish similar living gharials

gigas largest species reached ft skull champsosaurus dorsoventrally flattened temporal arches expanded posteriorly towards back skull laterally away midline giving skull heart shaped appearance viewed snout greatly elongated ghariallike making around half length skull least four times long opening nostrils end snout openings ears located underside body flat streamlined heavy gastralia riblike bones situated compared choristoderes lacrimal bone reduced size small triangle postorbital bone form part orbit eye socket contact premaxilla vomer bones internarial bone present choanae located posteriorly correlation elongation vomer interpterygoid vacuity small completely enclosed pterygoid bones located near posterior margin suborbital fenestra shape suborbital fenestra shortened kidney like articulation pterygoid parasphenoid fused joint skull lower jaws anterior level occipital condyles neomorphic bone forms border posttemporal fenestra paroccipital process strongly deflected downwards basal tubera basisphenoid winglike shape expanded backwards downwards mandibular symphysis connection two halves lower jaw elongated half length tooth row splenial bone strongly intervenes mandibular braincase champsosaurus poorly ossified front skull anterior well ossified rear posterior similar diapsids cranial endocast space occupied brain cranial vault similar basal archosauromorphs proportionally narrow dorsoventral lateral axes enlarged pineal body olfactory bulbs optic lobes flocculi small size indicating average vision ability best olfactory chambers nasal passages olfactory stalks braincase reasonably large indicating champsosaurus probably good olfactory capabilities sense smell nasal passages lack bony turbinates semicircular canals similar aquatic reptiles expansion sacculus indicates champsosaurus likely increased sensitivity low frequency sounds vibrations absence otic notch indicates champsosaurus lacked tympanum probably poor ability detect airborne champsosaurus like many fellow neochoristoderes features teeth striated enamel tooth crown enamel infolding base anterior teeth typically sharper slender posterior teeth like choristoderes champsosaurus possessed palatal teeth teeth present bones roof mouth longitudinal rows present pterygoid palatine vomer alongside small row flange pterygoid palatine teeth champsosaurus located raised platforms bone though wideness platforms sharpness orientation teeth vary species orientation teeth varies jaw posterior teeth orientated backward palatal teeth likely combination fleshy tongue probably aided gripping swallowing skin impressions champsosaurus reported consist small mm pustulate rhomboid scales largest scales located lateral sides body decreasing size dorsally osteoderms

suggested expanded temporal arches likely anchored powerful jaw muscles elongated snout allowed champsosaurus prey fish akin modern gharials adaptions allowing rapid movement head jaws prey study found middle posterior neck vertebrae champsosaurus adapted lateral movement champsosaurus may fed laterally sweeping head using slender jaws grab individual fish shoals akin modern gharials feed mechanism head movement different gharials lateral movement occurs headneck joint unlikely champsosaurus fed inertial feeding prey temporarily let go head moved forwards order force prey deeper throat prey moved throat tongue combination palatal erickston proposed position nostrils front snout allowed champsosaurus spend large amounts time bottom water bodies head angled upwards allow snout act like snorkel animal needed however later studies suggested neck vertebrae champsosaurus limited ability flex champsosaurus coexisted similarly sized aquatic crocodilians paleocene localities fellow neochoristodere simoedosaurus though assemblages champsosaurus occurs longirostrine long snouted ghariallike crocodilians absent suggesting niche previously two species champsosaurus identified
