participants exposed high levels social undermining even high levels social support improve participants course antidepressive treatment high levels social support social undermining could reduce also cause remission participants depressive symptoms study found african american participants low levels social undermining able fare better caucasians participants reducing symptoms groups participants given high levels social undermining african american participants fewer achievements symptom reduction caucasians participants reverse effect symptom reduction research conducted horwitz et al
