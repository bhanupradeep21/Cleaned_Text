leigh syndrome also called leigh disease subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy inherited neurometabolic disorder affects central nervous system named archibald denis leigh british neuropsychiatrist first described condition normal levels thiamine thiamine monophosphate thiamine diphosphate commonly found reduced absent level thiamine triphosphate thought caused blockage enzyme thiaminediphosphate kinase therefore treatment patients would take thiamine triphosphate symptoms leigh syndrome classically described beginning infancy leading death within span several however cases recognized apparent symptoms emerge adolescence patients survive many years following symptoms often first seen triggering event taxes bodys energy production infection surgery general course leigh syndrome one episodic developmental regression times metabolic stress patients long periods without disease progression others develop progressive infants syndrome symptoms include diarrhea vomiting dysphagia trouble swallowing sucking leading failure children early leigh disease also may appear irritable cry much healthy babies seizures often seen excess lactate may seen urine cerebrospinal fluid blood person leigh disease progresses muscular system debilitated throughout body brain control contraction muscles hypotonia low muscle tone strength dystonia involuntary sustained muscle contraction ataxia lack control movement often seen people leigh disease eyes particularly affected muscles control eyes become weak paralyzed uncontrollable conditions called ophthalmoparesis weakness paralysis nystagmus involuntary eye slow saccades also sometimes heart lungs also fail result leigh disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy thickening part heart muscle also sometimes found cause asymmetric septal hypertrophy also associated leigh children leighsyndrome associated ventricular septal defects caused pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency high forehead large ears seen facial abnormalities typical leigh however respiratory failure common cause death people leigh syndrome neurological symptoms include peripheral neuropathy loss sensation extremities caused damage peripheral nervous hypertrichosis seen leigh syndrome caused mutations nuclear gene mutations mitochondrial dna mtdna genes nuclear dna gene cox assembly factors implicated leigh disorders oxidative phosphorylation process cells produce main energy source adenosine triphosphate atp may caused mutations either mtdna nuclear encoded genes latter account majority leigh disease although always
