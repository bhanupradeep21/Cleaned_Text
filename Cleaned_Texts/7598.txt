thrombus pl thrombi colloquially called blood clot final product blood coagulation step hemostasis two components thrombus aggregated platelets red blood cells form plug mesh crosslinked fibrin protein substance making thrombus sometimes called cruor thrombus healthy response injury intended stop prevent bleeding harmful thrombosis clot obstructs blood flow healthy blood vessels circulatory system microcirculation consisting small smallest blood vessels capillaries tiny thrombi known microclots obstruct flow blood capillaries cause number problems particularly affecting alveoli lungs respiratory system resulting reduced oxygen supply microclots found characteristic feature severe cases long mural thrombi thrombi adhere wall large blood vessel heart commonly found aorta largest artery body often descending aorta less often aortic arch abdominal restrict blood flow usually block entirely appear greyred along alternating light dark lines known lines zahn represent bands white blood cells red blood cells darker entrapped layers thrombi classified two major groups depending location relative amount platelets red blood cells two major groups microcirculation consisting small smallest blood vessels capillaries tiny thrombi known microclots obstruct flow blood capillaries microclots small clumps blood form within circulation usually result larger thrombus breaking smaller pieces cause concern lead blockages small vessels restrict blood flow leading tissue damage potentially causing ischemic events microclots cause number problems particularly affecting alveoli lungs respiratory system resulting reduced oxygen supply microclots found characteristic feature severe cases long mural thrombi thrombi form adhere inner wall large blood vessel heart chamber often result blood commonly found aorta largest artery body often descending aorta less often aortic arch abdominal restrict blood flow usually block entirely mural thrombi usually found vessels already damaged mural thrombus affect heart chamber found left ventricle often result heart attack complication thrombus case separate chamber carried arteries block blood appear greyred alternating light dark lines known lines zahn represent bands white blood cells red blood cells darker entrapped layers fibrincitation needed suggested years ago thrombus formation result abnormalities blood flow vessel wall blood components concept known virchows triad three factors refined include circulatory stasis vascular wall injury hypercoagulable state contribute increased risk venous thromboembolism cardiovascular virchows triad describes pathogenesis thrombus disseminated intravascular coagulation dic involves widespread microthrombi formation throughout majority blood vessels due excessive consumption coagulation factors subsequent activation fibrinolysis using bodys available platelets clotting factors result hemorrhaging ischemic necrosis tissueorgans causes septicaemia acute leukaemia shock snake bites fat emboli broken bones severe traumas dic may also seen pregnant females treatment involves use fresh frozen plasma restore level clotting factors blood well platelets heparin prevent thrombi formationcitation needed thrombus occurs hemostatic process normally occurs response injury becomes activated uninjured slightly injured vessel thrombus large blood vessel decrease blood flow vessel termed mural thrombus small blood vessel blood flow may completely cut termed occlusive thrombus resulting death tissue supplied vessel thrombus dislodges becomes freefloating considered emboluscitation needed embolus becomes trapped within blood vessel blocks blood flow termed embolism embolisms depending specific location cause significant effects like strokes heart attacks even conditions increase risk blood clots developing include atrial fibrillation form cardiac arrhythmia heart valve replacement recent heart attack also known myocardial infarction extended periods inactivity see deep venous thrombosis genetic diseaserelated deficiencies bloods clotting abilitiescitation needed platelet activation occurs injuries damage endothelium blood vessels exposing enzyme called factor vii protein normally circulating within vessels tissue factor protein encoded gene platelet activation potentially cause cascade eventually leading formation process regulated thromboregulation micrograph showing thrombus center image within blood vessel placenta stain illustration depicting thrombus formation arterial plaque composition fresh thrombus microscopy showing nuclear debris background fibrin red blood cells anticoagulants drugs used prevent formation blood clots reducing risk stroke heart attack pulmonary embolism heparin warfarin used inhibit formation growth existing thrombi former used acute anticoagulation latter used longterm mechanism action heparin warfarin different work different pathways coagulation heparin works binding activating enzyme inhibitor antithrombin iii enzyme acts inactivating thrombin factor contrast warfarin works inhibiting vitamin k epoxide reductase enzyme needed synthesize vitamin k dependent clotting factors ii vii ix bleeding time heparin warfarin therapy measured partial thromboplastin time ptt prothrombin time pt clots formed drugs used promote thrombolysis clot breakdown streptokinase enzyme produced streptococcal bacteria one oldest thrombolytic drug administered intravenously dissolve blood clots coronary vessels however streptokinase causes systemic fibrinolytic state lead bleeding problems tissue plasminogen activator tpa different enzyme promotes degradation fibrin clots free drug made transgenic bacteria converts plasminogen clotdissolving enzyme recent research indicates tpa could toxic effects central nervous system cases severe stroke tpa cross barrier enter interstitial fluid increases excitotoxicity potentially affecting permeability causing cerebral also anticoagulants come animals work dissolving fibrin example haementeria ghilianii amazon leech produces enzyme called hementin salivary thrombus formation one four outcomes propagation
