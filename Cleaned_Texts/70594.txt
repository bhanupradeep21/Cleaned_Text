organism said sexually dimorphic male female conspecifics anatomical differences features body size coloration ornamentation disregarding differences reproductive organs sexual dimorphism usually product sexual selection female choice leading elaborate male ornamentation eg tails male peacocks malemale competition leading development competitive weaponry eg antlers male moose however evolutionary selection also acts sensory systems receivers use perceive external stimuli benefits perception one sex different sex differences sensory systems arise example female production signals used attract mates put selective pressure males improve ability detect signals result males species evolve specialized mechanisms aid detection female signal article uses examples sex differences auditory systems various organisms show sex differences sensory systems arise benefits one sex enhanced perception certain external stimuli case form sex difference reflects function serves terms enhanced reproductive success male sphinx moths manduca sexta rely female released sexpheromones guide typical zigzagging flight behaviors used locate although males females respond host plant olfactory cues locate food sources detection response sexpheromones appears male specific males better detecting female sexpheromones able find signaling females faster providing reproductive advantage since females gain advantage olfactory systems sensitive pheromones enhanced pheromone detection evolved olfactory system male sexta three main sex differences follows male antennae enlarged contain elongated sensilla sensory organules present pheromone elicits male response stimulating male specific receptor cells large number sensilla located antennal sexually dimorphic sensilla called male specific trichoid sensilla type hairlike olfactory contrast flagella female antennae lack trichoid sensilla projections make male antennae appear larger featherlike trichoid sensilla innervated two male specific olfactory receptor cells cell tuned sensitive one two major chemical components evolving larger pheromonespecific receptors peripheral olfactory system male sexta improved sensitivity female pheromones enhances mate detection also sex difference neural basis pheromone detection number insect species first order olfactory processing centers neuropil antennal lobe contain structure called macroglomerulus structure called macroglomerular complex species identified antennal lobe sexta discovered axons male specific olfactory receptor cells found trichoid sensilla project exclusively macroglomerular antennal lobe neurons respond sex pheromone also arborizations macroglomerular complex providing evidence plays key role processing pheromone sensory information lastly evidence male antennal lobe contains malespecific macroglomerular complex projection neurons relay pheromone information higher brain structures since males significantly larger populations medial group antennal lobe neurons thought extra neurons may belong malespecific kanzaki et al since characterized responses structures projection neurons found projection neurons dendritic arborizations macroglomerular complex ordinary glomeruli excited inhibited different stimuli pheromonal vs nonpheromonal stimuli selective response properties indicate specialized role relaying pheromone information likely malespecific features listed found levels primary detection neural processing sexta demonstrate males species evolved sex differences sensory system improve ability detect locate females sex differences visual system flies extremely common males generally possessing specialized eye flies family bibionidae display particularly notable dimorphism males possessing large dorsal eyes absent female eyes ventral eyes males similar however suggesting male dorsal eyes serve extra sex specific function research visually guided behavior flies suggests male dorsal eyes may specialized detection capture females great deal competition among work jochen zeil demonstrated dorsal eyes bibionids functionally adapted mate detection high speed female chases three main reasons firstly male dorsal eyes contain significantly longer rhabdomeres basic light sensing organelles ommatidia eyes times longer males found female eyes ventral eyes second enlarged retina prominent male dorsal eyes characterized larger facet diameters found male ventral female eyes meaning increase aperture area thirdly zeil able measure interommatidial angles illuminating fly heads light traveled antidromically rhabdomeres technique revealed male dorsal eyes smaller interommatidial angles different rhabdomere arrangements ventral female functional level increased aperture area longer rhabdomere length serve increase photon capture efficiency male dorsal also smaller ommatidial angles different rhabdomere arrangement observed dorsal eyes central function dorsal eye neural superposition eyes meaning neural pooling information neighboring ommatidia used enhance using model takes longer rhabdomeres larger facet diameters smaller ommatidial angles neural superposition account zeil shows dorsal eye males able detect small objects homogeneous background much greater distance ventral female optical properties longer rhabdomeres increased facet diameter smaller ommatidial angles also aid detection small objects increasing resolution six times ventral female eyes neural pooling resulting superposition taken greater sensitivity small light changes due longer rhabdomeres increased facet diameter combination ability detect females farther distances higher resolution allows male bibionid flies search females lower light levels greater portion day respond quickly presence female order catch initiate marriage capture occurs family unlike fly extreme dimorphism seen bibionids may particularly relevant species swarm landmark causing course females relatively olfactory example functional consequences sex differences bibionids linked sexspecific behavior sex differences play key adaptive role well known auditory systems anurans well adapted

co note males significantly lower frequencies increased sensitivity females qui note males co note explains difference behavioral responsiveness sex note call biologically relevant low mid frequency units thought derive amphibian papilla whereas high frequency units correspond basilar although difference found low frequency units sex differences mid high frequency unit response suggest may neural basis male co note selectivity amphibian papilla female qui note selectivity basilar papilla measuring values also found nerve fibers innervating basilar papilla males sharply tuned since qui note wideband signal sweeps upward frequency appears though fibers innervating female basilar papilla better suited detection component sharp tuning males decreases male selectivity qui note whereas
