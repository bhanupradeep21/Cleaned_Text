skin cancer neoplasia common type cancer diagnosed horses accounting cancers diagnosed sarcoids common type skin neoplasm common type cancer overall horses squamouscell carcinoma secondmost prevalent skin cancer followed squamouscell carcinoma melanoma usually occur horses greater sarcoids commonly affect horses years old surgical biopsy method choice diagnosis equine skin contraindicated cases prognosis treatment effectiveness varies based type cancer degree local tissue destruction evidence spread organs metastasis location tumor cancers metastasize cured mitigated surgical removal cancerous tissue use chemotherapeutic drugs sarcoids account equine cancers common cancer diagnosed breed predilection developing sarcoids occur age horses three six years common age group males slightly prone developing sarcoids also prevalent certain familial lines suggesting may heritable several studies found association presence bovine associated viral growth proteins skin cells sarcoid formation exact mechanism controls induces epidermal proliferation remains however high viral loads within cells strongly correlated severe clinical signs aggressive appearance number sarcoids vary horses single multiple lesions usually head legs ventrum genitalia around distribution pattern suggests flies important factor formation sarcoids may resemble warts verrucous form small nodules nodular form oval hairless scaly plaques occult form rarely large ulcerated masses fibroblastic form occult form usually presents skin around mouth eyes neck nodular verrucous sarcoids common groin penile sheath face fibroblastic sarcoids predilection legs groin eyelid sites previous multiple forms may also present individual horse mixed histologically sarcoids composed fibroblasts collagen producing cells invade proliferate within dermis sometimes subcutaneous tissue readily metastasize surgical biopsy definitively diagnose sarcoids significant risk making sarcoids worse therefore diagnosis based solely clinical signs fineneedle aspiration complete excisional biopsy safer sarcoids may spontaneously regress regardless treatment course duration disease highly unpredictable considered casebycase basis taking account cost treatment severity clinical surgical removal alone effective recurrence occurring cases removal often done conjunction topical treatment products containing bloodroot extract plant sanguinaria canadensis days reported effective removing small sarcoids salves caustic nature may cause pain sarcoid must area bandage freezing sarcoids liquid nitrogen another affordable method may result scarring topical application antimetabolite also obtained favorable results usually takes days repeated application effect injection small sarcoids usually around eyes chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin immunomodulator bcg also achieved one trial bcg effective treating nodular small fibroblastic sarcoids around eye repeatedly injected lesion injection cisplatin effective overall mostly horses nodular however bcg treatment carries risk allergic reaction cisplatin tendency leak sarcoids repeated external beam radiation also used small sarcoids often impractical cisplatin electrochemotherapy application electrical field sarcoid injection cisplatin horse general anesthesia used without prior surgery remove sarcoid nonrecurrence rate four years one retrospective chance sarcoid recurrence modalities even apparently successful sarcoids fatal large aggressive tumors destroy surrounding tissue cause discomfort loss function resistant treatment making euthanasia justifiable instances sarcoids may common skinrelated reason squamouscell carcinoma scc common cancer eye periorbital second common cancer overall accounting cancers

melanoma gray horses years estimated one survey camarguetype horses found overall population prevalence prevalence increasing horses years melanomas gray horses melanotic tumors horses darker haircoats may aggressive often one retrospective study cases sent referral hospital reported prevalence metastatic melanoma within study population however actual prevalence metastatic melanoma may lower due infrequent submission melanotic tumors common sites metastasis include lymph nodes liver spleen lung skeletal muscle blood vessels parotid salivary common sites melanotic tumors underside tail near base prepuce around mouth skin parotid gland near base tumors initially begin single small raised areas may multiply coalesce multilobed masses process called melanomatosis horses born acquire benign melanotic tumors called melanocytomas tumors often located legs trunk beneath tail older treatment small melanomas often necessary large tumors cause discomfort usually surgically removed cisplatin cryotherapy used treat small tumors less centimeters tumors may cimetidine histamine stimulator cause tumors regress horses may take months produce results multiple treatments may
