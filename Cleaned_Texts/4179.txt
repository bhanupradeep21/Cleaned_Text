hans joachim pabst von ohain december march german physicist engineer designer first turbojet engine power together frank whittle widely described coinventor turbojet hans von ohain still university student january whittle filed first patent turbojet engine von ohain stated biography interest jet propulsion began fall seventh semester göttingen university didnt know many people quickly caught whittle due support design axialflow engine opposed sir franks centrifugal flow engine eventually adopted manufacturers von ohain designed overall engine layout based compactness centrifugal impeller centrifugal radial compressor radial inflow ultimately configuration many shortcomings put production however aided enormous resources heinkel aircraft company developed version sufficient power august von ohain entered history designer worlds first gas turbine power aircraft von ohain stayed centrifugal designs contributing research heinkels projects combined centrifugalaxial ultimately none designs put production competing german designers junkers bmw following axial design layout saw engines production although never solved basic power durability problems von ohain nevertheless started worlds first jet engine industry homeland germany many prototypes series productions built till von ohain entered turbojet design time later whittle began working first turbojet engine designs period whittle building wu engine britain turbojet designs said example simultaneous however von ohain explains biography patent preparedand begun construction engine lawyer gave copy whittles patent read critiqued result forced modify application infringe whittles core ohains first jet engine heinkel hes described hydrogen test engine run march early april according ohain although ernst heinkels diaries record september work hydrogen test engine continued engine required modifications cure overtemperature problems fit fuel system enable run selfcontained liquid fuel achieved september heavy backing heinkel ohains jet engine first power aircraft heinkel aircraft followed whittles engine within gloster turbojet powered fighter aircraft germany britain entered operational use virtually simultaneously july july gloster meteor july first operational fighter jet saw flight combat hundreds machines dozen meteors saw limited action war two men met became friends received charles stark draper prize engineering independent development turbojet born dessau ohain earned phd physics thesis optical microphone record sound directly film university one major centers aeronautical research attended lectures ludwig still student conceived called engine require receiving second degree physics ohain became junior assistant robert wichard pohl director physical institute university working pohl ohain registered patent version jet engine process apparatus producing airstreams propelling unlike frank whittles power jets wu design axial flow turbine ohain used radial inflow turbine go centrifugal compressor placing backtoback annular combustion space wrapped around rotor working university ohain used take sports car serviced local garage bartles becker met automotive mechanic max hahn eventually arranged build demonstration model engine completed model larger diameter whittles fully working engine although much shorter ohain took model university testing ran problems combustion petrol fuel took place mostly turbine sending flames shooting exhaust duct lack combustion turbine contributed engine unable run without assistance electric motor subsequently overheated according von ohain interest jet engines began found elegance flying spoiled enormous vibrations noise piston enginepropeller combination came conclusion constant work process ie constant compression combustion expansion would great advantages thus chose quite simple engine radial compressor radial turbine however model max hahn built tested courtyard institute showed combustion chamber needed development consequence pohl von ohain decided approach heinkel someone doesnt back away new february pohl wrote ernst heinkel telling ohains design possibilities heinkel arranged meeting engineers ohain argued current garage engine would never work concept upon based sound engineers convinced april ohain hahn began working marienehe airfield outside rostock warnemuende working engineer gundermann hahn special development von ohain states pressure aiming bring combustion chamber unknown endurance flight readiness came upon idea separating turbine problem combustion chamber problem using hydrogen fuel physicist knew course diffusion combustion speed gaseous hydrogen substantially greater study models airflow resulted several improvements twomonth period encouraged findings ohain produced new prototype would run hydrogen gas supplied external pressurised source resulting heinkelstrahltriebwerk hes german heinkel jet engine built handpicking best machinists company much chagrin shopfloor supervisors hahn meanwhile worked combustion problem area experience engine extremely simple made largely sheet metal construction blacksmith village started late summer completed march two weeks later engine running hydrogen high temperature exhaust led considerable burning metal tests otherwise successful september combustor replaced engine run gasoline first time running gasoline caused combustor clog although engine never intended flightquality design proved beyond doubt basic concept workable ohain last caught whittle vastly funding industry support ohain would soon overtake whittle forge ahead long claimed ohain unaware whittles work strict sense may true unaware whittles experiments lutterworth raf engineer ran worlds first jet engine april nevertheless ohain given copy whittles patents lawyer patent application prepared begun construction engine biography ohain frankly critiqued whittles saw whittles patent almost convinced something boundary layer suction combinations twoflow dual entrance flow radial flow compressor looked monstrous engine point view flow reversal looked us undesirable thing turned wasnt bad although gave minor instability problems patent claims narrowed comparison whittles whittle showed certain things somewhat understandably justified knowledge whittles work saying felt looked like patent idea thought seriously worked february turbine section running test stand according von ohain working machine capable powering aircraft forerunner intended put combustion chamber compressor turbine done hydrogen unit hahn suggested putting ahead excellent idea turbine test flown erich warsitz walter künzel heinkel providing additional throttled thrust conventional work hes continued pohlohain team already moved design flightquality engine hes major differences use machined compressor turbine stages replacing bent folded sheet metal rearrangement layout reduce crosssectional area engine placing annular combustor extended gap compressor turbine original turbine small work efficiently beginning fitted airframe standing display roggentin july yet turbine still powerful enough flight according von ohain experimented various combinations modify compressor diffuser turbine nozzle vanes increase thrust sufficiently qualify aircraft first flight demonstration found small diffuser behind engine collar splitter divert flows functioned better high speed flow entire tube final result changes new design hes lengthened combustor placing forward part front compressor outer rim small original hes design nevertheless fairly compact first ran july references say may airtested heinkel dive bomber prototype original engine soon burned second one nearing completion time new test airframe heinkel first flew august first jetpowered aircraft fly test pilot erich warsitz heinkel applied may patent espacenet original document aircraft power plant inventor max hahn first application patent germany may work started immediately larger versions first hes simply larger hes new design known hes rearranged overall layout compressor turbine connected largediameter drum longenough fit annular combustion chamber intended install engine heinkel fighter airframe development progressed much smoothly engine used gliding tests work engine continued flightquality hes installed late march followed first flight april three days later aircraft demonstrated party nazi rlm officials impressed full development funds soon followed point number turbojet developments taking place germany heinkel impressed concept arranged transfer project adolph müller junkers developing axial compressorpowered design renamed heinkel hes müller left junkers purchased junkers motoren company project way time known junkers jumo meanwhile bmw making good progress design bmw early hes officially hes still progressing well meanwhile müllers hes officially hes developing much quickly engines still time ready production however appeared ready go early director jet development rlm helmut schelp refused funding designs ordered heinkel work new pet project eventually becoming heinkel hes although first schelps class ii engines start working well production still started war ended work continued hes time eventually abandoned spring part challenge von ohain approach designing practical turbojet could developed primary design comprised centrifugal compressor radial inflow turbine design proved impractical result despite much effort never put production comparison whittles centrifugal flow engines straightthrough reverse flow configuration developed rolls royce powered allied world war ii jets majority immediate postwar fighters built licence numerous countries including australia france us copied russians chinese power whittles basic reverse flow design remains common gas turbine configuration production today built form allison rr pratt whitney series ohain brought united states operation paperclip went work united states air force wrightpatterson air force made director air force aeronautical research laboratory chief scientist aero propulsion laboratory work wrightpatterson ohain continued personal work various topics early fair amount work design gas core reactor rockets would retain nuclear fuel allowing working mass used exhaust engineering needed role also used variety earth purposes including centrifuges pumps ohain would later use basic massflow techniques designs create fascinating jet engine moving airflow engine created stable vortex acted compressor turbine interest massflow led ohain research magnetohydrodynamics mhd power noting hot gases coalfired plant could used extract power speed exiting combustion chamber remaining hot enough power conventional steam turbine thus mhd generator could extract power coal lead greater efficiencies unfortunately design proven difficult build due lack proper materials namely hightemperature nonmagnetic materials also able withstand chemically active exhaust ohain also investigated power related also idea jet wing air compressor jet engine bled large augmented vents wings provide lift vtol aircraft small amount highpressure air blown venturi turn sucks much larger volume air along thus leading thrust augmentation concept used rockwell experimental aircraft although market interest vtol aircraft shortlived participated several ohain influence shifting mind paul bevilaqua one students wpafb math later enabled bevilaqua invent rollsroyce liftsystem jsf stovl school learned move pieces hans taught play ohain also
