parasitic worms eg nematodes cells harbouring pathogenic diseasecausing viruses bean plant hosting mutualistic helpful nitrogenfixing bacteria specifically botany host plant supplies food resources micropredators evolutionarily stable relationship hosts similar ectoparasitism host range collection hosts organism use partner symbiosis spans wide variety possible relationships organisms differing permanence effects two parties one partners association much larger generally known parasitism parasite benefits hosts commensalism two live together without harming mutualism parties parasites parasitic part life cycle comparing parasites closest freeliving relatives parasitism shown evolved least separate occasions organisms live close association host become parasitic environmental conditions parasite may longterm relationship host case endoparasites guest seeks host obtains food another service usually kill contrast parasitoid spends large part life within single host ultimately causing hosts death strategies involved verging predation generally host kept alive parasitoid fully grown ready pass next life guests relationship host may intermittent temporary perhaps associated multiple hosts making relationship equivalent herbivory wildliving animal another possibility relationship may permanent physical contact brood parasitism parasites follow wide variety evolutionary strategies placing hosts equally wide range parasitism implies coevolution including maintenance gene polymorphisms host tradeoff advantage resistance parasite cost disease caused always easy even possible identify host definitive secondary life cycles many parasites well understood subjectively economically important organism may initially designated incorrectly primary mislabelling may continue even error becomes known example trout salmon sometimes said primary hosts salmonid whirling disease even though myxosporean parasite reproduces sexually inside sludge host harbors different parasites phases different sites within body host intermediate definitive example trichinosis disease caused roundworms host immature juveniles muscles reproductive adults digestive micropredation evolutionarily stable strategy within parasitism small predator lives parasitically much larger host plant eating parts range plants herbivorous insect feeds known host range wide narrow never includes plants small number insects monophagous feeding single plant silkworm larva one mulberry leaves food consumed often insect limited host range oligophagous restricted closely related species usually plant diamondback moth example feeding exclusively larva potato tuber moth feeds potatoes tomatoes tobacco members plant family herbivorous insects wide range hosts various different plant families known polyphagous one example buff ermine moth whose larvae feed alder mint plantain oak rhubarb currant blackberry dock ragwort nettle plants often produce toxic unpalatable secondary metabolites deter herbivores feeding monophagous insects developed specific adaptations overcome specialist hosts giving advantage polyphagous species however puts greater risk extinction chosen hosts suffer setbacks monophagous species able feed tender young foliage high concentrations damaging chemicals polyphagous species feed make older leaves trade offspring quality quantity specialist maximises chances young thriving paying great attention choice host generalist produces larger numbers eggs suboptimal insect micropredators migrate regularly one host another

existing strains thereby producing new viral strain influenza vaccine produced existing viral strain might effective new strain requires new influenza vaccine prepared protection human hosts

leguminous plants certain nitrogenfixing bacteria called rhizobia form nodules roots plant host supplies bacteria energy needed nitrogen fixation bacteria provide much nitrogen needed host crops beans

use smaller animals clean parasites cleaners include fish shrimps birds hosts clients include much wider range fish marine reptiles including turtles iguanas octopus whales terrestrial host appears benefit interaction biologists disputed whether truly mutualistic relationship something closer parasitism remoras also called suckerfish swim freely evolved suckers enable adhere smooth surfaces
