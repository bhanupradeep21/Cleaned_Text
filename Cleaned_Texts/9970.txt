beta hairpin sometimes also called betaribbon betabeta unit simple protein structural motif involving two beta strands look like hairpin motif consists two strands adjacent primary structure oriented antiparallel direction nterminus one sheet adjacent cterminus next linked short loop two five amino acids beta hairpins occur isolation part series hydrogen bonded strands collectively comprise beta sheet researchers francisco blanco et al used protein nmr show betahairpins formed isolated short peptides aqueous solution suggesting hairpins could form nucleation sites protein beta hairpins originally categorized solely number amino acid residues loop sequences named oneresidue tworesidue system however somewhat ambiguous take account whether residues signal end hairpin singly doubly
