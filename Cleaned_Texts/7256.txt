pagets disease bone commonly known pagets disease historically osteitis deformans condition involving cellular remodeling deformity one bones affected bones show signs dysregulated bone remodeling microscopic level specifically excessive bone breakdown subsequent disorganized new bone structural changes cause bone weaken may result deformity pain fracture arthritis associated exact cause unknown although leading theories indicate genetic acquired factors see causes pagets disease may affect one several bones body commonly pelvis tibia femur lumbar vertebrae skull never entire spread bone rarely bone affected pagets disease transform malignant bone cancer disease often affects people differently treatments pagets disease vary although cure pagets disease medications bisphosphonates calcitonin help control disorder lessen pain symptoms medications often successful controlling disorder especially started complications begin pagets disease affects percent population

despite marked differences several treatments pagets disease also used treat osteoporosis pagets disease may caused slow virus infection ie paramyxoviridae present many years symptoms appear associated viral infections include respiratory syncytial canine distemper measles however recent evidence cast doubt upon measles laboratory contamination may played role past studies linking
