transcription translation negative feedback model involving timeless clock also konopka steven wells reported abnormality morphology neurosecretory cell group associated arrhythmic mutation arrhythmic mutants another fly strain drosophila pseudoobscura cell group normally consists four clustered cells either side brain roughly halfway top bottom edge posterior area brain cells cluster occasionally located abnormally near top edge rather middle brain rate cells wildtype melanogaster mutation significantly increases percentage abnormally located cells two aperiodic strains pseudoobscura percentages abnormally located cells likewise significantly increased wild type konopka inferred results neurosecretory cells may part drosophila circadian system per gene product may influence development konopka worked alfred handler discover nature behind pacemaker signalling transplanting brains donor flies abdomens arrhythmic host flies found circadian rhythms host flies restored period donor example short period pers adult brains implanted abdomens arrhythmic hosts could confer short period rhythm activity hosts least since transplanted brains unable create new neuronal connections locomotor activity centers konopka handler concluded pacemaker signalling locomotion must humoral clarkson college konopka continued work orr also collaborated chronobiologist colin pittendrigh
