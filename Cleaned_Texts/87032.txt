chimney sweeps cancer also called soot wart squamous cell carcinoma skin scrotum distinction first reported form occupational cancer initially identified percivall pott initially noticed prevalent amongst chimney sweeps disease also seen men exposed mineral oil worked coal cancer also referred epidermoid carcinoma scrotum epithelioma housing tax created century england limited number fireplaces per avoid tax several chimney pipes would connected single fireplace resulting angled odd chimney structures resulted complex mechanical cleaning result uncommon young boys hired chimney sweeps england typically hired orphans children poor young children ages often hired ability fit narrow chimney chutes chimney sweeps carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin scrotum chimney sweeps carcinoma first described percivall pott postulated cancer associated occupational exposure cancer primarily affected chimney sweeps contact soot since early childhood median age onset symptoms one review years although boys young years old found proposed wg spencer sweat running bodies caused soot accumulate rugae inferior surfaces scrotum resulting chronic irritation causing scrotal shown incorrect artifact method used stain microscope rd passey research physician guys hospital london produced malignant skin tumors mice exposed extract made soot demonstrating presence carcinogenic substances soot likely cause cancer scrotum chimney ernest kennaway james cook research institute cancer hospital london later known royal marsden hospital discovered several polycyclic hydrocarbons present soot potent carcinogens benzoαpyrene dna consists sequences four bases guanine adenine cytosine thymine bound deoxyribonucleic backbone forming four deoxyribonucleosides deoxyguanosine etc benzoαpyrene interacts deoxyguanosine dna damaging potentially starting processes lead initial lesion small painless often described itchy sore wart pimple often times may bleed due chimney sweeping common practice across europe north disease mostly found united kingdom climbing boys used likely reason high prevalence disease united kingdom chimney chutes another reason attributed hygiene standards century time hygiene standards lacking bathing year families often shared sleeping blankets blankets often ones used chimney sweeper collect soot resulting repeated soot also uncommon children work naked lack hygiene standards coupled working naked allowed repeated skin exposure toxins chimney soot possible cause first chimney sweepers act protect child workers passed act stated minimum working age years two societies formed protect children chimney sweeping british parliament passed act better regulation chimney sweepers apprentices act safer construction chimneys flues response child labor exploitation law forbade children years old acts also required improvements made chimney soon law changed minimum age years new law also suggested work chimney sweeping act parliament forbade practice climbing boys also used european lord shaftesbury philanthropist led later campaign however laws typically ignored due lack enforcement childrens employment commission evaluated child employment ensure acts set place report showed child employment increased since introduction act changing minimum working age victor hugo influenced social injustice witnessed based character novel les misérables injustices young boys chimney sweeping industry faced character cosette criticized child exploitation united states enslaved black children hired owners used way still climbing sir percivall pott january december london england english surgeon one founders orthopedy first scientist demonstrate cancer may caused environmental carcinogen elected master company surgeons forerunner royal college surgeons pott found association exposure soot high incidence chimney sweeps carcinoma scrotal cancer later found squamous cell carcinoma chimney sweeps first occupational link cancer pott first person demonstrate malignancy could caused environmental carcinogen potts early investigations contributed science epidemiology chimney sweepers act pott describes chimney sweeps carcinoma thus disease always makes first attack inferior part scrotum produces superficial painful ragged illlooking sore hard rising edgesin great length time pervades skin dartos membranes scrotum seizes testicle inlarges sic hardens renders truly thoroughly distempered whence makes way spermatic process comments life boys fate people seems peculiarly hard treated great brutality thrust narrow sometimes hot chimnies sic bruised burned almost suffocated get puberty become liable noisome painful fatal disease suspected carcinogen coal tar possibly diagnosis biopsy scrotal several different tests involved staging including mri scrotum abdominopelviscrotal ray whitmore proposed staging system based level commonly used system four stages cancer listed stage stage stage two substages stage stage stage disease localized stage disease moves surrounding areas including penis testis pubic bone stage b disease metastasizes point disease cancer andor tumor stage c disease metastasizes however point longer distant metastasis occurs stage disease point moves past regional nodes chimney sweeps carcinoma prognosis depends heavily upon presence absence nodal removing tumor initial surgery leading factor survival rate based upon nodal involvement approximate survival rate cases inguinal nodes survival rate iliac nodes treatment specifically wide excision also recommended surrounding subcutaneous tissue removed tumor scrotal contents usually removed involved radiation therapy chemotherapy also considered treat chimney sweeps incidence chimney sweeps carcinoma reduced protective work clothes law act outlined appropriate work improved personal hygiene also helped lowering incidence decades later noticed occur amongst gas plant oil shale workers later found certain constituents tar soot oils known polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found cause cancer laboratory animals related cancer called mule spinners cancer
