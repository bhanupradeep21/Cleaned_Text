cauda equina syndrome ces condition occurs bundle nerves end spinal cord known cauda equina signs symptoms include low back pain pain radiates leg numbness around anus loss bowel bladder onset may rapid cause usually disc herniation lower region causes include spinal stenosis cancer trauma epidural abscess epidural diagnosis suspected based symptoms confirmed medical imaging mri ct ces generally treated surgically via sudden onset regarded medical emergency requiring prompt surgical decompression delay causing permanent loss permanent bladder problems sexual dysfunction numbness may occur despite poor outcome occurs people despite people affected every first described signs symptoms cauda equina syndrome include severe back pain saddle anesthesia urinary fecal incontinence sexual dysfunction considered red flags ie features require urgent conus medullaris near lumbar vertebral levels occasionally lower spinal canal contains bundle nerve fibers cauda equina horsetail branches lower end spinal cord contains nerve roots nerve roots join sacral plexus affects sciatic nerve travels caudally toward feet compression trauma damage region spinal canal result cauda equina syndromecitation needed symptoms may also appear temporary sideeffect sacral extradural direct trauma also cause cauda equina syndrome common causes include complication lumbar punctures burst fractures resulting posterior migration fragments vertebral body severe disc herniations spinal anaesthesia involving trauma catheters high local anaesthetic concentrations around cauda equina penetrating trauma knife wounds ballistic cauda equina syndrome may also caused blunt trauma suffered event car accident ces caused lumbar spinal stenosis diameter spinal canal narrows could result degenerative process spine osteoarthritis developmental defect present birth severe cases spondylolisthesis cauda equina syndrome chronic spinal inflammatory conditions paget disease neurosarcoidosis chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ankylosing spondylitis rheumatoid disease spine chronic tuberculosis cause due spinal canal narrowing kinds syndromes individuals risk disc herniation likely develop ces race little influence notable exception african americans appear slightly less likely develop ces middle age also appears notable risk factor populations likely develop herniated disc heavy lifting also inferred risk factor risk factors include obesity diagnosis first suspected clinically based history physical exam usually confirmed mri scan ct scan depending bladder scanning loss catheter sensation also used evaluate bladder dysfunction suspected cases cauda equina syndrome aid diagnosis mri scanningcitation needed early surgery acute onset severe cases reported early diagnosis cauda equina syndrome allow preventive treatment signs allow early diagnosis include changes bowel bladder function loss feeling changes sensation start pins needles leading numbness changes bladder function may changes stream inability fully empty bladder person progresses full retention intervention less likely successfulcitation needed management true cauda equina syndrome frequently involves surgical decompression cauda equina syndrome caused herniated disk early surgical decompression sudden onset cauda equina syndrome regarded medicalsurgical surgical decompression means laminectomy approaches may undertaken within hours symptoms developing compressive lesion eg ruptured disc epidural abscess tumor hematoma demonstrated early treatment may significantly improve chance longterm neurological damage surgery may required remove blood bone fragments tumor tumors herniated disc abnormal bone growth tumor removed surgically malignant radiotherapy may used alternative relieve pressure chemotherapy also used spinal neoplasms syndrome due inflammatory condition eg ankylosing spondylitis antiinflammatory including steroids used effective treatment bacterial infection cause appropriate course antibiotics used treat cauda equina syndrome occur pregnancy due lumbar disc herniation risk cauda equina syndrome pregnancy increases age mother surgery still performed pregnancy adversely affect treatment treatment cauda equina carried time lifestyle issues may need addressed posttreatment issues could include persons need physiotherapy occupational therapy due lower limb dysfunction obesity might also need rehabilitation ces depends severity injury permanent damage occurs impairment bladder bowel control may surgery performed resting required bladder bowel dysfunction assessed urinary catheterization may help bladder control gravity exercise help control bowel movement hodges pelvic floor exercises assist controlling bowel movements pelvic floor exercises citation needed exercises done standing lying fours knees slightly separated full recovery bowel bladder control take long two yearscitation needed prognosis complete recovery dependent upon many factors important severity duration compression upon damaged nerves generally longer time intervention remove compression causing nerve damage greater damage caused nervescitation needed damage severe nerve regrowth impossible nerve damage permanent cases nerve damaged still capable regrowth recovery time widely variable surgical intervention decompression cauda equina assist recovery delayed severe nerve damage mean several years recovery time nerve growth exceptionally slowcitation needed review literature indicates around patients urinary retention cesr presentation incomplete

etiologies ces include fractures abscesses hematomas compression relevant nerve injuries thoracolumbar spine necessarily result clinical diagnosis ces cases necessary consider epidemiological studies ces done united states owing difficulties amassing sufficient cases well defining affected population therefore area deserving additional traumatic spinal cord injuries occur approximately people per million annually united states resulting traumas due motor vehicle accidents sporting injuries falls estimated vertebral fractures result injury spinal thorough physical examinations required trauma patients fractures initially go frequent injuries thoracolumbar region conus medullaris cauda equina particularly two syndromes ces ces mainly affects middleaged individuals particularly forties
