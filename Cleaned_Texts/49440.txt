transfusion medicine transfusionassociated circulatory overload aka taco transfusion reaction adverse effect blood transfusion resulting signs symptoms excess fluid circulatory system hypervolemia within hours symptoms taco include shortness breath dyspnea low blood oxygen levels hypoxemia leg swelling peripheral edema high blood pressure hypertension high heart rate occur due rapid transfusion large volume blood also occur single red blood cell transfusion often confused transfusionrelated acute lung injury trali another transfusion reaction difference taco trali trali results symptoms respiratory distress taco present either signs respiratory distress peripheral leg swelling risk factors taco diseases increase amount fluid person including liver heart kidney failure well conditions require many transfusions high low extremes age risk factor management taco includes immediate discontinuation transfusion supplemental oxygen needed medication remove excess primary symptoms taco signs respiratory distress shortness breath low oxygen levels blood along signs excess fluid within circulatory system leg swelling high blood pressure elevated heart physical exam patients may present crackles listening lungs murmur murmur listening heart leg swelling distended veins neck jugular venous risk factors promote development taco include conditions predispose individuals excess fluid circulatory system liver failure causing low levels protein blood heart renal nephrotic conditions place increased stress respiratory system lung conditions necessitating large volume transfusions severe age also found risk factor individuals less years old years old increased addition risk taco increases number units blood products transfused table shows volume transfused blood product multiple blood products blood products larger volumes increase risk national healthcare safety safety network division centers disease control prevention cdc released updated criteria table patients diagnosed taco least following two characteristics within hours transfusion ended along taco categorized taco transfusionrelated acute lung injury trali complications following transfusion result respiratory taco trali often difficult distinguish acute situationcitation needed assessing fluid status key differentiating two taco patient always positive fluid balance often present hypertension jugular venous distension elevated bnp peripheral edema respond well diuretics contrast trali associated fluid overload patient may positive even net fluid balance patients trali often present hypotension signs rightheart fluid overload normal bnp lack clinical improvement response causes edema promote volumeoverloaded state predispose individuals taco include heart failure renal insufficiency nephrotic syndrome cirrhosis chronic venous development taco thought due first hit state patient second hit blood transfusion patient may receiving blood due number causes may heart kidney dysfunction lead excess fluid upon transfusion blood product patient overwhelmed excess fluid develops symptoms related volume overloadcitation needed clinical symptoms taco due excess fluid within circulatory system result increased pressure within circulatory system resulting fluid moving surrounding lungs extra fluid accumulates air sacs within lung causing difficulties oxygen getting blood results low blood oxygen levels shortness breath arms legs fluid accumulates tissues causing swelling prominent legs due effects gravity conditions predispose increased hydrostatic pressure heart failure renal insufficiency decreased oncotic pressure liver failure malnutrition nephrotic syndrome places individuals increased risk tacocitation needed transfusion associated circulatory overload prevented avoiding unnecessary transfusions following strict criteria necessitating blood transfusion closely monitoring patients receiving transfusions transfusing smaller volumes blood slower rate blood products typically transfused mlkg per hour reduced mlkg per hour individuals increased risk patients susceptible volume overload eg renal insufficiency heart failure may pretreated diuretic either immediately following transfusion reduce overall net fluid taco suspected transfusion stopped immediately patient sat upright prevent fluid backing lungs treatment twofold respiratory support removal excess patients respiratory distress andor hypoxemia given supplemental oxygen ventilatory support noninvasive mechanical ventilation needed remove excess fluid patients given diuretic therapy urine output closely monitored quantitate amount removed reported incidence taco difficult determine many cases may undetected incidence estimated individuals receiving transfusion hospitalized patients increased taco commonly reported cause transfusionrelated death major morbidity second common cause death pulmonary edema result circulatory overload following transfusion reported early however term transfusion associated circulatory overload coined seen separate complication following blood httpsenwikipediaorgwikitransfusionassociatedcirculatoryoverload
