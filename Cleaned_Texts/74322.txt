james jim william truman american chronobiologist known seminal research circadian rhythms silkmoth saturniidae eclosion particularly restoration rhythm phase following brain transplantation professor emeritus university washington former senior fellow howard hughes medical institution janelia research truman introduced biological research undergraduate university notre dame laboratory george b craig intrigued craigs discoveries relating hormonal regulation mosquito mating graduate student continued study hormonal control insect behavior harvard university received phd doctoral advisor lynn riddiford later married began research chronobiology junior fellow harvard university continued work established laboratory university truman took three sabbaticals university first cambridge university studied drosophila neurobiology mike bate second half sabbatical traveled kenya spent time researching tsetse fly development second sabbatical truman traveled australian national university canberra australia research grasshopper metamorphosis hormones eldon ball final sabbatical returned cambridge university study evolutionary developmental biology michael akam years university washington truman retired university order study insect neuronal stem cells group leader howard hughes medical institutes janelia research campus ashburn retired howard hughes medical institute returned university washington pursue research friday harbor laboratories current research focuses development evolution insect crustacean nervous still graduate school harvard truman identified insect neurohormone known eclosion hormone mediates moth demonstrated injecting eclosion hormone eh moths elicits stereotyped sequence ecdysis future studies silkmoth eclosion truman went confirm role eh mediating ecdysis later studies also implicated brainbased circadian clock regulator controlling release eh junior fellow harvard society truman studied underlying mechanisms silkmoth eclosion mainly focusing role circadian clock driving time day rhythms eclosion truman demonstrated eclosion rhythms persist hyalophora cecropia moths compound eyes corpora cardiaca corpora allata surgically eclosion rhythms abolished removal brain indicating circadian clock located within experiments involving brain transplantation selective illumination different parts body revealed circadian photoreceptors responsible receiving light information entrain circadian clock also located brain brain transplant experiments hyalophora cecropia antheraea pernyi showed entrained freerunning eclosion rhythms rescued debrained moths brains transplanted restored eclosion rhythms debrained moths matched phase angle eclosion rhythms observed donor moths prior brain transplantation results confirmed trumans previous findings circadian clock located within brain factor mediating eclosion behavior hormonal similar experiments focusing role circadian clock regulating flight rhythms confirmed extraretinal photoreceptors brain responsible entraining brainbased circadian truman went discover eclosion rhythms mediated circadian release neurohormone eh chronobiology masking refers apparent coupling observable biological rhythm external environmental time cue without affecting underlying circadian clock mediates observed rhythm truman colleagues observed increased eclosion adult drosophila flies immediately following lightson signal lead subsequent discovery light triggers rapid eclosion drosophila condition prior eh release occurs convergence parallel neurosecretory pathways activated eh two eh activated pathways oppose one excitatory behavioral pathway one inhibitory truman colleagues found presence light result inhibition inhibitory pathway leading greater net effect excitatory pathway lightmediated response promotes rapid drosophila eclosion result masks circadian eclosion rhythms work drosophila resulted finding masking circadian eclosion rhythms also occur inhibition eclosion truman colleagues found expression light chain tetanus toxin uastnt affect release eh eh releasing cells fly inhibition eh release results inhibition another way mask circadian eclosion drosophila trumans influential work outside chronobiology involves hormones alter nervous system influence behavior insect models notably truman colleagues studied neuronal remodeling insect metamorphosis model organism hornworm moth manduca sexta chosen wellstudied endocrinology large size allows use standard electrophysiological neuroanatomical truman found accompanying bodily changes hornworm moth extensive reorganization moths central nervous system cns among many changes finding upon onset metamorphosis vast cell death sweeps nests larvae end larval life nest cells previously arrested state metamorphosisinduced cell death surviving nest cells differentiate cells become functional adult cns neurons following interest evolution metamorphosis truman began conducting research evolution insect nervous system janelia research campus working drosophila model systems corroborated findings work manduca sexta discovered adult insect cns develops metamorphosis neuronal stem cells neuroblasts differentiate based specific highly conserved lineages also identified peripheral nervous system motor neurons develop embryonic stage partially remodeled furthermore truman colleagues identified neuroblasts ventral nerve cord originate specific neuronal lineages extending different regions insect body neuroblasts characterized position size manner currently truman colleagues
