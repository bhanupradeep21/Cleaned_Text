embryomics identification characterization study diverse cell types arise embryogenesis especially relates location developmental history cells embryo cell type may determined according several criteria location developing embryo gene expression indicated protein nucleic acid markers surface antigens also position embryogenic tree many cell markers useful distinguishing classifying separating purifying numerous cell types present given time developing organism cell markers consist select rnas proteins present inside surface antigens present surface cells making embryo given cell type rna protein markers reflect genes characteristically active cell type catalog cell types characteristic markers known organisms embryomecitation needed word portmanteau embryo genome embryome may also refer totality physical cell markers embryo develops fertilized egg single egg cell splits many cells grow number migrate appropriate locations inside embryo appropriate times development embryos cells grow number migrate also differentiate increasing number different cell types ultimately turning stable specialized cell types characteristic adult organism cells embryo contains genome characteristic level activity many thousands genes make complete genome varies determines particular cells type eg neuron bone cell skin cell muscle cell etc embryo development embryogenesis many cell types present present adult organism temporary cells called progenitor cells intermediate cell types disappear embryogenesis turning progenitor cells mature adult somatic cell types disappear due programmed cell death apoptosis entire process embryogenesis described aid two maps embryo map temporal sequence images developing embryo showing location cells many cell types present embryo given

present developing embryo placing tree proper branch unknown number probably thousands distinct cell types present developing embryo including progenitor cell lines temporarily present disappear either differentiating permanent somatic cell types make tissues infants body birth progenitor cell lines undergoing programmed cell death process known apoptosis cell type defined genes characteristically active cell type particular gene cells genome codes production particular protein gene turned active protein coded gene produced present somewhere cell production particular protein involves production particular mrna messenger rna sequence intermediate step protein synthesis mrna produced copying process called transcription dna cells nucleus mrna produced travels nucleus cytoplasm encounters latches onto ribosomes stuck cytoplasmic side endoplasmic reticulum attachment mrna strand ribosome initiates production protein coded mrna strand therefore profile active genes

detecting measuring type amount specific protein rna molecules present cells addition mapping tree embryogenesis involves assigning specific identifiable cell type particular branch place tree
