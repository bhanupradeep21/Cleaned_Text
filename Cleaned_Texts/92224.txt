considered probiotic friendly bacteria animals least one strain applied treat urogenital infections strains lactobacilli formerly mistakenly classified l fermentum since reclassified limosilactobacillus commercialized strains l fermentum used probiotics include limosilactobacillus fermentum belongs genus limosilactobacillus species genus heterofermentative adapted intestinal tract vertebrates also used wide variety applications including food feed fermentation l fermentum differs species genus nomadic lifestyle stable member human animal intestinal found strains l fermentum natural resistances certain antibiotics chemotherapeutics considered potential vectors antibiotic resistance genes environment humans animals strains l fermentum associated cholesterol microorganism considered probiotic meeting certain characteristics human origin nonpathogenic high resistance passing intestine beneficial immune system general seen beneficial hosts body human health l fermentum identified potential use gut microbes probiotics food aimed towards preventing treating various health problems among health problems allergies neoplastic growth inflammatory bowel disease included recent areas study focused influence probiotics metabolic functions host one area metabolism cholesterol labs acting probiotics research shown lactobacilli proven remove cholesterol vitro various ways assimilation binding surface cells incorporation cellular testing l fermentum different ph concentration solutions revealed strong ph tolerance ability grow survive hours incubated level solution strains l fermentum also tested different bile concentrations demonstrated good bile tolerance incubated g bile salt l fermentum found survive conditions supporting idea act one ways l fermentum seen probiotic ability reduce cholesterol levels tests conducted using several lactobacilli cholesterol broths demonstrated l fermentum largest removal cholesterol one mechanisms l fermentum may remove cholesterol vivo absorption cholesterol result accelerates cholesterol metabolism another method incorporation cholesterol host body cell membrane walls would also increase resistance bacterial cell membranes environmental challenge third mechanism causing body consume cholesterol l fermentum would interfere recycling bile salt facilitate elimination result would increase demand bile salt made strain l fermentum recently discovered identified antimicrobial antioxidative probiotic strain l fermentum discovered analysis human fecal samples one important characteristics probiotic microbe tolerance conditions digestive tract tests conducted strain different bile concentrations found able survive without large loss numbers also found l fermentum tolerance survive drops ph levels withstand drop values without decreasing numbers characteristics tolerance bile concentrations ph levels serve classify limosilactobacillus fermentum also found capability suppress mainly gramnegative bacteria lesser extent also observed able suppress enterococci staphylococcus aureus would serve beneficial purpose host several antimicrobial characteristics include acetic lactic succinic acids research antioxidant properties strain soft cheese products revealed prevented experimentation also conducted consumption strain consumption positive influence microbiota gut volunteers given goat milk fermented strain capsulated three weeks analysis fecal samples revealed strain increased number beneficial lactobacilli comparison given nonfermented several human clinical studies performed

transferable resistant genes order l fermentum considered potential probiotic must contain transferable antibiotic resistance genes resistance gene transferable could lessen effect use antibiotics ten common antibiotic genes tested gatamicin cefazolin penicillin trimethoprimsulfmethoxazole ampicillin carbenicillin erythromycin amikacin chloramphenicol norfloxacin l fermentum found resistant amikacin norfloxacincitation needed others studies reported labs also resistant antibiotics led conclusion common characteristic labs resistance antibiotics considered natural intrinsic far observed l fermentum strains observed transferable resistance acquired resistance experiments conducted introducing strain l fermentum dairy products probiotic ingredient revealed able suppress reputed contaminants food pathogenic salmonella spp shigella spp urinary tract infections caused e coli staphylococcus spp also introduction l fermentum strains goat milk revealed actually favorable host resulting increase number beneficial although labs associated potential health advantages also responsible negative outcomes main organisms involved spoilage tomato products lactobacilli identified causative organisms research carried observe chemical constituents tomato juice stimulate growth bacteria responsible spoilage bacteria resist high temperatures strain l fermentum extracted tomato juice concentrate meanwhile eight different tomato juice mixtures heated survival rate l fermentum measured concluded pectins main tomato juice constituents protect bacteria cells destruction heating breakdown pectin enzymic action would make bacteria cells susceptible heat however found previous research heating inactivated natural pectolytic enzymes therefore l fermentum remained heat resistant heat resistance also found correlate medium bacteria cultured better medium used result higher resistance studies shown l fermentum antibiotic resistances l fermentum inherently vancomycin resistant lactobacillaceae exception species genera lactobacillus holzapfelia dna isolated l fermentum tested antibiotic resistance clinically important agents using broth dilution tests different strains l fermentum demonstrated uniform resistance patterns demonstrating resistance glycopeptide research done l fermentum strains revealed existence tetracycline erythromycin resistance l fermentum found
