prehypertension also known high normal blood pressure borderline hypertensive medical classification cases persons blood pressure elevated optimal normal level considered hypertension high blood pressure prehypertension referred elevated blood pressure american college cardiology acc american heart association accaha define elevated blood pressure readings systolic pressure mm hg diastolic pressure mm hg european society cardiology european society hypertension escesh define high normal blood pressure readings systolic pressure mm hg diastolic pressure mm readings greater equal mm hg considered hypertension accaha greater equal mm hg classification blood pressure based upon two readings two separate occasions compared outofoffice blood pressure readings prehypertension often asymptomatic without symptoms time diagnosis extremely elevated blood pressure malignant hypertension rare cases cause headaches visual changes fatigue dizziness nonspecific symptoms occur many conditions thus blood pressures normal go undiagnosed long period time elevated blood pressure develops gradually many years usually without specific identifiable cause however possible medical causes medications kidney disease adrenal problems thyroid problems must first excluded high blood pressure develops time without specific cause considered benign essential hypertension blood pressure also tends increase person ages lower risk prehypertension progressing hypertension modification lifestyle behaviors necessary lowsodium high potassium diet recommended along increasing physical activity least thirty minutes day days week quitting smoking reducing alcohol consumption maintaining healthy specifically diet high fruits vegetables aim half meal including nonstarchy vegetables like leafy greens beans carrots cucumbers tomatoes etc whole grains low refined grains eg white breads baked goods made white flour low saturated fats eg fatty cuts meat fried foods low sodium homemade minimally processed demonstrated randomized controlled studies significantly lower blood pressure types diet changes alone lower blood pressure greater single drug therapy effects diet sodium reduction work together meaning improve diet include less saturated fat fruits vegetables lower sodium intake significantly typical industrialized nations like united states greater benefit seen similarly better quality diet results seen significant results seen foods rich potassium include banana papaya sweet potato dark leafy greens avocado prune juice tomato juice oranges milk yogurt dried beans navy pinto black beans chickpeas lentils beef pork fish nuts seeds pistachio almonds pumpkin flax sunflower exercise including aerobic isometric dynamic resistance tai reduce blood pressure prehypertensive individuals lack sleep increase blood pressure longer sleep cycles may reduce blood pressure prehypertensive stress reducing techniques improve elevated blood careful monitoring signs endorgan damage progression hypertension important part followup patients prehypertension change blood pressure classification confirmed least one subsequent visit major indication pharmacologic antihypertensive therapy progression hypertension threshold lower patients diabetes chronic kidney failure cardiovascular target blood pressure conditions currently less mm hg home monitoring blood pressure used monitor track prehypertensive patients help raise awareness patient doctor blood pressure levels rise hypertensive levels home monitoring help avoid white coat hypertension results blood pressure levels elevated due presence doctor physician white coat monitoring home work regular times day helps diagnose patient prehypertension hypertension american heart association says may whats called white coat hypertension means blood pressure goes youre doctors surgery monitoring home help measure true blood pressure provide doctor log blood pressure measurements time helpful diagnosing preventing potential health problems people using home blood pressure monitoring devices increasingly also using blood pressure charting software charting methods provide print outs patients physician reminders check blood pressure patients health conditions elevated blood pressure especially diabetes kidney disease heart disease may advised take blood pressure extent prehypertension constitutes serious health concern remains several longterm studies suggested significant increase allcause mortality long periods time individuals falling within prehypertensive many studies indicate jshaped relationship blood pressure mortality whereby high low levels associated notable increases hand national heart lung blood institute suggests people prehypertension higher risk developing hypertension high blood pressure compared people normal blood metaanalysis concluded prehypertension increases risk stroke even lowrange prehypertension significantly increases stroke metaanalysis found elevated blood pressure increases risk heart attack stroke data national health nutrition examination survey nhanes iii estimated prevalence prehypertension among adults united states approximately percent decreased percent national health nutrition examination prevalence higher among men primary risk factor prehypertension overweight risk factors include family history hypertension sedentary lifestyle
