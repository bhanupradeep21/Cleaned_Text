defined cytotoxic chemotherapies reported induce remission patients nonsevere imcd however use cytotoxic chemotherapies currently recommended nonsevere imcd due high likelihood relapse severe side effect profiles alternative immunomodulators thalidomide cyclosporine sirolimus bortezomib anakinra recommended due similar response rates favorable long term side effect profilescitation needed recommended initial treatment patients severe imcd high dose steroids combined agent siltuximab tocilizumab regardless measured levels patients immediately improve regimen steroids may slowly tapered agent continued indefinitely due high relapse rate withdrawal treatment due high risk complications associated severe imcd patients worsen fail improve high dose steroids therapies cytotoxic
