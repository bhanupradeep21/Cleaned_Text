secretions using tools whitefronted capuchins observed using leaves cup drink intrasexual selection malemale competition occurs males invoke contests order gain opportunity reproduce female maximize

dimorphism generally correlated malemale wedgecapped capuchin larger amount canine dimorphism compared whitefaced capuchin whitefronted difference canine dimorphism species correlated differences social structure three groups alpha male wedgecapped capuchin tends monopolize mating therefore engaging malemale competition whitefaced capuchin whitefronted capuchin alpha male monopolize mating allows subordinate males mate much known kaapori capuchin due low population size likely would possess canine dimorphism like wedgecapped capuchin similar social structure monopolizing alpha male peripheral subordinate female presented opportunity copulate male evaluate costs benefits male females obtain direct benefits males mates female gains instant benefit male direct benefits would apply females genus cebus would include vigilance protection predators increased females also benefit indirectly males form phenotypic genotypic benefits well male protection alpha males fit therefore likely provide direct indirect benefits female compared subordinate whitefaced capuchin alpha male fathers offspring produced females hypothesized females mating alpha males ovulating mating
