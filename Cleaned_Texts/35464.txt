efforts interview response sarah lehnon published mongabay news climate change major threat posed towards bird species given sensitivity towards slight weather changes climates global warming influence timing also plant diversity key habitual areas birds due processes like eutrophication result higher levels nitrogen present increase agricultural efforts worsened ecosystems due environmentally unfriendly unfeasible processes use chemicals well rising sea levels threat species live around coastal lines increases forest fires reducing bird populations due effects climate although moderate levels responses specific issue increase awareness danger climate change meant greater need effective migratory bird agreements play important role protecting conserving migratory birds habitats outlining birds protected clauses determine action contracting parties undertaking migratory bird agreements highlight birds protected annex camba ensure specificity monitor birds protected time treaties like camba may instance may eastern curlew curlew sandpiper listed critically listed annex however twothirds australias migratory birds remain unprotected national protection reflecting need protection issue alongside several issues influence need migratory bird protection camba top threats include agriculture aquaculture biological resource use natural system range threats shooting poisoning electrocution identified several years impact worsened another frequent issue derived landuse constraints result increase population economic development land threat types include overgrazing afforestation burning issues go beyond conventional dilemmas identified legally related pitfalls international agreements include gaps listing international migrants national migrants legal mechanisms aim conserve migratory increase regulation rivers water bodies issue current migratory bird camba recognises laws regulation exception prohibiting taking birds eggs encouraging parties take measures protect environments although many international agreements fail recognise river regulation murraydarling basin example largely regulated experienced largest declines shorebird given size murraydarling basin water system impact bird populations proven negatively influence ecosystems due increase extraction regulation harmful complexity multilateral treaties another issue worsens effectiveness protection sophistication surrounding decisionmaking implementation given nature multinational agreements individual nations different attitudes towards legislation protecting specific areas limited due political jurisdictions contrasts nature migratory species highly national complexity given legal political barriers makes migratory bird protection harder implement measure effectiveness proven greater need harmonisation state federal responses leveraging epbc act integrating within legislation improve complexity treaties evident implicit language used defining key terms often requires legislation provide substantive details support state governments upholding protective response mechanisms ramsar convention seen limited purpose responding migratory bird protection compared migratory bird agreements camba given lack detail explicitness within instance ramsar convention focuses registration wetland sites migratory bird treaties greater focus migratory birds limitation migratory bird migration within australia demonstrated camba bilateral treaties national government implement international agreements states tending employ regulations laws
