immunodeficiency also known immunocompromisation state immune systems ability fight infectious diseases cancer compromised entirely absent cases acquired secondary due extrinsic factors affect patients immune system examples extrinsic factors include hiv infection environmental factors immunocompromisation may also due genetic diseasesflaws scid clinical settings immunosuppression drugs steroids either adverse effect intended purpose treatment examples use organ transplant surgery antirejection measure patients overactive immune system autoimmune diseases people born intrinsic defects immune system primary person immunodeficiency kind said immunocompromised immunocompromised individual may particularly vulnerable opportunistic infections addition normal infections could affect also decreases cancer immunosurveillance immune system scans bodys cells kills neoplastic ones also susceptible infectious diseases owing reduced protection afforded reality immunodeficiency often affects multiple components notable examples including severe combined immunodeficiency primary acquired immune deficiency syndrome secondary b cell deficiency distinction primary versus secondary immunodeficiencies based respectively whether cause originates immune system turn due insufficiency supporting component external decreasing factor number rare diseases feature heightened susceptibility infections childhood onward primary immunodeficiency also known congenital many disorders hereditary autosomal recessive xlinked recognised primary immunodeficiency syndromes generally grouped part immune system malfunctioning lymphocytes treatment primary immunodeficiencies depends nature defect may involve antibody infusions longterm antibiotics cases stem cell transplantation characteristics lacking andor impaired antibody functions related illnesses xlinked agammaglobulinemia common variable immune deficiency secondary immunodeficiencies also known acquired immunodeficiencies result various immunosuppressive agents example malnutrition aging particular medications eg chemotherapy diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs immunosuppressive drugs organ transplants glucocorticoids environmental toxins like mercury heavy metals pesticides petrochemicals like styrene dichlorobenzene xylene ethylphenol medications term immunosuppression generally refers beneficial potential adverse effects decreasing function immune system term immunodeficiency generally refers solely adverse effect increased risk infection many specific diseases directly indirectly cause immunosuppression includes many types cancer particularly bone marrow blood cells leukemia lymphoma multiple myeloma certain chronic infections immunodeficiency also hallmark acquired immunodeficiency syndrome caused human immunodeficiency virus hiv hiv directly infects small number helper cells also impairs immune system responses indirectly various hormonal metabolic disorders also result immune deficiency including anemia hypothyroidism hyperglycemia smoking alcoholism drug abuse also depress immune response heavy schedules training competition athletes increases risk immune cause immunodeficiency varies depending nature disorder cause either genetic acquired malnutrition poor sanitary genetic causes exact genes large number immunodeficiency syndromes present clinical laboratory characteristics autoimmunity decreased ability immune system clear infections patients may responsible causing autoimmunity perpetual immune system one example common variable immunodeficiency cvid multiple autoimmune diseases seen eg inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune thrombocytopenia autoimmune thyroid disease familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency another example low blood levels red blood cells white blood cells platelets rashes lymph node enlargement enlargement liver spleen commonly seen patients presence multiple uncleared viral infections due lack perforin thought responsible addition chronic andor recurrent infections many autoimmune diseases including arthritis autoimmune hemolytic anemia scleroderma type diabetes also seen xlinked agammaglobulinemia xla recurrent bacterial fungal infections chronic inflammation gut lungs seen chronic granulomatous disease cgd well cgd caused decreased production nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph oxidase neutrophils hypomorphic rag mutations seen patients midline granulomatous disease autoimmune disorder commonly seen patients granulomatosis polyangiitis nkt cell lymphomas syndrome patients also present eczema autoimmune manifestations recurrent bacterial infections lymphoma autoimmune polyendocrinopathycandidiasisectodermal dystrophy apeced also autoimmunity infections coexist organspecific autoimmune manifestations eg hypoparathyroidism adrenocortical failure chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis finally iga deficiency also sometimes associated development autoimmune atopic phenomena patients immune deficiencies present variable clinical phenotypes often translates significant delay diagnosis resultant patient morbidity structured approach suspect immunodeficiency initial investigations pathway given publication grammatikos et available treatment falls two modalities treating infections boosting immune system prevention pneumocystis pneumonia using trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole useful early immunoglobulinig used doctors treat patients primary immunodeficiency intramuscular injection ig replacement therapy infusions either subcutaneous intravenously administered resulting higher ig levels three four weeks although varies prognosis depends greatly nature severity condition deficiencies cause early mortality age one others even without treatment lifelong conditions cause little mortality morbidity newer stem cell transplant technologies may lead gene based treatments debilitating fatal genetic immune deficiencies prognosis acquired immune deficiencies depends avoiding treating causative agent condition like aids peripheral purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency httpsenwikipediaorgwikiimmunodeficiency
