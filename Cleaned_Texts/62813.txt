mucositis painful inflammation ulceration mucous membranes lining digestive tract usually adverse effect chemotherapy radiotherapy treatment mucositis occur anywhere along gastrointestinal gi tract oral mucositis refers particular inflammation ulceration occurs mouth oral mucositis common often debilitating complication cancer oral gastrointestinal gi mucositis affects almost patients undergoing highdose chemotherapy hematopoietic stem cell transplantation hsct patients malignancies head neck receiving radiotherapy wide range patients receiving chemotherapy alimentary tract mucositis increases mortality morbidity contributes rising health care cancer treatment patients get mucositis however get mucositis get grade oral irinotecan associated severe gi mucositis patients seventyfive eighty percent bone marrow transplantation recipients experience mucositis oral mucositis common debilitating especially melphalan used grade oral mucositis patient unable eat solid food grade patient unable consume liquids radiotherapy head neck pelvis abdomen associated grade grade oral gi mucositis respectively often exceeding patients among patients undergoing head neck radiotherapy pain decreased oral function may persist long conclusion therapy fractionated radiation dosage increases risk mucositis patients trials oral mucositis particularly profound prolonged among hsct recipients receive totalbody cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy usually become symptomatic four five days beginning treatment reaching peak around day slowly improving course weeks mucositis associated radiotherapy usually appears end second week treatment may last six eight weekscitation needed result cell death reaction chemo radiotherapy mucosal lining mouth becomes thin may slough become red inflamed ulcerated ulcers may become covered yellowishwhite fibrin clot called pseudomembrane peripheral erythema usually present ulcers may range cm greater cm oral mucositis severely painful degree pain usually related extent tissue damage pain often described burning sensation accompanied reddening due pain patient may experience trouble speaking eating even opening mouthcitation needed dysgeusia alteration taste perception common especially receiving concomitant radiation therapy neck mouth area taste blindness altered sense taste temporary condition occurs effects taste buds mostly located tongue sometimes partial recovery taste occurs common complaints food tasting sweet bitter continuous metallic tastecitation needed sores ulcerations become infected virus bacteria fungus pain loss taste perception makes difficult eat leads weight loss ulcers may act site local infection portal entry oral flora instances may cause septicaemia especially immunosuppressed patients therefore oral mucositis doselimiting condition disrupting patient optimal cancer treatment plan consequentially decreasing chances pathophysiology mucositis complex multifactorial currently sonis five phase model accepted explanation stages diagnosis based symptoms patient experiencing appearance tissues mouth following chemotherapy bone marrow transplants radiotherapy red burnlike sores ulcers throughout mouth enough diagnose mucositiscitation needed severity oral mucositis evaluated using several different assessment tools two commonly used world health organization oral toxicity national cancer institute common toxicity criteria ncictc oral nci system separate scores appearance erythema ulceration function pain ability eat solids liquids nothing mouth score combines elements single score grades severity condition oral mucositis swallowing possible patient needs supplementary nutrition another scale developed oral mucositis assessment scale omas shown highly reproducible observers responsive time accurate recording symptoms associated mucositis omas provides objective assessment oral mucositis based assessment appearance extent redness ulceration various areas cochrane systematic review assessing prevention chemotherapyinduced oral mucositis concluded oral cryotherapy leads large reductions incidence oral mucositis severities adults receiving treatment solid cancers evidence also indicates reduction oral mucositis adults receiving highdose melphalanbased cancer treatment prior haematopoietic stem cell transplantation although uncertainty regarding size reduction instance evidence found use preventive measure children oral cryotherapy involves placement rounded ice chips mouth cools oral tissues causes vasoconstriction decreases blood flow region hence also restricts amounts chemotherapy drugs delivered treatment mucositis mainly supportive oral hygiene mainstay treatment patients encouraged clean mouth every four hours bedtime often mucositis becomes worsecitation needed watersoluble jellies used lubricate mouth salt mouthwash soothe pain keep food particles clear avoid infection patients also encouraged drink plenty liquids least three liters day avoid alcohol citrus fruits alcohol foods hot known aggravate mucositis lesions medicinal mouthwashes may used chlorhexidine gluconate viscous lidocaine relief pain however care taken high doses viscous lidocaine cause adverse study reported lidocaine potential toxicity tested patients oral mucositis underwent bone marrow transplant lidocaine anesthetic mouthwash found
