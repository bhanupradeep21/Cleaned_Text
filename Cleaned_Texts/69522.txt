plant transformation vectors plasmids specifically designed facilitate generation transgenic plants commonly used plant transformation vectors termed tdna binary vectors often replicated e coli common lab bacterium agrobacterium tumefaciens plantvirulent bacterium used insert recombinant customized dna plants plant transformation vectors contain three key elements custom dna plasmid sequence created replicated one way methods generally share following processes plant transformation using plasmids begins propagation binary vector e coli bacterial culture reaches appropriate density binary vector isolated purified foreign gene introduced engineered binary vector including foreign gene reintroduced e coli amplification engineered binary factor isolated e coli introduced agrobacteria containing modified relatively small ti plasmid engineered agrobacteria used infect plant cells tdna containing foreign gene gets inserted plant cell genome infected cell tdna gets integrated different site genome entire plant regenerate single transformed cell results organism transformation dna integrated identically across cells foreign dna inserted insertional mutagenesis lethal plant cell organism diploid transformation dna fed rodents ends phagocytes rarely cells specifically bacterial dna preferential accumulation phagocytes thought real detection artefact since dna extents thought provoke phagocytosis however gene expression known resulted thought selector gene used distinguish successfully genetically modified cells unmodified ones selector gene integrated plasmid together desired target gene provides cells resistance antibiotic kanamycin ampicillin spectinomycin tetracycline desired cells along organisms growing within culture treated antibiotic allowing modified cells survive antibiotic gene usually transferred plant cell instead remains within bacterial cell plasmids replicate produce many plasmid molecules host bacterial cell number copies plasmid bacterial cell determined replication origin position within plasmids molecule dna replication initiated binary vectors higher number plasmid copies replicate e coli plasmid copynumber usually lesser plasmid resident within agrobacterium tumefaciens plasmids also replicated using polymerase chain reaction pcr tdna contains two types genes oncogenic genes encoding enzymes involved synthesis auxins cytokinins responsible tumor formation genes encoding synthesis opines compounds produced condensation amino acids sugars synthesized excreted crown gall cells consumed tumefaciens carbon nitrogen sources outside tdna located genes opine catabolism genes involved process tdna transfer bacterium plant cell genes involved bacteriumbacterium plasmid conjugative transfer hooykaas schilperoort zupan zambrysky tdna fragment flanked direct repeats act ciselement signal transfer apparatus process tdna transfer mediated cooperative action proteins encoded genes determined ti plasmid virulence region vir genes bacterial chromosome ti plasmid also contains genes opine catabolism produced crown gall cells regions conjugative transfer integrity stability kb virulence vir region regulon organized six operons essential tdna transfer vira virb vird virg increasing transfer efficiency virc vire hooykaas schilperoort zupan zambryski jeon et al different chromosomaldetermined genetic elements shown functional role attachment tumefaciens plant cell bacterial colonization loci chva chvb involved synthesis excretion b glucan cangelosi et al chve required sugar enhancement vir genes induction bacterial chemotaxis ankenbauer et al cangelosi et al cell locus responsible synthesis cellulose fibrils matthysse psca exoc locus playing role synthesis cyclic glucan acid succinoglycan cangelosi et att locus involved cell surface proteins matthysse httpsenwikipediaorgwikiplanttransformationvector
