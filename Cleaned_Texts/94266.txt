achievement gaps united states observed persistent disparities measures educational performance among subgroups us students especially groups defined socioeconomic status ses raceethnicity gender achievement gap observed variety measures including standardized test scores grade point average dropout rates college enrollment college completion rates gap achievement lower income students higher income students exists studied extensively us countries including various gaps groups exist around globe well research causes disparity academic achievement students different socioeconomic racial backgrounds ongoing since publication coleman report officially titled equality educational opportunity commissioned us department education report found combination home community inschool factors affect academic performance contribute achievement gap according american educational psychologist david berliner home community environments stronger impact school achievement inschool factors part students spend time outside school school addition outofschool factors influencing academic performance differ significantly children living poverty children middleincome achievement gap reported

elementary level education united states compulsory age regardless race class anticipated half public education students required pass standardsbased assessments expect students least exposed algebra high school exit prepared college researchers reached consensus causes academic achievement gap instead exists wide range studies cite array factors cultural structural influence student performance school sociologist annette lareau suggested students lack middleclass cultural capital limited parental involvement likely lower academic achievement better resourced researchers suggest academic achievement closely tied race socioeconomic status tried pinpoint past fifty years gap educational achievement males females united states gender disadvantaged fluctuated years data showed girls trailing behind boys variety academic performance measures specifically test scores math data last twenty years shows general trend girls outperforming boys academic achievement terms class grades across subjects college graduation rates boys scoring higher standardized tests better represented higherpaying prestigious job fields stem science technology engineering male students consistently achieved worse school marks female students countries traditionally girls outperformed boys reading writing although gap may minimal kindergarten grows students continue education according national reading assessment measured us department education gap boys girls slightly noticeable grade left boys points behind girls grade test female students continued higher average reading scores male students three ages gap male female graders points grade gap males national writing assessment boys scored average points lower girls grade average gap increased points grade widened points senior

could due fact class grades especially middle high school usually depend students completion homework assignments studies shown girls report spending time homework gender gap mathematics particularly large among highestachieving students example malefemale ratio among students score math portion least one study challenged existence gender gap mathematics janet hyde others published study showing male female students equally well child left behind standardized tests administered second eleventh grades ten states however hyde team find gaps favored males upper end achievement distribution tried examine gaps difficult test questions previous research shown males outperform females challenging items tests examined lacked adequately challenging items raised questions whether still gender gap math also large discrepancy number men women working stem fields women continue underrepresented fields underrepresentation evident distribution college majors among men women women earned engineering bachelors according data percent college students females percent males number males enrolled college increased percent number female students rose males enrolling college greater numbers ever yet fewer twothirds graduating bachelors degree numbers men women receiving bachelors degree increased significantly increasing rate female college graduates exceeds increasing rate percentage women bachelors degrees higher percentage men bachelors degrees first time women also earn masters degrees doctorates although women graduating undergraduate degrees men still earning disproportionately lifetimes could due many factors including different types jobs males females females greatly underrepresented science engineering fields typically correlated high lifetime males females also vastly different labor market histories based type job time spent student interacts evaluated teachers closely correlated students future academic according researcher thomas good two competing views teachers indirectly impact achievement students first teachers likely give special attention extra assistance students appear struggling class reading writing classes male students often behind female students terms achievement therefore male students likely get teacher attention extra interaction could give males advantage terms future achievement second view teachers demand show respect toward students view high achievers creates cycle students perceived intelligent receive extra help teacher teachers perceive students knowledge abilities varies gender influences classroom processes student achievement reading math teachers usually higher expectations students view higher achievers treat students study tach farkas also found students split reading groups based abilities students higherability reading groups likely demonstrate positive learning behaviors higher teachers likely favor girls evaluating types readers students seem studies shown teacher perceptions students determine much individualized attention student receives serve indicator future academic progress teachers underestimate males reading abilities use ability grouping classrooms male students might put disadvantage learning reading classes negatively opposite trend found math classes teachers still tend view math masculine subject tend higher expectations better attitude towards male students study fennema et al also shown teachers tend name males asked list best math females likely males negatively impacted underestimation math genderspecific evaluations teachers implicit usually teachers idea favoring one gender shown concrete evidence video recording classroom however even though discrimination implicit still negative effects male female conflicting evidence whether teacher assessments student performance ability consistent cognitive assessments like standardized tests teacher assessment evidence comes relatively small number classrooms compared standardized tests administered every public school fifty speculation gender stereotyping within classrooms also lead differences academic achievement representation female male students math science often perceived masculine subjects

research stereotype threat shown gender stereotypes decrease mathematical selfesteem many female students lack academic confidence leads anxiety poorer performance math childs parents view skills also contribute gender achievement gap education study jacobs eccles shown adults rate female children better social skills male children girls likely seen good children genderbased stereotypes perpetuate
