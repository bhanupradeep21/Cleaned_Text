operational telescope supporting observatory formally opened arecibo ionospheric observatory november ownership observatory transferred dod national science foundation october nsf named cornell university manage observatorys functions september nsf renamed observatory national astronomy ionosphere center naic made federally funded research development center nasa began contributing towards funding observatory alongside nsf support planetary radar early nasa started reduce contribution arecibo observatory putting pressure nsf continue fund nsf made first possible suggestion significantly reducing funding towards arecibo potentially decommissioning academics politicians lobbied increase funding bookmarked arecibo stave closure nasa recommitted funding study nearearth cut losses nsf delisted arecibo ffrdc removed cornell site operator replaced collaborative team led sri international allowed observatory able offer facilities wider range damage telescope hurricane maria led nsf consider possibility decommissioning observatory costs maintaining become consortium led university central florida ucf stepped forward offer manage observatory cover significant portion operations maintenance costs nsf made ucfs consortium new site though specific actions announced auxiliary main cable failure telescope august november respectively nsf announced decision would decommission telescope controlled demolition facilities observatory would remain operational future safe decommission telescope could occur remaining support cables one tower rapidly failed morning december causing instrument platform crash dish shearing tops support towers partially damaging buildings though nsf stated intention observatory facilities operational soon possible looking plans rebuild new telescope instrument nsf announced telescope rebuilt educational facility established cold spring harbor laboratory new york university maryland baltimore county university puerto rico río piedras

observatorys main feature large radio telescope whose main collecting dish inverted spherical dome feet diameter radius constructed inside karst dishs surface made perforated aluminum panels feet supported mesh steel ground beneath supported shadetolerant since completion november telescope used radar astronomy radio astronomy part search extraterrestrial intelligence seti program also used nasa nearearth object detection since around nsf funding support telescope waned foundation directed funds newer instruments though academics petitioned nsf congress continue support telescope numerous hurricanes including hurricane maria damaged parts telescope straining reduced budget two cable breaks one august second november threatened structural integrity support structure suspended platform damaged dish nsf determined november safer decommission telescope rather try repair telescope collapsed controlled demolition could carried remaining support cables one tower failed around local time december causing receiver platform fall dish collapsing nasa led extensive failure investigation reported along technical bulletin industry investigation concluded combination low socket design margin high percentage sustained loading revealed unexpected vulnerability zinc creep environments resulting longterm cumulative damage progressive zincwire failure arecibo observatory also facilities beyond main telescope including ft radio telescope intended verylongbaseline interferometry vlbi main lidar whose research continued since main telescopes collapse opened ángel ramos
