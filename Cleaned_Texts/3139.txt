similar microsaurs microbrachis cardiocephalus argued similarity enhanced due possibly single bone formed temporal region skull bones rear skull roof jaw area early tetrapods two three distinct bones area supratemporals tabular bones sometimes intertemporals prior studies microsaurs often considered single bone retain supratemporal including original description however many studies since identified tabular according andrews carroll adelospondyls possess even extreme reduction number skull bones area tabular bones fuse squamosal bones creating bone termed although original description acherontiscus depicted squamosal separate tabular ruta et al interpreted skull differently according interpretation acherontiscus also possessed fused squamosotabular adelogyrinids supporting status

vertebrae preserved also possess haemal arches looselyattached spiny structures jutting bottom bones either front hind limbs preserved holotype acherontiscus addition bones endochondral shoulder girdle ie scapulae coracoids also missing however welldeveloped dermal shoulder girdle consisting clavicles interclavicle preserved indicating ancestors acherontiscus possessed forelimbs carroll considered unlikely acherontiscus would possessed limbs considering size shoulder girdle missing bones perhaps becoming misplaced processes animal died became however considered equally plausible animal completely legless dermal girdle retained relic earlier dermal shoulder girdle represented platelike interclavicle would center living animals chest well two clavicle bones branching simple ovalshaped interclavicle bisected low ridge covered grooves clavicle bones thick rounded base taper extend outwards upwards case living conclusive evidence pelvic girdle hindlimbs found although carroll considered bone fragments around vertebrae may leg bones whole lack known limb endochondral material yet retention dermal shoulder girdle condition similar family adelospondyls adelogyrinids

palaeomolgophis brough brough respectively reidentified hyoid bones ribs carroll also claimed forelimbs present adelospondylus found hyoids small elongated scales preserved among bones acherontiscus skeleton scales show similarities microsaurs also towards tetrapods dvinosaurian temnospondyl classification acherontiscus gone much revision past shows mixture characteristics various groups nonamniote tetrapods amphibians broad definition term traditionally ancient amphibians classified two groups labyrinthodonts lepospondyls labyrinthodonts characterized mazelike tooth enamel presence multiple bones forming vertebral segment generally crocodilelike appearance modern analyses concluded order labyrinthodontia composed various groups nonamniote stegocephalians scattered within near tetrapod family tree groups include stemtetrapods ichthyostega well diverse groups embolomeri temnospondyli latter probably including modern lissamphibians frogs salamanders lepospondyls hand

possessed small intercentra complement large lepospondyls typically grouped together based singlebone lepospondylous vertebrae fact many lepospondyl groups evolved vertebrae independently casts doubt onto validity group animals like acherontiscus lethiscus trihecaton show lepospondyli rather traditional monophyletic group single ancestor may fact polyphyletic collection unrelated tetrapods

recently discovered stemtetrapod aytonerpeton within adelospondyli sister taxon due presence lateral lines acherontiscus individuals inferred aquatic animals carroll also noted even limbs present life lack preservation would indicate little bone material also supports hypothesis acherontiscus lived practically entire lives water long body embolomerous vertebrae would facilitated sidetoside
