hematuria haematuria defined presence blood red blood cells gross hematuria occurs urine appears red brown teacolored due presence blood hematuria may also subtle detectable microscope laboratory blood enters mixes urine come location within urinary system including kidney ureter urinary bladder urethra men common causes hematuria include urinary tract infection uti kidney stones viral illness trauma bladder cancer causes grouped glomerular nonglomerular causes depending involvement glomerulus red urine substances certain medications foods eg blackberries beets food dyes cause urine appear menstruation women may also cause appearance hematuria may result positive urine dipstick test urine dipstick test may also give incorrect positive result hematuria substances urine myoglobin protein excreted urine rhabdomyolysis positive urine dipstick test confirmed microscopy hematuria defined three red blood cells per high power hematuria detected thorough history physical examination appropriate evaluation eg laboratory testing help determine underlying hematuria classified according visibility anatomical origin timing blood many causes may present either visible hematuria microscopic hematuria differential diagnosis frequently organized based glomerular nonglomerular glomerular causes include hematuria due glomerular source commonly presents dysmorphic red blood cells misshapen red blood cells red cell casts small tubular structures made red blood cell components urine microscopy occurs due red blood cells deformed pass glomerular capillaries renal tubules eventually urinary normally red blood cells never pass glomerular capillary renal tubule always pathological process visible blood clots urine indicate nonglomerular nonglomerular causes include red brown urine caused substances certain medications certain foods cause urine appear medications may cause urine appear red include foods may cause urine appear red include urine dipstick may falsely positive hematuria due substances urine dipstick test able recognize heme red blood cells also identifies free hemoglobin free hemoglobin may found urine resulting hemolysis myoglobin may found urine resulting rhabdomyolysis muscle thus positive dipstick test necessarily indicate hematuria rather microscopy urine showing three red blood cells per high power field confirms women menstruation may cause appearance hematuria may result urine dipstick test positive menstruation ruled cause hematuria inquiring menstruation history ensuring urine specimen collected without menstrual common causes hematuria evaluation hematuria dependent upon visibility blood urine ie visiblegross vs microscopic visible hematuria must investigated may due pathological visible hematuria urological cancer frequently bladder kidney cancer discovered hematuria alone without accompanying symptoms raise suspicion malignancy urinary tract proven initial evaluation patients presenting signs symptoms consistent hematuria include assessment hemodynamic status underlying cause hematuria ensuring urinary drainage steps include assessment patients heart rate blood pressure physician exam taken healthcare professional blood work ensure patients hemodynamic status important obtain detailed history patient ie recreational occupational medication exposures information helpful suggesting cause physical exam also helpful identifying cause hematuria certain signs found physical exam suggest specific causes event initial evaluation hematuria reveal underlying cause evaluation physician specializes urology may proceed medical evaluation may consist limited history physical exam taken healthcare personnel laboratory studies ie blood work cystoscopy specialized imaging procedures ie ct first step evaluation red brown colored urine confirm true hematuria urinalysis urine microscopy hematuria defined three red blood cells per high power although urine dipstick test may used give false positive false negative gathering information important inquire recent trauma urologic procedures menses culturedocumented urinary tract present appropriate repeat urinalysis urine microscopy weeks treatment results urinalysis urine microscopy reveal glomerular origin hematuria indicated proteinuria red blood cell casts consultation nephrologist results urinalysis indicate nonglomerular origin microbiological culture urine performed done culture positive indicating bladder infection urinalysis urine microscopy repeated follwing treatment confirm resolution culture negative hematuria persists treatment ct urogram renal ultrasound cystoscopy hemodynamic stability monitored complete blood count ordered assess detecting confirming hematuria urinalysis urine microscopy first step

disruption glomerular basement membrane mechanical chemical erosion mucosal surfaces genitourinary acute clot retention one three emergencies occur two anemia blood clots prevent urine outflow either ureter known acute urinary retention blood clots remain bladder digested urinary urokinase producing fibrin fibrin fragments natural anticoagulants promote ongoing bleeding urinary removing blood
