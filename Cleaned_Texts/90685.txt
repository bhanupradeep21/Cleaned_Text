necrotizing fasciitis nf also known flesheating disease bacterial infection results death parts bodys soft severe disease sudden onset spreads symptoms usually include red purple skin affected area severe pain fever commonly affected areas limbs typically infection enters body break skin cut risk factors include poor immune function diabetes cancer obesity alcoholism intravenous drug use peripheral artery typically spread disease classified four types depending infecting cases involve one type methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa involved third medical imaging often helpful confirm necrotizing fasciitis may prevented proper wound care usually treated surgery remove infected tissue intravenous often combination antibiotics used penicillin g clindamycin iv vancomycin delays surgery associated much higher risk despite highquality treatment risk death necrotizing fasciitis occurs people per per year us per western sexes affected becomes common among older people

diagnosis early stages difficult hardening skin soft tissue swelling beyond area skin changes commonly present early necrotizing redness swelling usually blend surrounding normal tissues overlying skin may appear shiny signs suggestive necrotizing changes present later stages cases formation bullae bleeding skin present skin skin turning red purple black due thrombosis blood presence gas

developing necrotizing fasciitis wound reduced good wound care types softtissue necrotizing infection divided four classes according types bacteria infecting soft tissue classification system first described giuliano colleagues type infection common type infection accounts cases caused mixture bacterial types usually abdominal groin type infection usually caused various species grampositive cocci staphylococcus aureus streptococcus pyogenes enterococci gramnegative rods escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa anaerobes bacteroides clostridium populations affected typically older medical comorbidities diabetes mellitus obesity usually trauma cause infections previous history abscess infection gut perforation bacterial translocation may elicited clostridial infection accounts type infection clostridium species involved clostridium perfringens clostridium septicum clostridium sordellii typically cause gas gangrene also known myonecrosis clostridium perfringens produces two deadly toxins alphatoxin thetatoxin alphatoxin causes excessive platelet aggregation blocks blood vessels deprives vital organs oxygen supply creates acidic oxygendeficient environment proliferation bacteria alphatoxin absorbed soft tissues inhibit migration white blood cells blood vessels soft tissue thus impairing phagocyte function two toxins together cause destruction red blood cells blood vessels damage integrity blood vessels suppression heart functioncitation needed clostridium sordellii also produce two major toxins known virulent strains produce essential virulence factor lethal toxin tcsl number also produce haemorrhagic toxin tcsh tcsl tcsh members large clostridial cytotoxin lcc key clostridium septicum virulence factor poreforming toxin called alphatoxin though unrelated clostridium perfringens alphatoxin myonecrotic infections caused clostridial species commonly occur injecting heroin users clostridial infections typically severe pain wound site wound typically drains foulsmelling blood mixed serum serosanguinous discharge shock progress rapidly initial injury infection state shock established chance dying exceeds another bacterium associated similar rapid disease progression group streptococcal infection mostly streptococcus pyogenes meanwhile bacterial infections require two days become type ii infection infection accounts cases mainly involving mainly involves streptococcus pyogenes bacteria alone combination staphylococcal infections types bacteria progress rapidly manifest toxic shock syndrome streptococcus species produce protein acts superantigen stimulating massive systemic immune response effective bacterial antigen precipitating shock type ii infection commonly affects young healthy adults history type iii infection vibrio vulnificus bacterium found saltwater rare cause infection occurs break skin disease progression similar type ii sometimes little visible skin type iv infection authors described type iv infection fungal early diagnosis difficult disease often looks early like simple superficial skin number laboratory imaging modalities raise suspicion necrotizing fasciitis none rule gold standard diagnosis surgical exploration setting high suspicion doubt small incision made affected tissue finger easily separates tissue along fascial plane diagnosis confirmed extensive debridement imaging limited role diagnosis necrotizing fasciitis time delay performing imaging major concern plain radiography may show subcutaneous emphysema gas subcutaneous tissue strongly suggestive necrotizing changes sensitive enough detect cases necrotizing skin infections caused bacteria clostridial infections usually show subcutaneous emphysema diagnosis still doubt computed tomography ct scans magnetic resonance imaging mri sensitive modalities plain radiography however ct scan mri sensitive enough rule necrotizing changes ct scan may show fascial thickening edema subcutaneous gas abscess mri fluid collection deep fascia involvement occurs thickening enhancement contrast injection necrotizing fasciitis strongly suspected meanwhile ultrasonography show superficial abscess formation sensitive enough diagnose necrotizing ct scan able detect cases mri may pick slightly white blood cell count greater serum sodium level less mmoll sensitivity detecting necrotizing soft tissue infectioncitation needed also chance ruling necrotizing changes values shown otherwise various scoring systems developed determine likelihood getting necrotizing fasciitis scoring system developed wong colleagues commonly used laboratory risk indicator necrotizing fasciitis lrinec score used stratify risk people signs severe cellulitis abscess determine likelihood necrotizing fasciitis present uses six laboratory values creactive protein total white blood cell count hemoglobin sodium creatinine blood score indicates necrotizing fasciitis seriously scoring criteria however scoring system validated values would falsely positive inflammatory conditions present therefore values derived scoring system interpreted patients necrotizing fasciitis original study still lrinec score validation study showed patients lrinec score higher rate death necrotizing fasciitis partly prevented good wound care surgical debridement cutting away affected tissue mainstay treatment necrotizing fasciitis early medical treatment often presumptive thus antibiotics started soon condition suspected tissue cultures rather wound swabs taken determine appropriate antibiotic coverage antibiotics may changed light results besides blood pressure control hydration support initiated unstable vital signs low urine aggressive wound debridement performed early usually soon diagnosis necrotizing soft tissue infection nsti made surgical incisions often extend beyond areas induration hardened tissue remove damaged blood vessels responsible induration however cellulitic soft tissues sometimes spared debridement later skin coverage

condition leading increased reporting bacterial virulence increasing bacterial resistance areas world common one every higher rates necrotizing fasciitis seen obesity diabetes immunocompromised alcoholic peripheral artery disease however disease may also occur young healthy adults underlying illnesses nsaids may increase rates necrotizing infections due modification immune response body nsaids inhibit enzymes important producing thromboxane prostaglandin prostaglandin responsible fever inflammation pain inhibition prostaglandin production reduces inflammatory response leukocyte adhesion thus reduces immune response bacterial invasion giving rise softtissue fifth century bce hippocrates described necrotizing soft tissue infection disease affected would erysipelas body cause
