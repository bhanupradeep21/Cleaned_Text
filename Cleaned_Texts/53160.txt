braincase two traits rare among archosauria true crowngroup archosaurs similar nonarchosaurian archosauriforms like hand ankle much advanced animals like euparkeria features skull observed true archosaurs particularly early suchians distant ancestors modern group turfanosuchus shares similarities gracilisuchus yonghesuchus study grouped three genera family gracilisuchidae gracilisuchidae lies within pseudosuchia contains archosaurs closely related crocodilians birds skull features previously considered unique turfanosuchus considered characterize gracilisuchidae turfanosuchus retains

pterygoid teeth considered absent crownarchosaurs wu russell used justify classifying turfanosuchus nonarchosaur however recently pterygoid teeth reported crownarchosaurs eoraptor eudimorphodon eodromaeus therefore presence turfanosuchus preclude classification crownarchosaur another seemingly nonarchosaurian trait reported turfanosuchus fact internal carotid arteries enter braincase rather sides almost archosaurs including gracilisuchus however trait also known occur crownarchosaurs like arizonasaurus qianosuchus silesaurus otherwise braincase generally similar lower jaw slender elliptical hole known mandibular fenestra toothed dentary bone two rear prongs surrounding mandibular fenestra unique turfanosuchus among gracilisuchids lower prong much longer upper prong added
