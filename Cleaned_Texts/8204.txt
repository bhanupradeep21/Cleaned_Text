mating system way group structured relation sexual behaviour precise meaning depends upon context respect animals term describes males females mate circumstances recognised systems include monogamy polygamy includes polygyny polyandry polygynandry promiscuity lead different mate choice outcomes thus systems affect sexual selection works species practice plants term refers degree circumstances outcrossing human sociobiology terms extended encompass formation relationships marriage primary mating systems plants outcrossing crossfertilisation autogamy selffertilisation apomixis asexual reproduction without fertilization arising modification sexual function mixed mating systems plants use two even three mating systems number models used describe parameters plant mating systems basic model mixed mating model based assumption every fertilisation either selffertilisation completely random crossfertilisation complex models relax assumption example effective selfing model recognises mating may common pairs closely related plants pairs distantly related following mating systems generally recognized animals mating relationships may may associated social relationships sexual partners stay together become parenting partners alternative term pair bonding implies usual monogamy many polyandrous systems males female stay together rear young polygynous systems number females paired male low male often stay one female help rear young females rear young polygynandry males may assist one female adults help rear young system usually called communal breeding highly polygynous systems promiscuous systems paternal care young rare may parental care descriptions idealized social partnerships often easier observe mating relationships particular sexual conflict occurs individuals different sexes separate conflicting requirements optimal mating success conflict may lead competitive adaptations coadaptations one sexes maintain mating processes beneficial intralocus sexual conflict interlocus sexual conflict describe genetic influence behind sexual conflict presently recognized basic forms sexual compared vertebrates species usually single mating system humans display great variety humans also differ formal marriages cultures involve negotiation arrangement elder relatives regarding sexual dimorphism see section animals humans intermediate group moderate sex differences body size relatively small indicating relatively low sperm competition socially monogamous polygynous human societies one estimate human societies polygynous polyandrous rest monogamous even last group may least part genetically evolutionary standpoint females prone practice monogamy reproductive success based resources able acquire reproduction rather quantity offspring produce however males likely practice polygamy reproductive success based amount offspring produce rather kind benefit parental polygyny associated increased sharing subsistence provided women consistent theory women raise children alone men concentrate mating effort polygyny also associated greater environmental variability form variability rainfall may increase differences resources available men important association polygyny associated higher pathogen load area may make good genes male increasingly important high pathogen load also decreases relative importance sororal polygyny may becomes increasingly important genetic variability offspring see major histocompatibility complex sexual virtually terms used describe animal mating systems adopted social anthropology devised

mating systems resisted sociobiologist observing kinds behavior shown humans species would conclude known mating systems natural species depending circumstances individual culture increasingly affects human mating choices ascertaining natural mating system human animal zoological perspective becomes increasingly difficult clues taken human anatomy essentially unchanged prehistoric past suggested anatomical factors signify degree sperm competition although others provided anatomical evidence suggest sperm competition risk humans monogamy evolved multiple times animals homologous brain structures predicting mating parental strategies used homologous structures brought similar mechanisms even though many different evolutionary pathways get monogamy studied organisms express genes similarly fore midbrain implying universal mechanism evolution monogamy genetics exclusive cause mating systems within animals influential many animals particularly rodents heavily researched certain rodents mating polygynous socially monogamous frequent correlated suggested evolutionary phylogenies rodents closely related genetically likely use similar mating system suggesting evolutionary basis differences mating strategy traced back significant alleles affect behaviors heavily influential mating system alleles responsible level parental care animals choose partners sexual competitiveness among others least partially influenced genes may perfectly correlate mating system animals use genetics one factor may lead species population reproducing using one mating system another even potentially multiple different locations points time mating systems also large impacts genetics population strongly affecting natural selection speciation plover populations polygamous species tend speciate slowly monogamous species likely polygamous animals tend move larger distances find mates contributing high level gene flow genetically homogenize many nearby subpopulations monogamous animals hand tend stay closer starting location dispersing monogamous animals migrate far monogamous populations geographically closer together tend reproductively isolate easily thus subpopulation likely diversify speciate nearby populations compared polygamous populations polygamous species however male partner polygynous species female partner polyandrous species often tend spread look mates potentially find better mates increased level movement among populations leads increased gene flow populations effectively making geographically distinct populations genetically similar ones via observed species rodents generally promiscuous species quickly differentiated monogamous polygamous taxa prominent introduction monogamous behaviors populations species showing swift evolutionary effects different mating systems specifically monogamous populations speciated times faster lower extinction rates non monogamous another way monogamy potential cause increased speciation individuals selective partners competition causing different nearby populations species stop interbreeding much leading speciation another potential effect polyandry particular increasing quality offspring reducing probability reproductive many possible reasons one possibilities greater genetic variation families offspring family either different mother reduces potential harm done inbreeding siblings less closely related genetically diverse additionally increased genetic diversity among generations levels reproductive fitness also variable easier select positive traits quickly difference fitness members generation would greater many males actively mating polyandry decrease risk extinction well increase effective population size increased effective population sizes stable less prone

unicellular animals plants form tissues eukaryotes emerged evolution billion years earliest eukaryotes likely protists mating sexual reproduction widespread among extant eukaryotes based phylogenetic analysis dacks proposed facultative sex present common ancestor eukaryotes however many biologists seemed unlikely recently mating sex could primordial fundamental characteristic eukaryotes principal reason view mating sex appeared lacking certain pathogenic protists whose ancestors branched early eukaryotic family tree however several protists known capable recently capability meiosis hence mating cite one example common intestinal parasite giardia intestinalis considered descendant protist lineage predated emergence meiosis sex however g intestinalis recently found core set genes
