sleep animals refers behavioral physiological state characterized altered consciousness reduced responsiveness external stimuli homeostatic regulation observed various animals sleep observed mammals birds reptiles amphibians fish form insects even simpler animals nematodes internal circadian clock promotes sleep night diurnal organisms humans day nocturnal organisms rodents sleep patterns vary widely among species appears requirement mammals animals sleep follow physiological behavioral definition physiological sense sleep state characterized reversible unconsciousness special brainwave patterns sporadic eye movement loss muscle tone possibly exceptions see regarding sleep birds aquatic mammals compensatory increase following deprivation state last known sleep homeostasis ie longer waking state lasts greater intensity duration sleep state behavioral sense sleep characterized minimal movement nonresponsiveness external stimuli ie increased sensory threshold adoption typical
