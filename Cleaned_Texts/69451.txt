paresthesia abnormal sensation skin tingling pricking chilling burning numbness apparent physical paresthesia may transient chronic may many possible underlying paresthesias usually painless occur anywhere body commonly occur arms familiar kind paresthesia sensation known pins needles limb fall asleep less wellknown uncommon paresthesia formication sensation insects crawling skin paresthesias hands feet legs arms common transient symptoms briefest electric shock type paresthesia caused tweaking ulnar nerve near elbow phenomenon colloquially known bumping ones funny bone similar brief shocks experienced nerve tweaked eg pinched neck nerve may cause brief shocklike paresthesia toward scalp older age group spinal column irregularities may tweak spinal cord briefly head back turned flexed extended brief uncommon positions lhermittes signcitation needed common everyday cause temporary restriction nerve impulses area nerves commonly caused leaning resting parts body legs often followed pins needles tingling sensation causes include conditions hyperventilation syndrome panic attacks cold sore outside mouth canker sore inside mouth preceded tingling due activity causative herpes simplex virus varicella zoster virus shingles also notably may cause recurring pain tingling skin tissue along distribution path nerve commonly skin along dermatome pattern sometimes feeling like headache chest abdominal pain pelvic paincitation needed common examples occur sustained pressure applied nerve inhibiting stimulating function removing pressure typically results gradual relief pressureinduced paraesthesia results awkward posture engaging crosslegged sitting prolonged periods reactive hyperaemia occurs blood flow restored period ischemia may accompanied paresthesia eg patients raynauds disease rewarm cold cases paresthesia also reported varying frequencies following vaccine intake chronic paresthesia bergers bernhardt indicates either problem functioning neurons poor circulationcitation needed older individualsdefine paresthesia often result poor circulation limbs peripheral vascular disease often caused atherosclerosis buildup plaque within artery walls decades eventual plaque ruptures internal clots ruptures subsequent clot healing leaving behind narrowing closure artery openings locally andor downstream smaller branches without proper supply blood nutrients nerve cells longer adequately send signals brain paresthesia also symptom vitamin deficiency malnutrition well metabolic disorders like diabetes hypothyroidism hypoparathyroidism also symptom mercury poisoningcitation needed irritation nerve also come inflammation tissue joint conditions rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis carpal tunnel syndrome common sources paresthesia nerves head may compressed chronic neck spine problems exist caused among things muscle cramps may result clinical anxiety excessive mental stresscitation needed bone disease poor posture unsafe heavy lifting practices physical trauma whiplash paresthesia also caused simply putting pressure nerve applying weight pressure limb extended periods timecitation needed another cause paresthesia may direct damage nerves ie neuropathy stem injury frostbite infections lyme disease may indicative current neurological disorder neuropathy also side effect chemotherapies case chemotherapyinduced peripheral benzodiazepine withdrawal may also cause paresthesia drug removal leaves gaba receptors stripped bare possibly malformedclarification neededcitation needed chronic paresthesia sometimes symptomatic serious conditions transient ischemic attack autoimmune diseases multiple sclerosis complex regional pain syndrome lupus erythematosuscitation needed use fluoroquinolones also cause stroke survivors traumatic brain injury tbi may experience paresthesia damage central nervous systemcitation needed varicella zoster virus disease shingles attack nerves causing numbness instead pain commonly associated shinglescitation needed acroparesthesia severe pain extremities may caused fabry disease type also sign dental paresthesia loss sensation caused maxillary mandibular anesthetic administration dental potential causes include trauma introduced nerve sheath administration injection hemorrhage sheath sideeffectprone types anesthetic used administration anesthetic contaminated alcohol sterilizing causes may include nerve conduction study usually provides useful information making diagnosis mri ct scan sometimes used rule certain causes stemming central nervous system issuescitation needed medications offered include immunosuppressant prednisone intravenous gamma globulin ivig anticonvulsants gabapentin tiagabine antiviral medication depending underlying causemedical citation needed addition treatment underlying disorder palliative care include use topical numbing creams lidocaine prilocaine ketamine also successfully used generally approved insurance careful consideration must taken apply necessary amount excess contribute conditions otherwise products generally offer extremely effective shortlasting relief conditions paresthesia caused stroke may receive temporary benefit high doses baclofen multiple times daycitation needed hiv patients selfmedicate cannabis report reduces paresthesia caused shingles treated appropriate antiviral word
