neuritis njʊəˈraɪtɪs inflammation general inflammation peripheral nervous system inflammation frequently concomitant cause impaired transmission neural signals leads aberrant nerve function neuritis often conflated neuropathy broad term describing disease process affects peripheral nervous system however neuropathies may due either noninflammatory term encompasses form damage degeneration dysfunction neuritis refers specifically inflammatory process inflammation common reaction biological insult many conditions may present features neuritis common causes include autoimmune diseases multiple sclerosis infection either bacterial leprosy viral varicella zoster postinfectious immune reactions guillainbarré syndrome response physical injury frequently seen nerve body may undergo specific etiologies may preferentially affect specific nature symptoms depends specific nerves involved neuritis sensory nerve may cause pain paresthesia pinsandneedles hypoesthesia numbness anesthesia neuritis motor nerve may cause paresis weakness fasiculation paralysis muscle wasting treatment neuritis centers around removing managing inciting cause inflammation followed supportive care antiinflammatory immune modulatory treatments well symptomatic management active infections postinfectious autoimmune processes cause rapid identification infectious cause neuritis dictates treatment approach often much positive long term prognosis bacterial viral spirochete infections associated inflammatory neural responses bacterial agents associated neuritis leprosy lyme disease diphtheria viral causes neuritis include herpes simplex virus varicella zoster virus hiv leprosy frequently characterized direct neural infection causative organism mycobacterium leprosy presents heterogeneous clinical picture dictated bacterial titer inborn host tuberculoid leprosy seen cases host immunity high commonly associated neuritis presents low number anesthetic anhydrotic skin plaques bacilli result granulomatous process destroys cutaneous lepromatous leprosy seen host lacks resistance organism presents widespread skin lesions palpably enlarged disease involvement form leprosy characteristically progresses cooler regions body tip nose ear lobes towards warmer regions body eventually resulting extensive loss sensation destructive skin lesions rapid treatment critical component care patients affected leprosy delayed care results permanent loss sensation tissue damage requires extensive treatment lyme disease caused spirochete borrelia burgdorferi tickborne illness peripheral central neurological manifestations first stage lyme disease frequently presents pathognomonic bulls eye rash erythema migrans well fever malaise arthralgias roughly untreated patients develop neurological manifestations classically characterized cranial neuropathy radiculoneuritis lymphocytic nerve inflammation seen neurological lyme disease associated lymphoctyic infiltrate without evidence direct infection peripheral commonly selflimiting treatment antibiotics may hasten resolution diphtheria common childhood respiratory infection produces neurotoxin result biphasic neuropathy begins paralysis numbness soft palate pharynx well bulbar weakness several days weeks initial upper respiratory infection followed ascending flaccid paralysis caused acute inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy several antibiotics effective eradicating bacterium neurological sequelae infection must treated diphtheria herpes simplex virus common virus latently resides neuronal ganglia active infections commonly resides cranial nerve ganglia particularly trigeminal ganglia may cause painful neuralgias active periods also associated bells palsy vestibular frequently lies within lumbosacral ganglia associated radiculopathies active herpes reactivation often treated acyclovir although evidence efficacy controlling peripheral neurological manifestation disease remain varicella zoster virus cause chickenpox found dormant throughout nervous system initial infection reactivation virus cause herpes zoster commonly known shingles seen dermatomal cranial nerve distribution corresponding ganglion latent virus resided herpetic rash resolves additional period postherpetic neuralgia may persist weeks antiviral medications including acyclovir effective controlling viral reactivation management ensuing neuropathic often requires management possibly including gabapentin amitriptyline carbamazepine topical hiv associated broad range neurological manifestations acute infection progression disease acute infection direct peripheral nervous involvement commonly bilateral facial palsy acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy guillianbarré syndrome reported disease process progresses diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome may include lymphocytic inflammation peripheral nerves results painful symmetric polyneuropathy immune dysfunction course
