obstruction bowel strangulation tissue although umbilical hernias hiatus hernias may watched treated abdominal hernias surgically repaired surgery complications prior surgery patients medically optimized receive guidance changing factors controlled quitting smoking managing medical conditions like diabetes effectively working losing weight three primary methods utilized open surgery laparoscopy robotic techniques fixing inguinal hernia using laparoscopy causes less pain speeds recovery shows similar low rates hernia coming back compared traditional open repair method however open surgery done sometimes without general anesthesia using local anesthesia open groin hernia repair particularly patients additional health issues leads fewer complications reduced studies show compared regional general anesthesia local anesthesia results less postoperative pain shorter recovery times decreased unplanned overnight however might enough repairing large hernias patients abdominal domain loss general anesthesia preferred robotassisted hernia surgery also recently gained popularity safe alternatives open surgery robotic surgery inguinal hernia repair shows outcomes comparable laparoscopic surgery rates overall complications longlasting postoperative pain urinary retention readmission similar two like areas general surgery noted robotic surgery inguinal hernia repair takes time operating room compared laparoscopic uncomplicated hernias principally repaired pushing back reducing herniated tissue mending weakness muscle tissue operation called herniorrhaphy complications occurred surgeon check viability herniated organ remove part necessary muscle reinforcement techniques often involve synthetic materials mesh mesh placed either defect anterior repair defect posterior repair times staples used keep mesh place mesh repair methods often called tension free repairs unlike suture methods eg shouldice muscle pulled together tension however widely used terminology misleading many tensionfree suture methods use mesh eg desarda guarnieri liptonestrin etc evidence suggests tensionfree methods without mesh often lower percentage recurrences fastest recovery period compared tension suture methods however use prosthetic mesh appears higher likelihood causing longterm pain also lead frequency surgical correction ranges per uk per elective surgery mortality rate inguinal femoral hernia repair stands percent increases percent urgent bowel resection part hernia repair mortality rate even older age femoral hernias female sex urgent repair identified factors
