kidneys pair organs excretory system vertebrates maintains balance water electrolytes body osmoregulation filters blood removes metabolic waste products many vertebrates also produces hormones particular renin maintains blood healthy vertebrates kidneys maintain homeostasis extracellular fluid blood filtered kidneys form urine consists water excess unnecessary substances urine excreted body organs vertebrates depending species may include ureter urinary bladder cloaca vertebrates kidneys kidneys main organ allows species adapt different environments including fresh salt water terrestrial
