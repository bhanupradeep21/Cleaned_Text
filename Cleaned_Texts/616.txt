behçets disease recognized disease cause inflammatory perivasculitis inflammation tissue around blood lymph vessel practically tissue body usually prevalent symptoms include canker sores ulcers mouth genitals inflammation parts addition patients experience severe headache papulopustular skin lesions well disease first described turkish dermatologist dr hulusi behçet behçets disease prevalent middle east far east regions however rare america behçets disease neurological involvement neurobehçets disease nbd involves central nervous system damage high variation range due study design definition neurological involvement ethnic geographic variation availability neurological expertise investigations treatment protocols initial signs symptoms nbd usually general makes nbd hard diagnose patients experience severe neurological damage addition combination symptoms varies among patients main symptom meningoencephalitis happens nbd patients general symptoms behçets disease also present among parenchymal nbd patients fever headache genital ulcers genital scars skin lesions brainstem affected ophthalmoparesis cranial neuropathy cerebellar pyramidal dysfunction may observed cerebral hemispheric involvement may result encephalopathy hemiparesis hemisensory loss seizures dysphasia mental changes including cognitive dysfunction psychosis spinal cord involvement pyramidal

nonparenchymal nbd targets vascular structures symptoms arise area main clinical characteristic cerebral venous thrombosis cvt one experiences cvt clot one blood vessels brain blocks blood flow may result stroke happens dural venous sinuses strokelike symptoms confusion weakness dizziness may monitored headache tends worsen period several days less common symptoms include intracranial hypertension intracranial aneurysms cause behçets disease unknown cause responsible neurobehçets disease unknown well inflammation starts mainly due immune system failure however one knows factors trigger initiation autoimmune disease like inflammation cause unknown impossible eliminate prevent source causes disease therefore treatments focused suppress symptoms hinder daily life although diagnostic criterion behçets disease one neurobehçets disease exist three diagnostic tools mainly used japanese turkish patients tested possess hlab serotype patients showed times risk getting bd

corticosteroids given infusions intravenous methylprednisolone followed slowly tapering course oral steroids suggested therapy continued period time even symptoms get suppressed early relapse may occur sometimes medical doctors may suggest different steroid depending nature disease severity response steroids according several studies parenchymal nbd patients successfully suppress symptoms
