tissues structure determined shapes sizes macromolecules around cells proteins nucleic acids performing protective role fixatives denature proteins coagulation forming additive compounds combination coagulation additive processes compound adds chemically macromolecules stabilizes structure effectively able combine parts two different macromolecules effect known crosslinking fixation tissue done several reasons one reason kill tissue postmortem decay autolysis putrefaction fixation preserves biological material tissue cells close natural state possible process preparing tissue examination achieve several conditions usually must met first fixative usually acts disable intrinsic proteolytic otherwise digest damage sample second fixative typically protects sample extrinsic damage fixatives toxic common microorganisms bacteria particular might exist tissue sample might otherwise colonize fixed tissue addition many fixatives chemically alter fixed material make less palatable either indigestible toxic opportunistic microorganisms finally fixatives often alter cells tissues molecular level increase mechanical strength stability increased strength rigidity help preserve morphology shape structure sample processed analysis even careful fixation alter sample introduce artifacts interfere interpretation cellular ultrastructure prominent example bacterial mesosome thought organelle grampositive bacteria later shown new techniques developed electron microscopy simply artifact chemical standardization fixation tissue processing procedures takes introduction artifacts account establishing procedures introduce kinds artifacts researchers know types artifacts expect tissue type processing technique accurately interpret sections artifacts choose techniques minimize artifacts areas interest fixation usually first stage multistep process prepare sample biological material microscopy analysis therefore choice fixative fixation protocol may depend additional processing steps final analyses planned example immunohistochemistry uses antibodies bind specific protein target prolonged fixation chemically mask targets prevent antibody binding cases quick fix method using cold formalin around hours typically used methanol also used quick fixation time vary depending biological material example mdamb human breast cancer cells fixed minutes cold methanol enzyme localization studies tissues either prefixed lightly postfixed enzyme activity product formed generally three types fixation processes depending sample needs fixed heat fixation used fixation single cell organisms commonly bacteria archaea organisms typically mixed water physiological saline helps evenly spread sample diluted sample spread onto microscope slide diluted bacteria sample commonly referred smear placed slide smear dried room temperature slide gripped tongs clothespin passed flame bunsen burner several times heatkill adhere organism slide microincinerating device also used heating samples typically stained imaged using heat fixation generally preserves overall morphology internal structures heat denatures proteolytic enzyme prevents autolysis heat fixation used capsular stain method heat fixation shrink destroy capsule glycocalyx seen immersion used fix histological samples single cell entire organism sample tissue immersed fixative solution set period time fixative solution must volume least times greater volume order fixation successful fixative must diffuse throughout entire tissue tissue size density well type fixative must considered common technique cellular applications used larger tissues well using larger sample means must immersed longer fixative reach deeper perfusion passage fluid blood vessels natural channels organ organism tissue fixation via perfusion fixative pumped circulatory system usually needle inserted left ventricle done via ultrasound guidance opening chest cavity fixative injected heart injection volume matching typical cardiac output using innate circulatory system fixative distributed throughout entire body tissue doesnt die fixed method used drainage port must also added somewhere circulatory system account addition volume fixative buffer typically done right atrium fixative pumped circulatory system replaced blood using perfusion advantage preserving disadvantages subject dies volume fixative needed larger organisms high potentially raising costs possible decrease necessary volume fluid perform perfusion fixation pinching arteries feed tissues interest research involved perfusion fixation commonly used image brain lung kidney tissues rodents also used performing autopsies immersion perfusion fixation processes chemical fixatives used preserve structures state chemically structurally close living tissue possible requires chemical fixative crosslinking fixatives act creating covalent chemical bonds proteins tissue anchors soluble proteins cytoskeleton lends additional rigidity tissue preservation transient fine cytoskeletal structure contractions embryonic differentiation waves best achieved pretreatment using microwaves addition cross linking commonly used fixative histology formaldehyde usually used neutral buffered formalin nbf approx formaldehyde phosphate buffer ph since formaldehyde gas room temperature formalin formaldehyde gas dissolved water wv used making former fixative formaldehyde fixes tissue crosslinking proteins primarily residues basic amino acid lysine effects reversible excess water avoids formalin pigmentation paraformaldehyde also commonly used depolymerize back formalin heated also making effective fixative benefits paraformaldehyde include long term storage good tissue penetration particularly good immunohistochemistry techniques formaldehyde vapor also used fixative cell smears another popular aldehyde fixation glutaraldehyde operates similarly formaldehyde causing deformation proteins Î±helices however glutaraldehyde larger molecule formaldehyde permeates membranes slowly consequently glutaraldehyde fixation thicker tissue samples difficult troubleshot reducing size tissue sample one advantages glutaraldehyde fixation may offer rigid tightly linked fixed greater length two aldehyde groups allow bridge link distant pairs protein molecules causes rapid irreversible changes well suited electron microscopy works well gives best overall cytoplasmic nuclear detail however ideal immunohistochemistry staining fixation protocols call combination formaldehyde glutaraldehyde respective strengths complement one another crosslinking fixatives especially formaldehyde tend preserve secondary structure proteins may also preserve tertiary structure precipitating denaturing fixatives act reducing solubility protein molecules often disrupting hydrophobic interactions give many proteins tertiary structure precipitation aggregation proteins different process crosslinking occurs aldehyde fixatives common precipitating fixatives ethanol methanol commonly used fix frozen sections smears acetone also used shown produce better histological preservation frozen sections employed acetone methylbenzoate xylene amex technique proteindenaturing methanol ethanol acetone rarely used alone fixing blocks unless studying nucleic acids acetic acid denaturant sometimes used combination precipitating fixatives davidsons alcohols known cause considerable shrinkage hardening tissue fixation acetic acid alone associated tissue swelling combining two may result better preservation tissue morphology oxidizing fixatives react side chains proteins biomolecules allowing formation crosslinks stabilize tissue structure however cause extensive denaturation despite preserving fine cell structure used mainly secondary fixatives osmium tetroxide often used secondary fixative samples prepared electron microscopy used light microscopy penetrates thick sections tissue poorly potassium dichromate chromic acid potassium permanganate find use certain specific histological preparations mercurials zenkers fixative unknown mechanism increases staining brightness give excellent nuclear detail despite fast mercurials penetrate poorly produce tissue shrinkage best application fixation hematopoietic reticuloendothelial tissues also note since contain mercury care must taken disposal picrates penetrate tissue well react histones basic proteins form crystalline picrates amino acids precipitate proteins good fixative connective tissue preserves glycogen well extracts lipids give superior results formaldehyde immunostaining biogenic polypeptide hormones however causes loss basophils unless specimen thoroughly washed following fixation hepesglutamic acid buffermediated organic
