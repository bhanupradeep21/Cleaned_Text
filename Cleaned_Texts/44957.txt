interstitial fluid causes arterial vasoconstriction thus increases bodys mean arterial blood pressure renin commonly referred hormone albeit receptor prorenin receptor also known renin receptor prorenin receptor see also well enzymatic activity hydrolyzes angiotensinogen angiotensin primary structure renin precursor consists amino acids pre prosegment carrying amino acids respectively mature renin contains amino acids mass enzyme renin secreted pericytes vicinity afferent arterioles similar microvessels kidney specialized cells juxtaglomerular juxtaglomerular cells response three stimuli

muscle therefore raises resistance posed arteries heart cardiac output blood pressure rise angiotensin ii also acts adrenal glands releases aldosterone stimulates epithelial cells distal tubule collecting ducts kidneys increase reabsorption sodium exchanging potassium maintain electrochemical neutrality water leading raised blood volume raised blood pressure ras also acts cns increase water
