treatment methods accomplish goals includes segregating bio waste biomedical waste often incinerated efficient incinerator destroy pathogens sharps source materials recognizable resulting ash alternative thermal treatment also include technologies pyrolysis including energy recovery similar waste volume reductions pathogen destruction autoclave may also used treat biomedical waste autoclave uses steam pressure sterilize waste reduce microbiological load level may safely disposed many healthcare facilities routinely use autoclave sterilize medical supplies autoclave used sterilize supplies treat biomedical waste administrative controls must used prevent waste operations contaminating supplies effective administrative controls include operator training strict

old existing technologies autoclaves microwave based disinfection less cycle time power consumption requires minimal usage water consumables compared autoclaves liquids small quantities solution bleach used disinfect biomedical waste solutions sodium hydroxide chemical disinfectants may also used depending wastes characteristics treatment methods include heat alkaline digesters use microwaves
