anatomy clitoris nonhumans clitoris especially developed apes lemurs like penis many nonhuman placental mammals often contains small bone females bone known os clitoris exists species birds male counterpart intersex female bears mate give birth tip clitoris species grizzly bears brown bears american black bears polar bears although bears described birth canal runs clitoris rather forming separate vagina feature estimated make percent bears scientists state female spotted hyenas nonhermaphroditic female mammals devoid external vaginal opening whose sexual anatomy distinct usual intersex spider monkeys clitoris especially developed interior passage urethra makes almost identical penis retains distributes urine droplets female spider monkey moves around scholar alan f dixson stated urine voided bases clitoris flows shallow groove perineal surface held skin folds side spider monkeys south america pendulous erectile clitorises long enough mistaken penis researchers observers species look scrotum determine animals sex similar approach identify scentmarking glands may also present clitoris erects squirrel monkeys dominance displays indirectly influences squirrel monkeys reproductive clitoris bonobos larger externalized natalie angier said young adolescent female bonobo maybe half weight human teenager clitoris three times bigger human equivalent visible enough waggle unmistakably female bonobos often engage practice genitalgenital gg rubbing nonhuman form tribadism human females engage ethologist jonathan balcombe stated female bonobos rub clitorises together rapidly ten twenty seconds behavior may repeated rapid succession usually accompanied grinding shrieking clitoral engorgement added average engage practice every two hours bonobos sometimes mate facetoface evolutionary biologist marlene zuk suggested position clitoris bonobos primates evolved maximize stimulation sexual female spotted hyenas sometimes referred hermaphrodites scientists ancient later historical times believed modern scientists refer designation typically reserved simultaneously exhibit features genetic makeup female spotted hyenas clearly distinct male spotted female spotted hyenas clitoris percent long diameter male penis millimeters long millimeters pseudopenis formation seems largely androgenindependent appears female fetus differentiation fetal ovary adrenal spotted hyenas highly erectile clitoris complete false scrotum author john c wingfield stated resemblance male genitalia close sex determined confidence palpation pseudopenis also distinguished males genitalia greater thickness rounded female possesses external vagina labia fused form pseudoscrotum females scrotum consists soft adipose like male spotted hyenas regard penises female spotted hyenas small penile spines head clitorises scholar catherine blackledge pl said makes clitoris tip feel like soft sandpaper added clitoris extends away body sleek slender arc measuring average cm root tip like penis fully erectile raising head hyena greeting ceremonies social displays games rough tumble sniffing due higher levels androgen exposure fetal development female hyenas significantly muscular aggressive male counterparts socialwise higher rank males dominant dominant alpha females exposed higher levels androgen average become higherranking female peers subordinate females lick clitorises higherranked females sign submission obedience females also lick others clitorises greeting strengthen social bonds contrast males lick clitorises dominant females females lick penises males males considered lowest urethra vagina female spotted hyena exit clitoris allowing females urinate copulate give birth trait makes mating laborious male mammals also makes attempts sexually coerce physically force sexual activity females joan roughgarden ecologist evolutionary biologist said hyenas clitoris higher belly vagina mammals male hyena must slide rear female mating penis lines clitoris action similar pushing shirtsleeve female retracts pseudopenis creates opening male inserts male must practice act take couple months successfully female spotted hyenas exposed larger doses androgen significantly damaged ovaries making difficult giving birth pseudopenis stretched loses much original aspects becomes slackwalled reduced prepuce enlarged orifice split approximately females die first time giving birth species firstborn young many species talpid moles exhibit peniform clitorises tunneled urethra found erectile tissue notably species talpa genus found unique clade presence ovotestes wherein female ovary also mostly made sterile testicular tissue secretes testosterone small portion gonad containing ovarian tissue genetic studies revealed females xx genotype translocated ylinked detailed developmental studies talpa occidentalis revealed female gonads develop testislike pattern gene regulates development sertoli cells found expressed female germ cells meiosis however sertoli cells present fullydeveloped ovotestes additionally female germ cells enter meiosis postnatally phenomenon found eutherian phylogenetic analyses suggested like lemuroids trait must evolved common ancestor clade turned different talpid female european moles highly territorial allow males territory outside breeding season probable cause behavior high levels testosterone secreted female nonbreeding season vaginal opening covered skin akin condition seen mouse dwarf researchers studying peripheral central afferent pathways feline clitoris concluded afferent neurons projecting clitoris
