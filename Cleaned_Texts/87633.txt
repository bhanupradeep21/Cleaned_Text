pancoast tumor tumor apex lung type lung cancer defined primarily location situated top end either right left lung typically spreads nearby tissues ribs vertebrae pancoast tumors nonsmallcell lung cancers growing tumor cause compression many nearby structures brachiocephalic vein subclavian artery phrenic nerve recurrent laryngeal nerve vagus nerve characteristically compression sympathetic ganglion stellate ganglion result various presenting symptoms notably range symptoms known horners syndrome due compression nearby sympathetic nerves pancoast tumors named henry pancoast american radiologist first described though many advances treatment made since initial categorization pancoast tumors remain difficult treat due low rates possible surgical intervention therefore prognosis still pancoast tumor first described hare tumor involving certain tumor described detail henry pancoast radiologist philadelphia published article reported studied many cases apical chest tumors

conditions arthritis shoulder pain one symptoms might indicate imaging though chest xray good screening test might first mode imaging used easily seen early stages disease due size location following initial imaging ct scan mri preferred since provide details information size lymph node involvement areas invasion vascular biopsy lesion typically required order confirm diagnosis provide information regarding histology molecular markers turn allow assess best course treatment currently sensitive method percutaneous transthoracic needle important consider possible causes similar physical presentation pancoast tumor conditions consider part differential diagnosis include pancoast tumors staged similarly nonsmall cell lung cancers using tumor node metastasis tnm system well numbers indicate time diagnosis due difficulty early detection imaging pancoast tumors usually staged level due invasion chest wall local nerve advances treatment research greatly improved survival rates time yet due later detection pancoast tumors prognosis disease still always favorable varies depending various factors time detection extent invasion tumor lymph node involvement whether tumor currently five year prognosis average patients earlystage surgically resectable pancoast unfortunately less tumors found patients actually surgically resectable leading poorer treatment pancoast lung cancer may differ types nonsmallcell lung cancer current standard treatment combination chemotherapy radiotherapy followed surgical though complete tumor resection recommended position close proximity vital
