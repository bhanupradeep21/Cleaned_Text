terrazzo composite material poured place precast used floor wall treatments consists chips marble quartz granite glass suitable material poured cementitious binder chemical binding polymeric physical binding combination metal strips often divide sections changes color material pattern additional chips may sprinkled atop mix sets cured ground polished smooth otherwise finished produce uniformly

cementitious terrazzo include wider selection colors inch mm installation thickness lighter weight faster installation impermeable finish higher strength less susceptibility cracking disadvantage epoxy terrazzo used interior exterior applications epoxybased terrazzo lose color slightly peel used outdoors whereas cementbased terrazzo addition marble aggregate blends aggregates used mother pearl

place individual pieces decorative pattern instead small pieces thrown mortar base creating uniform surface appearance decorative patterns created using dividers creates lines different colored terrazzo mixtures cracking common form failure typically caused structural system supports terrazzo rather material contact alkalis acids deteriorate bonding agents used terrazzo aggregates often marble dust calcium carbonate strong acid also cause deterioration aggregates partial replacement necessary bracketing system mixing matching different chips used create potential aged terrazzo
