flow waveform human respiratory system lung ventilators shape air flow blown patients airways computer technology allows practitioner select particular flow patterns along volume pressure settings order achieve best patient outcomes reduce complications experienced mechanical ventilator modern lung ventilators able generate three basic wave forms flow squared waveform descending waveform sinusoidal waveform square waveform pattern found mechanical ventilators old new achieves constant flow inspiration phase flow rate rises predetermined level remains constant thus giving appearance square wave form produces shortest inspiratory time compared flow patterns decelerating flow waveform pattern also known descending ramp achieves highest level flow start breath patient flow demand often respiratory system article stub help wikipedia expanding httpsenwikipediaorgwikiflowwaveform
