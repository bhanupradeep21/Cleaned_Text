perinatal stroke disease infant stroke day gestation period postpartum affecting live disease divided three subgroups namely neonatal arterial ischemic stroke neonatal cerebral sinovenous ischemic stroke presumed perinatal several risk factors contribute perinatal stroke including birth trauma placental abruption infections mothers detection diagnosis perinatal stroke often delayed due prenatal onset inadequacy neonatal signs child may asymptomatic early stages life may develop common signs perinatal stroke seizures poor coordination speech delays get diagnostic tests magnetic resonance imaging electroencephalogram blood tests conducted doctors suspect patients developed signs perinatal prognosis disease associated severity development disease treated anticoagulant anticonvulsant drugs surgical procedures therapeutic hypothermia depending condition neonatal arterial ischemic stroke occurs blood vessels brain partly completely blocked situation normally affects middle cerebral arterial subgroup perinatal stroke affects babies live recent multinational cohort study showed stroke succeeding deficits caused death patients suffering neonatal arterial ischemic risk factors maternal gestational diabetes record miscarriage experiences increase occurrence neonatal arterial ischemic however definitive etiology neonatal arterial ischemic stroke remains uncertain neonatal cerebral sinovenous ischemic stroke disease cerebral venous system caused thrombosis region hinder outflow venous system causing surge central venous lead intracranial hypertension cerebral ischemia wide spreading hemorrhage may result permanent neurologic disease incidence rate every babies per however mortality due neonatal cerebral sinovenous ischemic stroke rather presumed perinatal stroke condition stroke diagnosed neonatal period significance neurological examination within days majority infants later diagnosed presumed perinatal stroke free symptoms neonatal timing stroke occurs varies day pregnancy period postpartum day among infants suffering presumed perinatal infants normally suffer arterial strokes white matter venous infarctions may variability underlying mechanisms risk factors perinatal stroke correlated various risk factors infants including birth trauma placental disorders infections mothers birth trauma mechanical trauma fetal head neck cause stroke damaging arteries children may arteries damaged trauma inflammation leaving rough jagged inner lining blood clots get stuck clots build enough eventually artery clogged blood flow addition vascular damage trauma fetal head excessive uterine activity manipulation pressure forceps vacuum application via direct occlusion vasospasm cause perinatal ischemic hypoxicischemic encephalopathy also known birth asphyxia arises oxygen deprivation womb hie results placental abruption umbilical cord problems uterine rupture failure identify abnormal heart rate medical placental disorders associated perinatal stroke range anatomical site degree implantation placenta placentamaternal effects fetal infections like chorioamnionitis cause infection maternal blood commonly leading premature birth newborn experiencing brain damage meningitis infections include neonatal sepsis immune system reacts affecting organs tissues resulting meningitis seizures cerebral mothers health also associated perinatal stroke factors include blood clotting disorders congenital heart diseases prenatal cocaine blood clotting disorders hemophilia b result low clotting factor quantities leading heavy bleedingmedical citation needed congenital heart disease perinatal stroke results disruption blood flow obstruction blood vessel however various infants still experience perinatal stroke normal pregnancy studies shown sometimes lack direct cause many infants many infants asymptomatic older symptoms speech delays balance difficulties asymmetrical weakness become apparent signs experienced asymmetrical weakness infants favor one hand due cerebral palsy arises lesions central nervous infants give indications stroke womb shortly birth commonly experience infant seizure experience jerking face legs arms alongside delayed seizures mostly caused hypoxicischemic encephalopathy hie perinatal doctors use diagnostic tests determine infant stroke clinical presentation stroke first diagnostic tests used imaging techniques diagnostic tests eeg echo blood tests genetic tests carried depending symptoms portrayed perinatal stroke diagnosed medical imaging techniques present brains image usage diffusionweighted imaging magnetic resonance imaging effective early diagnosis perinatal computerized tomography ct also commonly used diagnostic technique medical imaging techniques show bleeding blockage brain detect damage caused ischemic stroke hemorrhages brain magnetic resonance imaging clinically preferred computerized tomography highlight brains blood addition perinatal stroke challenging classify computerized tomography neonatal brain higher water however certain situations inability transport unstable infants severe respiratory cardiac disorders intensive care unit cranial ultrasound used alternative magnetic resonance cranial ultrasound identify intracranial hemorrhage intraventricular hemorrhage large cerebral sinus venous thrombosis along brains blood seizures associated perinatal stroke normally focal include rhythmic contractions arm findings eeg portray slow isolated spikewave patterns region dead tissue resulting blood supply abnormality heart rate detected echocardiogram creates detailed image heart utilising sound waves method locates clots source heart migrated brain resulted blood tests examine various factors leading perinatal strokes signs infections clotting conditions coagulation disorders include tests clotting disorders thrombophilia inflammatory genetic tests examine hereditary risk factors blood clots leading stroke genetic screening recommended patients family history perinatal strokes severity determines prognosis infants experienced perinatal stroke also diagnosed cerebral infants greater stroke severities involvement structures precentral gyrus wernickes area critical infants survived perinatal stroke may develop disabilities like cerebral palsy sensory dysfunctions adhd visual hearing prognosis correlated progression symptoms treatments allow infants recover quickly reduces chance suffering longterm disabilities clinical practice limited treatments available treating perinatal medications commonly prescribed alleviate symptoms caused disease surgery therapeutic hypothermia required treat hemorrhagic stroke perinatal stage anticoagulants medications interfere synthesis function several clotting factors present medications commonly used decrease possibility blood clotting babies brain medical history perinatal drugs taken upon expression identifiable risk factors perinatal stroke multiple cerebral emboli severe examples anticoagulants used heparin common side effects anticoagulants low platelet counts gastrointestinal bleeding stomach anticonvulsants drugs alter level neurotransmitters gaba synapses also affect concentration ions neurons altering activity na k cl ion channels neuronal cell modifications alter electrical impulses conductivity amplifying inhibition reducing excitation anticonvulsants benzodiazepines phenytoin carbamazepine commonly used controlling epilepsy due perinatal stroke adverse effects medications include headaches dizziness vision decompression craniectomy procedure commonly used alleviate pressure brain removing pooling blood caused ischemic stroke perinatal surgeons first remove skin tissues top site injury revealing small hole made skull allow stop bleeding sealing later temporal lobectomy procedure removes parts anterior temporal lobe treating seizures due perinatal patients undergone surgery seizurefree show significant improvement controlling therapeutic hypothermia process reduces metabolism induces selfrepairing brain cooling method also cause constriction blood vessels brain reducing probability reacting hyperactive responses aggravate brain damage procedure proven effective reducing possibility major neurological disability mortality carried hours may problematic infants express identifiable symptoms perinatal stroke new direction treating perinatal stroke combining therapeutic hypothermia growth factor medications likely improve condition infants suffering httpsenwikipediaorgwikiperinatalstroke
