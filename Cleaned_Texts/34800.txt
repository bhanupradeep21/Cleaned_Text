myocardial bridge mb congenital heart defect one coronary arteries tunnels heart muscle myocardium normal patients coronary arteries rest top heart muscle feed blood smaller vessels ex septal arteries take blood heart muscle ie populate throughout myocardium however band muscle forms around one coronary arteries fetal stage development myocardial bridge formed bridge heart muscle artery time heart squeezes pump blood band muscle exerts pressure constricts artery reducing blood flow heart defect present birth important note even thin ex mm andor short ex mm mb cause significant symptoms mbs range mm length cm overall prevalence myocardial bridge although prevalence found autopsy much higher many people tiny myocardial bridges cause symptoms others longer andor deeper bridges causing significant symptoms including children example patients run exercise others exercise despite symptoms shortness breath feelings tightness chest still others find improvement symptoms exercise many competitive athletes severe myocardial bridges unroofing symptoms myocardial bridges differ slightly patient patient depending length depth location bridge common symptoms myocardial bridges cause numerous complications often misunderstood medical community condition include note studies shown plaque form inside myocardial bridges yet virtually always plaque myocardial bridge adults common triggers myocardial bridge symptoms notably high heart rate tachycardia greatly increases ischemia low oxygen heart caused myocardial bridges studies ripa et al shown compressed artery reopens slowly heartbeat thus stays state semicompression diastolic period thus heart rate increases time artery reopen diastolic period decreases dramatically point high heart rates artery never fully reopens blood flow constantly reduced three key tests currently used diagnose myocardial bridges stanford university ct scan cardiac catheterization stress ultrasound much science testing mbs relatively new patients frequently go undiagnosed stanfords center myocardial bridges offered second opinion services distance ten years including numerous international patientscitation needed notably ekg reliable conclusive diagnostic tool diagnosing mbs symptomatic mb patients show normal ekg results others abnormal many doctors suggested need awareness mbs among doctors better testing including testing young people disease congenital according study ripa et al clinical suspicion myocardial bridge would warranted cases typical atypical chest pain subjects low probability atherosclerosis free traditional cardiovascular risk factors particularly article stanford medical centers official blog scope dr ingela schnittger stated many patients heartbreaking stories tell hold job travel take care families cardiologists completely loss know myocardial bridges exist taught benign never cause problems patients go er go lot cardiology tests come back normal told little valium think anxious get belittled taken seriously get really myotomy commonly known unroofing surgery firstline surgical treatment myocardial treatment actually removes myocardial bridge releasing artery compression unroofing surgery today done via open heart sternum thoracotomy ribs also using robotassisted surgery tiny keyholes chest full open heart surgery usually reserved large myocardial bridges andor specific situations make thoracotomy difficult far stanford university done unroofing surgeries hospital world unroofings completed since starting decade ago university chicago surgeon dr husam balkhy emerged provider roboticassisted unroofing surgery patients possible candidates done properly unroofing removes entire band muscle affecting artery restoring blood flow stanford university medical centers study pargaonkar et showed unroofing surgery significantly improves anginal symptoms improves five dimensions saq ie seattle angina questionnaire residual symptoms caused complications lifetime living myocardial bridge may continue unroofing surgery endothelial dysfunction vasospasm plaque narrowed artery however often improve slowly year myocardial bridge gonecitation needed cases occurred various hospitals patients completely unroofed leaving segments mb resulting lingering symptoms critical point endothelial dysfunction vasospasms caused myocardial bridges start heal unroofing surgery done mb continues squeeze artery damaging artery lining bypass surgery first line treatment myocardial bridges two main notably many myocardial bridge patients bypass surgery later need unroofing surgery bypass proved however papers ekeke et al others shown bypass surgery helpful addition supplement unroofing surgery significant plaque proximal myocardial bridge anatomic anomalies increase risk recurrence plaque russian study bockeria et concludes competitive flow problem much likely occur lima artery used graft rather svg svg recommended stents never indicated treatment myocardial bridges trials shown prone breaking artery squeezed unroofing surgery performed united states belgium spain italy england china russia united arab emirates among countries hospitals performed unroofing surgery include st francis hospital heart nyc dr newell robinson many countries including number highly developed countries uk australia new zealand ireland sweden singapore unroofing surgery myocardial bridges remains unavailable condition remains unrecognized medical problem true prevalence mbs still largely unknown studies made vastly different assessments stanford paper rogers et points estimations prevalence mbs vary least part result several key variables including means identification eg computed tomography ct intravascular ultrasound ivus autopsy vessels examined definition bridge applied eg deep bridge vs superficial deep bridges perhaps fundamental variable whether mb even considered unlike hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually obvious pathologist mbs easily obscured epicardial pericardial fat autopsy series estimated prevalence largest autopsy report included subjects found prevalence involved lad one populationbased study ct estimated prevalence result studies others estimated prevalence approximately generally accepted according stanford university medical center mbs often misunderstood doctors may taught condition always result patients often denied treatment great deal science emerged past decade clarify condition particular stanford published articles mbs since one commonly recurring reason denial treatment myth myocardial bridges significantly affect blood flow myth debunked stanford also daoud wafa say normally coronary blood flow occurs systole myocardial bridging systolic event angiography clinical significance relevance questioned however angiographic intravascular ultrasonographic studies demonstrated vessel compression systole followed delay increase luminal diameter diastole thus affecting predominant phase coronary perfusion especially episodes tachycardia data suggest angina acute coronary syndromes arrhythmias patients myocardial bridging may explained reduced ischemic threshold words myocardial bridge compresses artery heart squeezes systolic period time heartbeat cycle fact artery stays compressed long heart relaxes arteries sturdy pliable compressed slow reopen remaining level semicompression diastolic period ie heartbeat cycle hence critical need dffr testing diagnosing myocardial bridges thus coronary artery fully open allow normal blood flow small percentage heartbeat cycle problem exacerbated tachycardia high heart rate bring duration normal blood flow zero explained dr ingela schnittger head myocardial bridge research center stanford appeared bbc radio explain
