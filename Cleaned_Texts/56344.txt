man working kyiv agricultural institute national university life environmental sciences ukraine lysenko found interested agriculture worked different projects one involving effects temperature variation lifecycle plants later led consider might use work convert winter wheat spring wheat named process jarovization russian later translated conversion winter wheat spring wheat new discovery scientific experiments done nikolai vavilov initially supported lysenko encouraged work lysenko difficult time trying grow various crops peas wheat harsh winters however announced success praised soviet newspaper pravda claims discovered method fertilize fields without using fertilizers minerals shown winter crop peas could grown azerbaijan turning barren fields transcaucasus green winter cattle perish poor feeding peasant turk live winter without trembling lysenko worked different wheat crops try convert grow different seasons another area lysenko found interested effect heat plant growth believed every plant needed determinate amount heat throughout lifetime attempted correlate time amount heat required particular plant go various phases development get data looked amount growth many days went temperature days instead measuring actual heat trying determine effects making mistakes statistical analysis data confronted maksimov expert thermal plant development lysenko take well criticism encounter lysenko boldly claimed mathematics place experimental research improved crop yields earned support soviet leader joseph stalin especially following famine loss productivity resulting crop failures forced collectivization several regions soviet union early age working agricultural experiment station azerbaijan lysenko embarked research would lead paper vernalization drew wide attention potential practical implications soviet agriculture severe cold lack winter snow destroyed many early winterwheat seedlings treating wheat seeds moisture well cold lysenko induced bear crop planted spring lysenko coined term jarovization яровизация describe chilling process used make seeds winter cereals behave like spring cereals spring cereals called jarovoe russian jarovój archaic adjective meaning spring especially relation crops however method already known farmers since recently discussed detail gustav gassner lysenko translated jarovization vernalization latin vernum meaning lysenkos claims increased yields based plantings hectares believed vernalized transformation could inherited offspring vernalized plant would possess capabilities generation preceded would able withstand harsh winters imperfect weather lysenko rejected mendelian genetic inheritance theory favour logic believed gregor mendels theory reactionary idealist lysenkos ideas mixture russian agronomist ivan michurin soviet mixture ideas lysenko founded michurinist school core ideas body cells soma determine quality organisms offspring every part body contributes germ cells manner darwins theory pangenesis though lysenko denied ideas directly derived established biological theories mendelian genetics lamarckism darwinism shaped genetic concepts support simple practical purpose breeding improving crops ideas also shaped disprove claims made fellow geneticists ideas genetic claims later began termed lysenkoism claimed ideas associated lamarckism similarities two ideas belief inheritance acquired lysenkos ideas also seem vitalistic claimed plants die due lack sunlight moisture healthy ones may live die deposit growing roots help new generation survivecitation needed lysenko believed one generation hybridized crop desired individual could selected mated continue produce desired product worrying separationsegregation future breeds work assume lifetime developing acquiring best set traits survive passed next assumption disregarded potential variation mutation lysenko believe genes spoke say exist instead believed body alive obtained heredity meant entirety body able pass hereditary information organism entirely dependent special element dna puzzled biologists time went established notions heredity inheritance also contradicted mendelian principles biologists using base ideas scientists believed lysenkos ideas credible truly explain mechanisms inheritance biologists consider beliefs pseudoscientific little relationship lysenko argued competition also mutual assistance among individuals within species mutual assistance also exists different species according lysenko organism conditions required life inseparable unity different living bodies require different environmental conditions development studying requirements come know qualitative features nature organisms qualitative features heredity heredity property living body require definite conditions life development respond definite way various another lysenkos theories obtaining milk cows depend genetics treated better handled taken care milk would obtained lysenko followers well known taking good care lysenko claimed cuckoo born young birds warblers fed hairy caterpillars parent rather host birds claim failed recognise cuckoos described brood lysenkoites believed fertilization random specific selection best mate reasons like lysenkoism viewed pseudoscientific world war ii ended lysenko took interest works olga lepeshinskaya older feldsher biologist claimed able create cells egg yolk noncellular matter lepeshinskaya recognized common ground ideas lysenkos combining ideas possible proclaim cells could grow noncellular material predicted ratios mendelian genetics meiosis incorrect thus undermining basis modern cytology well lysenko forced farmers plant seeds close together since according law life species plants class never compete one lysenko played active role famines killed millions soviet people practices prolonged exacerbated food peoples republic china mao zedong adopted methods starting calamitous results culminating great chinese famine million people diednote outside soviet union scientists spoke critically british biologist c harland lamented lysenko completely ignorant elementary principles genetics plant physiology bertram wolfe criticism foreigners sit well lysenko loathed western bourgeois scientists denounced tools imperialist oppressors especially detested americanborn practice studying fruit flies workhorse modern genetics called geneticists fly lovers people vi lenin academy agricultural sciences vaskhnil served floor debate lysenkoists geneticists august end weeklong session organized lysenko approved vaskhnil announced point lysenkoism would taught correct theory soviet scientists forced denounce work contradicted several geneticists refused denounce theory executed including izrail agol solomon levit grigorii levitskii georgii karpechenko georgii nadson sent labor camps one prominent critic lysenko famous soviet geneticist president agriculture academy nikolai vavilov arrested died prison soviet union arguably best genetics community according atlantic writer sam kean lysenko gutted accounts set russian biology agronomy back lysenkos work eventually recognized fraudulent wrecked lives many destroyed reputation russian biology according scientist peter early mid twentieth century soviet union went war revolution political oppression caused tension within state also promoted flourishing science possible due flow resources demand results lysenko aimed manipulate various plants wheat peas increase production quality quantity impressed political officials success motivating peasants return soviet unions collectivist reforms forced confiscation agricultural landholdings peasant farmers heavily damaged countrys overall food production dispossessed peasant farmers posed new problems regime many abandoned farms altogether many waged resistance collectivization poor work quality pilfering dislocated disenchanted peasant farmers major political concern ussrs lysenko became prominent period advocating radical unproven agricultural methods also promising new methods provided wider opportunities yearround work agriculture proved useful soviet leadership reengaging peasants return work helping secure personal stake overall success soviet revolutionary lysenkos success encouraging farmers return working lands impressed stalin also approved lysenkos peasant background stalin claimed stand proletariat late ussrs leaders given support lysenko support consequence part policies put place communist party rapidly promote members proletariat leadership positions agriculture science industry party officials looking promising candidates backgrounds similar lysenkos born peasant family without formal academic training affiliations academic due close partnership stalin lysenko lysenko acquired influence genetics soviet union early mid twentieth century lysenko eventually became director genetics academy sciences gave even control remained position two decades throughout reigns stalin nikita khruschchev relieved duties attempt made disempower lysenko letter signed three hundred scientists socalled letter three hundred sent nikita khrushchev led lysenko resigning temporarily returned power efforts though lysenko remained post institute genetics influence soviet agricultural practice declined death stalin lysenko retained position support new leader nikita khrushchev however mainstream scientists reemerged found new willingness within soviet government leadership tolerate criticism lysenko first opportunity since late three prominent soviet physicists yakov zeldovich vitaly ginzburg pyotr kapitsa presented case lysenko proclaiming work pseudoscience also denounced lysenkos application political power silence opposition eliminate opponents within scientific community denunciations occurred period structural upheaval soviet government major institutions purged strictly ideological political machinations controlled work soviet unions scientific community several decades stalin physicist andrei sakharov spoke lysenko general assembly academy sciences ussr responsible shameful backwardness soviet biology genetics particular dissemination pseudoscientific views adventurism degradation learning defamation firing arrest even death many genuine soviet press soon filled antilysenkoite articles appeals restoration scientific methods fields biology agricultural science lysenko removed post director institute genetics academy sciences restricted experimental farm moscows lenin hills institute soon dissolved khrushchevs dismissal president academy sciences declared lysenkos immunity criticism officially ended expert commission sent investigate records kept lysenkos experimental farm secretive methods ideas revealed months later devastating critique lysenko made consequently lysenko immediately disgraced soviet lysenkos monopoly biology agronomy ended took many years sciences
