special somatic afferents special visceral afferents contrast sense touch somatic sense specialized organ comes body noticeably skin also internal organs viscera touch includes mechanoreception pressure vibration proprioception pain nociception heat thermoception information carried general somatic afferents general visceral visual perception ability interpret surrounding environment using light visible spectrum reflected objects environment resulting perception also known visual perception eyesight sight vision adjectival form visual optical ocular various physiological components involved vision referred collectively visual system visual system animals allows individuals assimilate information surroundings act seeing starts cornea lens eye focuses light surroundings onto lightsensitive membrane back eye called retina retina actually part brain isolated serve transducer conversion light neuronal signals based feedback visual system lens eye adjusts thickness focus light photoreceptive cells retina also known rods cones detect photons light respond producing neural impulses signals processed via complex feedforward feedback processes different parts brain retina upstream central ganglia brain note much paragraph could apply octopuses mollusks worms insects things primitive anything concentrated nervous system better eyes say jellyfish however following applies mammals generally birds modified form retina complex animals sends fibers optic nerve lateral geniculate nucleus primary secondary visual cortex brain signals retina also travel directly retina superior colliculus perception objects totality visual scene accomplished visual association cortex visual association cortex combines sensory information perceived striate cortex contains thousands modules part modular neural networks neurons striate cortex send axons extrastriate cortex region visual association cortex surrounds striate human visual system perceives visible light range wavelengths nanometers meters electromagnetic hearing auditory perception ability perceive sound detecting changes pressure surrounding medium time organ ear sound may heard solid liquid gaseous one traditional five senses partial total inability hear called hearing loss humans vertebrates hearing performed primarily auditory system mechanical waves known vibrations detected ear transduced nerve impulses perceived brain primarily temporal lobe like touch audition requires sensitivity movement molecules world outside organism hearing touch types three main components human ear outer ear middle ear inner ear smell olfaction chemoreception forms sense smell olfaction many purposes detection hazards pheromones food integrates senses form sense olfaction occurs odorants bind specific sites olfactory receptors located nasal glomeruli aggregate signals receptors transmit olfactory bulb sensory input start interact parts brain responsible smell identification memory often land organisms separate olfaction systems smell taste orthonasal smell retronasal smell waterdwelling organisms usually one vertebrates smells sensed olfactory sensory neurons olfactory epithelium olfactory epithelium made least six morphologically biochemically different cell proportion olfactory epithelium compared respiratory epithelium innervated supplied nerves gives indication animals olfactory sensitivity humans sq olfactory epithelium whereas dogs sq dogs olfactory epithelium also considerably densely innervated hundred times receptors per square molecules odorants passing superior nasal concha nasal passages dissolve mucus lines superior portion cavity detected olfactory receptors dendrites olfactory sensory neurons may occur diffusion binding odorant odorantbinding proteins mucus overlying epithelium contains mucopolysaccharides salts enzymes antibodies highly important olfactory neurons provide direct passage infection pass brain mucus acts solvent odor molecules flows constantly replaced approximately every ten minutes taste sensation produced substance mouth reacts chemically taste receptor cells located taste buds oral cavity mostly tongue taste along smell olfaction trigeminal nerve stimulation registering texture pain temperature determines flavors food substances humans taste receptors taste buds gustatory calyculi areas including upper surface tongue gustatory cortex responsible perception taste tongue covered thousands small bumps called papillae visible naked eye within papilla hundreds taste exception filiform papillae contain taste buds taste buds located back front tongue others located roof sides back mouth throat taste bud contains taste receptor cells sensation taste includes five established basic tastes sweetness sourness saltiness bitterness scientific experiments proven five tastes exist distinct one anothercitation needed taste buds able differentiate among different tastes detecting interaction different molecules ions sweet umami bitter tastes triggered binding molecules g proteincoupled receptors cell membranes taste buds saltiness sourness perceived alkali metal hydrogen ions enter taste buds basic tastes contribute partially sensation flavor food factors include detected olfactory epithelium detected variety mechanoreceptors muscle nerves temperature detected thermoreceptors coolness menthol hotness pungency chemesthesis taste senses harmful beneficial things basic tastes classified either aversive appetitive depending upon effect things sense sweetness helps identify energyrich foods bitterness serves warning sign among humans taste perception begins fade around years age loss tongue papillae general decrease saliva humans also distortion tastes dysgeusia mammals share taste senses rodents taste starch humans cats taste sweetness taste atp several carnivores including hyenas dolphins sea lions lost ability sense four ancestral five taste
