calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate cppd crystal deposition disease also known pseudogout pyrophosphate arthropathy rheumatologic disease thought secondary abnormal accumulation calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals within joint soft knee joint commonly disease metabolic origin treatment remains cppd also classified autoimmune paraneoplastic manifestation myelodysplastic syndrome patients exhausted classification name pseudogout alters course doctorpatient conversation treatmentcitation needed symptomatic disease classically begins symptoms similar gout attack thus moniker pseudogout includecitation needed symptoms monoarticular involving single joint polyarticular involving several symptoms usually last days weeks often recur although joint may affected knees wrists hips cppd chrystals appear shattered glass microscope released synovial fluid causes unbearable pain patient flares sudden severe without warning diet appear cause flares overexertion exercise standing long shopping stressful loud environments may lead severe flares last one hour months although patient interviews alcohol may known trigger xray ct imaging usually shows accumulation calcium within joint cartilage known chondrocalcinosis also findings white blood cell count often cause cppd disease unknown increased breakdown adenosine triphosphate atp molecule used energy currency living things

reactions inorganic phosphate chrondocalcinosis may extremely common population cppd flares may also triggerd joint trauma previous surgeries surgery necessity many problems may cause longterm trauma body even complete recoveries disease defined presence joint inflammation presence cppd crystals within joint crystals usually detected imaging andor joint fluid analysiscitation needed medical imaging consisting xray ct mri ultrasound may detect chondrocalcinosis within affected joint indicating substantial amount calcium crystal deposition within cartilage ultrasound reliable method diagnose using ultrasound chondrocalcinosis may depicted echogenic foci acoustic shadow within hyaline xray cppd appear similar diseases ankylosing spondylitis arthrocentesis removing synovial fluid affected joint performed test synovial fluid calcium pyrophosphate crystals present cppd stained stain calcium pyrophosphate crystals appears deeply blue however cpp crystals much better known rhomboid shape weak positive birefringence polarized light microscopy method remains reliable method identifying crystals however even method poor sensitivity specificity interoperator two modalities currently define cppd disease lack diagnostic thus diagnosis cppd disease potentially epiphenomenological medication could reduce inflammation cppd bears risk causing organ damage treatment advised condition causing acute pseudogout treatments include intraarticular corticosteroid injection systemic corticosteroids nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids occasion highdose general nsaids administered low doses help prevent cppd however acute attack already occurring higher doses nothing else works hydroxychloroquine methotrexate may provide research surgical removal calcifications underway however still remains experimental based patient interviews way cppd pain managed opioids corticosteroids treatments work relentless pain opioid treatment cases ignored clinicians nsaids colchicine methotrexate may provide initial relief however digestive system side effects liver kidney stomach poisoning weigh risks opioids patient may experience opioid dependence lieu addiction side effect managed close tapering primary care physician longterm use opioids taken correctly would cause digestive failure managed pain control opioids safe effective treatment prevents er visits improves quality life doctors rarely admit cppd patients hospitals treat er pain due current legislative biases pain management currently treatment noninvasive removal crystals deposited attempts dissolve crystals situ using enzymes turned clinical new innovative methods using catalytic peptides condition common older cppd estimated affect adult populations europe united previous studies overestimated prevalence simply estimating prevalence chondrocalcinosis found many conditions may cause considerable pain never women slightly higher risk men estimated ratio occurrence cppd may fatal however untreated pain may potentially result death cppd crystal deposition disease originally described years disease may common people yet research scant instead categorized gout gout although terribly painful disease attacks toes cure cppd formerly referred pseudogout gout pain radiates throughout entire skeleton treatment curecitation needed clinicians possibly dismiss pain disability
