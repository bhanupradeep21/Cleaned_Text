conservation restoration ivory objects process maintaining preserving objects ivory include ivory material conservation restoration aimed preserving ivory material physical form along objects condition treatment documentation activities dedicated preservation ivory objects include preventing agents deterioration specifically connect ivory material preventative conservation treatment ivory objects conservators curators collections managers museum personnel charge taking necessary measurements ensure ivory objects well maintained make decision conservation restoration objects ivory
