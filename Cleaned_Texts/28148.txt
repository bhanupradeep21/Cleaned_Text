valerie horsley american cell developmental biologist currently works associate professor yale university extensively researched growth restoration maintenance skin cells currently member yale cancer center yale stem cell center received presidential early career award scientists engineers recipient rosalind franklin young investigator award valerie horsley raised single mother working toward doctorate industrial engineering throughout early childhood horsley often placed care graduate students served initially considered career medicine working physician opted pursue career research horsley achieved bachelor science biology furman university later doctorate emory university research horsley explored throughout duration doctorate degree supervised grace pavlath focused transcription factors involved development skeletal muscle lab horsley worked discovered smaller muscles mice associated lack transcription factor able determine factor foundational component allotted myoblast cells fuse develop muscle fibers also found factor regulates transcription cytokine horsley later decided shift away muscle research complete postdoctoral training guidance elaine fuchs rockefeller process investigated factors influence stem cell development skin specifically transcription factor finding eliminating gene encoded led oily skin mice horsley discovered monitors size sebaceous horsley joined faculty yale university promoted associate professor dermatology well maxine f singer assistant professor molecular cellular developmental yale laboratory horsley studied cellular molecular pathways involved skin tissue development maintenance well relationship fat cells skin wound healing regeneration hair follicles formation keratinocytes embryonic horsley currently studies adult stem cells epithelial skin tissue cells contribute wound healing development cancer using mouse genetic model horsley revolutionized field epithelial stem cell biology identifying skin adipocyte stem cells establishing major role progenitor cells regulating turnover rejuvenation wound repair skin epidermis hair found within epithelial tissues cells tend confine distinct microenvironments mechanisms adipocyte cells tissue homeostasis regeneration well understood horsley discovered source fat cells immune cells local signals hormone signal prolactin responsible stem cell activity regeneration skin together laboratory also found cell differentiation adipocytes hair growth occur simultaneously cell differentiation process adipogenesis ceases hair growth stops follicles deteriorate team identified specific adipose progenitors skin indicated necessity cells sufficiently induce hair follicle growth cells activated injury required fibroblast migration wound healing process horsley laboratory discovered aging causes loss dermal adipocyte precursor cells regeneration therefore requires pdgf furthermore adipocytes stem cells form myofibroblasts skin injury generate extracellular matrix proteins crosslink collagen cells stimulated macrophagederived signaling research provides link communication various cells lead hair growth wound healing revealing framework possible regulation tissue repair development various diseases mechanical forces known regulate development homeostasis regeneration multicellular tissues illustrate mechanics involved skin function horsley e dufresne used traction force microscopy discover physical properties epithelial cell using genetics functionblocking antibodies mathematical modeling work revealed significance physical cohesion cadherin molecules coordination mechanical force throughout multicellular together king identified role nuclearcytoskeletal adhesion growth hair follicle found inner nuclear membrane proteins sun family required process keratinocyte adhesion hair follicle structure regulation horsley regional finalist blavatnik awards young horsley received presidential early career award scientists engineers research skin cell also one two recipients received rosalind franklin young investigator award presented every three years genetics society america american society human genetics two top women scientists field horsley received montagna lecture award society investigative dermatology horsley received graduate division biomedical biological sciences distinguished alumnus award emory horsleys work lab supported federal funding national institutes health realizing lack scientists political decision making horsley made first run elected office running state senate lost
