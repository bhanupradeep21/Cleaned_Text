odontometrics measurement study tooth used biological anthropology bioarchaeology study human phenotypic variation rationale use similar study dentition structure arrangement teeth number features observed human teeth use odontometrics length width teeth measured front back side side using calipers measurements made directly skeletal material dental casts living measurements reported commonly maximum crown length maximum crown linking past kenneth l feder states dental developmentprovides valuable gauge level physical maturity first set teeth lower central incisors begin appear infant approximately sixandahalf months old rest baby teeth called deciduous teeth appear fairly consistently across species child twoyearsold second upper molars appear point development twenty teeth age twoandahalf six years deciduous teeth maintain stability set molars also called six year molars appear lower jaw child first permanent teeth point approximate next twelve years rest deciduous teeth replaced permanent teeth additional permanent teeth erupt back mouth order enlarge mouth process permanent teeth coming adult mouth thirtytwo teeth fairly consistent rate deciduous permanent teeth appear relevant allows expert determine age human according feder based odontometrics approximate age living child age deceased child died fairly easily accurately determined based teeth present stage growth teeth teeth yet erupt mouth though available standard approaches sex identification used times archaeological remains completely discovered preserved odontometrics used teeth made enduring mineralized tissues human body resistant many types destruction including physical thermal mechanical chemical according marin vodanoviÄ‡ et al sex determination using dental features primarily based upon comparison tooth dimensions males females upon comparison frequencies nonmetric dental traits like carabellis trait upper molars deflecting wrinkle lower first molars distal accessory ridge upper lower canines shoveling upper central incisors analyzing teeth one must also take consideration differences odontometric features different populations one may led false conclusion sex several studies established average males larger teeth females although differences small always statistically sexually dimorphic human teeth canines teeth showing smaller size recent research looking dental tissues within tooth crown indicate male teeth significantly greater quantities dentine females absolutely proportionally differences could useful estimating certain features observed human teeth link different populations teeth exhibit variables strong hereditary component useful assessing population relationships evolutionary one example shovelshaped incisors individuals ridges inside margins front teeth trait common east asian native american populations occurs less frequently elsewhere teeth important role chewing food different dental pathologies patterns tooth wear indicate kinds food eaten dietary behaviors certain populations measurement examination teeth also exhibit incidental intentional modifications reflect patterns different cultural behaviors process tooth formation highly reflective developmental defects observed teeth provide general measure environmental stress study human variation odontometrics provides information past measurements teeth jaws modern humans smaller hominin ancestors however examinations fossil evidence shown decrease size masticatory system mostly attributed changes dietary habits species canine teeth believed small earliest hominins reduction size continues early period modern humans first molar teeth largest among molars overall tooth size reduced earliest hominins archaic hominins second molars generally largest molars teeth third molars closer size second molars evolution human tooth size masticatory system related diet food processing techniques also related brain size bipedalism million million years ago teeth homo habilis generally smaller australopiths still somewhat larger living arose million years ago jaws teeth homo erectus still large compared modern humans smaller earlier hominins particularly back teeth microscopic analyses teeth show wear patterns characteristic extensive meat years ago teeth homo heidelbergensis arranged jaw formed parabolic shape curved front teeth also smaller earlier species still larger modern humans members species possessed gap called retromolar space behind wisdom teeth back years ago neanderthal face acted withstand stresses brought use relatively large front teeth front teeth neanderthals large relative back teeth often show considerable wear suggesting used odontometric studies also utilized age sex determination forensic often used forensic cases along craniofacial teeth good sources material civil medicolegal identification provide resistance damage terms bacterial decomposition fire rest body damaged beyond odontometrics play important role determination sex young individuals secondary sexual characteristics yet mass disaster occurs either natural manmade odontology used help identify victims natural disasters include tornadoes
