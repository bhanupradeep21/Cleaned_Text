acquired brain injury common people experience memory memory disorders one prevalent cognitive deficits experienced affected however aspects memory directly linked attention challenging assess components deficit caused memory fundamentally attention often partial recovery memory functioning following initial recovery phase however permanent handicaps often abi patients reporting significantly memory difficulties compared people without acquired brain order cope efficiently memory disorders many people abi use memory aids included external items diaries notebooks electronic

cognitive emotional difficulties stem injury negatively impact level participation home school social participation structured events found especially hindered involvement social situations important normal development children means gaining understanding effectively work together furthermore young people abi often reported insufficient problem solving potential hinder performance various academic social settings important rehabilitation programs deal challenges specific children fully developed time rehabilitation following acquired brain injury follow set protocol due variety mechanisms injury structures affected rather rehabilitation individualized process often involve multidisciplinary rehabilitation team may include limited nurses neurologists physiotherapists psychiatrists

rehabilitation following brain injury music therapy may assist patients improve gait arm swing walking communication quality life experiencing newer treatment methods virtual reality robotics remain underresearched however reason believe virtual reality upper limb rehabilitation may useful following acquired brain due random control trials generally weak evidence research needed gain complete understanding ideal type parameters therapeutic interventions treatment acquired brain information therapeutic interventions acquired brain injury see stroke traumatic brain injury strategies rehabilitating memory affected abi used repetitive tasks attempt increase patients ability recall type training increases performance task hand little evidence skills translate improved performance memory challenges outside awareness memory strategies motivation dedication increasing memory related successful increases memory capability among example could use attention process training brain injury education patients memory disorders related brain shown increase memory functioning patients based selfreport another strategy improvement amongst individuals poor memory functioning use elaboration improve encoding items one form strategy called selfimagining whereby patient imagines event recalled personal selfimagining found improve recognition memory coding event manner
