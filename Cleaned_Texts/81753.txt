activity prevents ongoing infection also promoting group primates provide perhaps one best examples mutual grooming due intensive research performed regarding varying lifestyles direct variation means social grooming across different species among primates social grooming plays significant role animal consolation behavior whereby primates engage establishing maintaining alliances dominance hierarchies preexisting coalitions reconciliation conflicts primates groom socially moments boredom well act shown reduce tension reduction stress often associated observed periods relaxed behavior

responses stress reduction responses occur production hormones endorphins growth reduction nerve structures example studies suckling rats rats received warmth touch feeding lower blood pressure levels rats receive touch found result increased vagal nerve tone meaning higher parasympathetic nervous response lower sympathetic nervous response stimuli resulting lower stress social grooming form
