nocturnality behavior nonhuman animals characterized active night sleeping day common adjective nocturnal versus diurnal meaning opposite nocturnal creatures generally highly developed senses hearing smell specially adapted animals cats ferrets eyes adapt lowlevel bright day levels illumination see metaturnal others bushbabies bats function night many nocturnal creatures including tarsiers owls large eyes comparison body size compensate lower light levels night specifically found larger cornea relative eye size diurnal creatures increase visual sensitivity lowlight nocturnality helps wasps apoica flavissima avoid hunting intense sunlight diurnal animals including humans except night owls squirrels songbirds active daytime crepuscular species rabbits skunks tigers hyenas often erroneously referred nocturnal cathemeral species fossas lions active day night difficult say came first nocturnality diurnality hypothesis evolutionary biology nocturnal bottleneck theory postulates mesozoic many ancestors modernday mammals evolved nocturnal characteristics order avoid contact numerous diurnal recent study attempts answer question many modern day mammals retain nocturnal characteristics even though active night leading answer high visual acuity comes diurnal characteristics needed anymore due evolution compensatory sensory systems heightened sense smell astute auditory recent study recently extinct elephant birds modern day nocturnal kiwi bird skulls examined recreate likely brain skull formation indicated olfactory bulbs much larger comparison optic lobes indicating common ancestor evolved function nocturnal species decreasing eyesight favor better sense anomaly theory anthropoids appeared divergence nocturnality organisms examined mammals exhibit morphological characteristics expected nocturnal creature reptiles birds fit perfectly larger cornea pupil correlated well whether two classes organisms nocturnal active night form niche differentiation species niche partitioned amount resources amount time ie temporal division ecological niche hawks owls hunt field meadow rodents without conflict hawks diurnal owls means competition others prey another niche nocturnal lessens competition within pollination nocturnal pollinators moths beetles thrips bats lower risk seen predators plants evolved temporal scent production ambient heat attract nocturnal pollination like predators hunting prey plants apples pollinated day night nocturnality form crypsis adaptation avoid enhance predation although lions cathemeral may active time day night prefer hunt night many prey species zebra antelope impala wildebeest etc poor night vision many species small rodents large japanese field mouse active night dozen birds prey hunt diurnal many diurnal species exhibit nocturnal behaviors example many seabirds sea turtles gather breeding sites colonies night reduce risk predation andor offspring nocturnal species take advantage night time prey species used avoiding diurnal predators nocturnal fish species use moonlight prey zooplankton species come surface species developed unique adaptations allow hunt dark bats famous using echolocation hunt prey using sonar sounds capture dark another reason nocturnality avoiding heat day especially true arid biomes like deserts nocturnal behavior prevents creatures losing precious water hot dry daytime adaptation enhances one reasons cathemeral lions prefer hunt night conserve water hamiltons frog found stephens maud islands stays hidden majority day temperatures warmer mainly active night come day humid cool conditions many plant species native arid biomes adapted flowers open night suns intense heat wither destroy moist delicate blossoms flowers pollinated bats another creature night climatechange change global temperatures led increasing amount diurnal species push activity patterns closer towards crepuscular fully nocturnal behavior adaptive measure allows species

overlapping areas light pollution spatial disturbance light pollution major issue nocturnal species impact continues increase electricity reaches parts world previously species tropics generally affected due change relatively constant light patterns temperate species relying daynight triggers behavioral patterns also affected well many diurnal species see benefit longer day allowing longer hunting period detrimental nocturnal prey trying avoid light pollution disorient species used darkness adaptive eyes used artificial lighting insects obvious example attracted lighting usually killed either heat electrical species frogs blinded quick changes light nocturnal migratory birds may disoriented causing lose direction tire captured sea turtles particularly affected adding number threats different endangered species adults likely stay away artificially lit beaches might prefer lay eggs less cover additionally baby sea turtles hatch eggs artificially lit beaches often get lost heading towards light sources opposed rhythmic behaviors affected light pollution seasonally daily patterns migrating birds mammals might issues timing movement daytoday basis species see significant changes internal temperatures general movement feeding body small scale changes eventually lead population decline well hurting local trophic levels interconnecting typically diurnal species even become crepuscular nocturnal result light pollution general human documented effects light pollution reproductive cycles factors different species affect mate choice migration breeding grounds nest site male green frogs artificial light causes decrease mate calls continued move around instead waiting potential mate hurts overall fitness species concerning considering overall decrease amphibian predation nocturnal predatorprey relationships interrupted artificial lighting bats fastmoving often advantage insects drawn light fast enough escape predators also attracted light leaving slowmoving bats another example harbor seals eating juvenile salmon moved river lit nearby artificial lighting lights turned predation levels many diurnal prey species forced nocturnal susceptible nocturnal predators
