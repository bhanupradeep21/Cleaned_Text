interest english may mother studies indicated negative affect important beneficial impacts cognition behavior developments departure earlier psychological research characterized unilateral emphasis benefits positive states affect influence mental processes benefits negative affect present areas cognition including perception judgement memory interpersonal personal since negative affect relies cautious processing preexisting knowledge people negative affect tend perform better instances involving deception manipulation impression formation stereotyping negative affectivitys analytical detailed processing information leads fewer reconstructivememory errors whereas positive mood relies broader schematic thematic information ignores thus information processing negative moods reduces misinformation effect increases overall accuracy people also exhibit less interfering responses stimuli given descriptions performing cognitive people notoriously susceptible forming inaccurate judgments based biases limited information evolutionary theories propose negative affective states tend increase skepticism decrease reliance preexisting consequently judgmental accuracy improved areas impression formation reducing fundamental attribution error stereotyping sadness normally associated hippocampus produce side effects would associated feelings pleasure excitement sadness

groups detected deception successfully attended stimulus details systematically built inferences memory found many failures affect accuracy recalled especially pragmatic criminal settings eyewitness memories found less reliable one would hope however externally focused accommodative processing negative affect positive effect overall improvement memory evidenced reduction misinformation effect number false memories knowledge implies negative affect used enhance eyewitness however additional research suggests extent memory improved negative affect sufficiently improve eyewitness testimonies significantly reduce error negative affect shown decrease susceptibility incorporating misleading information related misinformation misinformation effect refers finding misleading information presented encoding event subsequent recall influences witnesss corresponds two types memory failure negative mood shown decrease suggestibility error seen reduced amounts incorporation false memories misleading information present hand positive affect shown increase susceptibility misleading information experiment undergraduate students supported results participants began study lecture hall witnessed thought unexpected fiveminute belligerent encounter intruder lecturer week later participants watched video generated either positive negative neutral mood completed brief questionnaire previous incident intruder lecturer witnessed week earlier questionnaire half participants received questions misleading information half received questions without misleading information manipulation used determine participants susceptible suggestibility failure minutes unrelated distractors participants given set true false questions tested false memories participants experiencing negative moods reported fewer numbers false memories whereas experiencing positive moods reported greater amount false memories implies positive affect promotes integration misleading details negative affect reduces misinformation people experience negative affectivity following event report fewer reconstructive false memories evidenced two studies conducted around public events first surrounded events televised oj simpson trial participants asked fill questionnaires three times one week two months year televised verdict questionnaires measured participant emotion towards verdict accuracy recalled memory occurred trial overall study found although participant response event outcome affect quantity remembered information influence likelihood false memory participants pleased verdict oj simpson trial likely falsely believe something occurred trial displeased another experiment found findings red sox fans yankees fans overall memory events occurred final game playoff series red sox defeated study found yankees fans better memory events occurred red sox fans results experiments consistent findings negative emotion lead fewer memory errors thus increased memory accuracy although negative affect shown decrease misinformation effect degree memory improved enough make significant effect witness testimony fact emotions including negative affect shown reduce accuracy identifying perpetrators photographic lineups researchers demonstrated effect experiment participants watched video induced either negative emotion neutral mood two videos deliberately similar except action interest either mugging negative emotion conversation neutral emotion watching one two videos participants shown perpetrator lineups either contained target perpetrator video foil person looked similar target results

emotional counterparts demonstrates emotional affect forensic settings decreases accuracy eyewitness findings consistent prior knowledge stress emotion greatly impair eyewitness ability recognitive negative affectivity produce several interpersonal benefits cause subjects polite considerate others unlike positive mood causes less assertive approaches negative affectivity many ways cause person

closely linked better conversation makes use hippocampus different regions braincitation needed someone upset individual may see hear things differently individual upbeat happy time small details negative individual picks may something completely overlooked anxiety disorders often associated overthinking ruminating topics would seem irrelevant pointless individual without disorder ocd one common anxiety trait allows affected individual different insight things may appear person makes use negative affect different view world goes thus making conversations different interesting others results one study show participants negative affectivity careful information shared others cautious could trust researchers found negative mood decreases intimacy levels also increases caution placing
