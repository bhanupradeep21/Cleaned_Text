eagle eye among sharpest animal kingdom eyesight estimated times stronger average although eagle may weigh pounds kg eyes roughly size eagle weight varies small eagle could weigh grams lb larger one could weigh kilograms lb eagle kilograms lb weight could eyes big human weighs pounds although size eagle eye human back side shape eagle eye flatter eyes stated larger size brain color vision resolution clarity prominent features eagles eyes hence sharpsighted people sometimes referred eagleeyed eagles identify five distinctly colored squirrels locate prey even addition eagles birds hawks falcons owls also known raptors extraordinary vision enable hunt prey easily raptors also known birds prey categorized predator hunting style means use sharp senses locate capture prey eagle said able spot rabbit km miles eagle descends sky attack prey muscles eyes continuously adjust curvature eyeballs maintain sharp focus accurate perception throughout approach outer region eye cornea light passes cornea first light refracted passed cornea given curved convex shape image formed cornea upside reversed right leftjourney n layers cornea raptors include anterior corneal epithelium anterior limiting lamina bowmans layer substantia propria stroma comprising majority corneal thicknessposterior limiting lamina descemets membrane posterior epithelium iris eagles appears yellow functions similarly iris humans iris contracts dilates control amount light received retina muscles iris striated muscle smooth muscle myopepithelial dilator muscle tucker v contracted change appearance pupil size eagles large transparent lenses ability change shape purpose lens able change shape eagles quickly focus object accuracy sclera made approximately small bones give eye shape function protect inner structures eye ciliary muscles originate sclera located within ciliary body muscles striated function change shape lens eagles retina allows higher nyquist retina pronounced rod cells cone cells eagle retinas fovea one million cells per compared per humans eagles large eyes take half skull large portion eagles skull dedicated sight essential survival eagles eyes flat wide toward back maximize image formed within eye back eye theres layer photoreceptor cells rods cones called retina transmit visual information brain eagles deep central fovea shallow temporal fovea function better visual acuity higher resolution sight line sight deep fovea points forwards approximately degrees right left head axis shallow fovea also points forwards approximately degrees right left head eagles highly developed sense sight allows easily spot prey eagles excellent vision compared average human vision means eagles see things feet away see feet away beginning cranial structure eagles fixed eye sockets angled degrees midline giving eagles visual field allows excellent peripheral binocular vision eagle flight reputedly sight rabbit two miles coordination hunting perch top trees eagle dive speeds miles per hour kmh catch prey phenomenon eagle turning flexible head almost sitting flying attributed fact large head turned fully eyes also turned unlike human eagles young age locate fish water result refraction error eye compensate grabbing dead fish floating surface grow older refraction error naturally rectifies able spot fish surface fierce look eagle due placement bony ridge eyes small amount bare skin eyes sharp beak feathers body generally grow ridge protects eyes protruding tree branches perches trees also prey struggles eagle eyeball moves separately eyeball large tightly fit eagle barely turn within socket called eyes located front head face forward looking slightly askew advantage like many predators eagle eyes face forward overlapping fields view allows binocular vision stereopsis vastly improves depth perception though hearing match visual acuity mating calls said heard several eagles upper lower eyelids bottom lid mobile gives appearance eyelid blinking bottom top inside eyelids made connective tissue called fibroelastic plate tarsus function support outer eyelid give shape eyelids small hair like feathers called filoplumes comparable human eye lashes eagles third eyelid also known nictitating grows inner corner eye next tear duct eagle tears produced lacrimal gland hardarian gland moisten eyes contain chemical lysozyme protects salt water also destroys bacteria thus preventing eye infections nictitating membrane thin semitransparent piece skin acts sweeping wiper moving laterally across eye controlled quadratus muscle third eyelid also acts mechanism remove dust dirt eagle iris pale yellow color much lighter human eyes eagles humans white area called sclera case eagles hidden eyelid eyelid openings ovalshaped humans round case birds eagles excellent vision generally eagles suffer myopia nearsightedness hyperopia farsightedness defects hunt easily eventually starve death eagles unique feature pecten function clearly understood general belief helps nourish retina keeps healthy without blood vessels facilitates fluids flow vitreous body appropriate pressure absorbs light minimize reflections inside eye could impair vision helps perceive motion creates protective shade sun senses magnetic wood fundus oculi birds especially viewed ophthalmoscope study comparative anatomy physiology describes eagle eye anatomy detail
