cholangiocarcinomas may vary undifferentiated welldifferentiated often surrounded brisk fibrotic desmoplastic tissue response presence extensive fibrosis difficult distinguish welldifferentiated cholangiocarcinoma normal reactive epithelium entirely specific immunohistochemical stain distinguish malignant benign biliary ductal tissue although staining cytokeratins carcinoembryonic antigen mucins may aid tumors specific blood tests diagnose cholangiocarcinoma serum levels carcinoembryonic antigen cea often elevated sensitive specific enough used general screening tool however may useful conjunction imaging methods supporting suspected diagnosis ultrasound liver biliary tree often used initial imaging modality people suspected obstructive ultrasound identify obstruction ductal dilatation cases may sufficient diagnose computed tomography ct scanning may also play important role diagnosis abdominal imaging useful diagnosis cholangiocarcinoma direct imaging bile ducts often necessary endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp endoscopic procedure performed gastroenterologist specially trained surgeon widely used purpose although ercp invasive procedure attendant risks advantages include ability obtain biopsies place stents perform interventions relieve biliary endoscopic ultrasound also performed time ercp may increase accuracy biopsy yield information lymph node invasion alternative ercp percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography ptc may utilized magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography mrcp noninvasive alternative authors suggested mrcp supplant ercp diagnosis biliary cancers may accurately define tumor avoids risks surgical exploration may necessary obtain suitable biopsy accurately stage person cholangiocarcinoma laparoscopy used staging purposes may avoid need invasive surgical procedure laparotomy histologically cholangiocarcinomas classically well moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas immunohistochemistry useful diagnosis may used help differentiate cholangiocarcinoma hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis gastrointestinal cytological scrapings often tumors typically desmoplastic stroma therefore release diagnostic tumor cells scrapings although least three staging systems cholangiocarcinoma eg bismuth blumgart american joint committee cancer none shown useful predicting important staging issue whether tumor surgically removed whether advanced surgical treatment successful often determination made time general guidelines operability cholangiocarcinoma considered incurable rapidly lethal disease unless tumors fully resected cut surgically since operability tumor assessed surgery majority people undergo exploratory surgery unless already clear indication tumor however mayo clinic reported significant success treating early bile duct cancer liver transplantation using protocolized approach strict selection adjuvant therapy followed liver transplantation may role treatment certain unresectable locoregional therapies including transarterial chemoembolization tace transarterial radioembolization tare ablation therapies role intrahepatic variants cholangiocarcinoma provide palliation potential cure people surgical tumor removed surgically people may receive adjuvant chemotherapy radiation therapy operation improve chances cure tissue margins negative ie tumor totally excised adjuvant therapy uncertain benefit results reported adjuvant radiation therapy setting prospective randomized controlled trials conducted march adjuvant chemotherapy appears ineffective people completely resected role combined chemoradiotherapy setting unclear however tumor tissue margins positive indicating tumor completely removed via surgery adjuvant therapy radiation possibly chemotherapy generally recommended based available majority cases cholangiocarcinoma present inoperable unresectable case people generally treated palliative chemotherapy without radiotherapy chemotherapy shown randomized controlled trial improve quality life extend survival people inoperable single chemotherapy regimen universally used enrollment clinical trials often recommended chemotherapy agents used treat cholangiocarcinoma include gemcitabine single gemcitabine plus small pilot study suggested possible benefit tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib people advanced radiation therapy appears prolong
