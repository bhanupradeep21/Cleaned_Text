nature versus nurture longstanding debate biology society relative influence human beings genetic inheritance nature environmental conditions development nurture alliterative expression nature nurture english use since least elizabethan goes back medieval complementary combination two concepts ancient concept ancient greek ἁπό φύσεως καὶ nature people think prewiring influenced genetic inheritance

individual due environmental genetic factors traits individual always complex interweaving individual even strongly genetically influenced obligate traits eye color assume inputs typical environment ontogenetic development eg certain ranges temperatures oxygen levels etc contrast heritability index statistically quantifies extent variation individuals trait due variation genes individuals carry animals breeding environments controlled experimentally heritability determined relatively easily experiments would unethical human research problem overcome finding existing populations humans reflect experimental setting researcher wishes create one way determine contribution genes environment trait study one kind study identical twins reared apart compared randomly selected pairs people twins share identical genes different family environments twins reared apart assigned random foster adoptive parents another kind twin study identical twins reared together share family environment genes compared fraternal twins reared together also share family environment share half genes another condition permits disassociation genes environment adoption one kind adoption study biological siblings reared together share family environment half genes compared adoptive siblings share family environment none genes many cases found genes make substantial contribution including psychological traits intelligence yet heritability may differ circumstances instance environmental deprivation examples low medium high heritability traits include twin adoption studies methodological limits example limited range environments genes sample almost studies conducted western countries therefore necessarily extrapolated globally include nonwestern populations additionally types studies depend particular assumptions equal environments assumption case twin studies lack preadoptive effects case adoption studies since definition nature context tied heritability definition nurture consequently become wide including type causality heritable term thus moved away original connotation cultural influences include effects environment including indeed substantial source environmental input human nature may arise stochastic variations prenatal development thus sense term many properties brain genetically organized dont depend information coming senses interactions genes environment called interactions another component debate classic example interaction ability diet low amino acid phenylalanine partially suppress genetic disease phenylketonuria yet another complication debate existence correlations correlations indicate individuals certain genotypes likely find certain environments thus appears genes shape selection creation environments even using experiments like described difficult determine convincingly relative contribution genes environment heritability refers origins differences people individual development even highly heritable traits eye color depends range environmental factors genes organism physical variables temperature oxygen levels etc development ontogenesis variability trait meaningfully spoken due certain proportions genetic differences nature environments nurture highly penetrant mendelian genetic disorders huntingtons disease virtually incidence disease due genetic differences huntingtons animal models live much longer shorter lives depending cared extreme traits native language environmentally determined linguists found child capable learning language learn human language equal virtually biological psychological traits however

event long disease manifest steven pinker likewise described several concrete behavioral traits patently depend content provided home language one speaks religion one practices political party one heritable traits reflect underlying talents proficient language person religious liberal partially heritable traits determined complex interaction genotype environment possible measure heritability trait within population however many nonscientists encounter report trait certain percentage heritability imagine noninteractional additive contributions genes environment trait analogy laypeople may think degree trait made two buckets genes environment able hold certain capacity trait even intermediate heritabilities trait always shaped genetic dispositions environments people develop merely greater lesser plasticities associated heritability measures heritability measures always refer degree variation individuals population statistics applied level individual would incorrect say heritability index personality ones personality obtained ones parents environment help understand imagine humans genetic clones heritability index traits would zero variability clonal individuals must due environmental factors contrary erroneous interpretations heritability index societies become egalitarian everyone similar experiences heritability index goes environments become similar variability individuals due genetic factors one also take account fact variables heritability environmentality precise vary within chosen population across cultures would accurate state degree heritability environmentality measured reference particular phenotype chosen group population given period time accuracy calculations hindered number coefficients taken consideration age one variable display influence heritability environmentality differs drastically across age groups older studied age noticeable heritability factor becomes younger test subjects likely show signs strong influence environmental factors example one study found statistically significant difference selfreported wellbeing middleaged monozygotic twins separated birth reared household suggesting happiness middleaged adults based environmental factors related family rearing result also found among middleaged dizygotic twins furthermore significantly variance dizygotic twins selfreported wellbeing monozygotic group genetic similarity thus estimated account around variance adult happiness given point time much variance longterm happiness studies similarly found heritability happiness around pointed environmental inputs affect expression one explanation environment influence extent genetic disposition actually traits may considered adaptations umbilical cord byproducts adaptations belly button due random variation convex concave belly button alternative contrasting nature nurture focuses obligate vs facultative adaptations may generally obligate robust face typical environmental variation facultative sensitive typical environmental variation example rewarding sweet taste sugar pain bodily injury obligate psychological environmental variability development much affect hand facultative adaptations somewhat like ifthen example facultative psychological adaptation may adult attachment style attachment style adults example secure attachment style propensity develop close trusting bonds others proposed conditional whether individuals early childhood caregivers could trusted provide reliable assistance attention example facultative physiological adaptation tanning skin exposure sunlight prevent skin damage facultative social adaptation also proposed example whether society warlike peaceful proposed conditional much collective threat society quantitative studies heritable traits throw light question developmental genetic analysis examines effects genes course human lifespan early studies intelligence mostly examined young children found heritability measured subsequent developmental genetic analyses found variance attributable additive environmental effects less apparent older individuals estimated heritability iq increasing multivariate genetic analysis examines genetic contribution several traits vary together example multivariate genetic analysis demonstrated genetic determinants specific cognitive abilities eg memory spatial reasoning processing speed overlap greatly genes associated specific cognitive ability affect others similarly multivariate genetic analysis found genes affect scholastic achievement completely overlap genes affect cognitive ability extremes analysis examines link normal pathological traits example hypothesizedby given behavioral disorder may represent extreme continuous distribution normal behavior hence extreme continuous distribution genetic environmental variation depression phobias reading disabilities examined contextcitation needed highly heritable traits studies identified loci associated variance trait instance individuals budding field epigenetics conducted research showing hereditable conditions like schizophrenia hereditability inherited trait actually displaying schizophrenic new research showing gene expression happen adults due environmental stimuli example people schizophrenic gene genetic predisposition illness gene lays dormant people however introduced chronic stress introducing amphetamines caused methyl groups stick hippocampi cognitive functions significant genetic component metaanalysis million twin pairs found genetics explained variability cognitive evidence behavioral genetic research suggests family environmental factors may effect upon childhood iq accounting quarter variance american psychological associations report intelligence knowns unknowns states doubt normal child development requires certain minimum level responsible care environment playing role believed fully genetic intelligence found severely deprived neglectful abusive environments highly negative effects many aspects childrens intellect development beyond minimum however role family experience serious dispute hand late adolescence correlation disappears adoptive siblings longer similar iq moreover adoption studies indicate adulthood adoptive siblings similar iq strangers iq correlation near zero full siblings show iq correlation twin studies reinforce pattern monozygotic identical twins raised separately highly similar iq dizygotic fraternal twins raised together much adoptive siblings recent adoption studies also found supportive parents positive effect development studies focused environmental factors may affect iq example research shown factors access education nutrition social support significant impact iq furthermore research suggested certain experiences early childhood exposure lead environmental toxins negative impact studies consistently shown environmental factors significant impact iq access quality education found positive effect iq one study indicating access quality preschool education lasting impact iq scores age malnutrition early childhood linked lower iq scores later life supplementation certain nutrients iron iodine shown improve iq scores social support also important environmental factor positively affects iq one study indicating children received high levels emotional support mothers higher iq scores received low levels emotional overall clear nature nurture play role determining iq genetics may provide foundation intelligence environmental factors significant impact iq throughout persons life therefore important consider factors discussing role nature vs nurture relation iq personality frequently cited example heritable trait studied twins adoptees using behavioral genetic study designs famous categorical organization heritable personality traits defined two research teams led paul costa robert r mccrae warren norman lewis goldberg people rate personalities dimensions narrowed big five factors conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness neuroticism studies found extraversion genetic component estimates heritability ranging however environmental factors parenting style cultural values life experiences also shape persons level extraversion likewise neuroticism genetic component estimates heritability ranging environmental factors adverse childhood experiences chronic stress cultural values also influence persons level close genetic relationship positive personality traits example happiness traits mirror images comorbidity psychopathology personality factors consistent across cultures many studies also tested heritability traits personal agency also factors debate genetic environmental factors shape personality individuals also agency shaping personality choices behaviors attitudes example one study found college students participated study abroad programs scored higher measures openness experience compared participate another study found individuals lived diverse neighborhoods likely score higher openness experience compared lived homogenous identical twins reared apart far similar personality randomly selected pairs people likewise identical twins similar fraternal twins also biological siblings similar personality adoptive siblings observation suggests personality heritable certain extent supporting article focused heritability personality estimated around subjective wellbeing study conducted using representative sample twin pairs test heritable differences subjective wellbeing found fully accounted genetic model fivefactor models personality however study designs allow examination environment well genes adoption studies also directly measure strength shared family effects adopted siblings share family environment adoption studies indicate adulthood personalities adopted siblings little similar random pairs strangers would mean shared family effects personality zero adulthood case personality traits nonshared environmental effects often found outweigh shared environmental effects environmental effects typically thought lifeshaping family life may less impact nonshared effects harder identify one possible source nonshared effects environment prenatal development random variations genetic program development may substantial source nonshared environment results suggest nurture may predominant factor environment environment situations fact impact lives way would typically react environmental factors preset personality traits basis would react situations example would extraverted prisoners become less happy introverted prisoners would react incarceration negatively due preset extraverted ch behavioral genes somewhat proven exist take look fraternal twins fraternal twins reared apart show similarities behavior response reared relationship personality peoples wellbeing influenced mediated found stable set point happiness characteristic individual largely determined individuals genes happiness fluctuates around setpoint genetically determined based whether good things bad things happening us nurture fluctuates small magnitude normal human midpoint fluctuations determined great genetic lottery people born leads themwho conclude happy may feel moment time simply due luck draw gene fluctuation also due educational attainment accounted less variance wellbeing women less variance theywho consider individualities measured together personality tests remain steady throughout individuals lifespan believe human beings may refine forms personality never change entirely darwins theory evolution steered naturalists george williams william hamilton concept personality evolution suggested physical organs also personality product natural advent genomic sequencing become possible search identify specific gene polymorphisms affect traits iq personality techniques work tracking association differences trait interest differences specific molecular markers functional variants example visible human trait precise genetic basis differences relatively well known eye color contrast views developed gender identity primarily learned led protocol surgical sex changes male infants injured malformed genitals david reimer genomics provided solid evidence sex gender identities primarily influenced genes clear genes vastly influential virtually force shaping sex identity gender identity growing consensus medicine children assigned chromosomal ie genetic sex regardless anatomical variations option switching desired later life attempts locate genes responsible configuring certain
