dioecy daɪˈiːsi ancient greek διοικία dioikía two households adj dioecious daɪˈiːʃiəs characteristic certain species distinct unisexual individuals producing either male female gametes either directly animals indirectly seed plants dioecious reproduction biparental reproduction dioecy costs since female part population directly produces offspring one method excluding selffertilization promoting allogamy outcrossing thus tends reduce expression recessive deleterious mutations present population plants several methods preventing selffertilization including example dichogamy herkogamy selfincompatibility zoology dioecy means animal either male female case synonym gonochory often needed example animal species gonochoric almost vertebrate species gonochoric bird mammal species dioecy may also describe colonies within species colonies siphonophorae portuguese manofwar may either dioecious land plants embryophytes differ animals life cycle involves alternation generations animals typically individual produces gametes one kind either sperm egg cells gametes half number chromosomes individual producing haploid without dividing sperm egg cell fuse form zygote develops new individual land plants contrast one generation sporophyte generation consists individuals produce haploid spores rather haploid gametes spores fuse germinate dividing repeatedly mitosis give rise haploid multicellular individuals gametophytes produce gametes male gamete female gamete fuse produce new diploid bryophytes mosses liverworts hornworts gametophytes fully independent seed plant gametophytes dependent sporophyte develop within spores condition known endospory flowering plants male gametophytes develop within pollen grains produced sporophytes stamens female gametophytes develop within ovules produced sporophytes sporophyte generation seed plant called monoecious sporophyte plant kinds sporeproducing organ separate flowers cones example single flowering plant monoecious species functional stamens carpels separate sporophyte generation seed plants called dioecious sporophyte plant one kind sporeproducing organ whose spores give rise either male gametophytes produce male gametes sperm female gametophytes produce female gametes egg cells example single flowering plant sporophyte fully dioecious species like holly either flowers functional stamens producing pollen containing male gametes staminate male flowers flowers functional carpels producing female gametes carpellate female flowers see plant reproductive morphology details including complex cases gynodioecy androdioecy dioecious holly plants male flowers functional stamens produce pollen holly plants female flowers produce ovules monoecious tulip flower pollenproducing stamens carpels containing ovules slightly different terms dioicous monoicous may used gametophyte generation although dioecious monoecious also dioicous gametophyte either produces male gametes sperm produces female gametes egg cells liverworts dioecy occurs wide variety plant groups examples dioecious plant species include ginkgos willows cannabis african teak specific name implies perennial stinging nettle urtica dioica annual nettle urtica urens dioecious flora predominant tropical gymnosperm species almost conifers gymnosperms sexual systems dioecy monoecy strongly correlated mode pollen dispersal

heterotrophic dioecious plants whether male female gametophytes produced determined genetically cases determined environment arisaema certain algae dioeciousclarification dioecy prevalent brown algae phaeophyceae may ancestral state plants dioecy evolved independently multiple generally either hermaphroditic species monoecious species previously untested hypothesis reduces dioecy shown associated increased genetic diversity greater protection deleterious regardless evolutionary pathway intermediate states need fitness advantages compared cosexual flowers order dioecy evolves due male female although unlikely mutations male female sterility occurred angiosperms unisexual flowers evolve bisexual dioecy occurs almost half plant families minority genera suggesting recent families dioecious species dioecy thought evolved family caricaceae dioecy likely ancestral sexual dioecious flowering plants evolve monoecious ancestors flowers containing functional stamens functional authors argue monoecy dioecy genus sagittaria since distribution sexual systems postulated dioecy evolved gynodioecy mainly mutations resulted male however since ancestral state unclear work needed clarify evolution dioecy via dioecy usually evolves hermaphroditism gynodioecy may also evolve asteraceae dioecy may evolved independently hermaphroditism least times reverse transition dioecy back hermaphroditism also observed asteraceae bryophytes frequency half forward silene since monoecy suggested dioecy evolved dioecious fungi monoecy dioecy fungi refer donor recipient roles mating nucleus transferred one haploid hypha another two nuclei present cell merge karyogamy form definition avoids reference male female reproductive structures rare individual dioecious fungal species requires partner mating performs one roles nuclear transfer either donor recipient monoecious fungal species perform roles may dioecy demographic disadvantage compared hermaphroditism half reproductive adults able produce offspring dioecious species must therefore fitness advantages compensate cost increased survival growth reproduction dioecy excludes selffertilization promotes allogamy outcrossing thus tends reduce expression recessive deleterious mutations present trees compensation realized mainly increased seed production females turn facilitated lower contribution reproduction population growth results demonstrable net costs males population compared dioecy may also accelerate retard lineage diversification angiosperms dioecious lineages diversified certain genera less others analysis
