ctenochasmatidae altmuehlopterus ramphastinus dsungaripteroidea illustrated results different topology based phylogenetic analysis made longrich martill andres unlike previous results placed pterodactylus within clade euctenochasmatia resulting derived germanodactylus cristatus germanodactylus rhamphastinus pterodactylus antiquus cycnorhamphus suevicus normannognathus wellnhoferi ctenochasmatidae numerous species assigned pterodactylus years since discovery first half century new pterosaur species would named pterodactylus thus became wastebasket even clearly different forms later given generic name new species would created productive sites throughout europe north america often based slightly different earliest reassignments pterosaur species pterodactylus started description rhamphorhynchus fossil collector georg graf zu münster alerted german paleontologist samuel thomas von sömmerring several distinct fossil specimens sömmerring thought belonged ancient

later owen uncovered multiple distinctively looking fossil remains yet cambridge greensand assigned new species named pterodactylus though british paleontologist harry govier seeley created separate generic name called ornithocheirus reassigned p simus type species created combination ornithocheirus years seeley reassigned many pterosaur species ornithocheirus also creating several new many species however reclassified genera considered nomina specimens found england owen ones assigned new species called pterodactylus species however reassigned genus lonchodectes hooley resulted l conclusion revised rigal et al disagreed hooleys reassignment therefore created genus serradraco afterwards resulted new combination called assigning new pterosaur species pterodactylus common europe also north america paleontologists othniel charles marsh example described several toothless pterosaur specimens accompanied teeth belonged fish xiphactinus marsh assumed teeth belonged pterosaur specimens found since pterosaurs discovered time teeth assigned specimens new species called pterodactylus oweni changed pterodactylus occidentalis p oweni found preoccupied pterosaur species described name back american paleontologist edward drinker cope also found various pterosaur specimens north america assigned two new species known ornithochirus umbrosus ornithochirus harpyia cope attempted assign specimens found genus ornithocheirus misspelled forgetting however cope reassigned species umbrosus harpyia pterodactylus umbrosus pterodactylus harpyia though species considered nomina dubia ever paleontologist samuel wendell williston unearthed first skull pterosaur found animal made marsh create genus pteranodon lit toothless wing therefore reassigned american pterosaur species including ones named pterodactylus later subsequent revisions peter wellnhofer reduced number recognized species half dozen many species assigned pterodactylus based juvenile specimens subsequently recognized immature individuals species genera understood even true part remaining species p elegans example found numerous studies immature another species pterodactylus originally based small immature specimens p micronyx however difficult determine exactly genus species p micronyx might juvenile form stéphane jouve christopher bennett others suggested probably belonged either

phylogenetic analysis treated relevant specimens distinct units found p kochi type specimen form natural group p antiquus concluded genus diopecephalus could returned use distinguish p kochi p antiquus named new genus aerodactylus p scolopaciceps well bennett considered early growth stages one species vidovic martill considered representatives new bennett challenged hypothesis claimed vidovic martill identified real differences three groups specimens provided rationale differences enough distinguish species rather individual variation growth changes simply due crushing distortion fossilization process bennett pointed particular data used distinguish aerodactylus different data related species might due unnatural assemblage specimens result bennett continued consider diopecephalus aerodactylus simply yearclasses immature pterodactylus history various species pterodactylus gone number changes classification thus acquired large number synonyms additionally number
