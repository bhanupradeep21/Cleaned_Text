capillary small blood vessel micrometres diameter part microcirculation system capillaries microvessels smallest blood vessels body composed tunica intima innermost layer artery vein consisting thin wall simple squamous endothelial site exchange many substances surrounding interstitial fluid convey blood smallest branches arteries arterioles veins venules substances cross capillaries include water oxygen carbon dioxide glucose uric acid lactic acid creatinine lymph capillaries connect larger lymph vessels drain lymphatic fluid collected microcirculation capillary comes latin word capillaris meaning resembling hair use english beginning meaning stems tiny hairlike diameter capillary usually used noun word also used adjective capillary action liquid flows without influence external forces gravity blood flows heart arteries branch narrow arterioles branch capillaries nutrients wastes exchanged capillaries join widen become venules turn widen converge become veins return

metabolically active tissue capillaries required supply nutrients carry away products metabolism two types capillaries true capillaries branch arterioles provide exchange tissue capillary blood sinusoids type openpore capillary found liver bone marrow anterior pituitary gland brain circumventricular organs capillaries sinusoids short vessels directly connect arterioles venules opposite ends beds metarterioles found primarily mesenteric lymphatic capillaries slightly larger diameter blood capillaries closed ends unlike blood capillaries open one end arterioles open end venules structure permits interstitial fluid flow lymph capillaries greater internal oncotic pressure blood capillaries due greater concentration plasma proteins blood capillaries categorized three types continuous fenestrated sinusoidal also known discontinuous continuous capillaries continuous sense endothelial cells provide uninterrupted lining allow smaller molecules water ions pass intercellular lipidsoluble molecules passively diffuse endothelial cell membranes along concentration continuous capillaries divided two subtypes fenestrated capillaries pores known fenestrae latin windows endothelial cells nanometres nm diameter spanned diaphragm radially oriented fibrils allows small molecules limited amounts protein renal glomerulus cells diaphragms called podocyte foot processes pedicels slit pores function analogous diaphragm capillaries types blood vessels continuous basal laminae primarily located endocrine glands intestines pancreas glomeruli kidney sinusoidal capillaries discontinuous capillaries special type openpore capillary also known wider fenestrations micrometres μm diameter wider openings fenestrated capillaries diaphragms cover pores whereas sinusoids lack diaphragm open pore types blood vessels allow red white blood cells μm μm diameter various serum proteins pass aided discontinuous basal lamina capillaries lack pinocytotic vesicles therefore use gaps present cell junctions permit transfer endothelial cells hence across membrane sinusoids irregular spaces filled blood mainly found liver bone marrow spleen brain circumventricular early embryonic
