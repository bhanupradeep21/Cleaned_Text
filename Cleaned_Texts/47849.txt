laidleria extinct genus temnospondyl likely lived early middle triassic though exact stratigraphic range less certain laidleria found karoo basin south africa cynognathus zone genus represented one species l gracilis though family laidleriidae include genera uruyiella sister taxon laidleria discovered classified laidleria described among smaller temnospondyls comparable size smallest temnospondyl genera bulk lived immediately permiantriassic extinction unlike many temnospondyls largely aquatic semiaquatic laidleria likely much terrestrial lifestyle body covered dermal however like temnospondyls laidleria sprawling posture laidleria gracilis first described kitching noticed fossil albany museum locality stated fossil engcobo district eastern cape province well similar lithology fossil surrounding rock sandstone found burgersdorp lady frere districts kitching placed fossil triassic cynognathus zone beaufort group karoo basin original preparation description fossil able reveal palate occiput skull unable prepare dorsally fear skull fully intact preparation process could damage skull due hard sandstone around much debate surrounded classification laidleria due plethora derived plesiomorphic character kitching first called trematosaur much consideration though state many capitosaurid traits later argued laidleria placed superfamily rhytodosteoidea due traits placement orbitals short postorbital region wide occiput broad cultriform groups laidleria attributed include family laidleriidae family later specimen finally able prepared dorsally warren removed much taxonomic uncertainty defining states multiple key features especially related cranial dorsal view skull laidleria triangular edges formed premaxillae maxillae jugals quadratojugals depth skull quite shallow skull looking quadratojugals trough projects laterally forming unusual overhang near articulation external nares located laterally relatively posteriorly anterior edge skull making prenarial region appear orbits placed near lateral edges septomaxillae lacrimals may absent small though poor preservation bone region makes distinguishing difficult however posterior margin skull preserved quite well allowing warren say certainty otic notches otic embayments present despite mandibles preserved place obscuring many details area long parasphenoidpterygoid contact greatly reduced subtemporal vacuities broad cultriform process parasphenoid visible palate region teeth show incredible variability size small maxillary teeth larger premaxillary teeth well large tusks vomers palatines mandible teeth notably larger maxillae though fewer due extreme shallowness skull quadrate condyles roughly level occipital condyles occipital condyles though somewhat difficult interpret due imperfections preservation fossil appear elliptical shape seen temnospondyls way characteristic rhytidosteids posttemporal fenestrae either dramatically reduced completely absent resulting also abbreviated paroccipital processes tabular horn otic notch absent profoundly impacting morphology occipital region possibly contributing reduced area large stapes present sides skull though unique attached skull roof could contact post cranial vertebral column laidleria consists solid centra without marked midline notch neural arches short transverse processes neural spines pleurocentra barely visible small bony residues could possibly pleurocentra suggesting may reduced laidleria flexible vertebrae better suited terrestrial lifestyle differing ancestral condition stiffer vertebrae well spoollike intercentra may contributed increased mobility land dorsal ventral surfaces laidleria covered small ornamented scutes giving unique dermal armor uncommon dorsal scutes larger less rounded scutes located ventral surface dermal armor kind typically found temnospondyls especially triassic period though armored temnospondyls somewhat common little found paleobiology laidleria though much inferred known similar genera laidleria suited terrestrial lifestyle bulk temnospondyls would also eaten terrestrial prey bite suited environment may visible irregular emarginations dorsal surface skull anterior external naris may result pressure dentary tusks outcome greater pressure however poor preservation teeth makes analysis exact diet difficult additionally known laidleria stapes present skull though structures could connected post cranial likely used hearing hearing likely done feeling vibrations ground laidleria found karoo basin south africa namely burgersdorp formation within hard sandstone deposits characteristic early middle triassic period coming end permiantriassic mass extinction event characterized rapid diversification massive success temnospondyls survived mass extinction within karoo basin global anisian olenekian temnospondyl diversity returned levels comparable preextinction event laidleria doubtless benefitted postextinction event conditions temnospondyls taking advantage terrestrial lifestyle expand range available resources away water sources aquatic temnospondyls relied however genus found outside south africa suggesting terribly large
