plant collecting acquisition plant specimens purposes research cultivation hobby plant specimens may kept alive commonly dried pressed preserve quality specimen plant collecting ancient practice records chinese botanist collecting roses years herbaria collections preserved plants samples associated data scientific purposes largest herbarium world exist mus√©um national dhistoire naturelle paris france plant samples herbaria typically include reference sheet information plant details collection detailed organized system filing provides horticulturist researchers alike way find information certain plant way add new information existing plant sample file collection live plant specimens wild sometimes referred plant hunting activity occurred centuries earliest recorded evidence plant hunting bc botanists sent somalia collect incense trees queen hatshepsut victorian era saw surge plant hunting activity botanical adventurers explored world find exotic plants bring home often considerable personal risk plants usually ended botanical gardens private gardens wealthy collectors prolific plant hunters period included william lobb brother thomas lobb george forrest joseph hooker charles maries robert fortune collecting sample important first make sure land collecting allows removal natural specimens first step plant collection begins selection sample viable samples include identifying features flowers fruits root systems unique features smaller plants may require multiple individuals make sample plants show signs infection avoided prevent spreading next step finding suitable plant collection assign number record keeping purposes number system individual collector usually involves date collection sequential number collection along assigned number observations plants location live appearance noted detail field notes accompany finished sample provide supplementary information proper pressing mounting techniques critical longevity collected plant sample properly preserved plant samples last hundreds new york botanical garden holds plant samples date back lewis clark expedition cleaning sample mud dirt next step press sample samples may press better left wilt days however plants never allowed spoil decompose pressing impact quality dried product plant presses commonly constructed two flat smooth pieces wood type compression mechanism compression may accomplished tightened nuts bolts corners press tightened straps around press placing weights top press book weighted object top also act placing press plant samples sandwiched layers absorbent blotter newspaper cardboard two common choices blotter material arranging plant press important remember dried plant product fragile inflexible position plant exactly wish final product appear tighten press wait approximately day check plant blotter taken replaced dry blotter roughly every hours complete drying time vary depending type plant generally days fleshier plants succulents take plant sample sufficiently dried pressed must mounted quality mounting impacts appearance plant sample also determines rate deterioration sample experience herbarium quality mounts use specialized paper best protection paper either alpha cellulose paper cotton rag paper types paper ideal preserving plant samples acid free ph neutral samples strapped paper linen tape glued onto sheet glue needed recommended grade methyl cellulose mixed water used optimal deterioration order plant specimens kept good condition future reference adequate storage conditions needed storage space kept low light low humidity environment temperature storage space kept cool degrees fahrenheit degrees important keep storage space free harmful pest recommended protect specimens sheathing sheets sealed plastic bags various pesticides may also used protect storage space pest infestation pest infestation already occurred samples frozen three four days freezing new additions plant samples suggested preventative measure introduction pest storage specimens compressed degrade dried require techniques preservation storage large seeds fruits may stored boxes without aquatic plants delicate plants may stored liquid preservative cacti may stored ethanol cases drying pressing plant may destroy alter plant feature studied ethanol used preserve specimen weeks commonly used sectioning tissue collector wishes preserve flower natural shape use desiccant commonly used desiccant silica gel flowers placed box desiccant added till flowers covered days desiccant removed revealing preserved herbarium specimens plants collected number different uses assist accurate identification provide species record time place used distribution maps also provide biological material researchers reference point document scientific names vouchers research seed dna barcoding new method identification plant vouchers used herbaria across smithsonian national museum natural history creates barcodes short sequence plant dna easily identified healthy specimens species barcode printed placed onto plant mount creating dna barcodes process organizing loaning plant specimens becomes streamlined mechanized voucher specimens select herbarium specimens distinguishes specimens others voucher specimen representative sample expertly identified organism specimens usually associated professional research article
