allows visual system interpret differences colour ultimately efficient processing colours primary visual cortex sends visual information extrastriate cortical areas higher order visual processing extrastriate cortical areas located anterior occipital lobe main ones designated visual areas area multiple functions recent findings shown colour centre neither isolated traceable single area visual
