using bone marrow cord blood seem help certain leukodystrophy types research done combined incidence leukodystrophies estimated majority types involve inheritance xlinked recessive xlinked dominant

telltale physical signs including muscle rigidity backwardsbent botox therapy often used treat patients juvenile adult onsets display similar symptoms including decrease loss hearing vision children experience optic auditory degeneration course disease usually rapid causing death relatively quickly whereas adults may live conditions many years children spastic activity often precedes progressive ataxia rapid cognitive deterioration described mental epilepsy commonplace patients progressed patients show weakness deglutition leading spastic coughing fits due inhaled saliva classic symptomatic progression juvenile xlinked adrenoleukodystrophy shown film lorenzos course timetable dependent age onset infants showing lifespan years juveniles years adults typically years adults typically see
