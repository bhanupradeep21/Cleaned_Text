agnosia inability process sensory information often loss ability recognize objects persons sounds shapes smells specific sense defective significant memory usually associated brain injury neurological illness particularly damage occipitotemporal border part ventral agnosia affects single vision recently topdown interruption considered cause disturbance handling perceptual visual agnosia broad category refers deficiency ability recognize visual objects visual agnosia subdivided two different subtypes apperceptive visual agnosia associative visual individuals apperceptive visual agnosia display ability see contours outlines shown object experience difficulty asked categorize objects apperceptive visual agnosia associated damage one hemisphere specifically damage posterior sections right contrast individuals associative visual agnosia experience difficulty asked name objects associative agnosia associated damage right left hemispheres occipitotemporal specific form associative visual agnosia known prosopagnosia prosopagnosia inability recognize faces example individuals difficulty recognizing friends family however individuals prosopagnosia recognize types visual speech agnosia auditory verbal agnosia refers inability comprehend spoken words despite intact hearing speech production reading patients report hear sounds produced sounds fundamentally unrecognizable untranslatablecitation needed despite inability process speaker saying patients reported recognize certain characteristic information speakers voice man agnosia result strokes dementia neurological disorders may also traumainduced head injury brain infection hereditary additionally forms agnosia may result developmental damage causing agnosia usually occurs either occipital parietal lobes brain although one modality may affected cognitive abilities areas patients experience dramatic recovery blindness experience significant total effect damage superior temporal sulcus consistent several types neurolinguistic deficiencies contend agnosia one superior temporal sulcus vital speech comprehension region highly involved lexical interface according trace ii model lexical interface associates sound waves phonemes morphological features produce meaningful words association process accomplished lateral inhibitionexcitement certain words within individuals lexicon instance experimenter say dog aloud utterance would activate inhibit various words within subjects lexical interface consistency model agnosia shown evidence bilateral lesions superior temporal sulcus produces pure word deafness kussmaul understood today speech agnosia patients pure word deafness demonstrate inability recognize process speech sounds normal auditory processing nonspeech sounds level order assess individual agnosia must verified individual loss sensation language abilities intelligence intact order individual diagnosed agnosia must experiencing sensory deficit single modality make diagnosis distinction apperceptive associative agnosia must made distinction made individual complete copying matching tasks individual form apperceptive agnosia able match two stimuli identical appearance contrast individual form associative agnosia able match different examples stimulus example individual diagnosed associative agnosia visual modality would able match pictures laptop open laptop individuals pure alexia usually difficulty reading words well difficulty identifying letters order assess whether individual pure alexia tests copying recognition must performed individual pure alexia able copy set words able recognize individuals usually shown pictures human faces may familiar famous actors singers politicians family members pictures shown patient selected age culture appropriate task involves examiner asking individual name face individual name whose face appears picture examiner may ask question would help recognize face practical purposes direct cure patients may improve information presented modalities damaged one different types therapies help reverse effects agnosia cases occupational therapy speech therapy improve agnosia depending causecitation needed initially many individuals form agnosia unaware extent either perceptual recognition deficit may caused anosognosia lack awareness deficit lack awareness usually leads form denial resistance form help treatment various methods used help individual recognize impairment perception recognition may patient presented stimulus impaired modality help increase awareness deficit alternatively task broken component parts individual see part problem caused deficit individual acknowledges perceptual recognition deficit form treatment may recommended various forms treatment compensatory strategies alternate modalities verbal strategies alternate cues organizational using verbal descriptions may helpful individuals certain types agnosia individuals prosopagnosics may find useful listen description friend family member recognize based description easily visual alternate cues may particularly useful individual environmental agnosia prosopagnosia alternate cues individual environmental agnosia may include color cues tactile markers symbolize new room remember area prosopagnosics may use alternate visual cues scar individuals face crooked teeth cues senses like sound individuals voice order recognize hair color length helpful cues organizational strategies may extremely helpful individual visual agnosia example organizing clothes according different hangers provides tactile cues individual making easier identify certain forms clothing opposed relying solely visual clinical trials done research treatments national institute neurological disorders stroke ninds support

freud disturbances recognition objects finkelnburg classes asymbolia like propose term agnosia prior freuds introduction term first ideas agnosia came carl wernicke created theories receptive aphasia noted individuals receptive aphasia possess ability understand speech repeat words believed receptive aphasia due lesions posterior third left superior temporal gyrus due lesions wernicke believed individuals receptive aphasia limited deafness certain sounds frequencies wernicke came kussmaul attempted explain auditory verbal agnosia also known word deafness occurs contrary wernickes explanations kussmaul believed auditory verbal agnosia result major destruction first left temporal gyrus kussmaul also posited origins alexia acquired dyslexia also known word blindness believed word blindness result lesions left angular supramarginal heinrich lissauer shared ideas agnosia wernicke theorized two ways object recognition impairment could occur one way impairment could occur damage early perceptual processing damage actual object representation actual object representation damaged would allow object stored visual memory therefore individual would able recognize time wernicke
