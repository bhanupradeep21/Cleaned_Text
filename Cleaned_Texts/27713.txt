syndrome scs also known acrocephalosyndactyly type iii rare congenital disorder associated craniosynostosis premature closure one sutures bones skull affects shape head face resulting coneshaped head asymmetrical face individuals scs also droopy eyelids ptosis widely spaced eyes hypertelorism minor abnormalities hands feet individuals severe cases scs may mild moderate intellectual learning disabilities depending level severity individuals scs may require form medical surgical individuals scs live fairly normal lives regardless whether medical treatment needed scs presents variable fashion majority individuals scs moderately affected uneven facial features relatively flat face due underdeveloped eye sockets cheekbones lower jaw addition physical abnormalities people scs also experience growth delays results relatively short stature although individuals scs normal intelligence individuals may mild moderate mental delays severe cases scs serious facial deformities occurs multiple cranial sutures close cranium consists three main sections including base cranium occipital bone face frontal bone top parietal bones sides temporal bone head bones cranium permanently set place prior birth however temporal parietal bones separated sutures remain open allowing head slightly change shape childbirth cranial sutures eventually close within first couple years following birth brain finished individuals scs coronal suture separating frontal bones parietal bones closes prematurely craniosynostosis occasionally even birth coronal suture closes asymmetrically unilaterally face forehead form unevenly sidetoside people scs pointy towerlike heads brain growing faster skull resulting increased intracranial pressure icp causing top head andor forehead bulge allow brain growth face appears uneven particularly areas eyes cheeks forehead appears wide abnormal forehead less space normal facial features develop results shallow eye sockets flat cheekbones shallow eye sockets make eyes prominent bulging cause eyes separated normal hypertelorism underdeveloped eye sockets cheekbones lower jaw cause face appear flat furthermore minor downward slant eyes along drooping eyelids ptosis adds overall unevenness scs typically inherited autosomal dominant trait however occasion children microdeletion chromosome containing locus responsible scs develop new abnormalities typically show significant neurological abnormalities increased parental age may play role development new mutations linkage analysis chromosomal rearrangement revealed cause scs mutations twist gene twist transcription factor gene located chromosome twist gene encodes basic helixloophelix bhlh transcription factor controls head mesenchyme development cranial tube forms varying twist mutations involving bhlh domain protein identified people scs mutations include missense nonsense frameshift deletioninsertion mutations either shorten disrupt bhlh domain individuals scs single large deletion region contains region codes twist searching gene responsible scs scientists johns hopkins children center began studying twist gene effects mice twist gene mice functions development muscle skeleton face head hands feet mice lacking copies twist gene spontaneously aborted prior birth serious deformities including abnormal limb head defects failure neural tube properly close however mice single copy nonworking twist gene survived examination revealed mice minor skull hand foot defects similar seen scs mouse twist gene located chromosome mice corresponds short arm

five different types mutations discovered individuals scs since none mutations seen normal individuals didnt scs provided enough evidence conclude twist gene causative agent researchers also studied

diagnosis saethrechotzen syndrome high risk pregnancies doable uncommon rarely performed furthermore possible mutation causing disease already identified within family genome different techniques prenatal testing carried prenatal testing usually performed around weeks using amniocentesis extract dna fetuss cells prenatal testing also performed weeks using chorionic villus sampling cvs extract dna recently increased interest utilizing ultrasound equipment order detect fetal skull abnormalities due immature fusion cranial overall diagnosis scs primarily based clinical findings observations

analysis sequence analysis deletionduplication analysis cytogenetics fish analysis sequence analysis exon coding region provides good method detecting frequency mutations gene mutations include nonsense missense splice site mutation intragenic deletionsinsertions deletionduplication analysis identifies mutations gene readily detected sequence analysis common methods include pcr multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification mlpa chromosomal microarray cma cytogeneticfish analysis attaches fluorescently labels dna markers denatured chromosome examined fluorescent lighting reveals

used study genechromosome defects cytogenetic testing study chromosomes detect gains losses chromosomes chromosome segments using fluorescent situ hybridization fish andor comparative genomic hybridization cgh direct gene testing uses blood hair skin amniotic fluid tissues order find genetic disorders direct gene testing determine whether individual scs testing individuals blood mutations genetic testing allows definitive diagnosis allows similar conditions differentiated based gene following table contains conditions similar scs physical abnormalities resulting scs typically mild require minor surgical procedure procedure one common symptoms scs development short brachydactyly webbed fingers broad toes syndactyly characteristics cause problems function hands feet thus medical procedure required fix abnormalities unless patient requests webbing fingers may affect base fingers resulting delayed hand growth childhood contributes functional impairments sometimes individuals scs develop broad toes bones ends toes duplicating especially seen big toe requires surgical intervention doesnt negatively affect overall function foot individuals toe abnormalities walk normally wear normal severe cases frequent surgeries clinical monitoring required throughout development child born asymmetrical unilateral coronal synostosis undergo cranioplasty within first year life order prevent increased intracranial pressure prevent progressive facial asymmetry cranioplasty surgical procedure correct prematurely fused cranial bones surgery acts reconstruct reposition bones sutures order promote normal cranioplasty necessary order continue grow important two main reasons first skull needs able accommodate growing brain following childbirth cant skull doesnt grow fast brain long sutures remain fused results increase pressure surrounding brain inhibits brain growing causing individual experience significant problems left untreated eventually lead death secondly cranioplasty may required appearance especially case individuals asymmetrical unilateral coronal synostosis requires reconstructive surgery face skull cranioplasty performed especially individuals unilateral coronal synostosis facial asymmetry get worse worse time cranioplasty performed soon surgery may also required individuals vision problems vision problems usually arise due lack space eye orbit skull abnormal bone structure face decreased space may also lead abnormal missing tear ducts nerve damage reconstructive surgery usually required order increase cranial space correct tear duct stenosis andor correct ptosis eyelids order prevent amblyopia lazy midfacial surgery may also required early childhood correct respiratory problems dental malocclusion swallowing difficulties cleft palate also corrected surgery may involve use tympanostomy tubes needed individual undergo orthognathic treatment andor orthodontic treatment facial development since hearing loss frequently associated scs recommended audiology screening persist throughout cranial reconstructive surgery child may required wear molding helmet form head protection cranial bones set place typically takes three months depends childs age severity condition following recovery individuals scs look act completely normal one would even able tell scs common craniosynostosis syndrome affects every occurs racial ethnic groups affects males females parent carries copy scs gene mutation chance child also carry copy gene mutation case child may may show signs scs also chance child two working copies gene would therefore scs parents carry single copy scs gene mutation chance child two gene mutation copies child would develop severe scs chance child would two normal copies gene would completely normal chance child would carry one gene mutation copy normal copy child may may display rare situations two normal parents child scs due de novo mutation exact cause de novo mutation unknown doesnt seem related
