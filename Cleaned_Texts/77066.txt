paralyse threatened sexual scandinavian study reported women visited emergency clinic within month experiencing sexual violence experienced significant tonic immobility paralysis happened even reported extreme tonic immobility sexual assault moreover almost twothirds women developed posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd major modern societies large portion population yet know paralysis sometimes called freezing happens often example dutch survey research commissioned amnesty international involving dutchspeaking students showed never heard freezing sense paralysis heard know exactly meant remaining students aged younger know never even heard however older students knew aged older knew moreover students know personal experience others sexual penetration without consent knew freezing survey also showed men never heard know women never heard without knowing finally many students found someone clearly say want sexual penetration even knew paralysis paralysed person unable say biggest difference women knew paralysis found therefore say want sex women knew paralysis men never heard paralysis found clearly say want sex men never heard although men also victims sexual violencenote also paralysed fear happens women often usually male perpetrators although also female lack public awareness paralysis potential perpetrators often recognise paralysis person want sex risk initiator asked person verbally nonverbally whether wanted sex initiator indicated wish sex fact becomes paralysed fear thus unable say resist interpreted initiator meaning person object sex initiator could falsely believe silence means consent proceed initiate sexual acts paralysed person way possible people unintentionally rape assault paralysed person without realising known negligent rape negligent sexual assault furthermore assumption every person could say resist moment want sex could afterwards lead perpetrator blame victim objected hand potential victims often unprepared scenario become paralysed unable say physically resist anymore soon find situation late afterwards many victims also known survivors understand happened could say anything communicate want sex consequence often blame sexually assaulted expected able something conclude failed could lead great shame tendency tell nobody happened attempts forget traumatic experience erase traces including matters could used evidence lack knowledge paralysis amongst legislators lawyers lead failure consider sexual scenarios paralysis occurs one hand could lead legislation based idea rape assault always accompanied violence coercion perpetrator andor always accompanied resistance victim coercionbased legislation falls short cases paralysis prevents victim resisting thus perpetrator use force coercion perform sexual acts person want according law crime committed perpetrator prosecuted result often legal protection victims sexual violence become remediate issue several countries define sexual violence force coercion also psychological pressure andor defenselessness victim legislation captures paralysis also cases victim intoxicated another possible solution problem base legislation sexual violence lack consent according approach requirement person communicates consent actually best way ensure person actually wants sex initiator get response person initiator may decide better engage sexual acts safe side case silence misinterpreted consentbased legislation eliminates requirement prove rape assault based violence coercion perpetrator victims resistance often made impossible
