cytometry compensation mathematical correction signal overlap channels emission spectra different photons emitted fluorochromes different energies wavelengths flow cytometers use photomultiplier tubes pmt order convert photons electrons detector register signal one fluorochrome creates signal overlap spillover removed optical system corrected electronically compensation done different flow cytometry software flowjo flowlogic kaluza etc first data compensation done michael loken et al two colour experiment mouse splenocytes stained fluorescein one cell marked two fluorochromes added brightness one fluorochrome creates significant background noise affects strength signal called spillover physical overlap different emission spectra fluorochromes activate different receptors ones intended given wavelength ability correct stems fact overlap linear function measured signal averaged thus corrected correction called compensation compensation necessary order able differentiate populations cells done measuring spectral overlap different fluorochromes using measured values create matrix matrix inverted gives actual compensation values flow cytometer uses values correct overlap detector
