cave bear ursus spelaeus prehistoric species bear lived europe asia pleistocene became extinct years ago last glacial maximum word cave scientific name spelaeus used fossils species mostly found caves reflects views experts cave bears may spent time caves brown bear uses caves hibernation thought largely herbivorous cave bear skeletons first described johann friedrich esper book newly discovered zoolites unknown four footed animals scientists time considered skeletons could belong apes canids felids even dragons unicorns esper postulated actually belonged polar bears twenty years later johann christian rosenmüller anatomist leipzig university gave species binomial name bones numerous researchers little regard world war scarcity phosphate dung earth caves cave bear bones occurred used

pliopleistocene etruscan bear ursus lived mya years ago last common ancestor cave bears brown bears lived immediate precursor cave bear probably ursus deningeri deningers bear species restricted pleistocene europe mya years transition deningers bear cave bear given last interglacial although boundary forms arbitrary intermediate transitional taxa proposed eg ursus spelaeus authorities consider taxa chronological variants cave bears found anywhere vary age thus facilitating investigations evolutionary trends three anterior premolars gradually reduced disappeared possibly response largely vegetarian diet fourth skulls found conturines third premolar still present derived specimens elsewhere lack last remaining premolar became conjugated true molars enlarging crown granting cusps cutting borders phenomenon called molarization improved mastication capacities molars facilitating processing tough vegetation allowed cave bear gain energy hibernation eating less scientists recovered sequenced nuclear dna cave bear lived years ago procedure used genomic dna extracted one animals teeth sequencing dna directly rather first replicating polymerase chain reaction scientists recovered cave bear genes remains yield significant amounts dna traditional study confirmed built results previous study using mitochondrial dna extracted cave bear remains ranging years show cave bear closely related brown bear polar bear american black bear split brown bear lineage distinct eastern western brown bear lineages diversified split brown bears polar bears divergence date estimate cave bears brown bears however recent study showed species hybridization cave bear broad domed skull steep forehead stout body long thighs massive shins inturning feet making similar skeletal structure brown cave bears comparable size larger largest modernday bears measuring ft average weight males kg though specimens weighed much kg females weighed kg cave bear skeletons museums classified male due misconception female skeletons merely dwarfs cave bears grew larger glaciations smaller interglacials probably adjust heat loss cave bears last ice age lacked usual two three premolars present bears compensate last molar elongated supplementary humerus cave bear similar size polar bear femora females femora male cave bears however bore similarities size kodiak cave bear teeth large show greater wear modern bear species suggesting diet tough materials however tubers gritty food cause distinctive tooth wear modern brown bears appear constituted major part cave bears diets basis dental microwear morphological features cave bear chewing apparatus including loss premolars long suggested indicate diets displayed higher degree herbivory eurasian brown indeed solely vegetarian diet inferred basis tooth results obtained stable isotopes cave bear bones also point largely vegetarian diet low levels accumulated faster rate carnivores opposed herbivores however evidence points toward occasional inclusion animal protein cave bear diets example toothmarks cave bear remains areas cave bears recorded potential carnivores suggests occasional cannibalistic possibly individuals died hibernation dental microwear analysis indicates cave bear may fed greater quantity bone contemporary smaller eurasian brown additionally cave bear remains peștera cu oase southwestern tip romanian part carpathian mountains elevated levels bones indicative omnivorous although values within range found strictly herbivorous although current prevailing opinion concludes cave bears largely herbivorous modern species genus increasing evidence points omnivorous diets based regional variability isotopic composition bone remains indicative dietary recent reevaluation craniodental morphology places cave bear squarely among omnivorous modern bear species respect skull tooth death hibernation common end cave bears mainly befalling specimens failed ecologically summer season inexperience sickness old cave bear bones show signs numerous ailments including spinal fusion bone tumours cavities tooth resorption necrosis particularly younger specimens osteomyelitis periostitis rickets kidney male cave bear skeletons found broken bacula probably due fighting breeding cave bear longevity unknown though estimated seldom exceeded twenty years paleontologists doubt adult cave bears natural predators save packhunting wolves cave hyenas would probably attacked sick infirm cave hyenas thought responsible disarticulation destruction cave bear skeletons large carcasses optimal food resource hyenas especially end winter food presence fully articulated adult cave lion skeletons deep cave bear dens indicates lions may occasionally entered dens prey hibernating cave bears dying cave bears range stretched across europe spain british isles west italy parts germany poland balkans romania georgia parts russia including caucasus northern iran traces cave bears found northern british isles scandinavia baltic countries covered extensive glaciers time largest numbers cave bear remains found austria switzerland northern italy northern spain southern

humerus scraper core flakes interpreted grave offerings unusual discovery deep chamber basura cave savona italy thought related cave bear worship vaguely zoomorphic stalagmite surrounded clay pellets thought used neanderthals ceremony bear bones scattered floor suggests likely sort ritual reassessment fossils indicate cave bear probably died years complex set factors rather single factor suggested led compared megafaunal species also became extinct last glacial maximum cave bear believed specialized diet highquality plants relatively restricted geographical range suggested explanation died much earlier experts disputed claim cave bear survived multiple climate changes prior extinction additionally mitochondrial dna research indicated genetic decline cave bear began long became extinct demonstrating habitat loss due climate change finally high levels found cave bear bones romania indicating wider dietary possibilities previously overhunting humans largely dismissed human populations time small pose serious threat cave bears survival though two species may competed living space chauvet cave contains around bear hollows created cave bear unlike brown bears cave bears seldom represented cave paintings leading experts believe cave bear may avoided human habitat preferences may overlapped paleontologist björn kurtén hypothesized cave bear populations fragmented stress even advent populations living south alps possibly survived significantly evidence indicates cave bear used caves hibernation inclined use locations thickets purpose contrast versatile brown bear specialized hibernation behavior would caused high winter mortality rate cave bears failed find available caves therefore human populations slowly increased cave bear faced shrinking pool suitable caves slowly faded away extinction neanderthals anatomically modern humans sought caves living quarters depriving cave bear vital habitat hypothesis researched according research study published journal molecular biology evolution radiocarbon dating fossil remains shows cave bear ceased abundant central europe around years results large scale study bone specimens resulting new sequences previously published complete mitochondrial genomes cave bear mitochondrial dna remains found switzerland poland france spain germany italy serbia indicated cave bear population drastically declined starting around years ago onset aurignacian coinciding arrival anatomically modern concluded human hunting andor competition played major role decline ultimate disappearance climate change likely dominant study spanish cave bear mtdna cave used cave bears found contain almost exclusively unique lineage closely related haplotypes indicating homing behaviour birthing hibernation conclusion study
