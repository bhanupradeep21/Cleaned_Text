necessary requirement order social interaction occur first place hamilton put altruistic selfish acts possible suitable social object available sense behaviours conditional start hamilton words whilst inclusive fitness theory specifies set necessary criteria evolution certain altruistic traits specify sufficient condition evolution given species since typical ecology demographics life pattern species must also allow social interactions individuals occur potential elaboration social traits evolve regard interactions initial presentation inclusive fitness theory see genetical evolution social behaviour focused making general mathematical case possibility social evolution however since many field biologists mainly use theory guide observations analysis empirical phenomena hamilton also speculated possible proximate behavioural mechanisms might observable organisms whereby social trait could effectively achieve necessary statistical correlation likely bearers selective advantage makes behaviour conditional right sense discrimination factors correlate relationship individual concerned therefore obvious may instance respect certain social action performed towards neighbours indiscriminately individual breaking even terms inclusive fitness could learn recognise neighbours really close relatives could devote beneficial actions alone advantage inclusive fitness would appear thus mutation causing discriminatory behaviour benefits inclusive fitness would selected fact individual may need perform discrimination sophisticated suggest difference generosity behaviour according whether situations evoking encountered near far home might occasion advantage similar kind hamilton hamilton suggesting two broad proximate mechanisms social traits might meet criterion correlation specified theory kin recognition active discrimination social trait enables organism distinguish different degrees genetic relatedness interacting mixed population discriminate positively performing social behaviours basis detecting genetic relatedness average relatedness recipients altruism could high enough meet criterion another section paper page hamilton considered whether supergenes

attempt apply inclusive fitness understanding organisms behaviour example hamilton initially suggested statistical correlation formulation could understood correlation coefficient genetic relatedness quickly accepted george prices correction general regression coefficient relevant metric together published corrections related confusion connection inclusive fitness multilevel selection often incorrectly assumed mutually exclusive theories regression coefficient helps clarify connection way first explained approach using inclusive fitness often identified kin selection presented strictly alternative group selection foregoing discussion shows kinship considered one way getting positive regression genotype recipient positive regression vitally necessary altruism thus inclusivefitness concept general kin selectionhamilton hamilton also later modified thinking likely mediating mechanisms whereby social traits achieve necessary correlation genetic relatedness specifically corrected earlier speculations innate ability supergenes recognise actual genetic relatedness likely mediating mechanism kin altruism expect anything describable innate kin recognition adaptation used social behaviour mating reasons already given hypothetical case trees hamilton point inbreeding avoidance significant since whole genome sexual organisms benefits avoiding close inbreeding different selection pressure play compared selection pressure social traits see kin recognition information ability discriminate degrees relatedness automatically implies kin selection model relevant origin fact since even earlier darwin realised organisms tend avoid closely inbred matings reasons must function sexuality quite yet resolved see eg bell shields hamilton whatever function must another set reasons discriminating animals clearly use discrimination purposes mate selection japanese quail example evidently use early imprinting chick companions towards obtaining much later preferred degrees consanguinity mates bateson hamilton since hamitons speculations active discrimination mechanisms theorists richard dawkins clarified would negative selection pressure mechanisms genes recognize copies individuals discriminate socially basis dawkins used green beard thought experiment gene social behaviour imagined also cause distinctive phenotype recognised carriers gene due conflicting genetic similarity rest genome would selection pressure greenbeard altruistic sacrifices suppressed via meitoic drive hamiltons later clarifications often go unnoticed longstanding assumption kin selection requires innate powers kin recognition theorists later tried clarify position fact animals benefit engaging spatially mediated behaviors evidence animals recognize kin support conclusion spatially based differential behaviors represent kin recognition mechanism see also discussions blaustein waldman halpin words evolutionary perspective may well advantageous kin aggregate individuals
