hip dislocation thighbone femur separates hip bone specifically head femur femoral head separates socket hip bone known joint femur pelvis hip joint stable secured bony softtissue dislocation would require significant force typically results significant trauma motor vehicle collision fall hip dislocations also occur following hip replacement developmental abnormality known hip hip dislocations
