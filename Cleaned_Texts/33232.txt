purely decided chance besides random process second random process second random process dna scrambled way pieces omitted deletion added duplication moved one place another translocation inverted inversion common process leads variation dna explains even identical twins genetically identicalcitation needed second random process give rise genetic mistakes deletion duplication process chromosomes come together new cell may shorter longer result spontaneous change structure dna copy number variation due copy number variation chromosomes different sizes combined new cell occurs
