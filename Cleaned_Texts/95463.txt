hydronephrosis describes hydrostatic dilation renal pelvis calyces result obstruction urine flow downstream alternatively hydroureter describes dilation ureter hydronephroureter describes dilation entire upper urinary tract renal pelvicalyceal system ureter signs symptoms hydronephrosis depend upon whether obstruction acute chronic partial complete unilateral bilateral hydronephrosis occurs acutely sudden onset caused kidney stone cause intense pain flank area hips ribs known renal colic historically type pain described dietls conversely hydronephrosis develops gradually time generally cause either dull discomfort pain nausea vomiting may also occur obstruction occurs urethra bladder outlet cause pain pressure resulting distension bladder blocking flow urine commonly prone urinary tract infections lead development stones fever blood pus urine complete obstruction occurs postrenal kidney failure obstructive nephropathy may blood tests may show impaired kidney function elevated urea creatinine electrolyte imbalances hyponatremia hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis urinalysis may indicate elevated ph due secondary destruction nephrons within affected kidney impairs acid excretion physical examination thin patient may detect palpable abdominal flank mass caused enlarged kidneycitation needed hydronephrosis result several abnormal pathophysiological occurrences structural abnormalities junctions kidney ureter bladder lead hydronephrosis occur fetal development congenital defects identified inherited conditions however benefits linking genetic testing early diagnosis structural abnormalities could caused injury surgery radiation therapycitation needed common causes hydronephrosis children anatomical abnormalities include vesicoureteral reflux urethral stricture stenosis common cause hydronephrosis young adults kidney stones older adults common cause hydronephrosis benign prostate hyperplasia bph intrapelvic neoplasms prostate compression one ureters also caused developmental defects completely occurring fetal stage abnormally placed vein artery tumor bilateral compression ureters occur pregnancy due enlargement uterus changes hormone levels time may also affect muscle contractions bladder complicating conditioncitation needed sources obstruction arise various causes include kidney stones blood clots retroperitoneal obstruction may either partial complete occur anywhere urethral meatus renal calyces hydronephrosis also result retrograde flow urine bladder back kidneys vesicoureteral reflux caused factors listed well compression bladder outlet urethra prostate enlargement fecal impaction rectum sits immediately behind prostate well abnormal contractions bladder detrusor muscles resulting neurological dysfunction neurogenic bladder muscular hydronephrosis caused obstruction urine renal pelvis obstruction causes dilation nephron tubules flattening lining tubules within kidneys turn causes swelling renal hydronephrosis either acute chronic acute hydronephrosis full recovery kidney function seen however chronic hydronephrosis permanent loss kidney function seen even obstruction obstruction occurs anywhere along upper urinary tract lead increased pressure within structures kidney due inability pass urine kidney bladder common causes upper tract obstruction include obstructing stones ureteropelvic junction upj obstruction caused intrinsic narrowing ureters overlying vessel obstruction occurring lower urinary tract also cause increased pressure reflux urine kidney common causes include bladder dysfunction neurogenic bladder urethral obstruction posterior urethral valves male infants compression prostatic hypertrophy older male adults pregnancy dextrorotation rotation right uterus cause compression right ureter thus making hydronephrosis common right kidney left kidney besides hormones oestrogen progestrerone prostaglandin cause ureter dilatation thus causing hydronephrosis despite absence visible obstruction along urinary prenatal diagnosis fact cases pediatric patients incidentally detected routine screening ultrasounds obtained however approximately half prenatally identified hydronephrosis transient resolves time infant born another hydronephrosis persists associated urinary tract obstruction socalled nonrefluxing nonobstructive hydronephrosis children regression hydronephrosis occurs spontaneously usually age however remaining cases prenatal hydronephrosis pathological condition identified diagnostic workup depends age patient well whether hydronephrosis detected incidentally prenatally associated symptoms blood tests measurement creatinine typically indicated though must interpreted cautiously even cases severe unilateral hydronephrosis overall kidney function may remain normal since unaffected kidney compensate obstructed kidneycitation needed urinalysis usually performed determine presence blood typical kidney stones signs infection positive leukocyte esterase nitrite impaired concentrating ability elevated urine ph distal renal tubular acidosis also commonly found due tubular stress injurycitation needed imaging studies intravenous urogram ivu renal ultrasonography ct mri also important investigations determining presence cause hydronephrosis whilst ultrasound allows visualisation ureters kidneys determine presence hydronephrosis hydroureter ivu useful assessing anatomical location obstruction antegrade retrograde pyelography show similar findings ivu offer therapeutic option well realtime ultrasounds doppler ultrasound tests association vascular resistance testing helps determine given obstruction effecting urinary functionality hydronephrotic determining cause hydronephrosis location obstruction determined whittaker pressure perfusion test wherein collecting system kidney accessed percutaneously liquid introduced high pressure constant rate measuring pressure within renal pelvis rise pressure cm suggests urinary collection system obstructed arriving pressure measurement bladder pressure subtracted initial reading internal pressure test first described whittaker test hypothesis patients whose hydronephrosis persists posterior urethral valves ablated usually ureters obstructed even though may kay recommends neonate born untreated utero hydronephrosis receive renal ultrasound within two days birth renal pelvis greater neonate considered abnormal suggests significant dilation possible abnormalities obstruction morphological abnormalities urinary choice imaging depends clinical presentation history symptoms examination findings case renal colic one sided loin pain usually accompanied trace blood urine initial investigation usually spiral helical ct scan advantage showing whether obstruction flow urine causing hydronephrosis well demonstrating function kidney many stones visible plain xray ivu stones visible ct therefore ct becoming common choice initial investigation ct used however reason avoid radiation exposure eg incidentally detected prenatal hydronephrosis first study obtain postnatal renal ultrasound since noted many cases prenatal hydronephrosis resolve spontaneously generally done within first days birth although risk obtaining imaging study early may miss cases mild hydronephrosis due relative oliguria newborn thus experts recommend obtaining followup ultrasound weeks reduce falsenegative rate initial voiding cystourethrogram vcug also typically obtained exclude possibility vesicoureteral reflux anatomical abnormalities posterior urethral valves finally hydronephrosis significant obstruction suspected ureteropelvic junction upj ureterovesical junction uvj obstruction nuclear imaging study scan ct scan bilateral hydronephrosis due

urography right reveals nondilated calyces pelvises society fetal ultrasound sfu developed grading system hydronephrosis initially intended use neonatal infant hydronephrosis used grading hydronephrosis adults treatment hydronephrosis focuses upon removal obstruction drainage urine accumulated behind obstruction therefore specific treatment depends upon obstruction acute obstruction upper urinary tract usually treated insertion nephrostomy tube chronic upper urinary tract obstruction treated insertion ureteric stent lower urinary tract obstruction caused bladder outflow obstruction secondary prostatic hypertrophy usually treated insertion urinary catheter suprapubic catheter surgery required prenatally detected prognosis hydronephrosis extremely variable depends condition leading hydronephrosis whether one unilateral bilateral kidneys affected preexisting kidney function duration hydronephrosis acute chronic whether hydronephrosis occurred developing mature kidneyscitation needed permanent kidney damage occur prolonged hydronephrosis secondary compression kidney tissue example unilateral hydronephrosis caused obstructing stone likely resolve stone passes likelihood recovery excellent alternately severe bilateral prenatal hydronephrosis occurs posterior urethral valves likely carry poor longterm prognosis obstruction kidneys developing causes permanent
