cyanidioschyzon merolae small clubshaped unicellular haploid red alga adapted high sulfur acidic hot spring environments ph cellular architecture c merolae extremely simple containing single chloroplast single mitochondrion lacking vacuole cell addition cellular organelle divisions synchronized reasons c merolae considered excellent model system study cellular organelle division processes well biochemistry structural organisms genome first full algal genome sequenced plastid sequenced mitochondrion organism considered simplest eukaryotic cells minimalist cellular originally isolated de luca solfatane fumaroles campi flegrei naples c merolae grown culture laboratory modified allens medium modified form twice concentration elements called using medium growth rates particularly fast doubling time time takes culture microbes double cells per unit volume approximately using optimal medium reduced culturing done white fluorescent light approximate intensity µmol photons however higher light intensity µe applied bubbling growth rate c merolae increased doubling time approximately higher light necessarily beneficial µe growth rate begins may due photodamage occurring photosynthetic apparatus c merolae also grown gellan gum plates purposes colony selection strain maintenance c merolae obligate oxygenic phototroph meaning capable taking fixed carbon environment must rely oxygenic photosynthesis fix carbon megabase pair genome c merolae sequenced reduced extremely simple compact genome made chromosomes found contain genes found expressed contain introns contained strict consensus strikingly genome c merolae contains trna genes extremely minimal number ribosomal rna gene shown genome comparison table reduced nature genome led several unusual features eukaryotes

genome c merolae contains many genes present chloroplast genomes algae genes case model organisms genetic tools developed c merolae include methods isolation dna rna c merolae introduction dna c merolae transient stable transformation methods selection including uracil auxotroph used selection marker several methods derived cyanobacterial protocols used isolation dna c first hot phenol extraction quick extraction used isolate dna suitable dna amplification polymerase chain reaction wherein phenol added whole cells incubated extract purer dna required cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab method may employed method highsalt extraction buffer first applied cells disrupted chloroformphenol mixture used extract dna room total rna may extracted c merolae cells using variant hot phenol method described case dna rna protocol protein extraction also adaptation protocol used cells disrupted using glass beads vortexing glycerol buffer containing reducing agent dtt break disulfide bonds within extraction result denatured proteins used sdspage gels western blotting coomassie staining c merolae sensitive many antibiotics commonly used selection successfully transformed individuals laboratory resistant notably ampicillin commonly used selection marker transformation c merolae involves uracil auxotroph requiring exogenous uracil mutant developed growing c merolae presence compound nontoxic converted toxic compound enzyme uracil biosynthetic pathway orotidine omp decarboxylase encoded random mutation led several lossoffunction mutants allowed cells survive presence long uracil transforming mutant pcr fragment carrying gene interest functional copy researchers confirm gene interest incorporated c merolae genome grow without exogenous uracil chromosomal integration genes creates stable transformant transient expression allows shortterm experiments done using labeled modified genes c merolae transient expression achieved using polyethylene glycol peg based method protoplasts plant cells rigid cell wall enzymatically eliminated c merolae lacks cell wall behaves much protoplast would transformation transform cells briefly exposed peg dna interest resulting transient method dna taken circular element integrated genome organism homologous regions exist integration create stable mutant line gene targeting used insert gene interest particular location c merolae genome via homologous recombination including regions dna several hundred base pairs long ends gene interest complementary sequence within c merolae genome organisms dna repair machinery used insert gene transformation procedure used transient expression used except homologous dna segments allow genome extremely simple divisome simple cell architecture ability synchronize divisions c merolae makes perfect organism studying mechanisms eukaryotic cell organelle synchronization division organelles cultured cells simple usually involves use light dark cycles chemical agent aphidicolin
