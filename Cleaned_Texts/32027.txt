root nodules found roots plants primarily legumes form symbiosis nitrogenfixing nitrogenlimiting conditions capable plants form symbiotic relationship hostspecific strain bacteria known process evolved multiple times within legumes well species found within rosid legume crops include beans peas soybeans within legume root nodules nitrogen gas atmosphere converted ammonia assimilated amino acids building blocks proteins nucleotides building blocks dna rna well important energy molecule atp cellular constituents vitamins flavones hormonescitation needed ability fix gaseous nitrogen makes legumes ideal agricultural organism requirement nitrogen fertilizer reduced indeed high nitrogen content blocks nodule development benefit plant forming symbiosis energy splitting nitrogen gas nodule
