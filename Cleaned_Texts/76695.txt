elginia extinct genus pareiasaurid known late permian scotland named area around elgin scotland yielded many fossils referred elgin reptiles type species elginia elginia mirabilis first described et newton fellow geologists john horne archibald geikie informed several unusual specimens stored elgin museum scotland specimens collected several years earlier coarse sandstones nearby cutties hillock quarry sandstone cutties hillock sandstone formation often always considered equivalent otherwise fossilpoor hopeman sandstone formation broader scottish geology tetrapod remains occupy narrow section sandstone lying pebbly layer sandstones cutties hillock deposited end permian period based dicynodont fauna similar daptocephalus assemblage zone south tetrapod fossils elgin rarely preserved actual bone material instead external molds within sandstone reconstruct original shape fossils sandstone split open revealing fine sand metal oxides filling cavities left original bones infill prepared away

cheek flange though elginia cheek flange less extreme many large pineal fossa present midway skull roof pineal fossa likely located front end broad platelike parietal bones small isolated midline bone lies behind parietals followed pair much larger triangular bones lie rear edge isolated midline bone likely singular postparietal would make elginia one pareiasaurs postparietal separated rear edge

fairly typical among pareiasaurs robust body short tail vertebrae amphicoelous concave ends swollen neural arches short neural spines large zygapophyses give vertebrae butterflyshaped profile seen dorsal ribs long curved chiselshaped tips attach vertebrae via transverse processes sweep backwards upwards e wuyongae flange connects transverse processes postzygapophyses e mirabilis structures separate sacral vertebrae flattened side large sacral ribs weakly contact ilium caudal ribs mostly straight slightly downturned tips large denselypacked osteoderms cover much torso osteoderms

lee completely lacks scapula somewhat long platelike lateral ridge leading strong acromion process evidence cleithrum humerus wide lower end joint surfaces project far outwards entepicondyle humerus

bends slightly upwards forwards crestlike postaxial flange runs entire rear edge femur narrowing middle projecting horizontally underside femur long curved internal trochanter prominent longitudinal ridge cnemial crest present many pareiasaurs precise phylogenetic placement uncertain elginia shares scutosaurus elaborate cranial ornament used suggest two closely elginia also hypothesized share relationship basal taxon dolichopareia nochelesaurus basis deeply notched skull table shared however authors argued association based taphonomic cladistic analyses tended nest elginia deeper among pareiasaurs making derived earlier giant pareiasaurus scutosaurus placement elginia remains volatile taxon hopping apical pareiasaurs basal pareiasaurs scutosaurus httpsenwikipediaorgwikielginia
