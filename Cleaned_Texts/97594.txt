sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma sef rare malignant tumor soft tissues microscopic examination consists small round ovoid neoplastic epithelioid fibroblastlike cells ie cells features resembling epithelioid cells world health organization classified sef distinct tumor type category malignant fibroblastic myofibroblastic however current studies reported lowgrade fibromyxoid sarcoma lgfms many clinically pathologically important features characteristic sef studies suggest lgsfms may early form time progress become since world health organization classified lgfms one malignant fibroblastic myofibroblastic tumors distinctly different sef lgfms regarded different tumor forms sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcomas aggressive tumors usually develop adults elderly small minority cases sef tumors often occur shoulder hip lower areas legs arms less commonly vital organ tissue location may virtually part sef tumors tend recur site surgically removed metastasize tissues poor surgical resection primary recurrent tumor without adjuvant radiation therapy mainstay treatment sef treatment often employed order achieve control tumors local injurious effects sensitivity sef tumors various chemotherapy regimens prognosis sef guarded surgery without radiation therapy chemotherapy frequently stop stops short time progression individuals presenting sef tumors years median age individuals aged tumors involve lower limb shoulder areas cases trunk head neck areas lung pleura bone including spinal soft tissues upper limb shoulder areas kidney pancreas liver brain rare cases sef tumors developed ovary lower gastrointestinal two separate studies patients presented metastases time initial diagnosis disease individuals present painless report painful enlarging mass tumor may noticed even painful months tumors developing head abdominal cavity spaceconstrained sites often present symptoms signs related tumors mass example patients diagnosed sef tumors spinal vertebrae presented pain experienced patients sef located buttock presented highly painful sef tumors varied size cm diameter average diameter one small study individuals treated surgical resection tumors represented recurrences tumors sites surgical removal represented metastases lung bone case liver brain defined microscopic histopathologic analyses hematoxylin eosin stained tissue samples sef tumors vary lower higher cellular lesions cells smalltomoderatesized epitheliodlike cells ultrastructural analyses features fibroblasts myofibroblasts cells contain moderate numbers mitochondria abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum networks large golgi complexes cytoplasmic arrays vimentin intermediate filaments cells tend grouped nests sheets cords andor single files embedded eosinophilic ie blue purple compared normal connective tissue excessive uptake hematoxylin stain sclerotic ie hardened connective tissue background connective tissue background contains irregular thinwalled distended blood vessels may foci hyaline cartilage bone formation necrosis clumps dead dying immunohistochemical analyses find neoplastic cells sef tumors typically express vimentin marker vimentin marker proteins expressed neoplastic cells various types tumors therefore distinguish tumors sef however expression found mainly neoplastic cells sef lowgrade fibroblastic tumors consequently expression marker protein tumor cells suggests tumors either sef lowgrade fibromyxoid sarcoma rather certain mimickers sef tumors neoplastic cells may aggressive sef tumors neoplastic several genetic alterations sef neoplastic cells fusion genes fusion gene hybrid gene formed two previously independent genes due chromosome translocation deletion genetic material chromosome chromosomal example fusion gene expressed sef neoplastic cells made chromosomal translocation unites part gene normally located band long q arm chromosome part gene normally located band short arm chromosome particular fusion gene predicted functional ie capable forming chimeric protein largest study date tested sef patients certain types gene rearrangements tumors neoplastic cells study found tumor cells expressed fusion gene cases fusion gene case fusion gene cases fusion gene cases types rearrangements eg deletions one genes cases inconclusive results smaller study found fusion gene neoplastic cells gene rearrangements sef neoplastic cells rare cases sef reported express fusion products made genes camp response elementbinding protein transcription factors regulate cell proliferation survival development gene fus gene product proteins belong fet protein family proteins regulate gene expression well mrnamicrorna processing may contribute development various gene product yesassociated protein contributes regulation cell proliferation apoptosis ie programmed cell death see gene oncogene ie potential cancercausing gene gene product proteins regulate gene transcription may contribute development various cancers see gene product protein regulates epithelialmesenchymal transition may involved development various studies needed determine fusion genes produce chimeric proteins retain cancerpromoting activity protein components thereby contribute development andor progression sef however presence fusion genes tumor helpful determining tumor sef neoplasia mimic sef see diagnosis based presentation pathology sef tumors difficult differentiate cases desmoid tumors nodular fasciitis lowgrade fibromyxoid sarcomas relative latter three tumor types however presence tumor neoplastic cells express marker protein fusion gene otherwise rearranged fus gene strongly suggest tumor express fusion gene suggest tumor sef case unlikely lowgrade fibromyxoid express fusion gene likely lowgrade fibromyxoid sarcoma sef ie fusion gene present lowgrade fibromyxoid sarcomas sef tumor express fusion gene likely sef sef tumors also mistaken rare types sarcomas sometimes epithelioid features mesenchymal chondrosarcomas ewing sarcomas osteosarcomas sclerosing variants rhabdomyosarcoma leiomyosarcomas also may mistaken certain metastatic carcinomas signet ring cell carcinoma lobular forms breast cancer extensive immunohistochemistry analyses help differentiate tumors sef surgical resection mainstay treatment sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma tumors however tumors often located complete surgical removal feasible tumor large tissueinfiltrating complete surgical removal andor tumor associated distant consequently sef tumors commonly treated wide local excision amputation involved extremity radiotherapy andor chemotherapy depending tumors surgical accessibility spread often however goal treatment regimens obtain control tumors local harmful one study among patients presenting sef tumors underwent surgical resection second resection tumor tissue left behind underwent debulking without removal tumor tissue supportive care unresectionable disease resection local recurrences underwent surgical resections metastatic tumors underwent radiation therapy aimed treating primary associated metastatic tumors received chemotherapy primary recurrent particular metastatic disease chemotherapy regimens included one following drugs doxorubicin ifosfamide docetaxel gemcitabine pazopanib vincristine cisplatin cyclophosphamide etoposide andor nonetheless studies suggest radiotherapy administered cases surgery impossible andor potential slow progression currently used chemotherapeutic regimens generally ineffective controlling study patients sef alive disease median time months
