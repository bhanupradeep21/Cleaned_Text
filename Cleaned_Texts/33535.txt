gastric acid gastric juice stomach acid digestive fluid formed within stomach lining ph gastric acid plays key role digestion proteins activating digestive enzymes together break long chains amino acids proteins gastric acid regulated feedback systems increase production needed meal cells stomach produce bicarbonate base buffer fluid ensuring regulated ph cells also produce mucus viscous barrier prevent gastric acid damaging stomach pancreas produces large amounts bicarbonate secretes bicarbonate pancreatic duct duodenum neutralize gastric acid passing digestive tract primary active component gastric acid hydrochloric acid hcl produced parietal cells gastric glands stomach secretion complex relatively energetically expensive process parietal cells contain extensive secretory network called canaliculi hydrochloric acid secreted lumen stomach ph gastric acid human stomach lumen level maintained proton pump hk parietal cell releases bicarbonate bloodstream process causes
