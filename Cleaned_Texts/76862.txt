biorhythm theory pseudoscientific idea peoples daily lives significantly affected rhythmic cycles periods exactly typically physical cycle emotional cycle intellectual cycle idea developed wilhelm fliess late century popularized united states late proposal independently tested consistently validity found according notion biorhythms persons life influenced rhythmic biological cycles affect ability various domains mental physical emotional activity cycles begin birth oscillate steady sine wave fashion throughout life modeling mathematically suggested persons level ability domains predicted day day built idea biofeedback chemical hormonal secretion functions within body could show sinusoidal behavior time biorhythm models use three cycles physical cycle emotional cycle intellectual although cycle length average womans menstrual cycle originally described female cycle see two necessarily synchronization cycles varies high low extremes sinusoidally days cycle crosses zero line described critical days greater risk uncertainty numbers maximum minimum indicate cycle rhythms particular day general rhythm crossing midpoint thought real impact ones life whereas rhythm peak cycle would give one edge area rhythm bottom cycle would make life difficult area particular meaning day ones rhythms high low except obvious benefits hindrances rare extremes thought ones life addition three popular cycles various cycles proposed based linear combination three longer shorter theories published state equations cycles displaystyle indicates number days since birth basic arithmetic shows combination simpler cycles repeats every days years triple combination cycles repeats every days years rhythms used biorhythmists first devised late century wilhelm fliess berlin

meaning fliess sigmund freud adopted idea early could predict anything wanted skeptical evaluations various biorhythm proposals led number critiques lambasting subject published biorhythm advocates
