richard william carthew born september developmental biologist quantitative biologist northwestern university professor molecular biosciences director nsfsimons center quantitative biology carthew received bsc degree biology queens university pursued interests ecology performing research supervision ted environmental adaptation cyanobacteria carthew continued studies university toronto received msc degree botany johann hellebust time pursued training music composition royal conservatory music toronto upon completion degree carthew worked two years research technician supervision jack greenblatt banting best department medical research toronto time carthew studied biochemistry eukaryotic gene transcription decided forgo career music one biomedical sciences carthew began phd studies massachusetts institute technology performed thesis research lab phillip sharp doctoral career carthew transformed electrophoresis mobility shift assay emsa assay could detect sequencespecific dnabinding proteins crude cell using method identified studied hela cell transcription factor usf role regulating gene carthew also played role popularizing nowcommon use biomedical literature multiple authors paper cofirst authors carthew fellow graduate student lewis chodosh decided adopt mechanism joint cell inspired use andrew fire mark novel feature paper noticed many subsequently adopted papers following graduate work carthew pursued postdoctoral research university california berkeley helen hay whitney fellow carthew worked direction gerald rubin molecular mechanisms compound eye development drosophila melanogaster showed ring finger domain protein seven absentia essential multipotent eye cells adopt photoreceptor cell subsequent work showed seven absentia activated ras signal transduction pathway acts ubiquitin ligase rapidly degrade transcriptional repressor cell carthew started independent research group university pittsburgh department biological sciences became tenured associate professor full professor carthew moved northwestern university became full professor department molecular biosciences located evanston campus appointed owen l coon professor molecular biology carthew served leader chromatin nuclear dynamics program northwestern robert h lurie comprehensive cancer center served director nci funded oncogenesis developmental biology training program currently serves director nigms funded training program cellular molecular basis disease northwestern early phase carthew lab research number firsts achieved carthew group first establish drosophila eye model system study planar cell first group use drosophila disease model screen test small molecule drugs potential efficacy disease first group provide genetic evidence frizzled proteins wnt receptors group discovered drosophila capable rnai rna labs andrew fire craig mello demonstrated key role doublestranded rna trigger rnai nematode caenorhabditis discovery culminating nobel prize fire mello showing rnai also existed another animal species carthew group stimulated search rnai mammals well adoption drosophila premier model study biochemical genetic mechanisms rnai carthew group also developed first second generations transgene systems performing rnai drosophila gene stage life cycle tissue cellspecific second generation system later expanded genomewide collection transgenic lines targeting annotated carthew lab continued pursuing mechanisms functions small noncoding rna world first glimpsed lens rnai group addressing small interfering rnas sirnas micrornas mirnas regulate gene expression since carthew group also pursued questions related quantitative issues development inspired mathematical biologist darcy thompson seminal book growth form group showed topology epithelial cells drosophila eye constrained due tendency cells minimize surface pioneering work emerged time groups around world also began addressing physical aspects morphogenesis recent work carthew lab turned dynamical features gene expression cells undergo lineage restriction work focused importance time dimension animal development gene regulatory networks designed provide temporal flexibility development carthew group found developmental tempo slowed limiting cell metabolism gene repressors become redundant lineage restriction entire microrna family rendered nonessential development july carthew became director newly founded nsfsimons center quantitative biology northwestern university cofunded publicprivate partnership national science foundation simons foundation center quantitative biology contains northwestern faculty members experts developmental biology applied mathematics pure mathematics centers mission greatly expand application mathematics study important questions developmental biology done supporting interdisciplinary research within center stimulating interdisciplinary research training activities across united states efforts augmented efforts three nsfsimons centers located across country httpsenwikipediaorgwikirichardcarthew
