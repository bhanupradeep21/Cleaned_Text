acilius sulcatus species water beetle family dytiscidaeit fairly large mm color variation shown throughout range typically yellow black sulcatus worldwide distribution found primarily north western sulcatus known throughout europe lesser diving beetle common name shared many aquatic beetles family dytiscidae temporary permanent water bodies asulcatas shows generalist response habitat choice living bogs ponds streams etc sulcatus able fly restricted single body water sulcatus found water bodies high low levels vegetation showing preference two dominate water bodies without fish predators used primary indicator predator sulcatus found large range thought face pressures continuity species beetle evaluated iucn unique morph however recognized akfadou mountains algeria potential attaining separate species status habitat loss due logging allopatric separation populations means morph deserves special due fairly large distribution sulcatus population numbers used aid measurement ecological health sulcatus univoltine adults overwintering deep permanent water bodies neither dry freeze mating pairs found spring autumn females lay eggs near water underside plant matter eggs hatch week larval development takes days pupal development takes another sulcatus predatory diving beetle feeds upon small invertebrate vertebrate prey larvae prefer microinvertebrate prey daphnia whereas adults select size appropriate prey known high aquatic speed sulcatus actively pursues prey rather using sit wait ambush strategy seen arthropods sulcatus active day night sulcatus larvae capture prey headfirst mandibles injecting digestive enzymes extra oral adults use extra oral digestion instead using strong mouth parts devour prey color varies throughout range sulcatus good identifying characteristic however sulcatus shows many unique structural morphologies useful identification sulcatus easily recognized large distinctive hind legs hind legs long fringed setae forming paddle like shape body always wider height insect streamlined spines chitinous structures protruding dytiscidae beetles sternal keel absent sulcatus clumsy land well adapted aquatic lifestyle strong flier sulcatus may also recognized unique reproductive structures males ventral suction disks used secure male slippery female male attachment females detrimental female survival mating period may attract predators avoid potential mating costs life females show modifications elytra elytra highly grooved many suberect making male attachment far difficult male elytra smooth without setae showing high levels sexual dimorphism competition sexes led evolutionary sexual arms race aquatic beetles family dytiscidae possess defensive glands used secrete agents repellent toxic vertebrate secretions primarily contain steroids synthesized steroids secreted act anesthetize predators leading narcosis steroids produced vary levels toxicity depending food availability sulcatus highly adapted aquatic movement make effective us speed escape threats tested common water beetle species sulcatus shown highest movement day sulcatus uses primarily visual information avoid predators however low light conditions chemical signals used dominant cues also suggested humming sound produced interaction wings elytra used defensive strategy causing unpleasant vibrating sensation mouth although put practice
