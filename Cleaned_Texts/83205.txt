speech synthesis artificial production human speech computer system used purpose called speech synthesizer implemented software hardware products texttospeech tts system converts normal language text speech systems render symbolic linguistic representations like phonetic transcriptions reverse process speech recognition synthesized speech created concatenating pieces recorded speech stored database systems differ size stored speech units system stores phones diphones provides largest output range may lack clarity specific usage domains storage entire words sentences allows highquality

early texttospeech system engine composed two frontend backend frontend two major tasks first converts raw text containing symbols like numbers abbreviations equivalent writtenout words process often called text normalization preprocessing tokenization frontend assigns phonetic transcriptions word divides marks text prosodic units like phrases clauses sentences process assigning phonetic

closely output sounds like human speech intelligibility ease output understood ideal speech synthesizer natural intelligible speech synthesis systems usually try maximize characteristics two primary technologies generating synthetic speech waveforms concatenative synthesis formant synthesis technology strengths weaknesses intended uses synthesis system typically determine approach used concatenative synthesis based concatenation stringing together segments recorded speech generally concatenative synthesis produces naturalsounding synthesized speech however differences natural variations speech nature automated techniques segmenting waveforms sometimes result audible glitches output three main subtypes concatenative synthesis unit selection synthesis uses large databases recorded speech database creation recorded utterance segmented following individual phones diphones halfphones syllables morphemes words phrases sentences typically division segments done using specially modified speech recognizer set forced alignment mode manual correction afterward using visual representations waveform index units speech database created based segmentation acoustic parameters like fundamental frequency pitch duration position syllable neighboring phones run time desired target utterance created determining best chain candidate units database unit selection process typically achieved using specially weighted decision tree unit selection provides greatest naturalness applies small amount digital signal processing dsp recorded speech dsp often makes recorded speech sound less natural although systems use small amount signal processing point concatenation smooth waveform output best unitselection systems often indistinguishable real human voices especially contexts tts system tuned however maximum naturalness typically require unitselection speech databases large systems ranging gigabytes recorded data representing dozens hours also unit selection algorithms known select segments place results less ideal synthesis eg minor words become unclear even better choice exists recently researchers proposed various automated methods detect unnatural segments unitselection speech synthesis diphone synthesis uses minimal speech database containing diphones soundtosound transitions occurring language number diphones depends phonotactics language example spanish diphones german diphone synthesis one example diphone contained speech database runtime target prosody sentence superimposed minimal units means digital signal processing techniques linear predictive coding recent techniques pitch modification source domain using discrete cosine diphone synthesis suffers sonic glitches concatenative synthesis roboticsounding nature formant synthesis advantages either approach small size use commercial applications decliningcitation needed although continues used research number freely available software implementations early example diphone synthesis teaching robot leachim invented michael j leachim contained information regarding class curricular certain biographical information students programmed tested fourth grade classroom bronx new domainspecific synthesis concatenates prerecorded words phrases create complete utterances used applications variety texts system output limited particular domain like transit schedule announcements weather technology simple implement commercial use long time devices like talking clocks calculators level naturalness systems high variety sentence types limited closely match prosody intonation original recordingscitation needed systems limited words phrases databases generalpurpose synthesize combinations words phrases preprogrammed blending words within naturally spoken language however still cause problems unless many variations taken account example nonrhotic dialects english r words like clear ˈklɪə usually pronounced following word vowel first letter eg clear realized ˌklɪəɹˈʌʊt likewise french many final consonants become longer silent followed word begins vowel effect called liaison alternation reproduced simple wordconcatenation system would require additional complexity contextsensitive formant synthesis use human speech samples runtime instead synthesized speech output created using additive synthesis acoustic model physical modelling

process normalizing text rarely straightforward texts full heteronyms numbers abbreviations require expansion phonetic representation many spellings english pronounced differently based context example latest project learn better project voice contains two pronunciations project texttospeech tts systems generate semantic representations input texts processes unreliable poorly understood

systems begun use hmms discussed generate parts speech aid disambiguating homographs technique quite successful many cases whether read pronounced red implying past tense reed implying present tense typical error rates using hmms fashion usually five percent techniques also work well european languages although access required training corpora frequently difficult languages deciding convert numbers another problem tts systems address simple programming challenge convert number words least english like becoming one thousand three hundred twentyfive however numbers occur many different contexts may also read one three two five thirteen twentyfive thirteen hundred twenty five tts system often infer expand number based surrounding words numbers punctuation sometimes system provides

words like foreign names loanwords whose pronunciations obvious spellings hand speech synthesis systems languages like english extremely irregular spelling systems likely rely dictionaries use rulebased methods unusual words words arent dictionaries consistent evaluation speech synthesis systems may difficult lack universally agreed objective evaluation criteria different organizations often use different speech data quality speech synthesis systems also depends quality production technique may involve analogue digital recording facilities used replay speech evaluating speech
