genus xenopus laevis xenopus tropicalis commonly studied model organisms developmental biology cell biology toxicology neuroscience modelling human disease birth genus also known polyploidy species sets chromosomes xenopus laevis rather inactive creature incredibly hardy live years times ponds xenopus laevis found dry compelling dry season burrow mud leaving tunnel air may lie dormant year pond dries rainy season xenopus laevis may migrate long distances another pond maintaining hydration rains adept swimmer swimming directions ease barely able hop able crawl spends time underwater comes surface breathe respiration predominantly well developed lungs little cutaneous respiration species xenopus flattened somewhat eggshaped streamlined bodies slippery skin protective mucus frogs skin smooth lateral line sensory organ stitchlike appearance frogs excellent swimmers powerful fully webbed toes though fingers lack webbing three toes foot conspicuous black claws frogs eyes top head looking upwards pupils circular moveable eyelids tongues rather completely attached floor eardrums similarly pipa pipa common suriname unlike amphibians haptoglobin xenopus species entirely aquatic though observed migrating land nearby bodies water times drought heavy rain usually found lakes rivers swamps potholes streams manmade adult frogs usually predators scavengers since tongues unusable frogs use small fore limbs aid feeding process since also lack vocal sacs make clicks brief pulses sound underwater similar pipa males establish hierarchy social dominance primarily one male right make advertisement females many species produce release call xenopus laevis females produce additional call sexually receptive soon lay xenopus species also active twilight crepuscular breeding season males develop ridgelike nuptial pads black color fingers aid grasping female frogs mating embrace inguinal meaning male grasps female around following fossil species like many frogs often used
