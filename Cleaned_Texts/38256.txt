spinning dancer also known silhouette illusion kinetic bistable animated optical illusion originally distributed gif animation showing silhouette pirouetting female dancer illusion created japanese web designer nobuyuki involves apparent direction motion figure observers initially see figure spinning clockwise viewed counterclockwise additionally may see figure suddenly spin opposite illusion derives lack visual cues depth instance dancers arms move viewers left right possible view arms passing body viewer foreground picture case would circling counterclockwise right foot also possible view arms passing behind dancers body background picture case seen circling clockwise left foot facing left right breasts ponytail clearly define direction facing although ambiguity leg however moves away facing left facing right dancer seen facing either two directions first two directions fairly close left say one facing slightly forward facing slightly backward become away reach position ponytail breasts line viewer neither breasts ponytail seen readily position could facing either away viewer towards viewer two possible positions degrees apart another aspect illusion triggered placing mirror vertically beside image natural expectation would normal image reflection spin opposite directions necessarily happen provides paradoxical situation dancers appear spin direction established silhouette often seen rotating clockwise counterclockwise according online survey participants approximately two thirds observers initially perceived silhouette rotating clockwise addition observers initially perceived clockwise rotation difficulty experiencing results explained psychological study providing evidence viewingfromabove bias influences observers perceptions kayaharas dancer presented camera elevation slightly horizontal plane consequently dancer may also seen addition spinning clockwise counterclockwise facing toward away observer upon inspection one may notice kayaharas original illusion seeing dancer spin clockwise paired constantly holding elevated viewpoint seeing dancer opposite also true observer maintaining counterclockwise perception assumed viewpoint dancer observers report perceiving kayaharas original silhouette spinning clockwise often counterclockwise two chief possibilities may bias see spinning clockwise may bias assume viewpoint tease two possibilities apart researchers created versions kayaharas silhouette illusion recreating dancer varying camera elevations allowed clockwisefromabove like kayaharas original clockwisefrombelow pairings results indicated clockwise bias rather viewingfromabove bias furthermore bias dependent upon camera elevation words greater camera elevation often observer saw dancer popular psychology illusion identified personality test supposedly reveals hemisphere brain dominant observer wrong interpretation popularly called right brain widely circulated internet late early paper describes brain activation related switching perception utilizing fmri volunteer capable switching direction rotation found part right parietal lobe responsible switching authors relate brain activation described spontaneous brain optical illusions depend similar kind visual ambiguity known multistable case bistable perception one example necker cube depending perception observer apparent direction spin may change number times typical feature socalled bistable percepts necker cube may perceived time time seen alternations spontaneous may randomly occur without change stimulus intention observer however observers may difficulty perceiving change motion one way changing direction perceived use averted vision mentally look arm going behind instead front carefully move eyes back may perceive change direction easily narrowing visual focus specific region image spinning foot shadow dancer gradually looking upwards one also try tilt ones head perceive change direction another way watch base shadow foot perceive toes always pointing away oneself help direction change one also close ones eyes try envision dancer going direction reopen dancer change directions still another way wait dancers legs cross projection try perceive change direction follows one also try using ones peripheral vision distract dominant part brain slowly look away ballerina one may begin see spin direction perhaps easiest method blink rapidly slightly varying rate necessary consecutive images going new direction one open ones eyes new rotational direction maintained even possible see illusion way dancer spinning simply rotating back forth degrees slightly altered versions animation created additional visual cue assist viewers difficulty seeing one rotation direction labels white edges added legs make clear leg passing front first looking one modified images sometimes make original dancer image spin corresponding direction white outlines legs help perceive clockwise spin grounded left leg original animation white outlines legs help perceive counterclockwise spin grounded right leg httpsenwikipediaorgwikispinningdancer
