honors carsten borchgrevink anglonorwegian explorer participated many expeditions antarctica borchgrevinkium represents poorly known genus whose affinities uncertain several unique characteristics differentiated many arthropods long parabolic nearly ushaped prosoma head elongated first second segments presence paired ridges surface third tenth tergites dorsal halves segments furthermore opisthosoma trunk borchgrevinkium triangular telson posteriormost division body short wedgeshaped small animal approximately centimetres inches long known specimen genus collected described russian paleontologist nestor ivanovich novojilov determined eurypterid classified family mycteroptidae however classification changed repeatedly years transferred eurypterida xiphosura back eurypterida time later borchgrevinkium tentatively considered prosomapod fossil material needed ensure current classification size known specimen borchgrevinkium identified label pin estimated less centimetres inches making small prosoma longer wider covering one third length animal parabolic nearly ushaped length cm eyes preserved therefore position shape unknown prosomal appendages limbs known tip poorly

pretelson segment preceded telson bifid divided two lobes dorsal projection telson posteriormost division body cuneiform wedgelike short narrow measured cm ornamentation body composed short scales broadly rounded russian paleontologist geologist vladimir vasilyevich menner discovered series fossils devonian deposits near imangda river southwest taymyr peninsula near norilsk krasnoyarsk krai russia soviet union sent russian paleontologist nestor ivanovich described among others specimen labelled pin nearly complete deposited paleontological institute russian academy sciences moscow remains novojilov considered unique enough erected new genus borchgrevinkium named anglonorwegian explorer carsten borchgrevink expeditions antarctica compared xiphosuran genus weinbergina assuming borchgrevinkium also xiphosuran however norwegian paleontologist leif størmer assisted study noticed novojilov considered accidental fissure actually part macrosegment first segment finding well tip appendages closer examination presence macrosegment convinced novojilov borchgrevinkium represented new eurypterid classified american paleontologist erik norman kjellesvigwaering study families genera superfamily stylonuracea known stylonuroidea tentatively recorded upper silurian occurrence genus borchgrevinkium apart lower devonian one believing new specimen specimen later named borchgrevinkium british geologist paleobiologist james c lamsdell irish palaeontologist derek briggs found specimen ypm ip collected bertie formation state new york samuel j ciurca jr identified new undescribed species borchgrevinkium contacting størmer nevertheless since specimen misidentified redescribed new species chasmataspidid diploaspis praecursor lamsdell history borchgrevinkium soon became turbulent classified xiphosuran back eurypterida years borchgrevinkium tentatively moved lamsdell clade taxonomic group novojilov description borchgrevinkium noted certain resemblance weinbergina especially paired ridges tergites based aforementioned macrosegment novojilov classified genus mycteroptid eurypterid compared species mycterops matthieui woodwardopterus scabrosus members family without finding many similarities still classifying borchgrevinkium eurypterid nowadays however descriptions considered inexhaustive based best preserved nevertheless genus continued considered authors eurypterid kjellesvigwaering classified borchgrevinkium woodwardopterus family woodwardopteridae based conclusion similarity ornamentation shape prosoma exceptional size first two segments størmer questioned affiliation genus clade suggested might represent chasmataspidid within order following recommendation victor p tollerton jr reclassified inside order revision norwegian paleontologist odd erik tetlie support change transferred borchgrevinkium eurypterid family woodwardopteridae woodwardopterus mycterops different suborder woodwardopterina suggesting arthropods actually could represent eurypterids woodwardopterines presumably united great elongation first two point view approved researchers eventually woodwardopterina synonymized stylonurina woodwardopteridae addition lamsdell considered genus needing nowadays borchgrevinkium highly uncertain problematic genus eurypterid nature soon denied lamsdell placed clade prosomapoda encompasses chelicerates prosomal uniramous appendages appendages composed single series segments attached endtoend adult stage excluding sixth last pair appendages however appendages borchgrevinkium poorly known lamsdell made note anderella determining order consolidate classification genera prosomapoda new fossil material phylogenetic analysis results presented cladogram conducted lamsdell relationships within xiphosura relations closely related groups concluded xiphosura presently understood paraphyletic group sharing last common ancestor including descendants ancestor thus valid phylogenetic group prosomapoda erected include several chelicerates formerly classified mostly xiphosurans well xiphosurans planaterga borchgrevinkium included due scarce known pycnogonum limulina arachnida known
