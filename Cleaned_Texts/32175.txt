intrauterine hypoxia also known fetal hypoxia occurs fetus deprived adequate supply oxygen may due variety reasons prolapse occlusion umbilical cord placental infarction maternal diabetes prepregnancy gestational maternal smoking intrauterine growth restriction may cause result hypoxia intrauterine hypoxia cause cellular damage occurs within central nervous system brain spinal cord results increased mortality rate including increased risk sudden infant death syndrome sids oxygen deprivation fetus neonate implicated either primary contributing risk factor numerous neurological neuropsychiatric disorders epilepsy attention deficit hyperactivity disorder eating disorders cerebral complications arising intrauterine hypoxia common causes preeclampsia hypertensive disorder occurs second trimester week pregnancy resulting poorly perfused world health organization estimates preeclampsia eclampsia responsible maternal deaths globally around deaths pregnancy women preeclampsia faces serious risk damage vital organs kidneys liver brain blood system hypertensive disorder may also cause damage placenta leading issues premature births miscarriages placental abruption even stillbirths cases preeclampsia eventually lead stroke organ failure untreated preeclampsia progress turn eclampsia much severe addition seizures eclampsia seizures could lead uncontrollable twitching loss consciousness could potentially lead death mother intrauterine hypoxia attributed maternal placental fetal kingdom kaufmann classifies three categories origin fetal hypoxia preplacental mother fetus hypoxic uteroplacental mother normal placenta fetus hypoxic postplacental fetus preplacental hypoxia commonly caused external hypoxic environments high altitude also caused maternal respiratory conditions asthma cardiovascular conditions heart failure pulmonary hypertension cyanotic heart disease hematological conditions conditions obesity nutritional deficiencies infections chronic inflammations stress also affect maternal oxygen supply fetal preventable cause maternal smoking cigarette smoking expectant mothers shown wide variety deleterious effects developing among negative effects carbon monoxide induced tissue hypoxia placental insufficiency causes reduction blood flow uterus placenta thereby reducing availability oxygenated blood fetus placental insufficiency result smoking shown causal effect development preeclampsia previous studies suggested carbon monoxide cigarette smoke may protective effect preeclampsia recent study conducted genetics preeclampsia consortium united kingdom found smokers five times likely develop nicotine alone shown teratogen affects autonomic nervous system leading increased susceptibility hypoxiainduced brain maternal anemia smoking also implicated another factor associated ihbaclarification needed smoking expectant mothers causes decrease maternal nucleated red blood cells thereby reducing amount red blood cells available oxygen uteroplacental hypoxia associated abnormal placental implantation impaired vascular remodeling vascular also associated pregnancies complicated gestational hypertension intrauterine growth restriction postplacental hypoxia associated mechanical obstructions umbilical cords reduced uterine artery flow progressive fetal cardiac failure genetic perinatal

vasodilator reducing vascular resistance protect bloodbrain barrier bbb goal treatments prolong pregnancy increase fetal survival day gained treatment utero increases fetal survival intact survival

causes wide range responses tests include prenatal testing fetal movement amniotic fluid levels doppler examination fetal heart another risk factor premature birth medical intervention premature birth
