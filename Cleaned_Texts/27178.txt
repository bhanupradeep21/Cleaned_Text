pioneer plaques pair goldanodized aluminum plaques placed board pioneer pioneer spacecraft featuring pictorial message case either pioneer intercepted intelligent extraterrestrial life plaques show nude figures human male female along several symbols designed provide information origin pioneer spacecraft first humanbuilt objects achieve escape velocity solar system plaques attached spacecrafts antenna support struts position would shield erosion interstellar dust original idea pioneer spacecraft carry message mankind first mentioned eric visited jet propulsion laboratory pasadena california mariner mission approached carl sagan lectured communication intelligent extraterrestrials conference crimea sagan enthusiastic idea sending message pioneer spacecraft nasa agreed plan gave three weeks prepare message together frank drake designed plaque artwork prepared linda salzman sagan sagans wife time additional artistic contributions made jon plaques manufactured precision engravers san carlos first plaque launched pioneer march second followed pioneer april may limited edition replicas engraved original master design precision engravers made available kickstarter campaign also

good although gesture may understood offers way show opposable thumb limbs originally sagan intended humans shown holding hands soon realized extraterrestrial might perceive single creature rather two original drawings figures based drawings leonardo da vinci greek womans genitals depicted detail mons pubis shown claimed sagan little time complete plaque suspected nasa would rejected intricate drawing therefore made compromise sagan said decision include vertical line womans genitalia pudendal cleft would caused intersection labia majora due two reasons first greek sculptures women include line second sagan believed design explicit depiction womans genitalia would considered obscene approved according memoirs robert kraemer however original design presented nasa headquarters included line indicated womans line erased condition approval design john naugle former head nasas office space science agencys former chief radial pattern left plaque shows lines emanating origin fourteen lines corresponding long binary numbers stand periods pulsars using hydrogen spinflip transition frequency unit since periods change time epoch launch calculated values lengths lines show relative distances pulsars sun tick mark end line gives z coordinate perpendicular galactic plane plaque found pulsars may visible location discovery showing location many pulsars provides redundancy location origin triangulated even pulsars recognized data one pulsars misleading plaque designed frequency pulsar known known three significant decimal digits map lists period pulsar binary much greater precision rounding significant bits would provided hint uncertainty pulsar represented long line pointing right fifteenth line plaque extends far right behind human figures line indicates suns relative distance center galaxy pulsar map hydrogen atom diagram shared common voyager golden record bottom plaque schematic diagram solar system small picture spacecraft shown trajectory shows way past jupiter solar system pioneers identical plaques however launch pioneer redirected toward saturn exited solar system regard pioneer plaque inaccurate saturn flyby pioneer would also greatly influence future direction destination compared pioneer fact depicted plaques saturns rings could give hint identifying solar system rings around planets jupiter uranus neptune unknown plaque designed however unlike saturn ring systems planets easily visible apparent saturns pluto considered planet plaque designed iau reclassified pluto dwarf planet large bodies classed dwarf planets eris depicted unknown time plaque made binary numbers planets show relative distance sun unit mercurys orbit rather familiar used behind figures human beings silhouette pioneer spacecraft shown scale size human beings deduced measuring spacecraft one parts diagram among easiest humans understand may among hardest potential extraterrestrial finders understand arrow showing trajectory pioneer ernst gombrich criticized use arrow arrows artifact huntergatherer societies like earth finders different cultural heritage may find arrow symbol art critic craig owens said sexual bias exhibited decision man diagram perform raised hand gesture greet extraterrestrials woman diagram hands feminists also took issue choice appease criticisms second illustration similar couple provided woman raising hand carl sagan regretted figures finished engraving failed look panracial although intent final figures criticised looking white broad flattened noses woman given epicanthial folds resemble east asian original drawing man drawn afro haircut additional african physical trait would included man make figures look panracial detail changed nonafrican mediterraneancurly haircut finished furthermore carl sagan said linda sagan intended portray man woman brown hair hair outlined rather outlined shaded made hair appear blonde people different interpretations race people depicted figures white people black people east asian people tended think figures resembled racial group although people proud race appeared selected represent humankind others viewed figures terribly racist apparently blatant exclusion linda sagan decided make figures nude address problem type clothes wear represent humanity make figures anatomically educational extraterrestrials viewed nudity according astronomer frank drake many negative reactions plaque human beings displayed images final design published american newspapers one newspaper published image mans genitalia removed another newspaper published image mans genitalia womans nipples one letter newspaper person angrily wrote felt nudity images made images contrast another letter newspaper person critical prudishness people found depictions nudity obscenea also
