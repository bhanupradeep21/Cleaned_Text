arthropods covered tough resilient integument exoskeleton chitin generally exoskeleton thickened areas chitin reinforced stiffened materials minerals hardened proteins happens parts body need rigidity elasticity typically mineral crystals mainly calcium carbonate deposited among chitin protein molecules process called biomineralization crystals fibres interpenetrate reinforce minerals supplying hardness resistance compression chitin supplies tensile strength biomineralization occurs mainly crustaceans insects arachnids main reinforcing materials various proteins hardened linking fibres processes called sclerotisation hardened proteins called sclerotin dorsal tergum ventral sternum lateral pleura form hardened plates sclerites typical body segment either case contrast carapace tortoise cranium vertebrate exoskeleton little ability grow change form matured except special cases whenever animal needs grow moults shedding old skin growing new skin beneath typical arthropod

silklike globular proteins bestknown rubbery protein called resilin relative abundance two main components varies approximately chitin protein softer parts exoskeleton higher proportion chitincitation

propertiescitation needed addition chitinousproteinaceous composite cuticle many crustaceans myriapods extinct trilobites impregnate cuticle mineral salts calcium carbonate make cuticle armoured product commonly great mechanical strength two layers cuticle different properties outer layer thickening biomineralization sclerotisation takes place material tends strong compressive stresses though weaker rigid region fails stress inner layer highly sclerotised correspondingly softer tougher resists tensile stresses liable failure combination especially effective resisting predation predators tend exert compression outer layer tension degree sclerotisation mineralisation determines cuticle responds deformation certain degree deformation changes shape dimension cuticle elastic original shape returns stress removed beyond level deformation nonreversible plastic deformation occurs finally cuticle cracks splits generally less sclerotised cuticle greater deformation required damage cuticle irreversibly hand heavily cuticle armoured greater stress required deform rule arthropod exoskeleton divided different functional units comprising series grouped segments group called tagma tagmata adapted different functions given arthropod body example tagmata insects include head fused capsule thorax nearly fixed capsule abdomen usually divided series articulating segments segment sclerites according requirements external rigidity example larva flies none exoskeleton effectively membranous abdomen adult fly covered light sclerites connected joints membranous cuticle beetles joints tightly connected body practically armoured rigid box however arthropoda bodily tagmata connected jointed flexible cuticle muscles least freedom movement many animals chilopoda larvae mosquitoes mobile indeed addition limbs arthropods jointed characteristically name arthropoda literally means jointed legs reflection fact internal surface exoskeleton often infolded forming set structures called apodemes serve attachment muscles functionally amounting endoskeletal components highly complex groups particularly crustaceacitation needed chemical physical nature arthropod exoskeleton limits ability stretch change shape animal grows special cases abdomens termite queens honeypot ants means continuous growth arthropods possible therefore growth periodic concentrated period time exoskeleton shed called moulting ecdysis control hormone called ecdysone moulting complex process invariably dangerous arthropod involved old exoskeleton shed cuticle separates epidermis process called apolysis new cuticle excreted underlying epidermis mineral salts usually withdrawn old cuticle reuse old cuticle shed arthropod typically pumps body example air water intake allow new cuticle expand larger size process hardening dehydration cuticle takes place newly molted arthropod typically pale colour state said teneral callow generally darkens otherwise gains colour exoskeleton
