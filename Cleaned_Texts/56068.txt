agraphia acquired neurological disorder causing loss ability communicate writing either due form motor inability loss writing ability may present language neurological disorders appearing commonly agraphia alexia aphasia dysarthria agnosia acalculia study individuals agraphia may provide information pathways involved writing language related agraphia directly treated individuals learn techniques help regain rehabilitate previous writing abilities techniques differ depending type agraphia agraphia broadly divided central peripheral central agraphias typically involve language areas brain causing difficulty spelling spontaneous communication often accompanied language peripheral agraphias usually target motor visuospatial skills addition language tend involve motoric areas brain causing difficulty movements associated central agraphia may also called aphasic agraphia involves areas brain whose major functions connected language writing peripheral agraphia may also called nonaphasic agraphia involves areas brain whose functions directly connected language writing typically motor history agraphia dates midfourteenth century second half nineteenth century sparked significant clinical interest research twentieth century focused primary aphasiology patients lesions agraphia impairment producing written language occur many ways many forms writing involves many cognitive processes language processing spelling visual perception visuospatial orientation graphic symbols motor planning motor control agraphia two main subgroupings central aphasic agraphia peripheral nonaphasic agraphia central agraphias include lexical phonological deep semantic agraphia peripheral agraphias include allographic apraxic motor execution hemianoptic afferent central

produce written language received clinical attention ideas localization brain influenced studies dissociation written spoken language well reading writing paul brocas work aphasia time inspired researchers across europe north america begin conducting studies correlation lesions loss function various cortical clinicians armand trousseau john hughlings jackson held prevailing view linguistic deficiency occurred writing well speech reading impairments louisvictor marcé argued written spoken language independent discovered many patients languages disorders speech writing impaired recovery written spoken language always parallel suggesting two modes expression independent believed ability write involved motor control also memory signs william ogle coined term agraphia made several key observations patterns dissociation found written spoken language demonstrated patients writing impairments able copy written letters struggled arranging letters form words ogle knew aphasia agraphia often occurred together confirmed impairment two different types language spoken written vary type severity although ogles review helped make important advancements toward understanding writing disorders documented case pure agraphia two decades research acquired language disorders began albert pitres made important contribution published clinical report pure according pitres marcé
