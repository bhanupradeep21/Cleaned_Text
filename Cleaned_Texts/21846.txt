limited capacity process information multiple objects given time example individual presented two stimuli objects asked identify attributes object time individuals performance would worse comparison objects presented separately suggests multiple objects presented simultaneously visual field compete neural representation due limited processing resources single cell recording studies conducted kastner ungerleider examined neural mechanisms behind biased competition experiment size receptive fields rf neurons within visual cortex examined single visual stimulus presented alone neurons rf followed another stimulus presented simultaneously within single effective stimuli produced low firing rate whereas two stimuli presented together produced high firing rate response paired stimuli reduced suggests two stimuli presented together within neurons rf stimuli processed mutually suppressive manner rather processed suppression process according kastner ungerleider occurs two stimuli presented together compete neural representation due limited cognitive processing rf experiment suggests number objects increase information available object decrease due increased neural workload
