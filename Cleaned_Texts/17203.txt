enough either standalone invention significant improvement work others patented patent granted gives inventor proprietary interest patent specific period time licensed financial gain inventor creates discovers invention word inventor comes latin verb invenire invent although inventing closely associated science engineering inventors necessarily engineers due advances artificial intelligence term inventor longer exclusively applies occupation see human inventions patented system patents established encourage inventors granting limitedterm limited monopoly inventions determined sufficiently novel nonobvious useful patent legally protects intellectual property rights inventor legally recognizes claimed invention actually invention rules requirements patenting invention vary country process obtaining patent often expensive another meaning invention cultural invention innovative set useful social behaviours adopted people passed institute social inventions collected many ideas magazines invention also important component artistic design creativity inventions often extend boundaries human knowledge experience capability inventions three kinds scientifictechnological including medicine sociopolitical including economics law humanistic cultural scientifictechnological inventions include railroads aviation vaccination hybridization antibiotics astronautics holography atomic bomb computing internet smartphone sociopolitical inventions comprise new laws institutions procedures change modes social behavior establish new forms human interaction organization examples include british parliament us constitution manchester uk general union trades boy scouts red cross olympic games united nations european union universal declaration human rights well

religious thinkers responsible inventions monotheism pantheism methodism mormonism iconoclasm puritanism deism secularism ecumenism baháʼí faith disciplines genres trends may seem existed eternally emerged spontaneously accord ideas invention may developed paper computer writing drawing trial error making models experimenting testing andor making invention whole form brainstorming also spark new ideas invention collaborative creative processes frequently used engineers designers architects scientists coinventors frequently named patents addition many inventors keep records working process notebooks photos etc including leonardo da vinci galileo galilei evangelista torricelli thomas jefferson albert process developing invention initial idea may change invention may become simpler practical may expand may even morph something totally different working one invention lead others history shows turning concept invention working device always swift direct inventions may also become useful time passes changes occur example parachute became useful powered flight invention often creative process open curious mind allows inventor see beyond known seeing new possibility connection relationship spark invention inventive thinking frequently involves combining concepts elements different realms would normally put together sometimes inventors disregard boundaries distinctly separate territories fieldscitation needed several concepts may considered thinking invention play may lead invention childhood curiosity experimentation imagination develop ones play instinct inventors feel need play things interest explore internal drive brings novel sometimes inventions ideas may seem arise spontaneously daydreaming especially mind free usual example j k rowling creator harry frank hornby inventor first ideas train journeys contrast successful aerospace engineer max munk advocated aimful invent see anew inventors often envision new idea seeing minds eye new ideas arise conscious mind turns away subject problem inventors focus something else relaxing sleeping novel idea may come eureka moment example years working figure general theory relativity solution came einstein suddenly dream like giant die making indelible impress huge map universe outlined one clear inventions also accidental case polytetrafluoroethylene teflon insight also vital element invention inventive insight may begin questions doubt hunch may begin recognizing something unusual accidental may useful could open new avenue exploration example odd metallic color plastic made accidentally adding thousand times much catalyst led scientists explore metallike properties inventing electrically conductive plastic light emitting invention nobel prize led innovative lighting display screens wallpaper much see conductive polymer organic lightemitting diode invention often exploratory process uncertain unknown outcome failures well successes inspiration start process matter complete initial idea inventions typically must developed inventors may example try improve something making effective healthier faster efficient easier use serve purposes longer lasting cheaper ecologically friendly aesthetically different lighter weight ergonomic structurally different new light color properties etc economic theory inventions one chief examples positive externalities beneficial side effect falls outside transaction activity one central concepts economics externalities benefits positive externality captured parties parties underrewarded inventions systematic underrewarding leads underinvestment activities lead inventions patent system captures positive externalities inventor patent owner economy whole invests optimum amount resources invention process contrast invention innovation implementation creative idea specifically leads greater value usefulness invention may useless value yet still invention innovation must sort value typically economic term invention also important legal concept central patent law systems worldwide often case legal concepts legal meaning slightly different common usage word additionally legal concept invention quite different american european patent law europe first test patent application must pass invention subsequent questions whether new sufficiently inventive legal invention inherently novel whether patent application relates invention governed article european patent convention excludes eg discoveries software epo boards appeal decided technical character application decisive represent invention following ageold italian german tradition british courts agree interpretation following australian decision nrdc believe possible grasp invention concept single rule british court stated technical character test implies restatement problem imprecise terminology united states patent applications considered inventions statute explicitly says american invention concept includes discoveries usc contrary european invention concept european invention concept corresponds american patentable subject matter concept first test patent application submitted statute usc virtually poses limits patenting whatsoever courts decided binding precedents abstract ideas natural phenomena laws nature patentable various attempts made substantiate abstract idea test suffers abstractness none succeeded last attempt far machine transformation test us supreme court decided merely indication best india invention means new product process involves inventive step capable made used industry whereas new invention means invention anticipated prior art used country anywhere invention long important history arts inventive thinking always played vital role creative inventions arts patentable others fulfill strict requirements governments established granting see patent inventions art include likewise jackson pollock invented entirely new form painting new kind abstraction dripping pouring splashing splattering paint onto unstretched canvas lying floor inventive tools artists trade also produced advances creativity impressionist painting became possible newly invented collapsible resealable metal paint tubes facilitated spontaneous painting inventions originally created form artwork also develop uses eg alexander calders mobile commonly used babies cribs funds generated patents inventions art design architecture support realization invention creative work frédéric auguste bartholdis design patent statue liberty helped fund famous statue covered small replicas including sold timeline invention arts lists notable artistic inventors historically women many regions unrecognised inventive contributions except russia despite sole inventor coinventor inventions including highly notable inventions notable examples include margaret knight faced significant challenges receiving credit elizabeth magie credited invention game among examples chienshiung wu whose male colleagues alone awarded nobel prize joint contributions societal prejudice institutional educational often legal patent barriers played role gender invention gap example although could found female patenters us patent office also likely helpful experience still patent applications made us patent office inventions less likely succeed applicant feminine additionally women could lose independent legal patent rights husbands see
