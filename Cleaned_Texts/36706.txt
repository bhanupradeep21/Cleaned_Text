clinically practical diagnostic criteria exist accurate diagnostic test intestinal biopsy however test invasive unnecessary prevention strongest reliable option preventing ee effects therefore prevention treatment ee often discussed environmental enteropathy believed result chronic malnutrition subsequent growth stunting low heightforage measurement well child development relationship

thus independent nutritional status nutrient intake inflammation usually decreasedcitation needed reports poor appetite caregivers restriction complementary foods common appetite may reduced proinflammatory cytokines low zinc may continuous children environmental nutrient availability growth environmental enteropathy limited due reduced intestinal surface area loss enzymatic activity causing malabsorption following microbial translocation retention circulating nutrients ie vitamin zinc iron body tissues order starve associations nutrient intake biomarkers nutrient nutrient status thus likely distorted children inflammation systemic inflammation resulting microbial translocation increase basal metabolic rate nutrient needs immune time nutrient losses increase due intestinal

underlying causes development environmental enteropathy ee multifactorial predominantly associated chronic exposure contaminated food water especially true environments widespread open defecation lack sanitation main cause environmental enteropathy likely repeated exposure enteric pathogens fecal rotavirus norovirus cryptosporidum shigella campylobacter ecoli among prevalent causative longterm
