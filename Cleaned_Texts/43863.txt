trigonocephaly congenital condition due premature fusion metopic suture greek metopon forehead leading triangular forehead premature merging two frontal bones leads transverse growth restriction parallel growth expansion may occur one component syndrome together abnormalities isolated form term greek trigonon triangle kephale head trigonocephaly either occur syndrome isolated trigonocephaly associated following syndromes bohringopitz syndrome muenke syndrome jacobsen syndrome syndrome syndrome etiology trigonocephaly mostly unknown although three main trigonocephaly probably multifactorial congenital condition due limited proof theories safely first theory assumes origin pathological synostosis lies within disturbed bone formation early pregnancy causes either tsh suppletion valproate second theory says synostosis begins fetal head gets hindered pelvic outlet third theory predominates disturbed brain formation two frontal lobes main issue behind limited growth frontal lobes leads absence stimuli cranial growth therefore causing premature fusion metopic suturecitation needed conditions syndromes trigonocephaly include diagnosis characterized typical facial

advancement firstly supraorbital bar remodelled wired greenstick fracture straighten secondly supraorbital bar moved cm forward fixed frontal process zygoma without fixation cranium lastly frontal bone divided two rotated attached supraorbital bar causing nude area craniectomy parietal bone frontal bone bone eventually regenerate since dura mater lies underneath dura mater osteogenic capabilities results advancement straightening forehead socalled floating forehead combined remodelling supraorbital bar derived frontosupraorbital advancement remodelling supraorbital bar remodelled described frontal bone split two pieces instead using pieces frontosupraorbital advancement remodelling one piece rotated attached supraorbital bar technique also leaves craniectomy simplest form surgery trigonocephaly however technique insufficient correct deformities used anymore distraction osteogenesis based creating cranial space brain gradually moving bones apart achieved using approaches solutions problem therefore results optimal distraction osteogenesis minimal invasive endoscopic surgery yet experimental phase trigonocephaly seems compliant form craniosynostosis standardization current surgical approaches surgical mortality complications simple suturectomy presently insufficient adjust complicated growth restrictions caused metopic hand frontosupraorbital

past yearswhen distraction osteogenesis gradually acknowledged since positive effect hypotelorismcitation needed expanding distance orbits using springs seems however discussions whether hypotelorism really needs minimal invasive endoscopic surgery gaining attention since early however technical limitations strip craniectomy attempts made reach beyond aesthetic outcome metopic synostosis surgery persistently good reoperation hazards anderson advised craniofacial operations synostosis extensive necessary study cases metopic coronal surgery provide natural outcome mostly minor irregularities reoperations usually performed severe cases including syndromic metopic synostosis hypotelorism temporal hollowing difficult correct hypotelorism usually remains corrected second operation often
