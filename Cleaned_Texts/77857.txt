velopharyngeal insufficiency disorder structure causes failure velum soft palate close posterior pharyngeal wall back wall throat speech order close nose nasal cavity oral speech production important speech requires sound vocal folds airflow lungs directed oral cavity mouth production speech sound exception nasal sounds n ng complete closure occur speech cause hypernasality resonance disorder andor audible nasal emission speech speech sound disorder addition may inadequate airflow produce consonants making sound weak terms velopharyngeal insufficiency velopharyngeal incompetence velopharyngeal inadequacy velopharyngeal dysfunction often used interchangeably although mean thing velopharyngeal dysfunction refers abnormality velopharyngeal valve regardless cause velopharyngeal insufficiency includes structural defect velum mechanical interference closure causes include history cleft palate adenoidectomy irregular adenoids cervical spine anomalies oralpharyngeal tumor contrast velopharyngeal incompetence refers neurogenic cause inadequate velopharyngeal closure causes may include stroke traumatic brain injury cerebral palsy neuromuscular important term velopharyngeal insufficiency used anatomical defect neurological velopharyngeal insufficiency diagnosed speech pathologist perceptual speech assessment speech characteristics vpi include hypernasality much sound nasal cavity speech andor audible nasal emission air speech nasal emission also cause consonants weak intensity pressure patient may develop compensatory productions consonants sounds produced pharynx throat area adequate airflow nasometry method measuring acoustic correlates resonance velopharyngeal function computerbased instrument nasometry testing gives speech pathologist nasalance score percentage nasal sound total nasal plus oral sound speech score compared normative values speech passage nasometry useful evaluation hypernasality provides objective measurements function velopharyngeal valve often used preand postsurgical comparisons determine speech outcomes result certain surgical interventions nasopharyngoscopy endoscopic technique physician speech pathologist passes small scope patients nose nasopharynx nasal cavity typically numbed procedure minimal discomfort nasopharyngoscopy provides view velum soft palate pharyngeal walls walls throat nasal breathing speech advantage technique videofluoroscopy examiner see size location cause velopharyngeal opening clearly without harm eg radiation patient even small openings visualized information helpful determining appropriate surgical prosthetic management patient disadvantage technique vertical level velar elevation less obvious videofluoroscopy although big concern multiview videofluoroscopy radiographic technique view length movement velum soft palate posterior lateral pharyngeal throat walls speech advantage technique entire posterior pharyngeal wall visualized disadvantages include following procedure requires radiation particular concern children well tolerated children requires injection barium nasopharynx nasal catheter resolution clarity image nearly good nasopharyngoscopy small unilateral openings seen xray beam takes sum parts provides twodimensional view therefore multiple views needed see entire velopharyngeal mechanism comparison multiview videofluoroscopy nasoendoscopy velopharyngeal movements diagnosis method useful assessing velopharyngeal vp closure healthy individuals vs individuals experience velar backed articulation ba given found healthy individuals vp closure occur tongue movement whereas individuals ba vp closure occur tongue movement articulating relatively new approach diagnosis magnetic resonance imaging mri noninvasive mri uses property nuclear magnetic resonance image nuclei atoms inside body mri nonradiographic therefore repeated often short periods time addition different studies show mri better imaging tool videofluoroscopy visualizing anatomy velopharynx limitations mri however unlike videofluoroscopy nasopharyngoscopy mri show movement velopharyngeal structures speech addition artifacts shown images patient moves imaging patient orthodontic appliances mri limited children claustrophobic finally mri much expensive videofluoroscopy nasopharyngoscopy limits mri currently widely used clinical diagnostic purposes speech therapy correct velopharyngeal insufficiency condition results abnormal structure requires physical management surgery prosthetic device surgery done speech therapy appropriate correct compensatory articulation productions develop result velopharyngeal insufficiency speech therapy successful correction velopharyngeal insufficiency speech pathologists associated cleft palatecraniofacial team qualified type patients cleft palate palate must repaired palatoplasty normal velopharyngeal function despite palatoplasty patients still degree velopharyngeal insufficiency require surgical prosthetic management correction therefore secondary operation one single operative approach surgical correction vpi surgical approach typically depends size velopharyngeal opening location cause diagnostic tools surgeon able decide technique used based anatomical situation individual goal every operation achieve best possible result technique assigned individual case without causing upper airway obstruction sleep procedure chosen palatoplasties pharyngeal flap sphincter pharyngeal flap used flap posterior wall attached posterior border soft palate flap consists mucosa superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle muscle stays attached pharyngeal wall upper side superior flap lower side inferior function muscle obstruct pharyngeal port moment pharyngeal lateral walls move towards important width level insertion flap properly constructed flap wide patient problems breathing nose result sleep alternatively postoperative situation created symptoms surgery complications possible example flaps width change contraction flap results situation symptoms hypernasality weeks also fistula occur sphincter pharyngoplasty used sides superiorbased palatopharyngeal mucosa muscle flaps distal parts posterior tonsillar pillars palatopharyngeal muscles attached sutured side posterior wall pharyngeal port become smaller result tissue flaps cross leading smaller port middle shorter distance palate posterior pharyngeal advantages using technique first procedure relatively easy execute makes operation cheaper also reduced anesthesia time secondly dynamic sphincter moved result remaining neuromuscular innervation gives better function velopharyngeal port finally lower complication rate although obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome osas techniques used often standard operation pharyngeal flap surgery better sphincter upon surgeons experience knowledge preference operation done also patient size nature velopharyngeal defect contribute technique another option diminishing velopharyngeal port posterior wall augmentation technique often additionally technique used small operation performed several advantages possible narrow velopharyngeal port without modifying function velum lateral furthermore chance obstructing airway lower port closed precisely many materials used closure petroleum jelly paraffin cartilage adjacent
