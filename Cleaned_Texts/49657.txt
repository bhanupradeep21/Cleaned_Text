head transplant experimental surgical operation involving grafting one organisms head onto body another many experiments recipients head removed others experimentation animals began early lasting successes three main technical challenges organ transplant managing immune response avoid transplant rejection necessary also brain highly dependent continuous flow blood provide oxygen nutrients remove waste products damage setting quickly normal temperatures blood flow cut finally managing nervous systems body head essential several ways autonomic nervous system controls essential functions like breathing heart beating governed largely brain stem recipient bodys head removed longer function additionally nerve coming head via spinal cord needs connected putatively corresponding nerve recipient bodys spinal cord order brain control movement receive sensory information finally risk systematic neuropathic pain high largely unaddressed challenges dealing blood supply transplant rejection addressed field transplant medicine generally making transplantation several types organs fairly however field common liver transplantation around quarter organs rejected within first year overall mortality still much higher general challenge grafting nervous system remained early stages research alexis carrel french surgeon developed improved surgical methods connect blood vessels context organ transplantation collaborated american charles claude guthrie attempt graft head one dog intact second dog grafted head showed reflexes early deteriorated quickly animal killed carrels work organ transplantation later earned nobel prize guthrie probably excluded controversial work head vladimir demikhov soviet surgeon done important work improve coronary bypass surgery performed experiment grafted dogs head upper body including front legs onto another dog effort focused provide blood supply donor head upper body grafting nervous systems dogs generally survived days one survived days grafted body parts able move react stimulus animals died due transplant immunosuppressive drugs organ transplantation techniques developed eventually made transplantation kidneys livers organs standard medical robert j white series experiments attempted graft vascular system isolated dog brains onto existing dogs learn manage challenge monitored brain activity eeg also monitored metabolism showed could maintain high levels brain activity metabolism avoiding break blood supply animals survived hours days four experiments cut head monkey connected blood vessels another monkey head attempt connect nervous systems white used deep hypothermia protect brains times cut blood procedure recipient bodies kept alive mechanical ventilation drugs stimulate heart grafted heads able function eyes tracked moving objects could chew swallow problems grafting blood vessels led blood clots forming white used high doses immunosuppressive drugs severe side effects animals died hours days heads experiments reported criticized media considered barbaric animal rights animal experiments head transplantation many years xiaoping ren published work grafted head mouse onto another mouses body focus avoid harm loss blood supply protocol grafted heads survived six sergio canavero published protocol said would make human head transplantation announced plans procedure valeriy spiridonov disabled russian software engineer suffering spinal muscular atrophy volunteered surgery canavero claimed chance however spiridonov later cancelled participation falling love ren published work cut heads mice left brain stem place connected vasculature donor head recipient body work effort address whether possible keep body recipient animal alive without life support prior experimental work involved removing recipient bodys head cut head lower second bone spinal column ren also used moderate hypothermia protect brains ren canavero published review attempted well possible neuroprotection strategies said researched potential use head transplantation procedure discussed various protocols connecting vasculature use various levels hypothermia use blood substitutes possibility using

resistance alarm quarters advances made joseph murray performed first kidney transplant described something unnatural playing god continued organs transplanted perhaps became sharp hand transplants face transplants emerged visible personal social ways internal organs medical ethics procedures extensively discussed worked clinical experimental regular usage regard head transplantation little formal ethical discussion published literature little dialogue among stakeholders plans canavero running well ahead societys medical establishments readiness accepted protocol conducting procedure justify risk people involved methods obtaining informed consent unclear especially person whose body would used issues desperation render truly informed consent head donor regard societal costs body person willing organ donor save lives many people supply tissues organs people willing organ donors meet medical need recipients notion entire donor body going one person difficult justify basic legal issues also unclear regard whether one people involved head transplantation would legal rights postprocedure appropriate initial form procedure unclear grafting head onto spinal cord possible time feasible procedure would one head connected blood supply donor body leaving person completely paralyzed accompanying limited quality life high societal cost psychological results procedure unclear well concerns raised whether recipients face transplant social circle would difficulty adjusting studies found disruptions minimal transplant ever performed entire body individual unfamiliar conclusion procedure one documents discussing ethics biomedical literature letter editor journal published foresaw high risk insanity result popular opinion canaveros plans head transplantation generally negative many criticisms focus state technology timeframe canavero says able successfully conduct literature film television video games httpsenwikipediaorgwikiheadtransplant
