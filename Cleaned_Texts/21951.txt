plant morphology thorns spines prickles general spinose structures sometimes called spinose teeth spinose apical processes hard rigid extensions modifications leaves roots stems buds sharp stiff ends generally serve function physically defending plants herbivory common language terms used less interchangeably botanical terms thorns derived shoots may may branched may may leaves may may arise spines derived leaves either entire leaf part leaf vascular bundles inside like petiole prickles derived epidermis tissue found anywhere plant vascular bundles leaf margins may also teeth teeth sharp called spinose teeth spinose leaf authors consider kind leaf apex apical process generally extension midvein especially sharp stiff spinelike may referred spinose pungent apical authors call kind leaf epidermis covered long stiff trichomes correctly called bristles authors kind may referred hispid trichomes stinging trichomes may called urent found also spines spinose structures derived predominant function thorns spines prickles deterring herbivory mechanical form reason classified physical mechanical defenses opposed chemical defenses functions spines glochids limited defense physical attacks herbivores animals cases spines shown shade insulate plants grow thereby protecting extreme temperatures example saguaro cactus spines shade apical meristem summer members opuntioideae glochids insulate apical meristem winter agrawal et al found spines seem little effect specialist pollinators many plants rely order pointing spinose processes broadly divided presence vascular tissue thorns spines derived shoots leaves respectively vascular bundles inside whereas prickles like rose prickles vascular bundles inside removed easily cleanly thorns spines thorns modified branches stems may

spines modified leaves stipules parts leaves extensions leaf veins authors prefer distinguish spines thorns like thorns unlike prickles commonly contain vascular spines variously described petiolar

comparable hairs quite coarse example rose prickles extensions cortex technically speaking many plants commonly thought thorns spines actually prickles roses instance position thorns spines known positively controlled phyllotaxis positioning prickles appears truly random phyllotaxis arcane give appearance randomnesscitation needed raised prickles stem caesalpinia decapetala rose prickles prickles leaves solanum viarum similar structures spinose teeth spinose apical processes trichomes trichomes particular distinct thorns spines prickles much smaller often microscopic outgrowths epidermal tissue less rigid hairlike appearance typically consist cells outermost layer epidermis whereas prickles may include cortex tissue trichomes often effective defenses small insect herbivores

environments provided inadequate resources fast regeneration spinose structures occur wide variety ecologies morphology also varies greatly occur thorns hollow act myrmecodomatia others eg crataegus
