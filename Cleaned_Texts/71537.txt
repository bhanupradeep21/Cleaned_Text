candidiasis fungal infection due type candida type affects mouth countries commonly called signs symptoms include white patches tongue areas mouth symptoms may include soreness problems affects vagina may referred yeast infection signs symptoms include genital itching burning sometimes white cottage cheeselike discharge yeast infections penis less common typically present itchy rarely yeast infections may become invasive spreading parts may result fevers along symptoms depending parts types candida may cause infection candida albicans infections mouth common among children less one month old elderly weak immune conditions result weak immune system include hivaids medications used organ transplantation diabetes use risk factors include breastfeeding following antibiotic therapy wearing vaginal infections occur commonly pregnancy weak immune systems following antibiotic individuals risk invasive candidiasis include low birth weight babies people recovering surgery people admitted intensive care units otherwise compromised immune efforts prevent infections mouth include use chlorhexidine mouthwash poor immune function washing mouth following use inhaled little evidence supports probiotics either prevention treatment even among frequent vaginal infections mouth treatment topical clotrimazole nystatin usually oral intravenous fluconazole itraconazole amphotericin b may used number topical antifungal medications may used vaginal infections including widespread disease echinocandin caspofungin micafungin number weeks intravenous amphotericin b may used certain groups high risk antifungal medications may used concomitantly medications known precipitate infections infections mouth occur babies less month receiving chemotherapy cancer aids also develop threequarters women least one yeast infection time widespread disease rare except risk signs symptoms candidiasis vary depending area candidal infections result minimal complications redness itching discomfort though complications may severe even fatal left untreated certain populations healthy immunocompetent persons candidiasis usually localized infection skin fingernails toenails onychomycosis mucosal membranes including oral cavity pharynx thrush esophagus sex organs vagina penis less commonly healthy individuals gastrointestinal urinary respiratory sites candida infection immunocompromised individuals candida infections esophagus occur frequently healthy individuals higher potential becoming systemic causing much serious condition fungemia called symptoms esophageal candidiasis include difficulty swallowing painful swallowing abdominal pain nausea infection mouth characterized white discolorations tongue around mouth throat irritation may also occur causing discomfort thrush commonly seen infants considered abnormal infants unless lasts longer infection vagina vulva may cause severe itching burning soreness irritation whitish whitishgray cottage cheeselike discharge symptoms infection male genitalia balanitis thrush include red skin around head penis swelling irritation itchiness soreness head penis thick lumpy discharge foreskin unpleasant odour difficulty retracting foreskin phimosis pain passing urine signs symptoms candidiasis skin include itching irritation chafing broken common symptoms gastrointestinal candidiasis healthy individuals anal itching belching bloating indigestion nausea diarrhea gas intestinal cramps vomiting gastric perianal candidiasis cause anal itching lesion red papular ulcerative appearance considered sexually transmissible abnormal proliferation candida gut may lead yet clear alteration may source symptoms generally described irritable bowel gastrointestinal candidiasis cause variety mental symptoms brain fog memory problems difficulty concentrating anxiety depression irritability mood swings even psychosis rare cases candida produce toxins affect brain nervous system leading cognitive emotional candida yeasts generally present healthy humans frequently part human bodys normal oral intestinal flora particularly skin however growth normally limited human immune system competition microorganisms bacteria occupying locations human candida requires moisture growth notably example wearing wet swimwear long periods time believed risk candida also cause diaper rashes extreme cases superficial infections skin mucous membranes may enter bloodstream cause systemic candida infectionscitation needed factors increase risk candidiasis include hivaids mononucleosis cancer treatments steroids stress antibiotic therapy diabetes nutrient deficiency hormone replacement therapy infertility treatments may also predisposing use inhaled corticosteroids increases risk candidiasis inhaled corticosteroids risk factors antibiotics oral glucocorticoids rinsing mouth use inhaled corticosteroids high dose inhaled corticosteroids put people even higher treatment antibiotics lead eliminating yeasts natural competitors resources oral intestinal flora thereby increasing severity weakened undeveloped immune system metabolic illnesses significant predisposing factors almost people weakened immune systems develop systemic illness caused candida diets high simple carbohydrates found affect rates oral c albicans isolated vaginas apparently healthy women ie experienced symptoms infection external use detergents douches internal disturbances hormonal physiological perturb normal vaginal flora consisting lactic acid bacteria lactobacilli result overgrowth candida cells causing symptoms infection local pregnancy use oral contraceptives reported risk diabetes mellitus use antibiotics also linked increased rates yeast penile candidiasis causes include sexual intercourse infected individual low immunity antibiotics diabetes male genital yeast infections less common yeast infection penis caused direct contact via sexual intercourse infected partner breastfeeding mothers may also develop candidiasis around nipple result moisture created excessive vaginal candidiasis cause congenital candidiasis oral candidiasis simply inspecting persons mouth white patches irritation may make diagnosis sample infected area may also taken determine organism causing symptoms vaginal candidiasis also present common bacterial aerobic vaginitis distinct excluded differential study women selftreating yeast infection found infection either bacterial vaginosis mixedtype diagnosis yeast infection confirmed either via microscopic examination culturing identification light microscopy scraping swab affected area placed microscope slide single drop potassium hydroxide koh solution added specimen koh dissolves skin cells leaves candida cells intact permitting visualization pseudohyphae budding yeast cells typical many candida speciescitation needed culturing method sterile swab rubbed infected skin surface swab streaked culture medium culture incubated several days allow development yeast bacterial colonies characteristics morphology colour colonies may allow initial diagnosis organism causing disease respiratory gastrointestinal esophageal candidiasis require endoscopy gastrointestinal candidiasis necessary obtain milliliter sample fluid duodenum fungal diagnosis gastrointestinal candidiasis based upon culture containing excess colonyforming units per candidiasis may divided types diet supports immune system high simple carbohydrates contributes healthy balance oral intestinal yeast infections associated diabetes level blood sugar control may affect wearing cotton underwear may help reduce risk developing skin vaginal yeast infections along wearing wet clothes long periods women experience recurrent yeast infections limited evidence oral intravaginal probiotics help prevent future includes either pills oral hygiene help prevent oral candidiasis people weakened immune people undergoing cancer treatment chlorhexidine mouthwash prevent reduce people use inhaled corticosteroids reduce risk developing oral candidiasis rinsing mouth water mouthwash using people dentures also disinfect dentures regularly prevent oral candidiasis treated antifungal medications include clotrimazole nystatin fluconazole voriconazole amphotericin b intravenous fluconazole intravenous echinocandin caspofungin commonly used treat immunocompromised critically ill revision clinical practice guideline management candidiasis lists large number specific treatment regimens candida infections involve different candida species forms antifungal drug resistance immune statuses infection localization gastrointestinal candidiasis immunocompetent individuals treated mg fluconazole per day mouth throat candidiasis treated antifungal medication oral candidiasis usually responds topical treatments otherwise systemic antifungal medication may needed oral infections candidal skin infections skin folds candidal intertrigo typically respond well topical antifungal treatments eg nystatin miconazole breastfeeding mothers topical miconazole effective treatment treating candidiasis gentian violet used thrush breastfeeding systemic treatment antifungals mouth reserved severe cases treatment topical therapy unsuccessful candida esophagitis may treated orally intravenously severe azoleresistant esophageal candidiasis treatment amphotericin b may vaginal yeast infections typically treated topical antifungal penile yeast infections also treated antifungal agents internal treatment may used pessary vaginal yeast infections external treatments cream recommended penile onetime dose fluconazole mouth effective treating vaginal yeast severe nonrecurring cases several doses fluconazole local treatment may include vaginal suppositories medicated douches types yeast infections require different dosing c albicans develop resistance fluconazole issue hivaids often treated multiple courses fluconazole recurrent oral vaginal yeast infection pregnancy topical imidazole triazole antifungals considered therapy choice owing available safety systemic absorption topical formulations minimal posing little risk transplacental vaginal yeast infection pregnancy treatment topical azole antifungals recommended seven days instead shorter vaginal yeast infections many complementary treatments proposed however number side benefit probiotics found active treatment typically consists oral intravenous antifungal candidal infections blood intravenous fluconazole echinocandin caspofungin may amphotericin b another hospitalized patients develop candidemia age important prognostic factor mortality following candidemia patients aged years patients aged among individuals treated intensive care units mortality rate systemic candidiasis oral candidiasis common fungal infection also represents common opportunistic oral infection infections mouth occur babies less month receiving chemotherapy cancer aids also develop estimated women may asymptomatically colonized vaginal united states approximately million doctor office visits every year threequarters women least one yeast infection time
