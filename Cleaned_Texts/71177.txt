descartes discusses theories meteorology known les météores first proposed idea elements made small particles join together imperfectly thus leaving small spaces spaces filled smaller much quicker subtile particles different based element constructed example descartes believed particles water like little eels though join twist around ever knot hook together way easily contrast particles made solid material constructed way generated irregular shapes size particle also matters particle smaller faster constantly moving easily agitated larger particles slow force different qualities combinations shapes gave rise different secondary qualities materials first idea basis rest descartes theory meteorology rejecting aristotles theories meteorology still kept terminology aristotle used vapors exhalations vapors would drawn sky sun terrestrial substances would generate descartes also theorized falling clouds would displace air also generating wind falling clouds could also generate thunder theorized cloud rests another cloud air around top cloud hot condenses vapor around top cloud causes particles fall particles falling top cloud collided bottom clouds particles would create compared theory thunder theory avalanches descartes believed booming sound avalanches created due snow heated therefore heavier falling onto snow theory supported experience follows one understand thunders rarely winter summer enough heat reaches highest clouds order break another theory descartes production lightning descartes believed lightning caused exhalations trapped two colliding clouds believed order make exhalations viable produce lightning made fine inflammable hot dry whenever clouds would collide would cause ignite creating lightning cloud heavier bottom cloud would also produce thunder descartes also believed clouds made drops water ice believed rain would fall whenever air could longer support would fall snow air wasnt warm enough melt raindrops hail cloud drops would melt freeze cold air would refreeze descartes use mathematics instruments werent time back theories meteorology instead used qualitative reasoning order deduce descartes often dubbed father modern western
