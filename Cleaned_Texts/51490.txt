sodomy often falls category sex unmarried man woman malemale intercourse referred liwat femalefemale intercourse referred sihaq considered reprehensible acts consensus punishment either jurists define zināʾ exclusively act unlawful vaginal penetration hence categorizing punishing anal penetration different ways jurists included vaginal anal penetration within definition zināʾ hence extended punishment one religious discourse mostly focused sexual acts unambiguously condemned quran refers explicitly malemale sexual relations context story lot labels sodomites actions universally understood later tradition anal intercourse abomination femalefemale relations addressed reported pronouncements muhammad hadith reinforce interdiction malemale sodomy although reports ever adjudicating actual case offence also quoted condemning crossgender behaviour sexes banishing local places unclear extent understood involving sexual relations several early caliphs confronted cases sodomy males said partners executed variety means taking precedents account medieval jurists unable achieve consensus issue legal schools prescribed capital punishment sodomy others opted relatively mild discretionary punishment general agreement however homosexual acts including females lesser offences subject discretionary quran strictly prohibits homosexuality story lot also biblical book
