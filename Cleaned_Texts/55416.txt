research food choice investigates people select food eat interdisciplinary topic food choice comprises psychological sociological aspects including food politics phenomena vegetarianism religious dietary laws economic issues instance food prices marketing campaigns influence choice sensory aspects study organoleptic qualities food factors guide food choice include taste preference sensory attributes cost availability convenience cognitive restraint cultural addition environmental cues increased portion sizes play role choice amount foods food choice subject research nutrition food science food psychology anthropology sociology branches natural social sciences practical interest food industry especially marketing endeavors social scientists developed different conceptual frameworks food choice behavior theoretical models behavior incorporate individual environmental factors affecting formation modification social cognitive theory examines interaction environmental personal behavioral factors researchers found consumers cite taste primary determinant food genetic differences ability perceive bitter taste believed play role willingness eat bittertasting vegetables preferences sweet taste fat content foods approximately percent us population supertasters percent tastersclarification neededcitation needed epidemiological studies suggest nontasters likely eat wider variety foods higher body mass index bmi measure weight kilograms divided height meters squared many environmental cues influence food choice intake although consumers may aware effects see mindless examples environmental influences include portion size serving aids food variety ambient characteristics discussed portion sizes united states increased markedly past several example portion sizes increased percent salty snacks percent soft importantly larger product portion sizes larger servings restaurants kitchens consistently increase food larger portion sizes may even cause people eat foods ostensibly distasteful one study individuals ate significantly stale twoweekold popcorn served large versus mediumsized percent ones total intake consumed using serving aids plates bowls glasses consequently serving aids act visual cues cognitive shortcuts inform us stop serving eating one study teenagers poured consumed percent juice short wide glasses compared tall narrow glasses similarly veteran bartenders tend pour percent liquor short wide glasses versus tall narrow may explained part piagets verticalhorizontal illusion people tend focus overestimate objects vertical dimension expense horizontal dimension even two dimensions identical addition larger bowls spoons also cause people serve consume greater volume although effect may also extend larger suggested people serve food larger dishes due delboeuf illusion phenomenon two identical circles perceived different size depending upon sizes larger circles surrounding plate color also shown influence perception liking one study individuals perceived dessert significantly likable sweet intense served white versus black given food increasingly consumed hedonic pleasantness foods taste smell appearance texture declines effect commonly referred sensoryspecific consequently increasing variety foods available increase overall food effect observed across across multiple age groups although evidence may pronounced adolescence diminished among older even perceived variety food increase consumption individuals consumed mm candies came ten versus seven colors despite identical furthermore simply making food assortment appear disorganized versus organized increase variety effect may evolutionarily adaptive complete nutrition found single food increased dietary variety increases likelihood meeting nutritional requirements various vitamins minerals low grade evidence changing availability positioning food options may result changes food selection consumption environmental interventions taxation foodbenefit programs increasing availability fruits reduce number sweetened beverages increased food salience ones environment including food visibility proximity shown increase regarding visibility food consumed faster rate greater volume presented clear versus opaque large stockpiles food products home increase rate consumption initially however weeks time consumption rate may drop back level nonstockpiled foods perhaps due sensoryspecific salient foods may increase intake serving continuous consumption reminder increasing number foodrelated cognitive choices individual must additionally studies found obese individuals may susceptible influence food salience external cues individuals normalweight distractions increase food intake initiating patterns consumption obscuring ability accurately monitor consumption extending meal example greater television viewing associated increased meal caloric study australian children found watched two hours television per day likely consume savory snacks less likely consume fruit compared watched less distractors reading movie watching listening radio also associated increased energy expenditure increases ambient temperature thermal neutral zone range ambient temperature energy expenditure required suggested energy intake also increases conditions extreme prolonged cold relatedly researchers posited reduced variability ambient temperature indoors could mechanism driving obesity percentage us homes air conditioning increased percent recent addition several human studies shown temperatures thermoneutral zone significantly reduce food intake however overall studies indicating altered energy intake response extreme ambient temperatures evidence primarily anecdotal dearth research investigating relationships lighting intake however extant literature suggests harsh glaring lighting promotes eating whereas soft warm lighting increases food intake increasing comfort level lowering inhibition extending meal compared fasttempo music lowtempo music restaurant setting associated longer meal duration greater consumption food drink including alcoholic similarly individuals hear preferred versus nonpreferred music tend stay dining establishments longer spend money food first time dietary guidelines americans dga highlighted role food environment american food choices recommended changes food environment support individual behavior influence environmental cues subtle factors increased interest using principles behavioral economics change food substantial amount research indicating presence others influences food intake discussed reviewing literature herman roth outlined three distinct effects social facilitation eating groups people tend eat alone daily diary studies individuals found eat presence others versus eating alone fact research indicated rate intake best described linear function number people present meals eaten one four seven people percent larger meals eaten alone addition observational findings also experimental evidence social facilitation meal duration may important factor social facilitation effects observational research identified positive correlations group size meal investigation confirmed meal duration mediator group sizeintake modeling eating presence others consistently eat either lot little individuals tend mirror behavior also eating either lot little early studies modeling effects investigated food intake alone versus presence others either ate either small amount cracker larger amount findings consistent individuals consuming paired highconsumption companion lowconsumption companion whereas eating alone associated intermediate amount intake research manipulating eating social norms within reallife actual friendships also demonstrated modeling effects individuals ate less company friends instructed restrict intake versus given furthermore modeling effects reported across range diverse demographics affecting normalweight overweight well dieters finally regardless whether individuals hungry full modeling effects remain strong suggesting modeling may trump signals hunger satiety sent impression management people eat presence others perceive observing evaluating tend eat less would otherwise eat alone leary define impression management general process individuals attempt control impressions others form previous research shown certain types eating companions make people less eager convey good impression individuals often attempt achieve goal eating example people eating presence unfamiliar others job interview first date tend eat series studies mori chaiken pliner individuals given opportunity snack getting acquainted first study males females tended eat less presence oppositesex eating companion females effect pronounced companion desirable also seems women may consume less order exude feminine identity second study women made believe male companion viewed masculine ate less women believed perceived feminine weight eating companions may also influence volume food consumed obese individuals found eat significantly presence obese individuals compared normalweight others normalweight individuals eating appears unaffected weight eating awareness although presence behavior others strong impact eating behavior many individuals aware effects instead tend attribute eating behavior primarily factors hunger relatedly people tend perceive factors like cost health effects significantly influential social norms determining fruit vegetable individuals overweight obese may suffer stigmatization discrimination related weight also called weightism weight bias emerging evidence experiences weight stigma may type stereotype threat leads behavior consistent stereotype example overweight obese individuals ate food exposure weight stigmatizing additionally study overweight obese women percent women reported coping weight stigma multiple occasions eating cognitive dietary restraint refers condition one constantly monitoring attempting restrict food intake order achieve maintain desired body strategies used restrained eaters include choosing reducedcalorie reducedfat foods addition restricting overall caloric intake individuals classified restrained eaters based responses validated questionnaires three factor eating questionnaire restraint subscale dutch eating behavior recent research suggests combination restraint disinhibition accurately predict food choice dietary restraint alone disinhibition another factor measured three factor eating questionnaire positive score reflects tendency towards individuals scoring high disinhibition subscale eat response negative emotion overeat others eating presence tasty comfort foods comes selecting food women likely men choose consume foods based health concerns food one possible explanation observed difference women may concerned body weight issues choosing certain types may inverse relationship adolescent girls noted lower intakes vitamins minerals ingest fewer fruitsvegetables dairy foods adolescent across lifespan different eating habits observed based socioeconomic status workforce conditions financial security taste preference amongst significant portion middleaged older adults responded choosing foods due concerns bodyweight heart disease whereas adolescents select food without consideration impact convenience appeal food taste appearance hunger food cravings found greatest determinants adolescents food food choice change early mature age result sophisticated taste palate income concerns health wellness income level education influence food choice via availability resources purchase higher quality food awareness nutritious diet may vary depending availability income purchase healthier nutrientrich lowincome family pricing plays larger role taste quality whether food may partly explain lower life expectancy lowerincome similarly higher levels education equate higher expectations functional foods avoidance food compared conventional foods organic foods higher cost people may limited access generating low income variety foods
