autonomic dysreflexia ad potentially fatal medical emergency classically characterized uncontrolled hypertension cardiac ad occurs often individuals spinal cord injuries lesions spinal cord level although reported patients lesions low syndrome may also cause autonomic uncontrolled hypertension ad may result mild symptoms sweating lesion level goosebumps blurred vision headache however severe symptoms may result potentially lifethreatening complications including seizure intracranial bleed stroke myocardial infarction retinal ad triggered either noxious nonnoxious stimuli resulting sympathetic stimulation common causes include bladder bowel overdistension urinary retention fecal pressure sores extreme temperatures fractures undetected painful stimuli pebble shoe sexual activity

hypertension activates baroreceptors resulting parasympathetic surge originating central nervous system inhibit sympathetic outflow however parasympathetic signal unable transmit level spinal cord

removing constrictive clothing including abdominal binders support stockings rechecking blood pressure frequently checking removing inciting issue may require urinary catheterization bowel systolic

precipitating cause known avoid well since bladder bowel common causes routine bladder bowel programs urological followup cystoscopyurodynamic studies may help reduce frequency severity condition

longstanding medical problems like soft tissue pressure injuries hemorrhoids long term therapy may include alpha blockers calcium channel complications severe acute hypertension include seizures
