species aublysodon mirandus named paleontologist joseph leidy sometimes considered dubious type specimen consists isolated premaxillary front tooth although specimen lost similar teeth found many us states western canada teeth almost certainly belong juvenile tyrannosaurine tyrannosaurids identified species level however likely type tooth therefore name aublysodon mirandus belongs one species genus daspletosaurus present contemporary formations matches specific details original synapomorphies alleged distinguish aublysodontinae especially lack serrations premaxillary teeth could caused
