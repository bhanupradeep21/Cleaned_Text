hair transplantation surgical technique removes hair follicles one part body called donor site bald balding part body known recipient site technique primarily used treat male pattern baldness minimally invasive procedure grafts containing hair follicles genetically resistant balding like back head transplanted bald scalp hair transplantation also used restore eyelashes eyebrows beard hair chest hair pubic hair fill scars caused accidents surgery facelifts previous hair transplants hair transplantation differs skin grafting grafts contain almost epidermis dermis surrounding hair follicle many tiny grafts transplanted rather single strip skin since hair naturally grows groupings hairs current techniques harvest transplant hair follicular units natural groupings thus modern hair transplantation achieve natural appearance mimicking original hair orientation hair transplant procedure called follicular unit transplantation fut donor hair harvested two different ways strip harvesting follicular unit extraction fue initial consultation surgeon analyzes patients scalp discusses preferences expectations advises best approach eg single vs multiple sessions results might reasonably expected laxometers used measure looseness specifically laxity scalp preoperative folliscopy help know actual existing density hair postoperative results newly transplanted hair grafts accurately assessed patients may benefit preoperative topical minoxidil application several days prior surgery patient refrains using medicines might result intraoperative bleeding resultant poor grafting alcohol smoking contribute poor graft survival post operative antibiotics commonly prescribed prevent wound graft transplant operations performed outpatient basis mild sedation optional injected local anesthesia scalp shampooed treated antibacterial agent prior donor scalp harvestedcitation needed several different techniques harvesting hair follicles advantages disadvantages regardless harvesting technique proper extraction hair follicle paramount ensure viability transplanted hair avoid transection cutting hair shaft hair follicle hair follicles grow slight angle skins surface transplanted tissue must removed corresponding anglecitation needed two main ways donor grafts extracted today strip excision harvesting follicular unit extraction strip harvesting also known follicular unit transplantation fut common technique removing hair follicles donor site surgeon harvests strip skin posterior scalp area good hair growth single double triplebladed scalpel used remove strips hairbearing tissue donor site incision planned intact hair follicles removed excised strip x cm size closing resulting wound assistants begin dissect individual follicular unit grafts small naturally formed groupings hair follicles strip working binocular stereomicroscopes carefully remove excess fibrous fatty tissue trying avoid damage follicular cells used grafting latest method closure called trichophytic closure results much finer scars donor area surgeon uses small micro blades fine needles puncture sites receiving grafts placing predetermined density pattern angling wounds consistent fashion promote realistic hair pattern technicians generally final part procedure inserting individual grafts place strip harvesting leave thin linear scar donor area typically covered patients hair even relatively short lengths recovery period around weeks require stitchesstaples removed medical personnel sub cuticular suturing done follicular unit extraction fue harvesting individual follicular units containing hairs removed local anesthesia micro removal typically uses tiny punches diameter surgeon uses small micro blades fine needles puncture sites receiving grafts placing predetermined density pattern angling wounds consistent fashion promote realistic hair pattern technicians generally final part procedure inserting individual grafts place fue takes place single long session multiple small sessions fue procedure timeconsuming strip surgery fue surgery time varies according surgeons experience speed harvesting patient characteristics procedure take anywhere couple hours extract grafts scar correction surgery two consecutive days megasession fue hair transplant procedure restrictions patient clients selected fue based fox though debate usefulness screening clients fue fue give natural results advantage strip harvesting fue harvesting negates need large areas scalp tissue harvested linear incision back head doesnt leave linear scar individual follicles removed small punctate scars remain virtually visible postsurgical pain discomfort minimized suture removal required recovery micro grafting fue less disadvantages include increased surgical times higher cost challenging new surgeons procedure physically demanding learning curve acquire skills necessary lengthy toughcitation needed surgeons note fue lead lower ratio successfully transplanted follicles compared strip harvesting robotic hair restoration devices utilize cameras robotic arms assist surgeon fue procedure neograft became first robotic surgical device fda approved

expectations results bht surgery cost hair transplantation depends individual hair loss consequently number necessary grafts average price per graft ranges turkey canada clinics also offer allinclusive uk cost depending location area hair thinning known shock loss common side effect usually bald patches also common fifty hundred hairs lost day postoperative hiccups also seen around transplant use scalp flaps band tissue original blood supply shifted continue bald area free grafts dates back century menahem hodara successfully implanted hair taken unaffected areas scalp scars left bald favus modern transplant techniques began japan surgeons used small grafts even follicular unit grafts replace damaged areas eyebrows lashes treat baldness efforts receive worldwide attention time traumas world war ii kept advances isolated another two decades modern era hair transplantation western world ushered late new york dermatologist norman orentreich began experiment free donor grafts balding areas patients male pattern baldness previously thought transplanted hair would thrive original hair recipient site orentreich demonstrated grafts donor dominant new hairs grew lasted would original advancing theory donor dominance walter p unger md defined parameters safe donor zone permanent hair follicles could extracted hair transplanted hair grow new site long would original one parameters continue serve fundamental foundation hair follicle harvesting whether strip method fue next twenty years surgeons worked transplanting smaller grafts results minimally successful mm plugs leading dolls headlike appearance strip excisions began replace plug technique carlos uebel brazil popularized using large numbers small grafts united states william rassman began using thousands micrografts single late bl limmer introduced use stereomicroscope dissect single donor strip small follicular unit hair transplant procedure continued evolve becoming refined minimally invasive size graft incisions become smaller smaller less invasive incisions enable surgeons place larger number follicular unit grafts given area new gold standard ultra refined follicular unit hair transplantation grafts placed per square centimeter appropriate surgeons also devoted attention angle orientation transplanted grafts adoption lateral slit technique early enabled hair transplant surgeons orient hair follicular unit grafts splay across scalps surface enabled transplanted hair lie better scalp provide better coverage bald areasoriginal research one disadvantage however lateral incisions also tend disrupt scalps vascularity sagittals thus sagittal incisions transect less hairs blood vessels assuming cutting instruments sizecitation needed one advantages sagittals much better job sliding around existing hairs avoid follicle transectionoriginal research makes strong case physicians require shaving recipient area lateral incisions bisect existing hairs perpendicular horizontal like sagittal incisions run parallel vertical alongside existing hairs use perpendicular lateralcoronal slits versus parallel sagittal slits however heavily debated patientbased hair
