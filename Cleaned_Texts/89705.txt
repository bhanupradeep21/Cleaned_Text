euromycter level remained largely unprepared overlapping elements euromycter suggested belongs different taxon named ruthenosaurus russellorum ruthenosaurus diagnosed several autapomorphies including dorsal vertebrae anteriorly tilting neural spines diamondshaped outline transverse section first sacral rib robust distal head twice second sacral rib short iliac blade prominent posterior process distinguished euromycter older deposits locality shape distal part humerus including ectepicondylar notch rather fully enclosed foramen specific shape ulna overall robustness lack fusion neural arches
