theropods characteristic puncture pull feeding method studies wear patterns teeth animal angelica torices et al study regarding theropod feeding habits indicate dromaeosaurid teeth share similar wear patterns seen tyrannosauridae troodontidae respectively however microwear teeth indicated saurornitholestes likely preferred larger prey items troodontids shared environment differentiations diet
