spaced structure known external fundamental system indicating individual reached sexual maturity also adult size assessment supported extensive remodeling cortical bone trait associated anatomical sexual maturity high number cyclical growth marks seen amargatitanis unusual sauropods possibly indicates sauropods grew discontinuously rather amargatitanis stems sedimentary rocks la amarga
