anatomy nasal concha ˈkɒnkə pl conchae ˈkɒnkiː latin shell also called nasal turbinate long narrow curled shelf bone protrudes breathing passage nose humans various animals conchae shaped like elongated seashell gave name latin concha greek κόγχη concha scrolled spongy bones nasal passages humans conchae divide nasal airway four groovelike air passages responsible forcing inhaled air flow steady regular pattern around largest possible surface area nasal mucosa ciliated mucous membrane shallow blood supply nasal mucosa cleans warms inhaled air preparation lungs rapidly dilating arteriolar circulation bones may lead sharp increase pressure within response acute cooling body core pain pressure often referred brain freeze frequently associated rapid consumption ice cream shallowness venous blood supply mucosa contributes ease nosebleed occur conchae composed pseudostratified columnar ciliated respiratory epithelium thick vascular erectile glandular tissue conchae located laterally nasal cavities curling medially downward nasal airway pair composed one concha either side nasal cavity divided superior conchae smaller structures connected middle conchae

sinuses act buffers protect sinuses coming direct contact pressurized nasal airflow inhaled airflow travels inferior concha middle humans usually long little finger inferior conchae largest turbinates long index finger humans responsible majority airflow direction humidification heating filtering air inhaled inferior conchae graded based inferior concha classification system known inferior turbinate classification system total amount airway space inferior concha takes estimated grade airway grade airway grade airway grade sometimes pair supreme conchae superior superior conchae present usually take form small crest conchae comprise mucosal tissue nose required functional respiration enriched airflow pressure temperaturesensing nerve receptors linked trigeminal nerve route fifth cranial nerve allowing tremendous erectile capabilities nasal congestion decongestion response weather conditions changing needs addition erectile tissue undergoes often unnoticed cycle partial congestion decongestion called nasal cycle flow blood nasal mucosa particular venous plexus conchae regulated pterygopalatine ganglion heats cools air nose nasopulmonary nasothoracic reflexes regulate mechanism breathing deepening inhalation triggered flow air pressure air nose quality air impulses nasal mucosa transmitted trigeminal nerve breathing centres brainstem generated response transmitted bronchi intercostal muscles diaphragm conchae also responsible filtration heating humidification air inhaled nose three filtration achieved mostly effective means mucous cilia air passes conchae heated humidified water saturation respiratory epithelium covers erectile tissue lamina propria conchae plays major role bodys first line immunological defense respiratory epithelium partially composed mucusproducing goblet cells secreted mucus covers nasal cavities serves filter trapping airborne particles larger micrometers respiratory epithelium also serves means access lymphatic system protects body infected viruses conchae provide first foremost humidity needed preserve delicate olfactory epithelium turn needed keep olfactory receptors healthy alert epithelial layer gets dry irritated may cease function usually temporary condition time may lead chronic turbinates also increase surface area inside nose directing deflecting airflow across maximum mucosal surface inner nose able propel inspired air coupled humidity filtration provided conchae helps carry scent molecules towards higher narrow regions nasal airways olfaction nerve receptors superior conchae completely cover protect nerve axons piercing cribriform plate porous bone plate separates nose brain nose areas middle conchae also innervated olfactory bulb three pairs conchae innervated pain temperature receptors via trigeminal nerve fifth cranial research shown strong connection nerve endings activation olfactory receptors science yet fully explain interaction large swollen conchae often referred clinically turbinates may lead blockage nasal breathing allergies exposure environmental irritants persistent inflammation within sinuses lead turbinate swelling deformity nasal septum also result enlarged treatment underlying allergy irritant may reduce turbinate swelling cases resolve treatment deviated septum turbinate surgery may required turbinate reduction surgery reduce size turbinates typically inferior turbinates different techniques including bipolar radiofrequency ablation also known somnoplasty electrocautery use cold steel instruments eg microdebrider turbinectomy surgery remove turbinates typically inferior turbinates case turbinate reduction small amounts turbinate tissue removed turbinates essential respiration turbinectomy usually reserved patients persistent symptoms despite previous turbinate reduction surgery risks reduction inferior middle turbinates include empty nose dr houser especially true cases anterior inferior turbinate resection important role internal nasal concha bullosa abnormal pneumatization middle turbinate may interfere normal ventilation sinus ostia result recurrent sinusitis cases concha bullosa may resected help resolve persistent symptoms generally animals nasal conchae convoluted structures thin bone cartilage located nasal cavity lined mucous membranes perform two functions improve sense smell increasing area available absorb airborne chemicals warm moisten inhaled air extract heat moisture exhaled air prevent desiccation lungs olfactory turbinates found living tetrapodscitation needed respiratory turbinates found mammals birds animals respiratory turbinates breathe faster without drying lungs consequently faster example emu exhales nasal turbinates condense moisture air absorbs dogs canids possess

thermoregulatory capabilities welldeveloped turbinates dogs may crucial adaptations allowed dogs including domestic dogs wild prehistoric gray wolf ancestors survive harsh arctic environment cold areas northern eurasia north america dry reptiles primitive synapsids olfactory turbinates involved sensing smell rather preventing maxilloturbinates mammals located path airflow collect moisture sensory turbinates mammals reptiles positioned farther back nasal passage away flow glanosuchus ridges positioned low nasal cavity indicating maxilloturbinates direct path airflow maxilloturbinates may preserved either thin cartilaginous possibility also raised ridges associated olfactory epithelium rather nonetheless possible presence maxilloturbinates suggests glanosuchus may able rapidly breathe without drying nasal passage therefore could bones nasal turbinates fragile seldom survive fossils particular none found fossil indirect evidence presence fossils rudimentary ridges like
