cosesaurus genus archosauromorph reptiles likely belonging family known fossil imprints single small skeleton mgb found muschelkalk outcrops near municipalities montral alcover spain outcrops dated ladinian age middle triassic million years ago specimen stored museu martorell aka museu geologia de barcelona part museu de ciències naturals de barcelona poor preservation likely juvenile nature specimen led anatomy cosesaurus misidentified several different sources example paul ellenberger claimed ancestor birds david peters claimed pterosaur ancestor claims contrast mainstream scientific theories origins either group paleontologists study specimen unable find features ellenberger peters reported ellenberger peters hypotheses thus considered fringe theories questionable scientific soundness due low reproducibility mainstream hypotheses relations cosesaurus generally agree protorosaur specifically tanystropheid closely related longnecked reptiles macrocnemus tanytrachelos tanystropheus due poor preservation grainy sedimentary rock fossil misinterpreted many paleontologists past first describer specimen paul ellenberger erroneously observed birdlike features could confirmed later studies published several analyses specimen hypothesized ancestor birds hypothesis soon abandoned paleontologists example paul olson briefly discussed specimen description small tanystropheid tanytrachelos found difficulty diagnosing specimen using ellenbergers photographs note shared many similarities tanystropheids tanytrachelos tanystropheus rather ellenbergers hypothesis fell favor late century due growing evidence origin birds among coelurosaurian time comprehensive study cosesaurus since ellenbergers performed josé luis sanz nieves lópezmartínez found barely features ellenberger used link cosesaurus birds valid also studied proportions concluded likely juvenile specimen based hypothesis constructed skeletal diagram showing adult cosesaurus may look like considering proportions reptiles change development sanz lópezmartínez found closest relative cosesaurus probably prolacertid variant ellenbergers hypothesis published researcher dave peters claimed found features specimen resemble ellenberger claimed connected cosesaurus birds however peters instead purported putative features indicated cosesaurus ancestor pterosaurs rather birds however paleontologists examined specimen could find evidence support peters claims noted link cosesaurus pterosaurs relied poorly constructed phylogenetic consensus view explained advocated studies nesbitt ezcurra pterosaurs closely related protorosaurs cosesaurus instead advanced archosaurs closely related dinosaurs peters published followup study used digital tracing algorithm support claims features prepubic bones frilllike skin flaps however method also heavily criticized due reliance photographs literature rather personal observation ct scan doctorate thesis published franco saller although mostly focusing musculoskeletal system macrocnemus bassanii also provided redescription cosesaurus thesis written italian debunked certain features specimen purported ellenberger peters presence sternum two vertebrae sacrum also provided additional implications anatomy biology members specimen estimated length centimeters inches although impressions tip tail faint length may slightly longer due poor preservation specimen definitive features difficult find ellenberger reported webbed feet feather impressions imprinted among bone peters claimed ellenberger instead observed skin remnants patagium actin fibers however claims softtissue dubious paleontologists analyzed specimen explain texture rock surface near bones differentiated rest rock snout moderate length elongated state early theropod dinosaurs like coelophysis short early details skull identified absolute confidence skull particularly eyes proportionally quite large although likely juvenile features domelike skull roof thinnest eyes broadening towards back head numerous small pointed teeth present mouth including estimated six seven long pointed premaxilla teeth back mouth large triangular bladelike compared thinner teeth rest although skull impression crushed small depression front eye conspicuous ellenberger claimed depression perforated snout represented antorbital fenestra peters argued represented series fenestrae close examination saller however showed depressions depth could determined bones surrounded jaw joint possesses features indicate cosesaurus saurian similar modern reptiles lizards dinosaurs crocodilians instead primitive amniote groups araeoscelidians weigeltisaurids features include possession retroarticular process mandible quadrate bone notched behind visible outside however flexibility quadrate therefore potential cranial kinesis neck moderately long length skull half length body formed elongated vertebrae variety archosauromorphs early dinosaurs prolacerta macrocnemus like protorosaurs unlike birds pterosaurs cervicals neck vertebrae attached long thin cervical ribs although neck short compared tanystropheids sanz lópezmartínez saller note necks tanystropheids tend become proportionally longer age therefore short neck cosesaurus tanystropheid standards likely juvenile vertebrae body shorter cervicals long tall dorsal ribs short thin ellenberger supposedly found cosesaurus possessed three fused sacral hip vertebrae peters claimed four present however claims debunked saller although note room three sacral vertebrae hip region cosesaurus also showed two pairs sacral ribs present quality preservation poor make sutures within sacrum support claims ellenberger peters therefore cosesaurus likely possessed two sacral vertebrae similar tail long composed elongated vertebrae first possessed thin ribs gradually decreased ellenberger claimed vertebrae fused rodlike pygostyle lacked haemal spines chevrons later debunked sanz lópezmartínez saller pectoral shoulder girdle one commonly misidentified areas cosesaurus specimen ellenberger claimed birdlike sternum breastplate furcula wishbone present features found sanz lópezmartínez saller elaborated ellenbergers misidentification explained furcula simply pair unfused clavicles reptiles sternum simply rounded lower portion coracoid bones peters also identified ellenbergers sternum coracoids incorrect assuming sternum present regardless saller could find evidence bones existence olson drew connections shoulder girdle forelimbs much smaller hindlimbs still decently sized standards reptiles humerus upper arm bone long straight flat joint surfaces middle slightly thinner tips bone radius ulna bones lower arm similar build hand long five thin fingers third finger longest length combined hand exceeds length lower hip region pelvic girdle poorly preserved ilium perhaps visible portion pelvis unusually elongated olson noted may large curved bones base tail similar heterotopic bones tanytrachelos tanystropheus bones may related reproductive processes however olson explained observations cosesaurus facilitated ellenbergers original grainy photographs new observations made using methods may although peters identified supposed pterosaurlike prepubic bones cosesaurus darren naish could find clear evidence features using peters saller made mention peters claims study hind limbs longer forelimbs trunk whole features may repercussions biology animal leg bones long straight similar build arm bones proximal portion femur thigh bone wider distal portion similar case tanystropheids four five metatarsals main foot bones long straight closely bundled together connected long toes tipped pointed claws fourth toe longest fifth outermost metatarsal much shorter broader acquiring hooked shape according olson fifth toe foot may elongated metatarsallike first phalanx toe bone counteract shrunken fifth feature unique tanystropheids exception olsons suspicions later confirmed saller study ellenberger proposed cosesaurus ancestor modern publication followed description birdlike theropod deinonychus appeared long theropod ancestry birds widely accepted publication ellenberger interpreted following traits fossil straplike scapula furcula wishbone keeled sternum beaklike jaws retroverted pubis tail feathers however every scientific study including cosesaurus since ellenberger found many traits incorrectly identified unlikely related birds studies since ellenberger interpreted cosesaurus prolacertiform protorosaur terms refer particular group reptiles elongated necks prolacerta macrocnemus tanystropheus group undergone much revision internally taxa belong externally belongs reptile family tree prior late century prolacertiforms shuffled around reptilia sources positing ancestors lizards sources include redescribers cosesaurus sanz lópezmartínez however late consensus reached positioned prolacertiforms archosauromorphs meaning closer archosaurs crocodilians dinosaurs rather lepidosaurs lizards however term prolacertiformes fell apart david dilkes determined prolacerta actually close relative prolacertiformes instead crownward revelation caused term prolacertiformes abandoned archosauromorph specialists replaced protorosauria encompasses many reptiles considered close prolacerta cosesaurus retained among protorosaurians although position within group usually tested phylogenetic analyses due fragmentary nature olson suggested lay among tanystropheids group specialized possibly semiaquatic protorosaurs including tanytrachelos interpretation also supported ezcurra et al sanz lópezmartínez identified prolacertid macrocnemus prolacerta although term mainly abandoned similar reasons prolacertiformes macrocnemus classified tanystropheid well tanystropheids occasionally found crownward protorosaurs although extent although sanz lópezmartínez argued closest relative cosesaurus macrocnemus based proportional olson saller placed among advanced members tanystropheidae argued metatarsallike first phalanx fifth toe invalidated connection macrocnemus saller thesis used two different phylogenetic analyses previous authors study relations protorosaurs first analyses dilkes study famously dissolved monophyly however analysis modified include tanystropheids run saller results fairly inconclusive sallers parsimonious trees mpts could agree structure tanystropheids advanced macrocnemus mpts family trees include smallest number steps evolutionary transitions traits gained lost guidelines occams razor mpts accurate depictions evolutionary relationships however sallers six mpts disagreed structure tanystropheidae result found six mpts macrocnemus basal member effort obtain conclusive results saller added unusual drepanosaur megalancosaurus analysis hopes would clarify relations although certain parts analysis made conclusive example structure archosauromorpha close found ezcurra internal structure protorosauria tanystropheidae conclusive analysis performed without megalancosaurus problem spurred saller use second phylogenetic analysis analysis originally created pritchard et al focused tanystropheids analysis found three mpts although structure archosauromorpha inconclusive three mpts agreement structure tanystropheidae one interesting results cosesaurus placed sister taxon
