relation psychology pair association action associating stimulus arbitrary idea object eliciting response usually emotional done repeatedly pairing stimulus arbitrary object example repeatedly pairing images beautiful women bathing suits elicits sexual response men advertising agencies repeatedly pair products attractive women television commercials intention eliciting emotional sexually aroused response consumer causes consumer likely buy product presented similar product without association hippocampal area beyond importance episodic memory part responsible creation storage associations memory especially item furthermore stated gilbert associations created might critical pairedassociative learning studies rats found lesions hippocampus lead objectplace associative learning findings hippocampal damage lead impairments association objectplace gilbert kesner state seen rodents also nonhuman primates humans harv error target help previously learned associations made damage hippocampal area affected impairment gilbert kesner suggested work ability still recall previously stored associations may due modified synapses auto associative network paired association learning defined system learning items words letters numbers symbols etc matched presentation one member pair cue recall learning constitutes basics pairedassociate task tasks divided following visualvisual verbalverbal visualverbal visualvisual members pair visual form eg picture blue circle paired picture yellow triangle verbalverbal members pair verbally presented eg listening word cat followed word hat spoken participant last form visualverbal one member pair spoken loud member presented visual form eg listening word box seeing picture house visual associative learning positive association age school age children visual association ability grows conjunction age younger children made errors older children made paired association task broken basics stimuli response consequence cue association best seen study naya sakai performed one version task monkeys study primate given visualvisual pairedassociate task shown pairs set long delay displayed one picture pair primate correct picture paired monkey showing pictures cueing response given rewards form study shows possible associations occur two previously unrelated items monkeys showed actually remembered shown visual associative learning efficiency participantsubject making connections actually decrease memory load itemsthe higher complexity one keep memory leads poorer performance paired associative learning tasks gluck mercado explain pairedassociation possibly tied encoding rather retrieval study presented gluck et paired associates test studying word pairs participants presented one word pair required recall match noticeable difference accuracy young adult older adults start study pair shown seconds older adults much worse performance recall abilities paled comparison younger adults however change time doubled seconds elderly able much improved performance level accepted understanding associative learning negative regression one ages performance levels regression remains even addressing possible interfering variables attention spatial memory paired association task performed ways performance task either negatively positively affected associations suffer item shared associations double function pairs ab bc harder recall later control pairs ab caplan et state double function pairs create called association ambiguity sharing common member pair leads interference brain difficulty processing pairs point cases one pair remembered expense pair example two word pairs carhorn cardog word pair participant would remember pair primarily forgetting pair memory ambiguous pairs often suffer compared unambiguous pairs situations eg ab bc ab one matter affected cue recall either direction forward cue recall b backward cue b recall either direction affect accuracy also holds true double function pairs additionally ongoing research effects ecstasypolystimulant use pairedassociate tasklearning study gallagher et found used ecstasypolydrugs general false positive responses clicking yes agreement asked word pair previously presented even reality false compared nonusers proposed creating association word pairs requires executive resources known hampered ecstasy users prevented binding word however stated author possible fully attribute deficits task bears noting differences occurring association improved aid production effect finding speaking word loud leads enhancements memory compared reading word production effect limited speaking word aloud mouthing writing whispering spelling typing lead enhanced memory though level reading aloud accordance putnam et enhancement recall production effect reading aloud creates distinctive memory encoding process moreover production effect improved pair recognition also pairedassociate recall findings hint positive link production effect association pairs relation pairedassociate tasklearning using one elements production effect leads improved encoding behaviorists often use paired association tests determine strength verbal behavior particular bf skinners concept verbal response class called httpsenwikipediaorgwikipairbyassociation
