allochiria neurological disorder patient responds stimuli presented one side body stimuli presented opposite associated spatial transpositions usually symmetrical stimuli one side body space opposite one thus touch left side body reported touch right side also known somatosensory auditory visual senses affected sounds persons voice instance reported heard opposite side occur objects presented visually reported presented opposite side often patients may express allochiria drawing copying image allochiria often cooccurs unilateral neglect like hemispatial neglect disorder arises commonly damage right parietal allochiria often confused alloesthesia also known false true allochiria symptom dyschiria unilateral dyschiria disorder localization sensation due various degrees dissociation cause impairment one side causing inability tell side body touched term greek meaning allochiria observed mainly context neglect usually due lesion affects right parietal patients allochiria sensibility retained completely patient clear side body touched power localization retained error exists side touched often refer irritation corresponding part patients mind doubt error side body touchedcitation needed multiple definitions allochiria according musser allochiria reference sensory stimulus corresponding location opposite location opposite side judson bury says patient may refer impression one side corresponding place opposite side thus patient pricked one limb may say feels overall even though different authors definition differs points type stimulus symmetry site stimulus seat localization agree essential feature allochiria deflection sensation wrong side body true allochiria none definitions stress laid state patients knowledge right left side symptoms seen error localizationcitation needed obsersteiner laid stress allochiria defect vertical localization merely confusion patients mind opposite sides body come look upon symptom simply form bad mistake patients mind doubt error side touched sensibility including power localization otherwise retained allochiria described occurring nerve lesions hemiplegia disseminated sclerosis multiple sclerosis tabes dorsalis unilateral injury spinal cord ménières disease hysteria symmetrical connection touch pain muscle sense temperature sense sight smell taste hearing electrical allochiria occur relation every segment body cases allochiria may bilateral others may restricted certain regions body even one part body allochiria marked connections variety senses sometimes certain kinds stimuli arouse appropriate feeling one seen cross electrical reflexes muscle stimulated electromotor allochiria observed face lower limbs upper cases stimulus presented affected side caused contraction opposite facial muscles current weak healthy facial react another example pressure one forearm caused movement opposite forearm central fact electrical stimulus may manifest effect distant part nervous system distant part may side body opposite side naturally often opposite side representation corresponding limbs spinal cord nearer homolateral nothing confusion two sides occurs patients mind allochiria presentcitation needed patient asked carry movement effect side corresponding part opposite side fully impression correctly performed required patients reflex allochiria respond stimulation sole foot inner part thigh evoked corresponding reflex opposite side cases auditory allochiria observations recorded tuning fork held constantly one ear patient responded series symptoms including pain deafness opposite visual allochiria objects situated one side visual field perceived contralateral visual one two cases ever recorded visual impression received right open eye regularly referred left eye patient maintained perceived impression left eye fact shut case colored object held front left eye recognized patient maintained saw color right case gustatory allochiria substance placed one side tongue said tasted opposite side also touches side tongue also referred opposite side type allochiria difficult see one case dissociate reference taste alloesthesia greek állos aisthesis perception also known false allochiria many dictionaries list definition allochiria even give greek lexical roots term allesthesia introduced grainger stewart article published british medical journal cases stewart found mainly related sensation observed consistent horizontal movement alloesthesia case mistaken incomplete perception stimulus maybe accompanied failures perception defective casestudy condition incorrectly described allochiria stimulus applied inside cheek referred outside another case touch index finger referred thumb false allochiria may occur bilateral affections nerves multiple neuritis although case yet recorded still clear condition related needed dyschiria failure determine correct side specific failure quite independent failure regards perception stimulus words patient may recognize every single feature concerning single precise nature position one point side evidence goes show present mental defect specific feeling dyschiria many forms include achiria allochiria achiria referred simple allochiria term proposed show failure regard feelings sidedness handedness achiria sensory motor introspective components sensory achiria stimulus applied affected part arouses feeling sidedness stimulus presented side body person disorder notion motor component patient asked carry movement limb question unable unless indicated way use words right left reason lost knowledge meaning words either altogether events applied limbs concerned introspective component patient loses memory feeling part body stimulus presented declares though knows part feel allochiria stimuli presented one side constantly referred corresponding point opposite side allochiria sensory motor introspective manifestations sensory cases point referred opposite side corresponds exactly symmetrical point touched fact disposes view allochiria way merely disturbance localization cases motor allochiria patient asked carry movement effect side corresponding part opposite side fully impression correctly performed required movement introspective cases patient appreciate given feeling sidedness opposite limb moved form dyschiria stimulus applied one side body felt sides synchiria sensory motor introspective signs sensory component refers stimulus applied affected part evokes two simultaneous sensations referred corresponding points sides body motor symptom patient asked carry movement affected side sides though gets feeling sidedness affected part introspective component shows patient unable appreciate affected feeling sidedness alone apart simultaneously appreciated feeling corresponding opposite side though appreciate moves limbs together impression moving affected many cases patients shown symptoms allochiria allochiria constructional tasks commonly seen neglect patients transpose elements left side right side fail see fix mistakes cases patients shown allochiria copying drawing clocks memory defect mental representations may lead patients transpose elements ipsilesional side drawing drawing memory tasks patients allochiria tendency place hours right half clock different kinds spatial transpositions exist drawing tasks patients figure shows example allochiria clock drawing patient hemispatial neglect patient omitted left side objects drawing clock even though patient could verbally express clock face left side would fail notice drawing incomplete implies drawing tasks play important role differentiating specific impairment brain lesion saying patient diagnosing allochiria important consider sensory motor aspects problem absence knowledge number ways various symptoms may overlooked misinterpreted condition goes frequently unrecognized one rare example medicine causes wrong diagnosis allochiria due unawareness simple facts failure judgment evident details sensory symptoms get overlooked testing patients localizing capacity observer neglects inquire expressly side sensation referred evident patients allochiria show fault sensorial perception localization however even patient mentions wrong side sometimes regarded slip tongue matter may pursued looking motor aspect allochiria symptoms described misleading way symptoms less obvious unless motor manifestations carefully analyzed may interpreted clumsiness moreover patients complained weakness awkwardness right apparently confirmed truth statement defect marked acts consciously performed present relation acts patient says tell side certain stimulus allochiria confirmed provided sensibility allochiria represents affection occurrence form allochiria regarded positive indication presence hysteria recognition allochiria may throw light upon number symptoms would otherwise misinterpreted paresis aboulia defective sensibility enables correct analysis made precise defects present serve guide toward original focus whole affection proving important step exact psychological diagnosis essential preliminary scientific treatment multiple theories explain outcome allochiria current widely accepted explanation allochiria hammonds theory assumes almost complete decussation sensory fibers within grey matter concludes lesion one posterior side would reach center corresponding hemisphere thus sensation referred hemisphere opposite side hammond goes say another unilateral lesion supervened different level first sensation previously deflected wrong hemisphere redirected meeting another obstacle arrived proper hemisphere allochiria occurs equally unilateral bilateral lesions long asymmetrical another theory hubers theory assumes appearance new lesion opposite side block redirecting impulse towards original disappearance symptoms due lesion track httpsenwikipediaorgwikiallochiria
