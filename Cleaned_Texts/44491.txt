corynebacterium diphtheriaea pathogenic bacterium causes also known bacillus discovered german bacteriologists edwin klebs friedrich löffler bacteria usually harmless unless infected bacteriophage carries gene gives rise toxin causes diphtheria caused adhesion infiltration bacteria mucosal layers body primarily affecting respiratory tract subsequent release toxin localized effect skin lesions well metastatic proteolytic effects organ systems severe originally major cause childhood mortality diphtheria almost entirely eradicated due vigorous administration diphtheria vaccination diphtheria longer transmitted frequently due development vaccine dtap although diphtheria outbreaks continue occur often developing countries majority population four subspecies recognized c mitis c intermedius c gravis c belfanti four subspecies differ slightly colonial morphology biochemical properties ability metabolize certain nutrients may toxigenic therefore cause diphtheria toxigenic strain subtyping involves comparing species bacteria categorizing strain subtyping also helps identifying origin certain bacterias outbreak however comes subtyping c diphtheriae lot useful accurate classification due lack publicly available resources identify strains therefore finding origin c diphtheriae produces diphtheria toxin alters protein function host inactivating elongation factor causes pharyngitis pseudomembrane throat strains toxigenic ones infected diphtheria toxin gene encoded bacteriophage found toxigenic strains integrated bacterial diphtheria toxin repressor mainly controlled iron serves essential cofactor activation target dna binding low concentration iron required medium toxin production high iron concentrations iron molecules bind aporepressor beta bacteriophage carries tox gene bound iron aporepressor shuts toxin eleks test toxigenicity used determine whether organism able produce diphtheria identify c diphtheriae gram stain performed show grampositive highly pleomorphic organisms often looking like chinese letters stains like alberts stain ponders stain used demonstrate metachromatic granules formed polar regions granules called polar granules babes ernst granules volutin granules enrichment medium löfflers medium used preferentially grow c diphtheriae differential plate known tellurite agar allows corynebacteria including c diphtheriae reduce tellurite metallic tellurium tellurite reduction colorimetrically indicated brown colonies cornyebacterium species black halo around c diphtheriae colonies organism produces catalase urease differentiates corynebacterium ulcerans c diphtheriae produce pyrazinamidase differentiates corynebacterium striatum corynebacterium corynebacterium diphtheriae bacterium causes disease called diphtheria bacteriophages introduce gene bacterial cells makes strain toxigenic strains infected viruses c diphtheriae rodshaped grampositive nonsporeforming nonmotile c diphtheriae shown exclusively infect humans believed humans may reservoir pathogen however extremely rare cases c diphtheriae found animals infections toxigenic two dogs two disease occurs primarily tropical regions developing countries immunocompromised individuals poorly immunized adults unvaccinated children greatest risk contracting diphtheria mode transmission persontoperson contact via respiratory droplets ie coughing sneezing less commonly could also passed touching open sores contaminated surfaces typical course disease body region commonly affected upper respiratory system thick gray coating accumulates nasopharyngeal region making breathing swallowing difficult disease remains contagious least two weeks following disappearance symptoms known last common routes entry c diphtheriae nose tonsils throat individuals suffering disease may experience sore throat weakness fever swollen glands could cause even dangerous symptoms shortness left untreated diphtheria toxin may enter bloodstream causing damage kidneys nerves heart extremely rare complications include suffocation partial paralysis vaccine dtap effectively prevents disease mandatory united states participation public education professions exceptions first step c diphtheriae infection involves toxigenic bacteria colonizing mucosal layer young children typically occurs upper respiratory tract mucosa adults infection limited mostly tonsillar region unusual sites infection include heart larynx trachea bronchi anterior areas mouth including buccal mucosa lips tongue hard soft bacteria number virulence factors help localize areas respiratory tract many yet fully understood diphtheria affect many model hosts mice one common virulence factor studied vitro multifunctional protein shown role bacterial adhesion host cells fibrogenbinding qualities experiments mutant strains c diphtheriae adhesion epithelial infiltration decreased significantly ability bind extracellular matrices aids bacteria avoiding detection bodys immune diphtheritic lesion often covered pseudomembrane composed fibrin bacterial cells inflammatory cells diphtheria toxin proteolytically cleaved two fragments nterminal fragment catalytic domain fragment b transmembrane receptor binding domain fragment catalyzes nad dependent adpribosylation elongation factor thereby inhibiting protein synthesis eukaryotic cells fragment b binds cell surface receptor facilitates delivery fragment bacteria localized one area start multiplying create inflammatory pseudomembrane individuals faucial diphtheria typically pseudomembrane grow tonsil accessory structures uvula soft palate possibly nasopharyngeal area upper respiratory tract diphtheria pseudomembrane grow pharynx larynx trachea bronchibronchioles pseudomembrane starts white color later becomes dirtygray tough due necrotic pseudomembrane formation trachea bronchi decrease efficiency airflow time diffusion rate alveoli decreases due lower airflow decreases partial pressure oxygen systemic circulation cause

united states participation public education professions exceptions apply invention toxoid vaccine provides protection corynebacterium diphtheriae caused dramatic shift bacteriums rate infection united states even though vaccine first made early become widely available early according national health nutrition examination survey nhanes percent persons age years immune diphtheria due wide use vaccine united diagnosis respiratory c diphtheriae made based presentation clinically whereas nonrespiratory diphtheria may clinically suspected therefore laboratory testing reliant culturing accurate kind testing confirm deny prevalence diphtheria toxins testing done swabbing possibly infected area well lesions toxigenic strain corynebacterium diphtheriae infects human body releases harmful toxins especially throat antitoxins used prevent harm antibiotics also used fight infection typical antibiotics used diphtheria involve penicillin erythromycin people infected diphtheria must quarantine least hours prescribed antibiotics confirm person longer contagious tests performed ensure bacteria cleared people vaccinated prevent transmission wideuse diphtheria vaccine dramatically decreased rate infection allows primary prevention disease people receive vaccine consist protection diphtheria tetanus pertussis commonly knowns dtap tdap vaccine dtap vaccine children tdap vaccine known adolescents united states dtap vaccine parents infants typically involves series five shots recommended vaccines injected arm thigh administered infant months months months months years possible side events associated diphtheria vaccine include mild fever fussiness drowsiness tenderness injection site although rare dtap vaccine may cause allergic reaction causes hives rash breakout within minutes
