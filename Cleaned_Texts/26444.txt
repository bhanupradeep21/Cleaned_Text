morphogenesis greek morphê shape genesis creation literally generation form biological process causes cell tissue organism develop shape one three fundamental aspects developmental biology along control tissue growth patterning cellular differentiation process controls organized spatial distribution cells embryonic development organism morphogenesis take place also mature organism normal maintenance tissue stem cells regeneration tissues damage cancer example highly abnormal pathological tissue morphogenesis morphogenesis also describes development unicellular life forms embryonic
