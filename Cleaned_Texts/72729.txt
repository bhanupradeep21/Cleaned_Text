ventilator type breathing apparatus class medical technology provides mechanical ventilation moving breathable air lungs deliver breaths patient physically unable breathe breathing insufficiently ventilators may computerized microprocessorcontrolled machines patients also ventilated simple handoperated bag valve mask ventilators chiefly used intensivecare medicine home care emergency medicine standalone units anesthesiology component anesthesia machine ventilators sometimes called respirators term commonly used particularly bird respirator however contemporary medical terminology uses word respirator refer facemask protects wearers hazardous airborne simplest form modern positive pressure ventilator consists compressible air reservoir turbine air oxygen supplies set valves tubes disposable reusable patient circuit air reservoir pneumatically compressed several times minute deliver roomair cases airoxygen mixture patient turbine used turbine pushes air ventilator flow valve adjusting pressure meet patientspecific parameters pressure released patient exhale passively due lungs elasticity exhaled air released usually oneway valve within patient circuit called patient manifold ventilators may also equipped monitoring alarm systems patientrelated parameters eg pressure volume flow ventilator function eg air leakage power failure mechanical failure backup batteries oxygen tanks remote control pneumatic system nowadays often replaced computercontrolled turbopump modern ventilators electronically controlled small embedded system allow exact adaptation pressure flow characteristics individual patients needs finetuned ventilator settings also serve make ventilation tolerable comfortable patient canada united states respiratory therapists responsible tuning

yet lightweight plastic tubes separated function eg inhaled air patient pressure exhaled air determined type ventilation needed patientend circuit may either noninvasive invasive noninvasive methods continuous positive airway pressure cpap noninvasive ventilation adequate patients require ventilator sleeping resting mainly employ nasal mask invasive methods require intubation longterm ventilator dependence normally tracheotomy cannula much comfortable practical longterm care larynx nasal intubation failure may result death mechanical ventilation systems classified lifecritical systems precautions must taken ensure highly reliable including power supply ventilatory failure inability sustain sufficient rate elimination maintain stable ph without mechanical assistance muscle fatigue intolerable mechanical ventilators therefore carefully designed single point failure endanger patient may manual backup mechanisms enable handdriven respiration absence power mechanical ventilator

backup batteries provide ventilation case power failure defective gas supplies methods operate call help mechanisms software power failures natural disaster create lifethreatening emergency people using ventilators home care battery power may sufficient brief loss electricity longer power outages may require going history mechanical ventilation begins various versions eventually called iron
