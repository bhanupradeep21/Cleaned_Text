dysmetria english wrong length lack coordination movement typified undershoot overshoot intended position hand arm leg eye type ataxia also include inability judge distance hypermetria hypometria respectively overshooting undershooting intended dysmetria often found individuals multiple sclerosis ms amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als persons tumors strokes persons diagnosed autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia scas also exhibit many types scas though many exhibit similar symptoms one dysmetria considered friedreichs ataxia wellknown sca children cerebellar malformations extending brainstem also present actual cause dysmetria thought caused lesions cerebellum lesions proprioceptive nerves lead cerebellum coordinate visual spatial sensory information motor damage proprioceptive nerves allow cerebellum accurately judge hand arm leg eye move lesions often caused strokes multiple sclerosis ms amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als tumorscitation needed according research article cited motor control learning process utilizes disruption appgs possibly cause ataxia dysmetria upon identification motor primitives clinicians may able isolate specific areas responsible cerebellar two types cerebellar disorders produce dysmetria specifically midline cerebellar syndromes hemispheric cerebellar syndromes midline cerebellar syndromes cause ocular dysmetria condition eyes track object properly either overshoot ahead object undershoot lagging behind object ocular dysmetria also makes difficult maintain fixation stationary object hemispheric cerebellar syndromes cause dysmetria typical motor sense many think hearing term dysmetriacitation needed common motor syndrome causes dysmetria cerebellar motor syndrome also marked impairments gait also known ataxia disordered eye movements tremor difficulty swallowing poor stated cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome ccas also causes dysmetria cerebellum area brain contributes coordination motor processes anatomically inferior sensorimotor integration brains way integrating information received sensory proprioceptive neurons body including visual information specific information needed perform motor task comes retinal information pertaining eyes position translated spatial information sensorimotor integration crucial performing motor task takes place post parietal visual information translated spatial information cerebellum must use information perform motor damage pathways connect pathways dysmetria may resultcitation needed motor dysmetria customary term used person refers dysmetria dysmetria extremities caused hemispheric syndromes manifested multiple ways dysrhythmic tapping hands feet dysdiadochokinesis impairment alternating damage cerebellum makes person slow orient extremities motor control learning process recent research also shed light upon specific process interrupted may cause ataxia dysmetria according sources cited article motor control learning process

inertia used increase dysmetria confirm diagnosis cerebellar dysfunction patients also show abnormal response changes damping findings confirm role cerebellum currently cure dysmetria actually symptom underlying disorder however isoniazid clonazepam used treat dysmetria frenkel exercises treat dysmetriacitation needed researchers testing different possibilities treating dysmetria ataxia one opportunity treatment called rehearsal eye believed visually guided movements require lower higherorder visual functioning first identifying target location moving acquire sought one study researchers
