deleterious alleles allowed hitchhike beneficial neighbors thus propagating maladapted alleles next generation conversely advantageous alleles may selected surrounded harmful alleles background selection due inability sort gene content chromosome particularly prone accumulation junk dna massive accumulations retrotransposable elements scattered throughout random insertion dna segments often

passed next generation population size chromosome inherently limited autosomes diploid organisms contain two copies autosomal chromosomes half population contains chromosome thus genetic drift exceptionally strong force acting upon chromosome sheer random assortment adult male may never pass chromosome female offspring thus although male may well adapted chromosome free excessive mutation
