weakness symptom many different medical causes many divided conditions true perceived muscle weakness true muscle weakness primary symptom variety skeletal muscle diseases including muscular dystrophy inflammatory myopathy occurs neuromuscular junction disorders myasthenia graviscitation needed muscle cells work detecting flow electrical impulses brain signals contract release calcium sarcoplasmic reticulum fatigue reduced ability generate force may occur due nerve within muscle cells new research scientists columbia university suggests muscle fatigue caused calcium leaking muscle cell makes less calcium available muscle cell addition columbia researchers propose enzyme activated released calcium eats away muscle substrates within muscle generally serve power muscular contractions include molecules adenosine triphosphate atp glycogen creatine phosphate atp binds myosin head causes ratchetting results contraction according sliding filament model creatine phosphate stores energy atp rapidly regenerated within muscle cells adenosine diphosphate adp inorganic phosphate ions allowing sustained powerful contractions last seconds glycogen intramuscular storage form glucose used generate energy quickly intramuscular creatine stores exhausted producing lactic acid metabolic byproduct contrary common belief lactic acid accumulation doesnt actually cause burning sensation felt people exhaust oxygen oxidative metabolism actuality lactic acid presence oxygen recycles produce pyruvate liver known cori cyclecitation needed substrates produce metabolic fatigue depleted exercise resulting lack intracellular energy sources fuel contractions essence muscle stops contracting lacks energy socitation needed conditions myasthenia gravis muscle strength normal resting true weakness occurs muscle subjected exercise also true cases chronic fatigue syndrome objective postexertion muscle weakness delayed recovery time measured feature published asthenia greek ἀσθένεια lit lack strength also disease medical term referring condition body lacks lost strength either whole parts poorly defined condition include true primary muscle weakness perceived muscle perceived muscle weakness asthenia described feeling weak tired muscles absence muscle weakness muscle generate normal amount force perceived requiring general asthenia occurs many chronic wasting diseases tuberculosis cancer sleep disorders chronic disorders heart lungs kidneys probably marked diseases adrenal gland asthenia may limited certain organs systems organs asthenopia characterized ready fatiguability asthenia also side effect medications treatments ritonavir protease inhibitor used hiv treatment differentiating psychogenic perceived asthenia true asthenia myasthenia often difficult time apparent psychogenic asthenia accompanying many chronic disorders seen progress primary weaknesscitation needed myasthenia greek μυο meaning muscle asthenia ἀσθένεια meaning weakness simply muscle weakness lack muscle strength causes many divided conditions either true perceived muscle weakness true muscle weakness primary symptom variety skeletal muscle diseases including muscular dystrophy inflammatory myopathy occurs neuromuscular diseases myasthenia gravis perceived muscle weakness occurs diseases chronic fatigue syndrome sleep disorders muscle fatigue central neuromuscular peripheral muscular central muscle fatigue manifests overall sense energy deprivation peripheral muscle weakness manifests local musclespecific inability neuromuscular fatigue either central peripheralcitation needed central fatigue generally described terms reduction neural drive nervebased motor command working muscles results decline force suggested reduced neural drive exercise may protective mechanism prevent organ failure work continued exact mechanisms central fatigue unknown though considerable interest role serotonergic nerves control contraction muscles determining number sequence force muscular contraction nerve experiences synaptic fatigue becomes unable stimulate muscle innervates movements require force far muscle could potentially generate barring pathology neuromuscular fatigue seldom issuecitation needed extremely powerful contractions close upper limit muscles ability generate force neuromuscular fatigue become limiting factor untrained individuals novice strength trainers muscles ability generate force strongly limited nerves ability sustain highfrequency signal extended period maximum contraction nerves signal reduces frequency force generated contraction diminishes sensation pain discomfort muscle appears simply stop listening gradually cease move often lengthening insufficient stress muscles tendons often delayed onset muscle soreness following workout part process strength training increasing nerves ability generate sustained high frequency signals allow muscle contract greatest force neural training causes several weeks worth rapid gains strength level nerve generating maximum contractions muscle reaches physiological limit past point training effects increase muscular strength myofibrillar sarcoplasmic hypertrophy metabolic fatigue becomes factor limiting contractile force peripheral muscle fatigue physical work consideredby inability body supply sufficient energy metabolites contracting muscles meet increased energy demand common case physical nationalwhere average adults work force causes contractile dysfunction manifests eventual reduction lack ability single muscle local group muscles work insufficiency energy ie suboptimal aerobic metabolism generally results accumulation lactic acid acidic anaerobic metabolic byproducts muscle causing stereotypical burning sensation local muscle fatigue though recent studies indicated otherwise actually finding lactic acid source fundamental difference peripheral central theories muscle fatigue peripheral model muscle fatigue assumes failure one sites chain initiates muscle contraction peripheral regulation therefore depends localized metabolic chemical conditions local muscle affected whereas central model muscle fatigue integrated mechanism works preserve integrity system initiating muscle fatigue muscle derecruitment based collective feedback periphery cellular organ failure occurs therefore feedback read central regulator could include chemical mechanical well cognitive cues significance factors depend nature fatigueinducing work performedcitation needed though universally used metabolic fatigue common alternative term peripheral muscle weakness reduction contractile force due direct indirect effects reduction substrates accumulation metabolites within myocytes occur simple lack energy fuel contraction interference ability
