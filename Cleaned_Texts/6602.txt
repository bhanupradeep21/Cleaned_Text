alcoholrelated brain alters structure function brain result direct neurotoxic effects alcohol intoxication acute alcohol withdrawal increased alcohol intake associated damage brain regions including frontal limbic system widespread cerebral atrophy brain shrinkage caused neuron degeneration damage seen neuroimaging frontal lobe damage becomes prominent alcoholics age lead impaired neuropsychological performance areas problem solving good judgement goaldirected impaired emotional processing results damage limbic system may lead troubles recognizing emotional facial expressions interpreting nonverbal emotional binge drinking heavy episodic drinking lead damage limbic system occurs relatively short period time brain damage increases risk alcoholrelated dementia abnormalities mood cognitive abilities binge drinkers also increased risk developing chronic alcoholism alcoholism chronic relapsing disorder include extended periods abstinence followed relapse heavy drinking also associated many health problems including memory disorders high blood pressure muscle weakness heart problems anaemia low immune function liver disease disorders digestive system pancreatic problems also correlated depression unemployment family problems increased risk domestic abuse gender parental history alcoholism binge drinking influence susceptibility alcohol dependence higher levels typically seen males family nearly half american alcoholics exhibit neuropsychological disabilities range mild approximately two million requiring lifelong care developing permanent debilitating conditions prolonged alcohol abstinence lead improvement disabilities mild impairments improvement seen within year take much longer higher severity impulsivity sensation seeking seen adolescence may lead increased alcohol intake frequent binge drinking episodes leaving adolescents particularly risk alcoholism still developing brain adolescents vulnerable damaging neurotoxic neurodegenerative effects high impulsivity also found families alcoholism suggestive genetic link thus genetics impulsivity overlaps genetic risks alcohol use disorder possibly alcohol also genetic risk proinflammatory cytokine mediated alcoholrelated brain damage evidence variants genes involved contributing brain damage also impulsivity alcohol abuse three genetic traits contribute heavily alcohol use alcoholics typically divided two categories uncomplicated uncomplicated alcoholics nutritional deficiency states liver disease reduction overall brain volume due white matter cerebral atrophy severity atrophy
