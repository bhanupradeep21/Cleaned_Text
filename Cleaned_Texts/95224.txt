zeitgeber ˈtsaɪtˌɡeɪbər external environmental cue entrains synchronizes organisms biological rhythms usually naturally occurring serving entrain earths lightdark term zeitgeber german ˈtsaɪtˌɡeːbɐ lit time giver first used jürgen aschoff one founders field chronobiology work demonstrated existence endogenous internal biological clocks synchronize biological rhythms addition found certain exogenous external cues called zeitgeber influence timing internal clocks biological process body repeats period approximately hours maintains rhythm absence external stimuli considered circadian believed brains suprachiasmatic nucleus scn internal pacemaker responsible regulating bodys biological rhythms influenced combination internal external maintain clockenvironment synchrony zeitgebers induce changes concentrations molecular components clock levels consistent appropriate stage cycle process termed early research circadian rhythms suggested people preferred day closer hours isolated external stimuli like daylight timekeeping however research faulty failed shield participants artificial light although subjects shielded time cues like clocks daylight researchers aware phasedelaying effects indoor electric subjects allowed turn light awake turn wanted sleep electric light evening delayed circadian phase results became well recent research shown adults builtin day averages hours indoor lighting affect circadian rhythms people attain bestquality sleep chronotypedetermined sleep periods study czeisler et al harvard found range normal healthy adults ages quite hours minutes minutes clock resets daily cycle earths biological rhythms including cycles related sleep wakefulness mood cognitive performance synchronized bodys internal circadian best way observe workings clock experimentally deprive individuals external cues like light social interaction allow body experience freerunning environment one zeitgebers influence bodys circumstances circadian clock alone modulates bodys biological normally however external cues like lightdark cycles social interactions also exert influence bodys rhythms zeitgebers alerting individuals changes likelihood possible rewards threats environment example humans likely find food shelter daytime less likely detect predators nighttime meaning wakefulness tends fruitful day sleep safest activity therefore changes light darkness influence body rise day become fatigued night many different zeitgebers relative influence individual given time depends number factors including presence operation kinds zeitgebers example jürgen aschoff showed individuals compensate absence zeitgebers like natural light attending social zeitgebers instead specifically individuals placed total darkness four days differ variety measures including body temperature various psychomotor tasks like time estimation finger tapping individuals placed artificial lightdark environment groups given strict time researchers concluded social zeitgebers like meal times interactions people entrain biological rhythms ways similar common zeitgebers like light since internal clock sets using zeitgebers loss disruption individuals usual zeitgebers disorienting individual experiences significant changes zeitgebers irregularly scheduled night shift changes variety negative effects one example phenomenon jetlag traveling another time zone causes desynchronization sleepwake cycles appetite emotions zeitgeber disruptions also lead decreased cognitive performance negative mood cases episodes mental illness researchers shown circadian clock also influences cognitive performance wide variety paradigms including serial search verbal reasoning working memory tasks suppressing wrong answers manual performance tasks varies course day type task unique daily rhythm example best time perform working memory task tends midday immediate memory best morning simple processing ideally performed addition individual differences among participants effect daily rhythms performance studies found children perform mental math exercises successfully young adults performance peaks variation performance various tasks attributable number factors including relative working memory load change strategy hemispheric dominance ability suppress wrong answers age level practice morningnesseveningness many fluctuate according time based findings researchers conclude factors disturb circadian rhythms also affect cognitive performance disturbances zeitgebers exert negative influence emotion mood well cognitive disturbance biological rhythms zeitgebers theorized increase risk forms psychopathology strong evidence individuals depression experience irregular biological rhythms including disrupted sleepwake cycles temperature cortisol findings support theory first proposed ehlers frank kupfer says stressful life events lead depressive episodes disrupting social biological rhythms leading negative symptoms like sleep disturbance trigger depression vulnerable recent work also demonstrated interventions like light therapy sleep deprivation pharmacological antidepressants may effective treating depression reordering rhythms natural interventions influence individuals mood body temperature cortisol levels melatonin production appear irregular depressed individuals researchers suggested disturbances biological rhythms present depressed individuals may actually result previous disruptions social interactions serve cues possibility may help explain relationship stressful life events development mood disorders example newly married cohabiting couples often need adjust others sleeping rhythms beginning share bed first time adjustment difficult may lead disruptions sleep quality quantity possibly increase risk depression result researchers attempted explore effect life events disturb social rhythms might depressive symptoms number ways number studies looked whether loss spouse significant negative life event often associated increased depressive symptoms might lead increased depression via disrupted social rhythms addition grief bereaved spouses may also dealing changes numerous social zeitgebers instance bereaved spouses may suddenly faced changes meal times responsibilities additional chores social expectations simply reality living day day without ones usual conversational partner taken together findings studies bereaved spouses indicate bereavement associated changes social rhythms depressive symptoms likely increase however bereaved individuals able maintain social rhythms death spouse increased depression less findings suggest social rhythm stability may entirely dependent life events rather traitlike elements well since individuals may likely maintain social rhythms others following occurrence significant life event recent studies also found connection disruption social rhythms triggering manic episodes bipolar differentiating zeitgeber disturbances lead depression lead manic episodes proven difficult however unipolar bipolar depression concept social zeitgebers potential risk factors influenced development interventions address risk bipolar disorder interpersonal social rhythm therapy ipsrt meant regulate normalize individuals social rhythms including meal times personal relationships exercise social demands regulating social rhythms therapists hope normalize turn individuals biological rhythms studies found much evidence ipsrt improves mood individuals undergoing ipsrt experience longer periods bipolar episodes indicating normalizing social rhythms may preventative seasonal affective disorder may occur result deficiencies zeitgebers light winter months stimulate reward activation system resulting depressed mood studies pointed hormone melatonin regulated circadian rhythms possible circadian clocks synchronize human sleepwake cycles coincide periods day reward potential highest recent studies determined daily rhythms reward activation humans modulated circadian clocks external influences rhythms may influence individuals mood httpsenwikipediaorgwikizeitgeber
