mechanism genetic structure viruses salvador luria also showed bacterial resistance viruses phages genetically inherited luria born salvatore luria turin italy influential italian sephardi jewish

delbrücks theories gene molecule began formulate methods testing genetic theory bacteriophages viruses infect bacteria received fellowship study united states intended work delbrück soon luria received award benito mussolinis fascist regime banned jews academic research fellowships without funding sources work us italy luria left home country paris france nazi german armies invaded france luria fled bicycle marseille received immigration visa united states luria arrived new york city september soon changed first middle names help physicist enrico fermi knew time university rome luria received rockefeller foundation fellowship columbia university soon met delbrück hershey collaborated experiments cold spring harbor laboratory delbrücks lab vanderbilt famous experiment delbrück known experiment demonstrated statistically inheritance bacteria must follow darwinian rather lamarckian principles mutant bacteria occurring randomly still bestow viral resistance without virus present idea natural selection affects bacteria profound consequences example explains bacteria develop antibiotic resistance luria latarjet published quantitative analysis effect ultraviolet irradiation bacteriophage multiplication intracellular early course infection found increase bacteriophage resistance ultraviolet irradiation later decrease time pattern known lurialaterjet effect published little known central role dna biology later work established multiple specific dna repair pathways encoded infecting bacteriophage contribute increase uv resistance early worked indiana university first graduate student james watson went discover structure dna francis crick january luria became naturalized citizen united states luria moved university illinois early luria giuseppe bertani discovered phenomenon hostcontrolled restriction modification bacterial virus culture e coli significantly reduce production phages grown strains however phage become established strain also become restricted ability grow later discovered researchers bacteria produce enzymes cut viral dna particular sequences bacterias dna protected methylation enzymes became known restriction enzymes developed one main molecular tools molecular luria nobel prize physiology medicine max delbrück alfred hershey discoveries replication mechanism genetic structure became chair microbiology massachusetts institute technology mit mit switched research focus phages cell membranes bacteriocinscitation needed sabbatical study institut pasteur paris found bacteriocins impair function cell

luria outspoken political joined linus pauling protest nuclear weapon testing luria opponent vietnam war supporter organized labor involved debates genetic engineering advocating compromise position moderate oversight regulation rather extremes complete ban full scientific freedom due political involvement blacklisted receiving funding national institutes health short time friend noted linguist political activist noam chomsky communicated jewish american writer elie wiesel letter criticized israels involvement guatemalan genocide satirically wiesels silence issue concerning israels alleged terrorist activities worldwide chomsky would later describe salvador luria friend mine nobel laureate biology politically active knew ie genocide wasnt big secret asked collect articles hebrew press described israels participation genocidal attacks guatemala participation leadership role wanted send elie wiesel polite letter saying fellow nobel laureate would like bring attention could use
