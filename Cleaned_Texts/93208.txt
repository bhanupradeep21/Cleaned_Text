behavioral momentum theory quantitative analysis behavior behavioral metaphor based physical momentum describes general relation resistance change persistence behavior rate reinforcement obtained given situation b f skinner proposed behavior based fundamental unit behavior called discriminated operant discriminated operant also known threeterm contingency three components antecedent discriminative stimulus response reinforcing punishing consequence organism responds presence stimulus past responses presence stimulus produced reinforcement according behavioral momentum theory two separable factors independently govern rate discriminated operant occurs persistence response face disruptions punishment extinction differential reinforcement alternative behaviors see nevin grace review first positive contingency response reinforcing consequence controls response rates ie relation shaping particular pattern responding governed relative law effect ie matching law herrnstein secondly pavlovian relation surrounding context stimuli rate magnitude reinforcement obtained context ie relation governs resistance behavior operations extinction resistance change assessed measuring responding operations extinction satiation tend disrupt behavior comparing measurements stable predisruption response rates resistance disruption considered better measure response strength simple measure response ratenevin variations reinforcement contingencies differentialreinforcementofhigh lowresponserate schedules yield highly variable response rates even though overall reinforcement rates equal thus questionable whether differences response rates indicate differences underlying strength response see morse discussion according behavioral momentum theory relation response rate resistance change analogous relation velocity mass moving object according newtons second law motion nevin mandell atak newtons second law states change velocity object force applied directly related force inversely related objects mass similarly behavioral momentum theory states change response rate conditions disruption bx relative baseline response rate bo directly related force magnitude disruption f inversely related rate reinforcement stimulus context r free parameter b indicates sensitivity resistance change rate reinforcement stimulus context ie relation resistance disruption typically assessed two distinctive discriminative stimulus contexts alternate signal different schedules reinforcement ie multiple schedule equation rewritten account resistance change across two stimulus contexts nevin nevin grace mclean disrupter uniformly applied across contexts ie subscripts indicate different stimulus contexts thus equation states relative resistance change power function relative rate reinforcement across stimulus contexts parameter indicating sensitivity relative reinforcement rate consistent behavioral momentum theory resistance disruption often found greater stimulus contexts signal higher rates magnitudes reinforcement see nevin review studies add responseindependent ie free reinforcement one stimulus context strongly support theory changes response strength

concurrently available responses different rates reinforcement arranged within context responses eg bell williams resistance disruption across stimulus contexts analogous inertial mass moving object behavioral momentum theory also suggests preference concurrentchains procedures one stimulus context another analogous gravitational attraction two bodies see nevin grace concurrentchains procedures responding concurrently available initial links provides access one two mutually exclusive stimulus contexts called terminal links multiple schedules independent schedules reinforcement function
