dosage index mathematical figure used breeders thoroughbred race horses sometimes bettors handicapping horse races quantify horses ability inability negotiate various distances horse races run calculated based analysis horses pedigree interest determining sires race horses transmit raw speed sires transmit stamina defined ability successfully compete longer distances progeny dates back early century french researcher lt col j j vuillier published study subject called dosage subsequently modified italian breeding expert dr franco varola two books authored entitled typology race horse
