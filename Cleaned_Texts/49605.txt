patients diseases face treatments cures augustine dedicated much clinical research understanding diseases developing therapies treat focuses neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses ncls batten diseases group rare pediatric neurodegenerative disorders showing symptoms similar dementia parkinsons often blindness seizures motor impairment work helped elucidate distinct characteristics juvenile ncls show myoclonic seizures extent subsets augustine also begun pilot studies remote assessment disease symptoms progression audiovisual technological assessment neuropsychological work critical since patients often travel far distances seek specialized treatment ncls remote data disease monitoring would greatly enhance quality care characterizing disorder exploring ways track disease progress augustine taken steps towards elucidating pharmacological compounds better target disease causes treat symptoms ncl data shows inflammation autoimmunity characteristic ncls augustine tested mycophenolate patients ncl immunosuppressant first see short term administration found immunosuppression mycophenolate well tolerated patients moving long term clinical trials test efficacy reducing ncl since remote disease monitoring critical effectively treating patients rare disorders often live close specialized clinic seek treatment health management augustine exploring novel ways best provide remote care patients explored telemedicine performs means administering unified batten disease rating scale ubdrs physical impairment subscale assess disease using live video patients assessed trained examiners found method works well diagnose disease severity patients batten following work augustine colleagues developed revised model care rare diseases since patient population needs different common diseases local care delivery much model includes use telehealth remove geographic barriers healthcare access also enhancing data collection patientproviderresearcher augustines research also explored sex differences neurological anecdotal evidence parents suggested females experience increased severity batten disease symptoms augustine sought explore found females average later disease onset earlier death addition earlier loss functional augustine also explored sex differences parkinsons found overall men women exhibit differences clinical motor impairment early course observe
