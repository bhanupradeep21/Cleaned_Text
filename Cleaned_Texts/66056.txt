mark recapture method commonly used ecology estimate animal populations size impractical count every portion population captured marked released later another portion captured number marked individuals within sample counted since number marked individuals within second sample proportional number marked individuals whole population estimate total population size obtained dividing number marked individuals proportion marked individuals second sample names method closely related methods include capturerecapture capturemarkrecapture markrecapture sightresight markreleaserecapture multiple systems estimation band recovery petersen lincoln method another major application methods used estimate completeness ascertainment disease registers typical applications include estimating number people needing particular services ie services children learning disabilities services medically frail elderly living community particular conditions ie illegal drug addicts people infected hiv typically researcher visits study area uses traps capture group individuals alive individuals marked unique identifier eg numbered tag band released unharmed back environment markrecapture method

another sample individuals individuals second sample marked initial visit known organisms captured second visit captured first visit study area unmarked animals usually given tag band second visit population size estimated two visits study area commonly two visits made particularly estimates survival movement desired regardless total number visits researcher simply records date capture individual capture histories generated analyzed mathematically estimate population size survival capturing marking organisms ecologists need consider welfare organisms chosen identifier harms organism
