archaeornithomimus sinornithomimus anserimimus gallimimus qiupalong struthiomimus ornithomimus ornithomimosaurs belonged clade maniraptoriformes coelurosaurian theropods also includes modern birds early ornithomimosaurs teeth lost derived members makovicky kobayashi currie suggested early evolutionary history ornithomimosaurs took place asia genera discovered including basal primitive taxa although acknowledged presence basal pelecanimimus europe presents complication classification group must dispersed twice asia north america across beringia account late cretaceous genera found seen dinosaur groups ornithomimosaurs largely restricted asia north america europe separated asia turgai palaeontologist thomas r holtz grouped ornithomimosaurs troodontids clade based shared features presence bulbous capsule parasphenoid named clade bullatosauria based specific name gallimimus bullatus also reference holtz instead found troodontids basal maniraptorans meaning members clade would fall within bullatosauria would therefore become junior synonym maniraptoriformes clade since fallen cervical vertebrae gallimimus indicate held neck obliquely declining upwards angle degrees osmólska colleagues found hands gallimimus prehensile capable grasping thumb opposable also suggested arms weak compared example ornithomimosaur deinocheirus agreed interpretations ornithomimid biology palaeontologist dale russell earlier including would fleet cursorial animals although less agile large modern ground birds would used speed escape predators russell also suggested good sense vision intelligence comparable modern ratite birds since predators may colour vision suggested would influenced colouration perhaps resulting palaeontologist richard thulborn estimated gallimimus could run speeds kmh mph found ornithimimids would fast ostriches reach kmh mph part due arms tails increasing paul suggested eyeballs ornithomimids flattened minimal mobility within sockets necessitating movement head view objects since eyes faced sideways birdlike theropods binocular vision would limited adaptation animals improves ability see predators behind paul considered relatively short tails reduced weight missing halluxes ornithomimids adaptations speed suggested could defended pecking kicking would mainly relied speed akinobu watanabe colleagues found together deinocheirus archaeornithomimus gallimimus pneumatised skeleton among ornithomimosaurs pneumatisation thought advantageous flight modern birds function nonavian dinosaurs known certainty proposed pneumatisation used reduce mass large bones related high metabolism balance locomotion used lee colleagues suggested various possible taphonomic circumstances changes decay fossilisation explain gallimimus foot discovered associated trackway trackway preserved sandstone foot preserved mudstone extending centimetres layer tracks possible fossil represents animal died tracks depth foot mud may shallow become mired may also killed flood buried pond however layers mud sand indicate flooding probably dry environment disrupted sediments around fossil indicate animal alive came area authors thus suggested tracks made extended amount time period drying probably none produced individual owned foot animal may walked across floor pond breaking sediment layer tracks soaked rain contained water animal may died position thirst hunger another reason mud deposited sand thereby covering preserving tracks carcass foot may become clenched disarticulated decomposed made tendons flex later stepped heavy dinosaurs area may single bone bed based possible number poached specimens representing gallimimus mass mortality perhaps due drought famine fact animals seem died time empty excavation pits stratigraphically identical may indicate gallimimus gregarious lived groups also suggested osmólska colleagues pointed front part neck gallimimus would mobile hind part rigid neural arches vertebrae region similar chicken galliformes indicating similar feeding habits found beak gallimimus similar duck goose would fed small living prey swallowed whole mobility neck would useful locating prey ground since eyes positioned sides skull assumed ornithomimids similar feeding habits pointed russel compared beaks ornithomimids insectivorous birds osmólska colleagues suggested gallimimus capable cranial kinesis due seemingly loose connection bones back skull feature allows individual bones skull move relation also proposed use short handed forelimbs bringing food mouth raking digging ground access hands gallimimus may weaker example struthiomimus may instead used hands hooking gripping according article palaeontologists elizabeth l nicholls anthony p paul disagreed ornithomimids omnivores ate small animals eggs well plants previously suggested pointed ostriches emus mainly grazers browsers skulls ornithomimids similar extinct moas strong enough bite twigs evidenced gut content suggested ornithomimids well adapted browsing tough plants would used hands bring branches within reach palaeontologist jørn hurum suggested due similar jaw structure gallimimus may

gallimimus authors noted ornithomimids probably use beaks prey large animals abundant mesic environments rarer arid environments suggesting may depended aquatic food makovicky kobayashi currie pointed interpretation correct gallimimus would one largest known terrestrial filter palaeontologist paul barrett pointed lamellalike structures gallimimus appear flexible bristles like filterfeeding birds indication structures overlapping collapsed instead akin thin regularly spaced vertical ridges beaks turtles hadrosaurid dinosaurs animals ridges thought associated herbivorous diets used crop tough vegetation barrett suggested ridges beak gallimimus represented natural cast internal surface beak indicating animal herbivore fed material high fibre discovery many gastroliths gizzard stones ornithomimids indicate presence gastric mill therefore point towards herbivorous diet used grind food animals lack necessary chewing apparatus barrett also calculated kilograms lb gallimimus would needed kilograms lb food per day depending whether endothermic ectothermic warm coldblooded metabolism intake found unfeasible filter feeder also found ornithomimids abundant formations represented mesic environments also arid environments would insufficient water sustain diet based palaeontologist espen knutsen wrote beak shape ornithomimids compared modern birds consistent omnivory highfibre david j button zanno found herbivorous dinosaurs mainly followed two distinct modes feeding either processing food gracile skulls low bite mouth characterized features associated extensive processing ornithomimid ornithomimosaurs deinocheirus diplodocoid titanosaur sauropods segnosaurus caenagnathids found former category researchers suggested ornithomimid ornithomimosaurians gallimimus deinocheirids invaded niches separately convergently achieving relatively large sizes advantages large body mass herbivores include increased intake rate food fasting resistance trends may therefore indicate ornithomimids deinocheirids herbivorous ornithomimosaurians cautioned correlations herbivory body mass simple directional trend towards increased mass seen clade furthermore diet ornithomimosaurians poorly shape proportions skull changed significantly growth rear skull orbits decreased size whereas snout became relatively longer similar changes occur modern crocodiles skull
