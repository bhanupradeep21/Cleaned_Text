medullary thymic epithelial cells mtecs represent unique stromal cell population thymus plays essential role establishment central tolerance therefore mtecs rank among cells relevant development functional mammal immune system cell precursors rise bone marrow migrate bloodstream thymus development maturation thymus undergo process called vdj recombination conducts development cell receptors tcrs mechanism stochastic process enables one hand generation vast repertoire tcrs however hand causes also origin called autoreactive cells recognize self antigens via tcrs autoreactive cells must eliminated body skewed regulatory cells tregs lineage prevent manifestations autoimmunity mtecs possess ability deal autoreactive clones via mediation processes central tolerance namely clonal deletion regulatory cells selection respectively nb cited references utilized mouse model organism two scientific groups came hypothesis thymus expresses genes periphery strictly expressed specific

molecules rank among efficient antigenpresenting cells moreover utilize macroautophagy load self antigens mhcii thus mtecs capable present selfgenerated tras mhc molecules select potential autoreactive cells published mtecs mediate clonal deletion recessive tolerance via presentation tras leads apoptosis autoreactive well competent skew autoreactive cells tregs also presentation tras migrate periphery protect tissues autoreactive cells occasionally avoid selection processes thymus dominant mtecs discriminate two modes tolerance shown prospective tregs interact presented tras lower
