tumefactive multiple sclerosis condition central nervous system person multiple demyelinating lesions atypical characteristics standard multiple sclerosis ms called tumefactive lesions tumorlike mimic tumors clinically radiologically sometimes atypical lesion characteristics include large intracranial lesion size greater cm mass effect edema open ring enhancement mass effect effect mass surroundings example exerting pressure surrounding brain matter edema buildup fluid within brain tissue usually ring enhancement directed toward cortical tumefactive lesion may mimic malignant glioma cerebral abscess causing complications diagnosis tumefactive ms rim incomplete ring enhancement lesions postgadolinium weighted imaging brain mri enable accurate diagnosis normally tumefactive
