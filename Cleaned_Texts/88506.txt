context effect aspect cognitive psychology describes influence environmental factors ones perception impact context effects considered part topdown design concept supported theoretical approach perception known constructive perception context effects impact daily lives many ways word recognition learning abilities memory object recognition extensive effect marketing consumer decisions example research shown comfort level floor shoppers standing reviewing products affect assessments products quality leading higher assessments floor comfortable lower ratings uncomfortable effects context effects currently studied predominantly context effects employ topdown design analyzing information top design fuels understanding image using prior experiences knowledge interpret stimulus process helps us analyze familiar scenes objects encountering perception kind people generally use either sensory data bottomup design prior knowledge stimulus topdown design analyzing stimulus individuals generally use types processing examine use sensory data prior knowledge reach conclusion feature optimal probabilistic reasoning known bayesian inference cognitive scientists shown mathematically context effects emerge bayesian inference context effects occur individuals using environmental cues perceived examining stimuli order help analyze words individuals often make relative decisions influenced environment previous exposure objects decisions may greatly influenced external forces alter way individuals view object example research shown people rank television commercials either good bad relation enjoyment levels show commercials presented like dislike show likely rate commercials shown show positively negatively another example shows sound recognition context effect use sounds environment change way categorize needed context effects come several forms including configural superiority effect demonstrates varying degrees spatial recognition depending stimuli present organized configuration present verification example one may recognize fully composed object faster individual parts objectsuperiority effect context effects wide range impacts daily life reading difficult handwriting context effects used determine letters make helps us analyze potentially ambiguous messages decipher correctly also affect perception unknown sounds based noise example may fill word make sentence based words could understand context prime attitudes beliefs certain topics based current environmental factors previous experiences context effects nullified made consciously aware outside stimulus past history may influence decision example study conducted norbert schwarz gerald clore showed asked rate overall life satisfaction either sunny rainy days people expressed greater satisfaction sunny days less satisfaction rainy days however people reminded weather satisfaction rating returned almost even study demonstrates effect environment perception pointed context effects nullified context effects also affect memory often better able recall information location learned studied example studying test better study environment test taken ie classroom location information learned need phenomenon called transferappropriate processing perhaps greatest amount research concerning context effects comes marketing research context effects influence consumers choice three main context effects researched marketing first compromise effect states objects priced middle choice sets looked middle choice seems like good compromise choices may viewed extreme example bikes sale local store ranging average shopper looking luxury bicycle would normally opt choose bike average matches level expertise however adding bike sale average shoppers would opt select higher bike demonstrates compromise effect choosing bike match expectations regarding middle attractiveness effect second contextual effect consumer behavior maintains one item increase attractiveness another item similar superior showing item superior similar one likability possible purchasing power superior item similarity effect third contextual effect consumers behavior states item hurt similar item sales dissimilar item two similar items competing attention detract firms looking increase product resale use context effects construct profitable marketing strategies idea context effects marketing industry allow profitable items boost optional sharing productivity boost based contextual effects certain context effect consumer behavior study conducted undergraduate marketing students university korea researchers set mixed design test visual framing promoting greater use alternativebased processing would reduce perceived attractiveness compromise options also hypothesized decision process would minimal influence choice asymmetrically dominating options researchers split participants three conditions attribute based processing treatment alternative based processing treatment control order perpetuate attribute alternative based processing participants researchers used different visual tactics present product attribute processing group horizontal lines drawn attribute product option highlighting various attributes different products within choice set conversely alternative treatment group vertical lines drawn individual product options visually separate one another control group visual framing treatment researchers simultaneously assessed attractiveness compromise effect impacts probability consumer choose target brand listing two attributes three products choice set depending extremity differences product attribute options either placed compromise asymmetrically dominant subgroup findings study proved hypothesis frequency often compromise option chosen depends heavily difference visual framing attribute alternative based processing treatments study found alternative treatment promoted compromise effect took precedence participants decision making furthermore study showed significant difference attribute control treatments probability choosing asymmetrically dominant option equally high across three framing conditions context also affects perception artwork artworks presented classical museum context liked rated interesting presented sterile laboratory context specific results depend heavily style
