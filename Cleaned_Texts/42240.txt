anchoring effect psychological phenomenon individuals judgements decisions influenced reference point anchor completely irrelevant numeric nonnumeric anchoring reported research numeric anchoring value anchor set subsequent arguments estimates etc made individual may change would otherwise without anchor example individual may likely purchase car placed alongside expensive model anchor prices discussed negotiations lower anchor may seem reasonable perhaps even cheap buyer even said prices still relatively higher actual market value another example may estimating orbit mars one might start earths orbit days adjust upward reach value seems reasonable usually less days correct answer original description anchoring effect came psychophysics judging stimuli along continuum noticed first last stimuli used compare stimuli also referred end anchoring applied attitudes sherif et al article assimilation effects anchoring stimuli anchoring adjustment heuristic first theorized amos tversky daniel one first studies participants asked compute within seconds product numbers one eight either reversed participants enough time calculate full answer make estimate first multiplications first multiplications gave small answer sequence started small numbers median estimate sequence started larger numbers median estimate correct answer another study tversky kahneman participants asked estimate percentage african countries united nations estimating participants first observed roulette wheel predetermined stop either participants whose wheel stopped guessed lower values average

purchase study found using appbased stock brokerage investor first stock purchase price serves anchor future stock purchases findings indicate investors start making small stock purchase end less accumulated investments long run various studies shown anchoring difficult avoid example one study students given anchors wrong asked whether mahatma gandhi died age age clearly neither anchors correct two groups asked suggest thought died guessed significantly differently average age vs average age studies tried eliminate anchoring much directly study exploring causes properties anchoring participants exposed anchor asked guess many physicians listed local phone book addition explicitly informed anchoring would contaminate responses best correct control group received anchor explanation regardless informed whether informed correctly experimental groups reported higher estimates control group thus despite expressly aware anchoring effect participants still unable avoid later study found even offered monetary incentives people unable effectively adjust anchoring effects also shown remain adequately present given accessibility knowledge pertaining target turn suggests despite delay judgement towards target extent anchoring effects seen remain unmitigated within given time period series three experiments conducted test longevity anchoring effects observed despite

judgement period shows little influence relative selfgenerated anchors even commonly encountered targets temperature used one experiments showing anchoring effects may precede priming duration especially anchoring effects formed research conclude effect effectively retained substantial period time proven given old saying two heads better one often presumed groups come unbiased decision

discriminatory fashion information communicated processed aggregated based individuals anchored knowledge results diminished quality decisionmaking process consequently amplifies preexisting anchored biases cause group anchoring remains obscure group anchors may established group level may simply culmination several individuals personal anchors previous studies shown given anchor experiment

bi system mitigated negative effects spurious anchor influence effects plausible anchor important business context shows humans still susceptible cognitive biases even using sophisticated technological systems one subsequent recommendations experimenters implement forewarning bi systems anchoring effect several theories put forth explain causes anchoring although explanations popular others consensus study possible causes anchoring two authors described anchoring easy demonstrate hard least one group researchers argued multiple causes play called anchoring actually several different original study tversky kahneman put forth view later termed anchoringasadjustment according theory anchor set people adjust away get final answer however adjust insufficiently resulting final guess closer anchor would researchers also found evidence supporting anchoringandadjusting factors influence capacity judgmental correction like alcohol intoxication performing taxing cognitive load rehearsing long string digits working memory tend increase anchoring people know direction adjust incentivizing accuracy also appears reduce anchoring model without critiques proponents alternative theories criticized model claiming applicable initial anchor outside range acceptable answers use earlier example since mahatma gandhi obviously die age people adjust reasonable number given though would adjustment therefore theory according critics explain cases anchoring alternate explanation regarding selective accessibility derived theory called confirmatory hypothesis testing short selective accessibility proposes given anchor judge ie person making judgment evaluate hypothesis anchor suitable answer assuming judge moves another guess accessing relevant attributes anchor evaluating new answer judge looks ways similar anchor resulting anchoring various studies found empirical support explanation assumes judge considers anchor plausible value immediately rejected would preclude considering relevant attributescitation needed example onlineexperiment showed ratings previous members crowd could act anchor displaying results previous ratings context business model idea evaluation people incorporate displayed anchor decisionmaking process leading decreasing variance recently third explanation anchoring proposed concerning attitude change according theory providing anchor changes someones attitudes favorable particular attributes anchor biasing future answers similar characteristics anchor leading proponents theory consider alternate explanation line prior research anchoringandadjusting selective estimating something predictors less likely choose amount close maximum allowable adjustment according theory predictors adjust less anchor chosen result final prediction results close anchor wide range research linked sad depressed moods extensive accurate evaluation result earlier studies hypothesized people depressed moods would tend use anchoring less happier moods however recent studies shown opposite effect sad people likely use anchoring people happy neutral study focusing medical practitioners found physicians possess positive moods less susceptible anchoring bias compared physicians neutral moods specifically found positive mood leads information processing systematic leads efficient problem solving leads decreased anchoring early research found experts high knowledge experience expertise field resistant anchoring effect however anchoring happens unconsciously means unless someone knowledgeable warned prior still susceptible since however numerous studies demonstrated experience sometimes reduce effect even experts susceptible anchoring study concerning effects anchoring judicial decisions researchers found even experienced legal professionals affected anchoring remained true even anchors provided arbitrary unrelated case also relates goal setting experienced individuals set goals based past experiences consequently affects end results expertise judge relevant knowledge study using price estimation cars found relevant knowledge positively influenced anchoring expertise cognitive bias related experience however two exclusively exhaustive study using stock return estimates found expertise decreases behavioural bias significantly found factors like cognitive ability experience susceptibility anchoring susceptibility increases tend become factors decrease effects anchoring research correlated susceptibility anchoring big five personality traits personality traits follows conscientiousness character orderly responsible neuroticism individual uneasy nature unstable extraversion person sociable outgoing nature openness experience intelligent creative personality trait agreeableness someone polite trusting people high agreeableness conscientiousness neuroticism likely affected anchoring high extraversion openness experience less likely affected studies shown high openness new experiences agreeableness susceptible impact cognitive ability anchoring contested recent study willingness pay consumer goods found anchoring decreased greater cognitive ability though another study however found cognitive ability significant effect likely people use pokerlike experiment included people differing academic achievement psychometric reasoning scoring found anchoring related education level also found numerical reasoning reflection scores negative association anchoring although overconfidence emanates heuristic refers specifically behavioural tendency take initial assessment put emphasis making initial assessment leading cognitive cognitive conceit overconfidence arises factors like personal cognitive attributes knowledge decisionmaking ability decreasing probability pursue external sources confirmation factor also shown arise tasks greater difficulty even within subject matter experts also prey behaviour overconfidence actively reduce behaviour following study estimations uncertain despite several attempts curb overconfidence proving tversky kahneman suggest effective solution overconfidence subjects explicitly establish anchors help reduce overconfidence negotiation process anchoring serves determine accepted starting point subsequent negotiations soon one side states first price offer subjective anchor set counterbid counteranchor addition initial research conducted tversky kahneman multiple studies shown anchoring greatly influence estimated value instance although negotiators generally appraise offer based multiple characteristics studies shown tend focus one aspect way deliberate starting point strongly affect range possible process offer counteroffer results mutually beneficial arrangement however multiple studies shown initial offers stronger influence outcome negotiations subsequent example power anchoring conducted strategic negotiation process workshops workshop group participants divided two sections buyers sellers side receives identical information party going oneonone negotiation following exercise sides debrief experiences results show participants anchor negotiation significant effect needed anchoring affects everyone even people highly knowledgeable field northcraft neale conducted study measure difference estimated value house students realestate agents experiment groups shown house given different listing prices making offer group asked discuss factors influenced decisions followup interviews realestate agents denied influenced initial price results showed groups equally influenced anchoring subtle effects negotiations well janiszewski uy investigated effects precision anchor participants read initial price beach house gave price thought worth received either general seemingly nonspecific anchor eg precise specific anchor eg participants general anchor adjusted estimate given precise anchor vs authors propose effect comes difference scale words anchor affects starting value also starting scale given general anchor people adjust large increments etc given specific anchor like people adjust lower scale thus specific initial price tend result final price closer initial one question setting first second anchor party setting second anchor advantage counteranchor determines point midway due possible lack knowledge party setting first anchor also set low ie interests generally negotiators set first anchor also tend less satisfied negotiation outcome negotiators set may due regret sense achieve rather maximise full potential negotiations however studies suggest negotiators set first offer frequently achieve economically advantageous tversky suggest anchoring effect product anchoring adjustment heuristics whereby estimates made

traits susceptibility towards anchoring effect manipulations participant study shifted median response towards anchor evidence systematic relationship according theory consumers shopping experiences influenced factors time restriction specific environment enterprises design would set anchor values consumers order get buy products persuading consumers purchase particular product sellers might use anchoring sellers often influence consumers price perception anchoring high reference price anchor following three ways set anchor value consumers sellers usually sort prices products high low method common seen menus high prices top menu act anchor values situation consumers expectation products expensive knowing relatively high prices products top list result pleased see cheaper products middle bottom list regard prices acceptable cheaper expected therefore likely buy decoy effect defined situation people tend change preference two choices showed third choice third choice called decoy designed induce consumers change preferences decoy usually considered inferior example might expensive option lower quality option b case anchor one decoy effect example bundle sales example many restaurants often sell set meals consumers simultaneously meals components sold separately prices meals components decoy pricing act anchor enables make set meal valuable consumers decoy effect generates anchor increases consumers willingness pay set meals mixed incidental price defined prices offered showed seller products consumers interested according theory incidental price serves anchor
