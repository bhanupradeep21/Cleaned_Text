acanthocercus pattoni daidal named spirit takelma mythology extinct genus mantis shrimp lived carboniferous period genus family daidalidae three species currently placed within genus fossils type species acanthocercus found bear gulch limestone montana second species pattoni known lower limestone formation scotland third species schoellmanni discovered westphalia germany genus proposed polyphyletic pattoni possibly earlier diverging lineage though specimens research needed confirm fossilized remains daidal first described almost century genus named ben peach studied several crustacean fossils carboniferous deposits scotland erected species perimecturus pattoni based single specimen g collected top hosie limestone lower limestone formation near east kilbride believing belonged genus perimecturus specific name honors andrew patton manager calderwood cement works collected clark would report additional material species move genus tyrannophontes tyrannophontes pattoni though lothar schöllman placed back perimecturus jenner et al analysed numerous stomatopod specimens bear gulch limestone recognized specimens formerly thought represent bairdops beargulchensis tyrannophontes theridion represent new species named tyrannophontes acanthocercus specimen cm selected holotype species specific name combined greek akanthos meaning thorn kerkos meaning tail reference spines lothar schöllman studied remains another stomatopod species collected hagenvorhalle westphalia germany concluded mostly similar gorgonophontes assigning gorgonophontes cf authors tentatively assigned specimens perimecturus frederick schram conducted study revising classification paleozoic stomatopods found fossils assigned tyrannophontes acanthocercus differed significantly holotype tyrannophontes species placed separate genus genus daidal thus erected acanthocercus renamed daidal acanthocercus type species generic name references spirit takelma mythology name schram also found perimecturus pattoni similar acanthocercus features pleon telson therefore reclassifying second species daidal named daidal pattoni addition german remains assigned gorgonophontes cf

acanthocercus initially described species tyrannophontes pattoni first named species perimecturus therefore assigned families tyrannophontidae perimecturidae specimens schoellmanni one point

gigantion ahyongi laurae laevis phoenicia pennata syriaca yehoachi nkporoensis fisherorum squilla mantis based diet mantis shrimps fact enlarged raptorial appendages daidal believed carnivore extant unipeltatan mantis shrimps raptorial appendages second pair thoracopods specialized joint associated set muscles form clickjoint mechanism allowing appendages rapidly extend capture however daidal probably lacked mechanism instead raptorial appendages closely resemble smaller third fifth thoracopods unipeltatans used manipulate prey capture thus suggested jenner et al basal stomatopods like daidal opportunistic scavengers primarily handled dead hand haug haug theorized early mantis shrimps benthopelagic predators swimming seabed hunted possibly grabbing prey supported appendage morphology tyrannosculda tyrannophontes gorgonophontes showing early forms could attack prey method hunting also observed larvae extant mantis shrimps studying may help increase understanding early
