amygdalotomy form psychosurgery involves surgical removal destruction amygdala parts amygdala usually lastresort treatment severe aggressive behavioral disorders similar behaviors including hyperexcitability violent outbursts practice medical amygdalotomy typically involves administration general anesthesia achieved application cranial stereotactic surgery target regions amygdala surgical studies found stereotactic amygdalotomy humans effective treatment severe cases intractable aggressive behavior responded standard treatment studies remain cases amygdalotomy humans substantial evidence impairment overall cognitive function including intelligence working memory however deficits specific areas memory noted pertaining recognition emotional interpretation facial stimuli specialized cells amygdala attend facial stimuli amygdala considered important underlying structure fightorflight response playing mediating role aggression humans clinical studies revealed stimulation amygdala produces accentuates rageful behavior research also revealed lesions amygdala humans animals produces calming effect aggressive based findings amygdalotomy developed neurosurgical procedure ameliorate aggression reducing arousal levels since early accumulation experimental evidence demonstrate role limbic system specifically amygdala complex mediating emotional expressions fear early primate studies revealed chemical electrical stimulation amygdala region accentuates aggressive behavior conversely destruction amygdala nucleus results taming effect normal anger fearing responses primate behavior similarly clinical studies humans revealed close etiological role temporal lobe structures particularly limbic system amygdala mediating fear rageful findings instrumental development clinical amygdalotomy form neurosurgery produce placating effects abnormal aggressive procedural amygdalotomy used last recourse treatment severe intractable aggression options including pharmacological treatments exhausted psychopathology patients severe aggressive behavior clinical cases amygdalotomy past century vary including epileptics violent convulsions psychotics violent outbursts individuals unmanageable conduct disorder patients selfmutilative tendencies clinical practice amygdalotomy humans commonly implemented stereotactic frame varying techniques used destroy amygdala ranging radiofrequency mechanical destruction injection oil wax preferred target zone amygdala also varies basal lateral nuclei medial region corticomedial group nuclei bed stria size lesion differs onethird onehalf threequarters entire amygdalar spite methodological differences published accounts human amygdalotomy indicated beneficial outcomes reducing intensity frequency aggressive amongst earliest studies conducted removal amygdala animal primate early friedrich goltz conducted experiments temporal lobectomy dogs including removal amygdala found dogs postsurgery experienced taming effects aggressive deep brain stimulation studies animals revealed temporal lobe involved mediating expressions rage detailed analysis specific regions temporal lobe animals revealed limbic system specifically amygdala complex involved mediating fear earliest primate studies amygdalotomy carried rhesus monkeys kluver bucy late data collected studies revealed bilateral destruction amygdala resulted reduction intensity frequency fear aggression behaviors human counterpart role amygdala observed century height professor hirotaro narabayashi colleagues first researchers carry stereotactic amygdalotomy treatment abnormal aggression hyperexcitability series patients psychological procedure performed stereotactic frame devised professor narabayashi involved administration mixture oilwax destroy lateral groups amygdala nucleus localized via clinical results revealed marked reduction emotional disturbances amongst cases following narabayashis study cases amygdalotomy reported clinical trials lastresort treatment severe intractable aggressive around time hatai chitanondh utilized slightly different technique stereotactic amygdalotomy using injection olive oil mixture induce lesions mechanically block signals amygdala results revealed improvement social adaptability seven late balasubramaniam ramamurthi investigated largest clinical patient series undergo stereotactic amygdalotomy aggression behaviours procedure performed via highfrequency current generating electrodes inserted stereotactically induce several small thermal lesions creating total lesion volume size larger improvement maladaptive behavior patients including hyperexcitability rebellious behavior destructive behavior ranged moderate development mri technology recent century enabled accurate efficient process amygdalotomy easier localization amygdala regions neuronavigation well use advanced radiofrequency generating electrode induce surgical despite recent advances technology decline clinical cases amygdalotomy treatment maladaptive behavior growing skepticism medical community costbenefits procedure partly due greater reliance pharmacological general consensus amongst many researchers general effectiveness amygdalotomy reducing aggression amongst patients psychosis violent epilepsy selfmutilative diverse stereotactic amygdalotomy used treat patients primarily aggressive behavior violent epilepsy found behavioral abnormalities eliminated patients significant improvement another patients aggressive behavior manifests convulsions also eliminated patients whilst patients experienced significant decrease number epileptic convulsions patient rehabilitation also effective patients committed mental institutions discharged whilst patients awaiting institutionalization longer considered multidisciplinary project carried amygdalotomy amongst epileptics violent outbursts found amygdalotomy showed promising results decline violent aggressive antisocial behavior well reduction amongst patients improvement occupational functioning researchers however concluded results generalized nonepileptics conducted patients conduct disorder personality disorder selfmutilation schizophrenics violent hallucinations found maladaptive behaviors also improved across groups patients using reliable objective methods evaluation heimburger colleagues found patients respond nonsurgical therapy amygdalotomy effective conditions uncontrolled conduct disorder seizures seeming improved stereotaxic amygdalotomy conducted patients schizophrenia frequent selfmutilations found patients amygdalotomy resulted elimination marked reduction aggressive two patients frequent selfmutilative episodes reactive psychotic hallucinations however symptoms disappeared additional basofrontal tractotomy performed scarcity longterm studies followup effects clinical amygdalotomy amongst followup studies includes research compared results clinical amygdalotomy patients pre postsurgery average years using objective analysis psychiatric interviews neuropsychological tests eeg analysis found indication worsening symptoms additionally researchers found evidence retention positive outcomes onethird patients limited improvements rageful behaviour also included decrease overall frequency seizures another followup professor narabayashi colleagues observed clinical effects amygdalotomy cases years found cases continued satisfactory improvement calming taming effects previously uncontrollable aggression including destructive violent behaviour cases amygdalotomy humans substantial evidence impairment overall cognitive function including intelligence working however deficits specific areas memory noted particularly areas memory pertaining recognition emotional interpretation facial findings face recognition impairment amygdalotomy particular importance due neurophysiological data collected importance cells amygdala specifically attend facial stimuli humans detailed case study patient undergone bilateral amygdalotomy found incidences patient showed poor learning new faces impaired recognition familiar faces particularly troubles naming additionally patient also revealed deficits emotional processing facial stimuli demonstrating difficulty identifying matching range facial expressions another study patients showed reduction general intelligence similar pattern changes attention memory involving facial stimuli link amygdala social disturbances pertaining processing facial stimuli investigated possible sideeffect
