medicine drug eruption adverse drug reaction skin druginduced cutaneous reactions mild disappear offending drug called simple drug eruptions however serious drug eruptions may associated organ injury liver kidney damage categorized drugs also cause hair nail changes affect mucous membranes cause itching without outward skin use synthetic pharmaceuticals biopharmaceuticals medicine revolutionized human health allowing us live longer lives consequently average human adult exposed many drugs longer treatment periods throughout unprecedented rise pharmaceutical use led increasing number observed adverse drug two broad categories adverse drug reactions type reactions known side effects drug largely predictable called whereas type b hypersensitivity reactions often immunemediated reproducible repeated exposure normal dosages given unlike type reactions mechanism type b hypersensitivity drug reactions fully elucidated however complex interplay patients inherited genetics pharmacotoxicology drug immune response ultimately give rise manifestation drug manifestation drug eruption complex highly individual many subfields medicine studying phenomenon example field pharmacogenomics aims prevent occurrence severe adverse drug reactions analyzing persons inherited genetic clinical examples inherited genetic alleles known predict drug hypersensitivities diagnostic testing severe lifethreatening examples drug eruptions erythema multiforme syndrome sjs toxic epidermal necrolysis ten hypersensitivity vasculitis drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome dihs erythroderma acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis severe cutaneous drug eruptions categorized hypersensitivity reactions immunemediated four types hypersensitivity reactions many drugs induce one hypersensitivity basophil surface receptors angioedema complementdriven cell lysis hemolytic anemia goodpastures anca vasculitis tissuestriggers recruitment leukocytes inflammation leading tissue destruction common type eruption morbilliform resembling measles erythematous rash approximately less commonly appearance may also urticarial papulosquamous pustular purpuric bullous blisters angioedema also druginduced notably angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors underlying mechanism immunological drug allergies nonimmunological example photodermatitis side effect anticoagulants fixed drug eruption term drug eruption occurs skin area every time person exposed drug eruptions occur frequently certain drug example rare example sweets syndrome following administration colonystimulating culprit prescription drug overthecounter medication examples common drugs causing drug eruptions antibiotics antimicrobial drugs sulfa drugs nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids biopharmaceuticals chemotherapy agents anticonvulsants psychotropic drugs common examples include photodermatitis due local nsaids piroxicam due antibiotics minocycline fixed drug eruption due acetaminophen nsaids ibuprofen rash following ampicillin cases certain drugs less likely cause drug eruptions rates estimated per patients exposed include digoxin aluminum hydroxide multivitamins acetaminophen bisacodyl aspirin thiamine prednisone atropine codeine hydrochlorothiazide morphine insulin warfarin drug eruptions diagnosed mainly medical history clinical examination however mimic various conditions thus delaying diagnosis example druginduced lupus erythematosus acnelike rash caused erlotinib skin biopsy blood tests immunological tests also useful drug reactions characteristic timing typical amount time takes rash appear exposure drug help categorize type reaction example acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis usually occurs within days starting culprit drug drug reaction eosinophilia systemic symptoms usually occurs days exposure toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome typically occur days exposure anaphylaxis occurs within minutes simple exanthematous eruptions occur days ten sjs severe cutaneous drug reactions involve skin mucous membranes accurately diagnose condition detailed drug history often several drugs may causative allergy testing may sulfa drugs well known induce ten sjs certain people example hiv patients increased incidence sjs ten compared general population found express low levels drug metabolizing enzyme responsible detoxifying sulfa genetics plays important role predisposing certain populations ten sjs fda recommended genetic screening tests available certain drugs ethnic populations prevent occurrence drug well known example carbamezepine anticonvulsant used treat seizures hypersensitivity associated presence genetic allele asian us african australian thai european malaysian korean han dihs delayed onset drug eruption often occurring weeks months initiation worsening systemic symptoms occurs days cessation offending genetic risk alleles predictive development dihs particular drugs ethnic important abacavir antiviral used treatment hiv hypersensitivity
