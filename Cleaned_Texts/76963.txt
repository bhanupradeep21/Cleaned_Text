nerve enclosed cablelike bundle nerve fibers called axons peripheral nervous system nerves historically considered basic units peripheral nervous system nerve provides common pathway electrochemical nerve impulses called action potentials transmitted along axons peripheral organs case sensory nerves periphery back central nervous system axon within nerve extension individual neuron along supportive cells schwann cells coat axons myelin within nerve axon surrounded layer connective tissue called endoneurium axons bundled together groups called fascicles fascicle wrapped layer connective tissue called perineurium finally entire nerve wrapped layer connective tissue called epineurium nerve cells often called neurons classified sensory motor mixed nerves central nervous system analogous structures known nerve nerve covered outside dense sheath connective tissue epineurium beneath layer fat cells perineurium forms complete sleeve around bundle axons perineurial septae extend nerve subdivide several bundles fibres surrounding fibre endoneurium forms unbroken tube surface spinal cord level axon synapses muscle fibres ends sensory receptors endoneurium consists inner sleeve material called glycocalyx outer delicate meshwork collagen nerves bundled often travel along blood vessels since neurons nerve fairly high energy requirements within endoneurium individual nerve fibres surrounded lowprotein liquid called endoneurial fluid acts similar way cerebrospinal fluid central nervous system constitutes bloodnerve barrier similar molecules thereby prevented crossing blood endoneurial fluid development nerve edema nerve irritation injury amount endoneurial fluid may increase site irritation increase fluid visualized using magnetic resonance neurography thus mr neurography identify nerve irritation andor injury nerves categorized three groups based direction signals conducted nerves categorized two groups based connect central nervous system specific

involuntarily nerves exit cranium called cranial nerves exiting spinal cord called spinal nerves cancer spread invading spaces around nerves particularly common head neck cancer prostate cancer colorectal cancer nerves damaged physical injury well conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome cts repetitive strain injury autoimmune diseases syndrome neurodegenerative diseases polyneuropathy
