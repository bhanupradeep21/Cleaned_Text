eurypterina one two suborders eurypterids extinct group chelicerate arthropods commonly known sea scorpions eurypterine eurypterids sometimes informally known swimming known fossil deposits worldwide though primarily north america europe seventyfive percent eurypterid species eurypterines represents superfamily pterygotioidea speciesrich clade species followed adelophthalmoidea species sister taxa comprise derived eurypterines pterygotioidea includes pterygotids eurypterids known cosmopolitan though numerous specimens taxa eurypterines shorter temporal range two eurypterid suborders first appeared around time stylonurina middle ordovician suborder faced slow extinction middle late devonian possibly tied emergence jawed every eurypterine genus lineage went extinct carboniferous save adelophthalmus would go extinct early permian millions years permiantriassic extinction event ended stylonurina eurypterina easily distinguished morphology posteriormost prosomal appendage stylonurina appendage takes form long slender walking leg lacking modified spine termed podomere eurypterina leg usually modified broadened swimming paddle always includes podomere swimming eurypterines represent absolute majority known eurypterid species known specimens though morphology walking stylonurines almost diverse appearance fossil record eurypterines may therefore simply complete stylonurines possibly due varying habitat basal eurypterines swimming legs genus onychopterella known east coast gondwana close equator region today south africa late ordovician known whether swimming forms originated speculated migrated laurentia since stylonurines basal swimming forms predominantly known laurentia gondwana otherwise completely lacks basal swimming megalograptoids likely first major successful group eurypterids evidenced late ordovician radiation known members megalograptoidea middle late ordovician laurentia though potential records middle silurian baltica known form genus holmipterus suecicus though classification megalograptoid eurypteroids known laurentia baltica one known species avalonia eurypterus eurypteroids appear unable spread beyond laurussian waters genus eurypterus particular dominated many silurian eurypterid faunas laurentia despite abundance appears originated laurentia earliest records genus baltica eurypterus thus likely invasive genus laurentia albeit one managed adapt well new majority carcinosomatoid taxa also known laurentia baltica avalonia isolated fragmentary fossils late silurian vietnam czech republic show terranes annamia perunica within geographical range carcinosomatoids basal carcinosomatoids eg carcinosoma paracarcinosoma found deeper waters whilst derived forms mixopterus lanarkopterus basal carcinosomatoids carcinosomatidae likely responsible fossil remains vietnam czech republic may distribution similar cosmopolitan distribution pterygotoids though common adelophthalmoids longest lasting clade eurypterines becoming extinct middle permian part due survival adelophthalmus beyond middle devonian earliest records genus early devonian western germany following amalgamation pangaea carboniferous permian genus gained almost cosmopolitan distribution basalmost species entire clade baltica evolution within basal members took place laurussia devonian representatives found siberia australia long

llandovery scotland laurentia south china mobility makes difficult pinpoint geographical origin clade though speculated close laurentia like eurypterina contains eight superfamilies onychopterelloidea moselopteroidea megalograptoidea eurypteroidea carcinosomatoidea waeringopteroidea adelophthalmoidea pterygotioidea relationships remain somewhat unclear megalograptoidea thought relatively primitive onychopterella eurypteroidea lack synapomorphy derived swimming forms modified distal margin sixth podomere swimming leg position necessarily true since sixth podomere swimming leg resembles reduced podomere found mixopteridae might instead belong eurypteroidea contrast megalograptoidea eurypteroidea rather wellknown clade contains around known eurypterid specimens closely related supported numerous similarities carcinosomatoidea carcinosomatoidea poorly resolved internal phylogeny though easily recognised scorpionlike appearance heavily spinose pterygotioidea adelophthalmoidea two derived clades well taxonomically diverse ones adelophthalmoidea contains species whereas pterygotioidea contains superfamilies classified part eurypterina contain following families suborder
