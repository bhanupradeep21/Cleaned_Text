spastic quadriplegia also known spastic tetraplegia subset spastic cerebral palsy affects four limbs arms legs compared quadriplegia spastic tetraplegia defined spasticity limbs opposed strict paralysis distinguishable forms cerebral palsy afflicted condition display stiff jerky movements stemming hypertonia spastic quadriplegia affecting four limbs less equally still present parts body stiffer others one arm tighter another arm forth spastic triplegia meanwhile involves three limbs one arm two legs one leg two arms etc spastic diplegia affects two limbs commonly legs spastic hemiplegia affects one another entire side body left right spastic monoplegia involves single limbcitation needed spastic quadriplegia detected abnormal development motor skills children symptoms present early three months generally seen child reaches two years age warning signs include child two months stiff legs scissor unable control head child twelve months developed ability crawl spastic quadriplegia also presents range symptoms affect musculature many experience contractures defined joints stretched moved clonus another symptom characterized alternating rapid muscle contraction relaxation presents tremors scissoring limbs distonia lasting muscle contractions tightness also often experienced affected spastic quadriplegia involuntary muscle contractions may affect development structural muscle around hip lead hip dysplasia dislocation making difficult sit combination symptoms often makes difficult patients walk although arms legs patients often stiff neck usually limp due lack voluntary muscle controlcitation needed spastic quadriplegia generally caused brain damage disruptions normal brain development preceding birth according national institutes health four types brain damage cause spastic quadriplegia include damage white matter periventricular leukomalacia abnormal brain development cerebral dysgenesis bleeding brain intracranial hemorrhage brain damage due lack oxygen hypoxicischemic encephalopathy intrapartum white matter brain especially vulnerable weeks maturation damage white matter interfere brain ability transmit signals rest body spastic quadriplegia caused condition known periventricular leukomalacia results formation lesions holes white matter braincitation needed prior week maturation fetal brain particularly susceptible various toxins whose effects ultimately hinder normal development exposure brain infectious agents especially dangerous trigger immune responses activate cytokines lead inflammation brain infections linked development spastic quadriplegia include meningitis herpes rubella difference blood types mother fetus also initiate problematic immune response cause brain damage severe jaundice also lead brain damage spastic quadriplegia due buildup bilirubin bleeding brain caused fetal strokes blood clots weak malformed blood vessels high maternal blood pressure may also lead brain damage causing spastic quadriplegia maternal infection specifically pelvic inflammatory disease shown increase risk fetal strokecitation needed hypoxia lack oxygen brain also cause damage cerebral motor cortex brain regions lack oxygen result placenta malfunction womb rupture umbilical cord damage low maternal blood pressure asphyxia labor children experienced many complications birth prematurity insufficient oxygen low birthweight aspiration head injury bleeding brain greater risk developing spastic quadriplegia children whose mothers ill pregnancy receive adequate nutrition also likely develop spastic quadriplegia diagnosed early age one noticed delay development particularly delay rolling crawling sitting however depending severity signs may show age three muscle tone sometimes used make diagnosis spastic quadriplegia affected children often appear either stiff another important diagnostic factor persistence primitive reflexes past age disappeared months reflexes include rooting reflex sucking reflex moro reflex among otherscitation needed magnetic resonance imaging mri computed tomography scan ct scan may used locate cause symptoms ultrasound may used function premature cerebral palsy refers group disorders important clear systematic naming system disorders must nonprogressive nontransient due injury spinal disorders within group classified based two characteristics main physiological
