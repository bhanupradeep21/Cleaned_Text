rib cage endoskeletal enclosure thorax vertebrate animals comprises ribs vertebral column sternum protects vital organs heart lungs great vessels circumferential enclosure formed left right rib cages together known thoracic cage semirigid bony cartilaginous structure surrounds thoracic cavity supports shoulder girdles form core part axial skeleton typical human thoracic cage consists pairs ribs adjoining costal cartilages sternum along manubrium xiphoid process thoracic vertebrae articulating ribs thoracic cage also provides attachments extrinsic skeletal muscles neck upper limbs upper abdomen back together overlying skin associated fascia muscles makes thoracic wall tetrapods rib cage intrinsically holds muscles respiration diaphragm intercostal muscles etc crucial active inhalation forced exhalation therefore major ventilatory function respiratory system thirtythree vertebrae human vertebral column rib cage associated ribs described based location connection sternum ribs attached posteriorly thoracic vertebrae numbered accordingly one twelve ribs articulate directly sternum called true ribs whereas articulate directly termed false ribs false ribs include floating
