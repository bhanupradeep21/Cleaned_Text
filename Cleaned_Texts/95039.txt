fertilization ivf method means eggs removed ovaries fertilized laboratory one resulting embryos placed uterus hopefully create pregnancy reciprocal ivf differs standard ivf two partners involved eggs taken one partner partner carries way process mechanically identical ivf egg reciprocal ivf offers highest chance pregnancy lower chance multiple birthscitation needed process first introduced spain cefer reciprocal ivf process involves steps genetic mother gestational mother lists onebyone steps couple undergoing procedure go decision choose partner going egg donor partner going gestational
