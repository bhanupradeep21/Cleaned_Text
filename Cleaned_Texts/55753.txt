northern blot rna technique used molecular biology research study gene expression detection rna isolated mrna northern blotting possible observe cellular control structure function determining particular gene expression rates differentiation morphogenesis well abnormal diseased northern blotting involves use electrophoresis separate rna samples size detection hybridization probe complementary part entire target sequence strictly speaking term northern blot refers specifically capillary transfer rna electrophoresis gel blotting membrane however entire process commonly referred northern northern blot technique developed james alwine david kemp george stark stanford northern blotting takes name similarity first blotting technique southern blot named biologist edwin major difference rna rather dna analyzed northern general blotting starts extraction total rna homogenized tissue sample cells eukaryotic mrna isolated use oligo dt cellulose chromatography isolate rnas polya rna samples separated gel electrophoresis since gels fragile probes unable enter matrix rna samples separated size transferred nylon membrane capillary vacuum blotting system nylon membrane positive charge effective use northern blotting since negatively charged nucleic acids high affinity transfer buffer used blotting usually contains formamide lowers annealing temperature proberna
