inbred strains also called inbred lines rarely animals linear animals individuals particular species nearly identical genotype due long inbreeding strain inbred undergone least generations brother x sister offspring x parent mating point least loci individual strain homozygous individual treated effectively clones inbred strains bred generations leaving individuals population isogenic inbred strains animals frequently used laboratories experiments reproducibility conclusions test animals similar possible however experiments genetic diversity test population may desired thus outbred strains laboratory animals also available outbred strain strain organism effectively wildtype nature little inbreeding certain plants including genetic model organism arabidopsis thaliana naturally selfpollinate makes quite easy create inbred strains laboratory plants including important genetic models maize require transfer pollen one flower inbred strains extensively used research several nobel prizes awarded work probably could done without inbred strains work includes medawars research immune tolerance kohler milsteins development monoclonal antibodies doherty zinkernagels studies major histocompatibility complex isogenic organisms identical near identical true inbred strains since normally least similarity generation exceedingly high uniformity means fewer individuals required produce results level statistical significance inbred line used comparison outbred line breeding inbred strains often towards specific phenotypes interest behavioural traits like alcohol preference physical traits like aging selected traits make easier use experiments like easy use transgenic one key strengths using inbred strains model strains readily available whatever study one performing resources jackson laboratory flybase one look strains specific phenotypes genotypes among inbred lines recombinant lines coisogenic strains embryos lines little interest currently frozen preserved interest unique genotypical phenotypical analysis linkage quantitative traits recombinant lines useful isogenic nature genetic similarity individuals allows replication quantitative trait locus analysis replication increases precision results mapping experiment required traits aging minor changes environment influence longevity organism leading variation one type inbred strain either altered naturally mutated different single strains useful analysis variance within inbred strain inbred strains differences would due single genetic change difference environmental conditions two individuals one specific uses drosophila inbred strains use lines driver system expressed specific tissues specific conditions based location drosophila genome expressed increase expression genes uas sequence specific normally found drosophila meaning researcher test expression transgenic gene different tissues breeding desired uas line line intended expression pattern unknown expression patterns also determined using green fluorescent protein gfp protein expressed uas drosophila particular thousands lines unique specific expression patterns making possible test expression patterns within inbreeding animals sometimes lead genetic drift continuous overlaying like genetics exposes recessive gene patterns often lead changes reproduction performance fitness ability survive decrease areas known inbreeding depression hybrid two inbred strains used cancel deleterious recessive genes resulting increase mentioned areas known inbred strains small populations homozygous individuals susceptible fixation new mutations genetic drift jackson laboratory information session genetic drift mice calculated quick estimate rate mutation based observed traits phenotypic mutation every generations though caution likely underrepresentation data used visible phenotypic changes phenotype changes inside mice strains add statistically every generations mutation coding sequence fixed

mathematical theory inbreeding wright developed method path coefficients used develop mathematical theory inbreeding wright introduced inbreeding coefficient f correlation uniting gametes subsequent theory inbreeding developed work definition inbreeding coefficient widely used mathematically equivalent japanese medaka fish high tolerance inbreeding one line bred brothersister many generations without evidence inbreeding depression providing ready tool laboratory research genetic manipulations key features medaka make valuable laboratory include transparency early stages growth embryo larvae juveniles allowing observation development organs systems within body organism grows also include ease chimeric organism made variety genetic approaches like cell implantation growing embryo allowing study chimeric transgenic strains medaka within though many traits zebrafish worthwhile study including regeneration relatively inbred strains zebrafish possibly experience greater effects
