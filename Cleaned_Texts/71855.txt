respiratory pigs later outbreaks caused respiratory illness humans increasing likelihood humantohuman transmission indicating existence dangerous strains virus outbreak nipah virus occurred among pig farmers majority human infections stemmed direct contact sick pigs unprotected handling secretions pigs based seroprevalence data virus isolations primary reservoir nipah virus identified pteropid
