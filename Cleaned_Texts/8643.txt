transmission transfer behavioral traits one individual another genes transferred organism parents fertilization egg seen genetic transmission occur lifetime thus genetic transmission quite slow compared relative speed cultural transmission cultural transmission behavioral information passed means verbal visual written methods teaching therefore cultural transmission new behaviors learned many organisms matter days hours rather many years reproduction would take behavior spread among organisms genetic transmissioncitation needed culture transmitted among animals various methods common include imitation teaching language imitation one prevalent modes cultural transmission nonhuman animals teaching language much less widespread food acquisition techniques meerkats suricata suricatta

languagebased culture animalscitation needed beginning modern era animal culture research middle century came gradual acceptance term culture referring animals japans leading primatologist time kinji imanishi first introduced idea kaluchua preculture referring famous potatowashing behavior japanese imanishi colleagues began studying macaques across japan began notice differences among different

colleagues observed among different groups macaques may suggest arisen part groups unique famous eating behaviors observed island koshima one young female observed carrying soiled sweet potatoes small stream proceeded wash sand dirt eating behavior observed one monkeys playmates mother playmates potatowashing eventually spread throughout whole macaque colony imanishi introduced japanese term kaluchua later translated masao kawai others refer behavior acquired precultural researchers caution must overestimate situation say monkeys culture confuse human point observed behaviors animals like observed imanishi related survival waycitation needed first evidence apparently arbitrary traditions came also behavior primates time researchers mcgrew tutin found social grooming handclasp behavior prevalent certain troop chimpanzees tanzania found groups grooming behavior involved one chimpanzee taking hold hand another lifting air allowing two groom others armpits though would seem make grooming armpits easier behavior actually apparent advantage primatologist frans de waal explains later observations handclasp grooming behavior different group chimpanzees unique property handclasp grooming posture required grooming armpit another individual thus appears yield obvious benefits rewards prior findings opponents idea animal culture argued behaviors called cultural simply behaviors evolutionarily evolved due importance survival identification initial nonevolutionarily advantageous evidence culture scientists began find differences group behaviors traditions various groups
