behavioral ecology adaptive behavior behavior contributes directly indirectly individuals reproductive success thus subject forces natural examples include favoring kin altruistic behaviors sexual selection fit mate defending territory harem rivals conversely nonadaptive behavior behavior counterproductive individuals survival reproductive success examples might include altruistic behaviors favor kin adoption unrelated young subordinate dominance hierarchy adaptations commonly defined evolved solutions recurrent environmental problems survival individual differences commonly arise heritable nonheritable adaptive behavior proven influential evolution species adaptive behaviors although nonheritable adaptation remains controversial populations change process evolution individual population unique role particular environment role commonly known ecological niche simply organism lives environment relation successive generations organism must adapt surrounding conditions order develop niche organisms niche evolve changes external environment occur successful species nature able use adaptive behaviors build prior knowledge thereby increasing overall knowledge bank turn improve overall survival reproductive success many species ability adapt organisms often learn various psychological cognitive processes operant classical conditioning discrimination learning process allows organisms modify behavior survive unpredictable organisms begin naive individuals learning allows obtain knowledge need adapt survive important remember learned adaptive behavior must psychological well biological component without integration two disciplines behavioral adaptation occur kin selection commonly referred altruism example adaptive behavior directly influences genetic composition population involves evolutionary strategies favor persistence organisms relatives often cost organisms survival result population gene frequency variation successive generations based interactions related individuals probability altruism increases cost low donor high level gain beneficiary addition individuals often display altruistic behaviors relative genetically similar means offspring siblings likely benefit altruism someone distantly related cousin aunt kin selection played large role evolution social adaptive behaviors chimpanzees closely related chimpanzees form kin group cooperates protect territory thereby increasing access females working together close relatives ensure genes persist next generation even circumstances make unable reproduce behavioral adaptation coincides chimpanzees ability distinguish kin nonkin referred visual kin selection allowing chimps formulate large complex societies use altruistic methods ensure genes persist future wide variety species including lions honeybees insects displayed kin selection adaptive mentioned chimpanzees work together closely related kin protect defending territory rivals known territoriality learnt adaptive behavior performed several ecological species advantage territorial varies depending species interest underlying principle always increase overall many species display territoriality order acquire food compete mates safest lair bird song example learned territorial defense studies show birds highquality songs use stimulus deter predators territorial higher quality songs proven act best defense mechanism variety bird species redwinged blackbird agelaius therefore correct learning birdsong early life necessary territory defense birds european beavers castor fiber another species use territory defense protective territory spend great deal time energy familiarizing location building habitat beavers developed technique scentmarking way intimidate scent acts psychological fence thereby decreasing possibility injury death predation debate whether exists biological component associated learning process ecological adaptive behavior many researchers suggest biological psychological disciplines integrated others believe nonheritable component strictly psychological argue nonheritable traits evolve successive organisms also express heritable adaptive behaviors behaviors encoded genes inherited parents gives organisms ability respond situations innate response mechanisms using mechanisms respond appropriately internal external environment without heritable adaptive behavior evolves natural selection case genes better equip individuals respond environmental physiological cues thereby increasing reproductive success causing genes persist future generations nonadaptive behaviors cause decrease reproductive success genes lost future adaptive nonadaptive characteristics arise random mutation recombination andor genetic essentially natural selection mechanism contributes directional gene selection individuals reproduce traits cause greater reproductive success organism favored whereas reduce reproductive success selected contrast learning natural selection solely biological concept biological genetic component allows adaptive behavior inherited connection environment form adaptive behavior commonly considered ecological studies therefore natural selection often used explain ecological adaptive behavior organisms kin selection nonheritable direct result environment sexual selection heritable adaptive behavior therefore acted upon natural selection sexual selection refers specifically competition many traits features characteristic certain species explained sexual selection adaptive behavior competition mates results specific traits species able successfully compete obtain mate reproduce pass genes next generation therefore speciesspecific genetic traits must inherited allowing individuals successful designated environments many environmental examples sexual selection adaptive behavior one popular example sexual dimorphism sexual dimorphism morphological phenotypic difference males females common example sexual dimorphism difference body sexual dimorphism specifically seen fish species lamprologus male fish substantially larger sometimes times female males increased size advantageous larger individuals able compete females subsequently defend offspring grow inside empty snail shells basically larger male fish greater adaptive benefit advantage larger powerful demonstrated males ability compete protect contrast males female fish must remain small order lay eggs inside snail evident size plays significant role reproductive success particular fish large size common adaptive behavioral trait inherited sexual selection reproduction demonstrated lamprologus callipterus sexually dimorphic species proven adaptive behavior crucial process natural selection thus important evolutionary process species possess positive adaptive behaviors inherently acquire evolutionary advantages example adaptive behavior mechanism population natural communities organisms able interact creating
