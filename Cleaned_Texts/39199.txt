dentin hypersensitivity dental pain sharp character short duration arising exposed dentin surfaces response stimuli typically thermal evaporative tactile osmotic chemical electrical ascribed dental degree dentin sensitivity normal pain usually experienced everyday activities like drinking cooled drink therefore although terms dentin sensitivity sensitive dentin used interchangeably refer dental latter term accurate pain sharp sudden response external common trigger people hypersensitivity reporting pain upon application cold types stimuli may also trigger pain dentin hypersensitivity including frequency severity pain occurs real cause dentine hypersensitivity controversial several theories put forward try explain cause dentine hypersensitivity include odontoblastic transduction theory neural theory hydrodynamic commonly accepted model called hydrodynamic fluid movement theory proposed brannstrom according theory exposed dentine surface subjected thermal chemical tactile evaporative stimuli flow fluid within tubules fluid movement inside dentinal tubules may away towards pulp dentine contains many thousands microscopic tubular structures radiate outwards pulp dentinal tubules typically micrometres diameter changes flow plasmalike biological fluid present dentinal tubules trigger mechanoreceptors present nerves located pulpal aspect thereby eliciting pain response hydrodynamic flow increased cold air pressure drying sugar sour dehydrating chemicals forces acting tooth hot cold food drinks physical pressure typical triggers individuals teeth sensitivity movement dentinal fluid away pulp caused triggers cold drying movement towards pulp caused heat research shown triggers causing dentinal fluid move away pulp elicit painful odontoblastic transduction theory suggested rapp et al puts forward idea odontoblasts act receptor cells conduct impulses via synaptic junctions end nerves therefore cause feeling pain however much evidence support theory neural theory proposes thermal mechanical stimuli directly influence nerve endings within dentinal tubules via direct communication nerve endings pulp two common ways dentine exposed gingival recession tooth main cause dh gingival recession receding gums exposure root surfaces loss cementum layer smear layer receding gums sign longterm trauma excessive forceful toothbrushing abrasive toothpaste dental abrasion sign chronic periodontitis gum less common cause acid erosion loss hard dental tissues due acids eg related gastroesophageal reflux disease bulimia excessive consumption acidic foods drinks repeated exposures low ph cause mineral content teeth outer layer enamel dissolve therefore leaving dentine exposed leading hypersensitivity causes include dental bleaching smoking tobacco lead recession therefore sensitivity cracked teeth abfraction grinding teeth evidence abfraction may shown wedge shaped defects developed cervical region teeth known abfraction lesions direct relationship

irritation pulp causing degree reversible common causes sensitive teeth diagnosis dh may diagnosis exclusion reached possible explanations pain ruled thorough patient history clinical examination examination includes pain provocation test blasting air dental instrument onto sensitive area gentle scratching dental negative result pain provocation test occurs treatment dentinal hypersensitivity indicated another diagnosis sought causes orofacial inflammation dental pulp termed pulpitis produces true hypersensitivity nerves dental pulpitis classified irreversible pulpal inflammation irreversibly progress pulpal necrosis due compression venous microcirculation tissue ischemia reversible pulp still capable returning healthy noninflamed state although usually dental treatment required irreversible pulpitis readily distinguishable dh poorly localized severe pain aggravated thermal stimuli continues stimulus removed also typically spontaneous pain without stimulus reversible pulpitis may readily distinguishable dh however usually obvious sign carious cavity crack etc indicates pulpitis contrast pulpitis pain dh short sharp gingival recession cervical tooth wear main causes dentine hypersensitivity lead exposure dentinal tubules avoided healthy dietary oral hygiene practices using nontraumatic toothbrushing technique ie recommended technique modified bass technique rather indiscriminately brushing teeth gums rough scrubbing motion help prevent receding gums tooth wear around cervical margin teeth nonabrasive fluoridecontaining toothpastes used least twice daily two minutes time consumption acidic foods drinks avoided possible otherwise limited mealtimes afterwards mouth rinsed still water importantly teeth brushed immediately acidic foods drinks ideally least minutes afterwards recommended anyone suffers acid reflux seek medical treatment prevent mouth acidic environment nonabrasive diet also help prevent tooth wear commonly teeth whitening products cause sensitivity however increased sensitivity temporary cease within days sensitivity experienced using tooth whitening product taking break may universally accepted goldstandard treatment reliably relieves pain dental hypersensitivity long term consequently many treatments suggested varying degrees efficacy scientifically studied generally divided inoffice ie intended applied dentist dental therapist treatments carried home available overthecounter prescription otc products suited generalized mild moderate dentin hypersensitivity associated several teeth inoffice treatments localized severe dh associated one two teeth noninvasive simple treatments carried home attempted inoffice procedures carried purported mechanism action treatments either occlusion dentin tubules eg

dentifrices potassium salts mouthwashes chewing gums variety toothpastes marketed dentin hypersensitivity including compounds strontium chloride strontium acetate arginine calcium carbonate hydroxyapatite calcium sodium phosphosilicate desensitizing chewing gums mouthwashes also marketed potassiumcontaining toothpastes common however mechanism may reduce hypersensitivity unclear animal research demonstrated potassium ions placed deep dentin cavities cause nerve depolarization prevent repolarization known effect would occur twicedaily transient small increase potassium ions saliva brushing potassiumcontaining toothpaste creates individuals dentin hypersensitivity associated exposed root surfaces brushing twice daily toothpaste containing potassium nitrate six eight weeks reduces reported sensitivity tactile thermal air blast stimuli however meta analysis reported individuals subjective report sensitivity significantly change six eight weeks using potassium nitrate toothpaste desensitizing toothpastes containing potassium nitrate used since toothpastes potassium chloride potassium citrate available since least believed potassium ions diffuse along dentinal tubules inactivate intradental nerves however confirmed intact human teeth desensitizing mechanism potassiumcontaining toothpastes remains uncertain since several trials shown potassiumcontaining toothpastes effective reducing dentin hypersensitivity although rinsing mouth brushing may reduce efficacy studies found mouthwashes containing potassium salts fluorides reduce dentine hypersensitivity randomized clinical trial published found promising results controlling reducing hypersensitivity potassium oxalate mouthrinse used conjugation toothbrushing controlled study effects
