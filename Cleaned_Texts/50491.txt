reverses thymus involution testosterone advancing thymus thymic involution remains evolutionary mystery since occurs vertebrates despite negative effects since induced senescence many scientists hypothesized may evolutionary pressures organ involute hypotheses follows developing cells interact strongly antigen presented within thymus induced undergo programmed cell death intended effect deletion selfreactive cells works well antigen presented within thymus truly self origin antigen pathogenic microbes happens infiltrate thymus potential subvert entire process rather deleting cells would cause autoimmunity cells capable eliminating infiltrating pathogen deleted instead proposed one way minimize problem produce many longlived cells possible time life thymus likely pristine generally would organisms young protection functional maternal immune thus mice humans example best time prodigiously functional thymus prior birth turn well known theory evolution senescence strong selection enhanced early function readily accommodates antagonistic pleiotropy deleterious later occurring effects thus potentially accounting especially early demise thymus disposable soma hypothesis life history hypothesis say similarly tradeoffs involved thymic involution since immune system must compete bodily systems notably reproduction limited physiological resources body must invest immune system differentially different stages life high immunological investment youth since immunological memory also hypotheses suggest thymic involution directly adaptive example hypotheses proposed
