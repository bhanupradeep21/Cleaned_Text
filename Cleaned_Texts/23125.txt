conventional bili lights shine baby biliblanket consists fiberoptic blanket designed transfer light lamp unit around babys body commonly used home jaundice hyperbilirubinemia common newborn babies presents yellow discoloration skin whites eyes sclera jaundice occurs roughly infantscitation needed condition also causes babies appear sick experience difficulty waking make highpitch cries able fed gain weightmedical citation needed bilirubin orange yellow bile pigment produced byproduct hemoglobin red blood cells break hemolysis bilirubin metabolized liver recycled excreted bowel movements baby jaundice hyperbilirubinemia indicate babys body producing excess bilirubin liver immature able eliminate bilirubin fast feeding particular breastfeeding baby often first days birth help lower chances developing jaundice since baby pass stool milk provides energy liver allow metabolism bilirubin uncontrolled levels bilirubin harmful neonatal jaundice shows first week birth nevertheless bilirubin levels become exceedingly high substance may move blood cross blood brain barrier collect brain tissue damaging babys brain cells condition known acute bilirubin acute bilirubin encephalopathy addressed promptly kernicterus syndrome develop cause permanent brain rare situations baby may experience seizures deafness cerebral palsy mental jaundice prevented treated majority cases jaundice dangerous certain cases babies born prematurely weeks gestation babies underweight less grams birth babies going infection babies experienced difficult delivery bruises since replacing breaking red blood cells higher rate babies blood group compatible jaundice babies disappear within one two weeks without treatment however babies severe jaundice treatment required traditional phototherapy devices include blue leds halogen white light fluorescent tubes biliblanket phototherapy home treatment consists portable illuminator fiberoptic pad uses pad woven fibers transfer light baby order treat neonatal jaundice hyperbilirubimia uses visible light transform bilirubin watersoluble form allows dissolve easily water eliminated therapy lowers serum bilirubin level baby placed fiberoptic pad disposable cover direct contact babys skincitation needed fiberoptic pad exposes skin light bilirubin eliminated light biliblanket releases waves blue white light absorbed skin bilirubin breaks eliminated babys blood streamcitation needed lowers yellowing effect babys eyes afterwards blood needs tested observe bilirubin levels decide whether biliblanket still needed majority babies need biliblanket use several days depends babys condition even though biliblanket may cause loose stools skin rashes considered safe part device mostly used days severe situations intravenous fluids may needed given patient phototherapy uses photons energy infused absorbed bilirubin located superficial capillaries subcutaneous tissues interstitial spaces skin photochemical reactions transform bilirubin nontoxic isomers polar watersoluble therefore excreted without metabolized liver urinary gastrointestinal elimination remain important process reducing bilirubin one common side effect experienced babies receiving phototherapy treatment frequent loose stools color stools usually greenish color however normal way bilirubin removed body bilirubin levels return normal phototherapy longer needed frequency bowel movements color stools return severe long term side effects rare non existent could correlation conditions allergyasthma patent ductus arteriosus retinopathy statistical

bidirectional fiberoptic phototherapy blanketcitation needed different types phototherapy jaundice involve blue light varying types light wavelengths degrees irradiance light waves promote breakdown bilirubin allow compared standard forms phototherapy biliblanket utilizes fiberoptic system allowing used homecitation needed biliblanket system consists three components illuminator fiberoptic pad disposable pad covercitation needed fiberoptic pad used transport blue white light light source illuminator directly onto babys biliblanket setup consists light generator termed light box fibreoptic

home since home phototherapy recommended option readmission hospital american national biliblanket safe used hours day long therapy required however duration phototherapy vary individual individual based babys current condition disease state also depend physicians clinical blood tests may required daily phototherapy assess bilirubin levels determine normal levels reached whether phototherapy stopped bilirubin levels normal babys skin return normal one advantage biliblanket used home cases babys condition severe parents given biliblanket set use home provides comfortable convenient setting since parents baby stay hospital home treatment proven improve bonding reduce stress among parents reduce costs advantages biliblanket easily transported used baby sleeping eating held promotes
