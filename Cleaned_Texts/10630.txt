exchange blaster fire like ran colorcoding onscreen sense direction blaster fire used depict opposing forces star wars original trilogy rebels employed red blaster fire often attack left empire also employed red blaster fire using green blaster fire tie fighters attack right star wars episode ii attack clones second film prequel trilogy color direction reversed film republic employed green blue blaster fire attack right separatists employed red blaster fire attack inner workings blasters essentially create particle beams pierce melt disintegrate trigger pulled highenergy gas excited power cell converted plasma plasma fired collimating components barrel galven circuitry focusing lens emerge coherent energy bolt held together via magnetic bottle effect however bolts inherent instability limiting factor precision aiming start lose coherence traveling target plasma dissipates longer barrel collimating components fitted rectify problems increased range prolonged use also result overheating counteracted utilizing alloys greater heat employing heatdispersal cooling packs blaster weaponry vary intensity output generating bolts greater destructive power corresponding tradeoffs example blaster rifle used clone troopers blast hole ft wide wall made fictional material ferroconcrete set maximum power consumes gas reduces ammunition capacity shots powerful blaster bolt also generates recoil make difficult use different types gas used blaster ammunition fictional tibanna gas found lower atmosphere bespin used power weapons also results different coloration depending gas used least expensive type gas generate redcolored particle beams expensive gases produce green particle blaster small arms come range sizes small handheld blasters carbines larger laser rifles equipped features targeting scope flash noise others highly customizable like blaster rifle used rebel commandos scarif removable shoulder stock swappable barrels different sizes certain modifications however considered inhumane banned civilized worlds trandoshan doubler tripler added barrel blaster pistol turns devastating hand crewserved blasters also exist example eweb heavy repeating blaster deployed snowtroopers hoth powerful repeating blaster employed empire weapon requires crew two set power generator rigid mount counteract fearsome weapons larger versions blaster weaponry star wars universe referred blaster cannons laser cannons commonly found vehicles starfighters spacecraft two laser cannons considered powerful possess greater laser cannons republic laat gunship example fire bolts five gigajoules destructive laser cannons may also fitted fixed emplacements defend area attack like golan arms antiinfantry battery employed rebel defenders battle hoth cannons effective range km mi take entire squad infantry single powerful form laser cannon turbolaser found star wars capital ships operating principles larger power generators multiperson crews weapons used penetrate defenses capital ships conduct planetary turbolasers vary power intensity depending needs mission simply crippling target outright vaporizing true warships like venatorclass star destroyer able feed nearly entire reactor output heavy weaponry fleet warships reduce upper crust planet molten slag part base delta zero laser device emits beam coherent light target controlling containing direction light energy also known synchronization concentration energy one direction gives strong sometimes powerful lasers different uses military purposes many strongly differ seen star wars still follow concepts concentrating energy andor material within limited magnetic major difference recently current laser technology emit lasers separate bolts single rays whereas star wars depicts additionally rhett allai associate professor physics southeastern louisiana university argues energy bolts fail fit definition laser explains many ways laser cannons star wars actually defy rules however paper richard e russo national laboratory berkeley california discusses functions lasers mildly argues star wars depiction lasers researchers laser centre institute physical chemistry polish academy

less one billionth second combined still images film laser powerful intense resulted air ionized interaction pulse plasma generates light many different wavelengths appears recent advanced development involved students macquarie university australia developed method multiplying laser power use diamonds concept similar fictional kyber crystals used star wars universe power laser weapons smaller
