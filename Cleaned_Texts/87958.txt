iron deficiency sideropenia state body lacks enough iron supply needs iron present cells human body several vital functions carrying oxygen tissues lungs key component hemoglobin protein acting transport medium electrons within cells form cytochromes facilitating oxygen enzyme reactions various tissues little iron interfere vital functions lead morbidity total body iron averages approximately g men g women blood plasma iron carried tightly bound protein transferrin several mechanisms control iron metabolism safeguard iron deficiency main regulatory mechanism situated gastrointestinal tract majority iron absorption occurs duodenum first section small intestine number dietary factors may affect iron absorption loss iron sufficiently compensated intake iron diet state iron deficiency develops time state uncorrected leads irondeficiency anemia common type anemia occurs medical condition iron deficiency without anemia called latent iron deficiency lid anemia condition characterized inadequate red blood cells erythrocytes hemoglobin body lacks sufficient amounts iron production protein hemoglobin reduced hemoglobin binds oxygen enabling red blood cells supply oxygenated blood throughout body women childbearing children people poor diet susceptible disease cases irondeficiency anemia mild treated cause problems like irregular heartbeat pregnancy complications delayed growth infants children could affect cognitive development symptoms iron deficiency occur even condition progressed iron deficiency anemia symptoms iron deficiency unique iron deficiency ie pathognomonic iron needed many enzymes function normally wide range symptoms may eventually emerge either secondary result anemia primary results iron deficiency symptoms iron deficiency includecitation needed continued iron deficiency may progress anemia worsening fatigue thrombocytosis elevated platelet count also result lack sufficient iron levels blood one reason people donate blood though genetic defects causing iron deficiency studied rodents known genetic disorders human iron metabolism directly cause iron deficiency possible reasons athletics may contribute lower iron levels includes mechanical hemolysis destruction red blood cells physical impact loss iron sweat urine gastrointestinal blood loss haematuria presence blood although small amounts iron excreted sweat urine losses generally seen insignificant even increased sweat urine production especially considering athletes bodies appear become conditioned retain iron mechanical hemolysis likely occur highimpact sports especially among longdistance runners experience footstrike hemolysis repeated impact feet ground exerciseinduced gastrointestinal bleeding likely occur endurance athletes haematuria athletes likely occur undergo repetitive impacts body particularly affecting feet running hard road kendo hands eg conga candombe drumming additionally athletes sports emphasize weight loss eg ballet gymnastics marathon running cycling well sports emphasize highcarbohydrate lowfat diets may increased risk iron us federal survey food consumption determined women men age average iron consumption foods beverages mgday respectively women age range years consumed less estimated average requirement ear men ages fewer consumption data updated us government survey reported men women ages older average iron intakes respectively people us usually obtain adequate amounts iron diets however subgroups like infants young children teenaged girls pregnant women premenopausal women risk obtaining less socioeconomic racial differences affect rates iron iron needed bacterial growth making bioavailability important factor controlling blood plasma result carries iron tightly bound transferrin taken cells endocytosing transferrin thus preventing access percent protein content human milk consists binds iron comparison cows milk percent result breastfed babies fewer lactoferrin also concentrated tears saliva wounds bind iron limit bacterial growth egg white contains conalbumin withhold bacteria get egg shell reason prior antibiotics egg white used treat reduce bacterial growth

risk death cause including cardiovascular whether may alter number people may require blood transfusion mild iron deficiency prevented corrected eating ironrich foods cooking iron skillet iron requirement plants animals wide range foods provide iron good sources dietary iron heme iron easily absorbed inhibited medication dietary components two examples red meat nonheme sources contain iron though reduced bioavailability examples lentils beans leafy vegetables pistachios tofu fortified bread fortified breakfast cereals iron different foods absorbed processed differently body instance iron meat heme iron source easily absorbed iron grains vegetables nonheme iron minerals chemicals one type food may also inhibit absorption iron another type food eaten example oxalates phytic acid form insoluble complexes bind iron gut absorbed iron plant sources less easily absorbed hemebound iron animal sources vegetarians vegans somewhat higher total daily iron intake eat meat fish legumes darkgreen leafy vegetables like broccoli kale asian greens especially good sources iron vegetarians vegans however spinach swiss chard contain oxalates bind iron making almost entirely unavailable
