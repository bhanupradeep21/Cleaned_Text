proterosuchus quadrupedal reptile sprawling could reach total length meters proterosuchus fergusi largest known proterosuchid skull length cm possible body length like reptiles proterosuchus scaly proterosuchus proportionally large head long neck compared distinctive characteristic head strongly hooked snout formed downturned premaxilla contained nine teeth adults teeth snout tip splayed jaws proterosuchus contained numerous teeth premaxillary maxillary dentary teeth teeth proterosuchus recurved labiolingually compressed serrated archosauriforms isodont equal size shape adult individuals juveniles teeth less strongly curved back skull proterosuchus exhibits many features characteristic position basal archosauriform bears prominent antorbital fenestra like archosauriforms specimens jugal quadratojugal contact complete ventral margin lower temporal fenestra archosauriforms specimens narrow gap bones lower temporal bar incomplete nonarchosauriform lower jaw bears small external mandibular fenestra another characteristic archosauriforms closest lifestyle proterosuchus debated conventionally depicted semiaquatic ambush predator similar modern crocodiles however lived arid environment many aspects anatomy conflict semiaquatic particular limbs wellossified terrestrial animals nostrils laterallypositioned snout dorsallypositioned histology bones reminiscent terrestrial animals semiaquatic however support semiaquatic lifestyle comes brain anatomy resembles semiaquatic predators crocodiles closely terrestrial reptiles orientation ear canals suggests neutral head posture snout angled upward would raised nostrils high enough animal breathe largely however utility orientation semicircular canal determining head posture habitat preference proterosuchus predator specifics diet known suggested eaten fish abundant contemporary dicynodont function hooked snout proterosuchus fully known likely use sexual social signaling similar hooked snout male salmon snout appear sexually dimorphic may example mutual sexual selection snout may used specialized method predation exhibits high resistance dorsoventral however method may unclear premaxillary teeth show wear facets occlude teeth lower jaw indicating used abrasive activities could used grip prey snout tip pressure receptors present crocodilians proterosuchus mesopic vision indicating adapted see well bright dim light mesopic vision characteristic cathemeral animals active night day crepuscular animals active twilight adaptations see dim light may ancestral archosaurs proterosuchus may early example however proterosuchus lived near antarctic circle mesopic vision may instead adaptation highly seasonal day lengths hearing proterosuchus likely adapted lower frequencies modern crocodiles due lowsensitivity hearing proterosuchus probably rely heavily vocal communication may relatively solitary based size olfactory bulbs proterosuchus strong sense smell similar modern crocodiles however olfactory bulbs large relative tasmaniosaurus suggesting different habits potentially aquatic ecology metabolism proterosuchus disputed like crocopod archosauromorphs proterosuchus higher metabolic rate extant furthermore proterosuchus possessed fibrolamellar bone indicative high growth rate corresponding high however studies conflict whether metabolism proterosuchus within range extant metabolic rate lower crocopods except ectothermic phytosaurs crocodilians may adaptation crocodilelike predatory proterosuchus grew quickly probably reached sexual maturity within year roughly twothirds maximum adult body rapid growth rates typical early triassic archosauromorphs may adaptation surviving hostile environment early juvenile proterosuchus may hunted different prey
