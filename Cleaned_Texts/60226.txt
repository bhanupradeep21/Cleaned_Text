clidastes extinct genus marine lizard belonging mosasaur family classified part mosasaurinae subfamily alongside genera like mosasaurus prognathodon clidastes known deposits ranging age coniacian early campanian united states clidastes means locked vertebrae originates greek noun κλειδί kleid meaning key akin latin claudere meaning shut refers vertebral processes allow proximal heads vertebrae interlock stability strength swimming one earliest hydropedalnote mosasaurs representing one first properly marine predatory forms alongside early hydropedal genera like tylosaurus likely agile swimmer preyed upon cephalopods fish small vertebrates shallow water isotopic analysis teeth specimens suggested genus platecarpus may entered freshwater occasionally like modern sea clidastes one smallest mosasaurs smallest known dallasaurus averaging meters ft length largest specimens reaching meters feet generic name refers vertebral processes allow proximal heads vertebrae interlock stability strength swimming even though vertebrae lock together living animal would still range motion horizontal plane sufficient allow high quality swimming shallow additionally strengthening tail entire backbone allowed muscle attachments help swimming possessed delicate slim form expansion neural spines chevrons near tip tail enabled chase fastest prey due wellrepresented wellstudied genus
