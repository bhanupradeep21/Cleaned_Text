floaters eye floaters sometimes visible deposits eg shadows tiny structures protein cell debris projected onto retina within eyes vitreous humour vitreous normally transparent vitreous become particularly noticeable looking blank surface open monochromatic space blue sky floater measured size shape consistency refractive index also called muscae volitantes latin flying flies mouches volantes phrase vitreous usually starts transparent imperfections may gradually develop one ages common type floater present peoples eyes due degenerative changes vitreous perception floaters may annoying problematic people known less commonly myodaeopsia myiodeopsia myiodesopsia often treated except severe cases vitrectomy surgery laser vitreolysis medication may effective floaters visible either shadows imperfections cast refraction light passes appear alone together several others clump ones visual field may appear spots threads fragments cobwebs float slowly observers eyes move especially direction eyes objects exist within eye optical illusions entoptic phenomena caused eye confused visual snow similar static television screen although two conditions may coexist part number visual disturbances include starbursts trails afterimages floaters objects pockets liquid within vitreous humour thick fluid gel fills vitreous retina vitreous humour vitreous body jellylike transparent substance fills majority eye lies within vitreous chamber behind lens one four optical components thus floaters follow rapid motions eye drifting slowly within pocket first noticed natural

although blood vessels eye also obstruct light invisible normal circumstances fixed location relative retina brain tunes stabilized images neural floaters particularly noticeable looking blank surface open monochromatic space blue sky despite name floaters many specks tendency sink toward bottom eyeball whichever way eyeball oriented supine position looking lying back tends concentrate near fovea center gaze textureless evenly lit sky forms ideal background view brightness daytime sky also causes eyes pupils contract reducing aperture makes floaters less blurry easier see floaters present birth usually remain lifelong appear later may disappear within weeks uncommon cause serious problems survey optometrists suggested average patients per month per optometrist presented symptoms floaters however floaters nuisance distraction severe cases especially spots seem constantly drift field vision shapes shadows projected onto retina tiny structures protein cell debris discarded years trapped vitreous humour vitreous retina floaters even seen eyes closed especially bright days sufficient light penetrates eyelids cast shadowscitation needed however elderly persons troubled floaters also become problem younger people especially also common cataract operations traumacitation needed floaters able catch refract light ways somewhat blur vision temporarily floater moves different area often trick persons troubled floaters thinking see something corner eye really persons come terms problem time learn ignore floaters persons severe floaters nearly impossible ignore completely large masses constantly stay within almost direct viewcitation needed case young people particularly symptomatic floaters likely suspended within posterior region eye known premacular bursa floaters appear welldefined usually bear appearance crystal worm cobweb due proximity retina floaters significant effect visual field patients addition floaters often central visual axis moves intravitreal currents

increase numbers andor severely affect vision one treatments may necessary insufficient evidence available compare safety efficacy surgical vitrectomy laser vitreolysis treatment floaters cochrane review find relevant studies compared two aggressive marketing campaigns promoted use laser vitreolysis treatment strong evidence currently exists treatment floaters laser vitreolysis strongest available evidence comparing two treatment modalities retrospective case vitrectomy may successful treating severe technique usually involves making three openings part sclera known pars plana small gauge instruments one infusion port resupply saline solution maintain pressure eye second fiber optic light source third vitrector vitrector reciprocating cutting tip attached suction device design reduces traction retina via vitreous material variant sutureless selfsealing technique sometimes used like invasive surgical procedures however vitrectomy carries risk including retinal detachment
