endometriosis complications major cause female infertility endometriosis dysfunction characterized migration endometrial tissue areas outside endometrium uterus common places find stray tissue ovaries fallopian tubes followed organs lower abdominal cavity bladder intestines typically endometrial tissue adheres exteriors organs creates attachments scar tissue called adhesions join adjacent organs together endometrial tissue adhesions block fallopian tube prevent meeting ovum sperm cells otherwise interfere fertilization implantation rarely carrying fetus term endometriosis estimated occur women associated risk infertility endometriosis commonly classified revised american society reproductive medicine system minimal endometriosis severe endometriosis therapy management endometriosis infertility based severity endometriosis often presents diverse array symptoms dysmenorrhea pain menstruation cyclical pelvic pain generalized pain lower abdomen predictably worsens menstruation dyspareunia pain intercourse infertility inability achieve pregnancy unprotected intercourse year one suggested pathophysiologic mechanism involves retrograde menstruation endometrial interactions peritoneal inflammatory cytokines promote ectopic implantation growth endometrial tissue outside women experience phenomenon normal cycles rendering many susceptible endometriosis women undergoing tubal ligation surgeries visually apparent clinically asymptomatic endometrial poor correlation extent ectopic implantation symptom severity makes early detection intervention challenging women presenting symptom infertility often diagnoses delayed beyond average window years gold standard diagnosing endometriosis diagnostic laparoscopy minimally invasive procedure involves camera entering

several classification systems rate prognosis currently revised american society reproductive medicine rasrm classification globally accepted widely used system classification endometriosis uses
