speaker recognition identification person characteristics used answer question speaking term voice refer speaker recognition speech recognition speaker verification also called speaker authentication contrasts identification speaker recognition differs speaker diarisation recognizing speaker speaking recognizing speaker simplify task translating speech systems trained specific voices used authenticate verify identity speaker part security process speaker recognition history dating back four decades uses acoustic features speech found differ individuals acoustic patterns reflect anatomy learned behavioral patterns two major applications speaker recognition technologies methodologies speaker claims certain identity voice used verify claim called verification authentication hand identification task determining unknown speakers identity sense speaker verification match one speakers voice matched particular template whereas speaker identification match voice compared multiple templates security perspective identification different verification speaker verification usually employed gatekeeper order provide access secure system systems operate users knowledge typically require cooperation speaker identification systems also implemented covertly without users knowledge identify talkers discussion alert automated systems speaker changes check user already enrolled system etc forensic applications common first perform speaker identification process create list best matches perform series verification processes determine conclusive match working match samples speaker list best matches helps figure person based amount similarities differences prosecution defense use evidence determine suspect actually one earliest training technologies commercialize implemented worlds wonders julie doll point speaker independence intended breakthrough systems required training period ad doll carried tagline finally doll understands despite fact described product children could train respond term voice recognition even decade later referred speaker needed speaker recognition system two phases enrollment verification enrollment speakers voice recorded typically number features extracted form voice print template model verification phase speech sample utterance compared previously created voice print identification systems utterance compared multiple voice prints order determine best matches verification systems compare utterance single voice print process involved verification faster identification speaker recognition systems fall two categories textdependent textdependent recognition requires text enrollment textdependent system prompts either common across speakers eg common pass phrase unique addition use sharedsecrets eg passwords pins knowledgebased information employed order create multifactor authentication scenario conversely textindependent systems require use specific text often used speaker identification require little cooperation speaker case text enrollment test different fact enrollment may happen without users knowledge case many forensic applications textindependent technologies compare said enrollment verification verification applications tend also employ speech recognition determine user saying point authenticationcitation needed text independent systems acoustics speech analysis techniques speaker recognition pattern recognition problem various technologies used process store voice prints include frequency estimation hidden markov models gaussian mixture models pattern matching
