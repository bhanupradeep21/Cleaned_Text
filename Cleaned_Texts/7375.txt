also obtain access vehicles customization options soldiers bring battle heavy weapon support tactical players deploy squads four roughly sixteen soldiers though limits squad size determined mostly players availability healthy soldiers transportation players try defeat alien human enemies combat enemies example enemies attack base seek try destroy vital functional aliens also try kill eat abduct civilians find players assault enemy facility soldiers use stealth avoid alerting enemy presence however alerted enemies seek attack combat occurs turnbased moves involve tactical options similar found xcom soldier two basic actions take turn moving firing weapon fire misses target hit something else potentially injure damage basic actions extended two circumstances first enemy spotted movement action soldier halts player choose react firing moving second soldiers special actions add examples special actions available soldiers include overwatch return fire return fire allows units retaliate enemy weapon fire weapon soldiers willpower attribute determines many points soldier soldiers expend points take special soldiers lose points injuries comrade dying encountering horrifying monster special enemy soldier whose points fall zero may panic lose willpower regained rest special abilities leaders rallying willpower points relate system phoenix point combat inflict lasting physical even psychological injuries soldiers injured disabled knocked unconscious battle difficult permanent death soldiers also called permadeath significant concern injuries soldiers suffer even
