connectedness nature facing problem evaluating early environmental educations programmes targeting younger children new parent questionnaire cnippc measure connectedness nature young children recently developed sobko original cn index modified tested among parents preschool children cnippc urban setting hong kong internal consistency external validity confirmatory factor analysis revealed scale adequately captures four major dimensions enjoyment nature empathy nature sense responsibility awareness nature new questionnaire tested strengths difficulties questionnaire wellestablished measurement psychological wellbeing childrens behaviour problems results revealed children closer connection nature less distress less hyperactivity fewer behavioural emotional difficulties improved prosocial behaviour interestingly children took greater responsibility towards nature fewer peer difficulties results give new possibility investigating link outdoor environment wellbeing preschool children thus cnippc factors meaningful substantive associations strengths difficulties parents perceived children indicates cnippc valid reliable instrument measure cn age children respond simple
