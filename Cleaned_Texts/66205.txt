theories align domaingeneral framework include developmental psychologist jean piaget theorized people develop global knowledge structure contains cohesive whole knowledge internalized experience psychologist charles spearman whose work led theory existence single factor accounting general cognitive ability domaingeneral learning theories direct opposition domainspecific learning theories also sometimes called theories modularity domainspecific learning theories posit humans learn different types information differently distinctions within brain many domains domainspecific learning theorists also assert neural domains independent purposed solely acquisition one skill ie facial recognition mathematics may provide direct benefits learning unrelated skills developmental

developmental change come due maturation domaingeneral cognitive mechanisms however although piagets theory cognitive development credited establishing field cognitive development aspects theory

rather highly specialized cognitive mechanisms development namely memory executive functioning language development one theory memory development suggests basic domaingeneral memory processes become superior theory basic memory processes frequently used rapidly executed memory activities activities include association generalization recognition recall basic processes theory memory development states memory processes underlie cognition holds complex cognitive activities built combining basic processes different thus memory basic processes seen domaingeneral processes applied across various domains domain general processes memory development addition general processes working memory particular extensively studied relates functions domaingeneral mechanism constraints cognitive example researchers believe maturation one able hold complex structures working memory results increase possible computations underlie inference thus working memory viewed domaingeneral mechanism aids development across many different domains researchers expanded search domaingeneral mechanisms underlie cognitive development beyond working memory advancement cognitive neuroscience technology credited making expansion within last decade researchers begun focus group cognitive mechanisms collectively named executive functions mechanisms commonly labeled executive functions include working
