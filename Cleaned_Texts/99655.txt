neurogenic bladder dysfunction neurogenic bladder refers urinary bladder problems due disease injury central nervous system peripheral nerves involved control multiple types neurogenic bladder depending underlying cause symptoms symptoms include overactive bladder urinary urgency frequency incontinence difficulty passing range diseases conditions cause neurogenic bladder including spinal cord injury multiple sclerosis stroke brain injury spina bifida peripheral nerve damage parkinsons disease neurodegenerative diseases neurogenic bladder diagnosed history physical well imaging specialized treatment depends underlying disease well symptoms managed behavioral changes medications surgeries procedures symptoms neurogenic bladder especially incontinence significant impact quality life united states patients multiple sclerosis patients parkinsonism patients stroke neurogenic bladder dysfunction bladder also frequently seen patients spina bifida affects births united states documented patients spina bifida form urinary incontinence around patients spinal cord injury degrees bladder dysfunction different types neurogenic bladder depending underlying cause many types may similar symptoms uninhibited bladder usually due damage brain stroke brain tumor cause reduced sensation bladder fullness low capacity bladder urinary incontinence unlike forms neurogenic bladder lead high bladder pressures cause kidney spastic neurogenic bladder also known upper motor neuron hyperreflexive bladder muscle bladder detrusor urethral sphincter work together usually tightly contracted time phenomenon also called detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia desd leads urinary retention high pressures bladder damage kidneys bladder volume usually smaller normal due increased muscle tone bladder spastic neurogenic bladder usually caused damage spinal cord level thoracic vertebrae flaccid bladder also known lower motor neuron hypotonic bladder muscles bladder lose ability contract normally cause inability void urine even bladder full cause large bladder capacity internal urinary sphincter contract normally however urinary incontinence common type neurogenic bladder caused damage peripheral nerves travel spinal cord mixed type neurogenic bladder cause combination presentations mixed type bladder muscle flaccid sphincter overactive creates large low pressure bladder inability void carry much risk kidney damage spastic bladder mixed type b characterized flaccid external sphincter spastic bladder causing problems neurogenic bladder cause range urinary symptoms including urinary urgency urinary incontinence difficulty urinating urinary retention first sign bladder dysfunction may recurrent urinary tract infections utiscitation needed neurogenic bladder cause hydronephrosis swelling kidney due buildup urine recurrent urinary tract infections recurrent kidney stones may compromise kidney especially significant spastic neurogenic bladder leads high bladder pressures kidney failure previously leading cause mortality patients spinal cord injury dramatically less common due improvements bladder urine storage elimination urination requires coordination bladder emptying muscle detrusor external sphincter bladder coordination disrupted damage diseases central nervous system peripheral nerves autonomic nervous includes condition impairs bladder signaling point along path urination center brain spinal cord peripheral nerves bladdercitation needed damage brain spinal cord common cause neurogenic bladder damage brain caused stroke brain tumors multiple sclerosis parkinsons disease neurodegenerative bladder involvement likely damage area pons damage spinal cord caused traumatic injury demyelinating disease vitamin deficiency syringomyelia cauda equina syndrome spina bifida spinal cord compression herniated disks tumor spinal stenosis also result neurogenic damage nerves travel spinal cord bladder peripheral nerves cause neurogenic bladder usually flaccid type nerve damage caused diabetes alcoholism vitamin deficiency peripheral nerves also damaged complication major surgery pelvis removal diagnosis neurogenic bladder made based complete history physical examination may require imaging specialized studies history include information onset duration triggers severity medical conditions medications including anticholinergics calcium channel blockers diuretics sedatives alphaadrenergic agonist alpha urinary symptoms may include frequency urgency incontinence recurrent urinary tract infections utis questionnaires helpful quantifying symptom children important obtain prenatal developmental ultrasound imaging give information shape bladder postvoid residual volume evidence kidney damage kidney size thickness ureteral trabeculated bladder ultrasound indicates high risk developing urinary tract abnormalities hydronephrosis voiding cystourethrography study uses contrast dye obtain images bladder full urination show changes bladder shape consistent neurogenic urodynamic studies important component evaluation neurogenic bladder urodynamics refers measurement pressurevolume relationship bladder bladder usually stores urine low pressure urination completed without dramatic pressure rise damage kidneys probable pressure rises cm water bladder pressure measured cystometry bladder artificially filled catheter bladder pressures detrusor activity monitored patterns involuntary detrusor activity well bladder flexibility compliance evaluated valuable test test detrusor sphincter dyssynergia desd perform cystometry simultaneously external sphincter electromyography uroflowmetry lessinvasive study measure urine flow rate use estimate detrusor strength sphincter urethral pressure monitoring another lessinvasive approach assessing detrusor sphincter studies repeated regular intervals especially symptoms worsen measure response evaluation kidney function blood tests serum creatinine imaging pelvis ct scan magnetic resonance imaging may necessary especially concern obstruction tumor inside bladder visualized cystoscopycitation needed treatment depends type neurogenic bladder medical problems treatment strategies include catheterization medications surgeries procedures goals treatment keep bladder pressures safe range eliminate residual urine bladder urination postvoid residual volumescitation needed emptying bladder use catheter common strategy managing urinary retention neurogenic bladder patients accomplished intermittent catherization involves surgery permanently attached appliances intermittent catheterization involves using straight catheters usually disposable singleuse products several times day empty done independently assistance people unable use disposable straight catheters foley catheter allows continuous drainage urine sterile drainage bag worn patient catheters associated higher rates oxybutynin common anticholinergic medication used reduce bladder contractions blocking muscarinic receptors use limited side effects dry mouth constipation decreased sweating tolterodine longer acting anticholinergic may fewer side urinary retention cholinergics muscarinic agonists like bethanechol improve squeezing ability bladder alpha blockers also reduce outlet resistance allow complete emptying adequate bladder muscle botulinum toxin botox used two different approaches spastic neurogenic bladder bladder muscle detrusor injected cause flaccid months prevents high bladder pressures intermittent catherization must used botox also injected external sphincter paralyze spastic sphincter patients detrusor sphincter various strategies alter interaction nerves muscles bladder including nonsurgical therapies transurethral electrical bladder stimulation minimally invasive procedures sacral neuromodulation pacemaker operative reconfiguration sacral nerve root surgical interventions may pursued medical approaches maximized surgical options depend type dysfunction observed urodynamic testing may include overall prevalence neurogenic bladder limited due broad range conditions lead urinary dysfunction neurogenic bladder common spinal cord injury multiple rates type urinary dysfunction surpass one year spinal cord among patients multiple sclerosis develop neurogenic bladder although type severity bladder dysfunction burden neurogenic bladder dysfunction individuals health care systems substantial actual costs care less recent systematic review literature assessed global costs associated current state care neurogenic bladder found annual costs routine care range lifetime costs reaching complications catheters absorbent aids among costliest categories expenditure routine invasive
