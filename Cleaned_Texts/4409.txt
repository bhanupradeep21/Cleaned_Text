abscisic acid aba abscisin plant hormone aba functions many plant developmental processes including seed bud dormancy control organ size stomatal closure especially important plants response environmental stresses including drought soil salinity cold tolerance freezing tolerance heat stress heavy metal ion torsten hemberg working university stockholm found evidence positive correlation exists rest period occurrence acidic ether soluble growth inhibitor potato abscisic acid first identified characterized plant hormone frederick addicott larry davis studying compounds cause abscission shedding cotton fruits bolls two compounds isolated called abscisin abscisin ii abscisin ii presently called abscisic acid aba originally believed involved abscission received name known case small number plants abamediated signaling also plays important part plant responses environmental stress plant plant genes aba biosynthesis sequence pathway aba also produced plant pathogenic fungi via biosynthetic route different aba biosynthesis preparation winter aba produced terminal slows plant growth directs leaf primordia develop scales protect dormant buds cold season aba also inhibits division cells vascular cambium adjusting cold conditions winter suspending primary secondary growth abscisic acid also produced roots response decreased soil water potential associated dry soil situations plant may stress aba translocates leaves rapidly alters osmotic potential stomatal guard cells causing shrink stomata close abainduced stomatal closure reduces transpiration evaporation water stomata thus preventing water loss leaves times low water availability close linear correlation found aba content leaves conductance stomatal resistance leaf area seed germination inhibited aba antagonism gibberellin aba also prevents loss seed dormancycitation needed several abamutant arabidopsis thaliana plants identified available nottingham arabidopsis stock centre deficient aba production altered sensitivity action plants hypersensitive insensitive aba show phenotypes seed dormancy germination stomatal regulation mutants show stunted growth brownyellow leaves mutants reflect importance aba seed germination early embryo developmentcitation needed pyrabactin pyridyl containing aba activator naphthalene sulfonamide hypocotyl cell expansion inhibitor agonist seed aba signaling first agonist aba pathway structurally related abacitation needed abscisic acid aba isoprenoid plant hormone synthesized plastidal mep pathway unlike structurally related sesquiterpenes formed mevalonic acidderived precursor farnesyl diphosphate fdp backbone aba formed cleavage carotenoids mep zeaxanthin first committed aba precursor series enzymecatalyzed epoxidations isomerizations via violaxanthin final cleavage carotenoid dioxygenation reaction yields proximal aba precursor xanthoxin oxidized aba via abscisic abamine designed synthesized developed patented first specific aba biosynthesis inhibitor makes possible regulate endogenous levels aba catabolized phaseic acid via group enzymes inactivated glucose conjugation abaglucose ester via enzyme uridine diphosphateglucosyltransferase udpglucosyltransferase catabolism via important aba homeostasis mutants genes generally accumulate higher levels aba lines overexpressing aba biosynthetic soil bacteria alternative catabolic pathway leading dehydrovomifoliol via enzyme vomifoliol dehydrogenase reported absence aba phosphatase inhibits action protein kinases subfamily aba perceived pyrabactin resistance membrane proteins aba binding binds inhibits released inhibition activate several transcription factors aba responsive elementbinding factor abf family abfs go cause changes expression large number around plant genes thought regulated abacitation needed like plants fungal species example cercospora rosicola botrytis magnaporthe oryzae endogenous biosynthesis pathway aba fungi seems mva biosynthetic pathway predominant rather mep pathway responsible aba biosynthesis plants one role aba produced pathogens seems suppress plant immune aba also found present metazoans sponges mammals including currently biosynthesis biological role animals poorly known aba recently shown elicit potent antiinflammatory antidiabetic effects mouse models diabetesobesity inflammatory bowel disease atherosclerosis influenza many biological effects animals studied using aba nutraceutical pharmacognostic drug aba also generated endogenously cells like macrophages stimulated also conflicting conclusions different studies claim aba essential proinflammatory responses whereas show antiinflammatory effects like many natural substances medical properties aba become popular also naturopathy aba clearly beneficial biological activitiescitation needed many naturopathic remedies contain high levels aba wheatgrass juice fruits vegetables health claims made may exaggerated overly optimistic mammalian cells aba targets protein known lanthionine synthetase clike triggering alternative mechanism activation peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma ppar conserved plants originally suggested aba receptor also plants later several methods help quantify concentration abscisic acid variety plant tissue quantitative methods used based hplc elisa recently independent fret probes
