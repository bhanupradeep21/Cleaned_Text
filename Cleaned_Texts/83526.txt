mhc class ii molecules class major histocompatibility complex mhc molecules normally found professional antigenpresenting cells dendritic cells mononuclear phagocytes endothelial cells thymic epithelial cells b cells cells important initiating immune responses antigens presented class ii peptides derived extracellular proteins cytosolic mhc class loading mhc class ii molecule occurs phagocytosis extracellular proteins endocytosed digested lysosomes resulting epitopic peptide fragments loaded onto mhc class ii molecules prior migration cell surface humans mhc class ii protein complex encoded human leukocyte antigen gene complex hla hlas corresponding mhc class ii hladp hladm hladoa hladob hladq hladr mutations hla gene complex lead bare lymphocyte syndrome bls type mhc class ii deficiency like mhc class molecules class ii molecules also heterodimers case consist two homogenous peptides α β chain encoded subdesignation etc refers separate domains within hla gene domain usually encoded different exon within gene genes domains encode leader sequences transmembrane sequences etc molecules extracellular regions well transmembrane sequence cytoplasmic tail regions chains come together make membranedistal peptidebinding domain regions remaining extracellular parts chains form membraneproximal immunoglobulinlike domain antigen binding groove antigen peptide binds made two αhelixes walls antigenbinding groove mhc class ii molecules open ends corresponding groove class molecules closed end antigens presented mhc class ii molecules longer generally amino acid residues long molecules constitutively expressed professional immune antigenpresenting cells may also induced cells interferon expressed epithelial cells thymus apcs periphery mhc class ii expression closely regulated apcs ciita mhc class ii transactivator ciita solely expressed professional apcs however nonprofessional apcs also regulate ciita activity mhc ii expression mentioned interferon γ ifn

molecules present proper peptides bound stably essential overall immune function class ii mhc loaded extracellular proteins mainly concerned presentation extracellular pathogens example bacteria might infecting wound blood class ii molecules interact mainly immune cells like helper cell peptide presented regulates cells respond stable peptide binding essential prevent detachment degradation peptide could occur without secure attachment mhc would prevent cell recognition antigen cell recruitment proper immune triggered appropriate immune response may include localized inflammation swelling due recruitment phagocytes may lead fullforce antibody immune response due activation b cells synthesis class ii mhc endoplasmic reticulum α β chains produced complexed special polypeptide known invariant nascent mhc class ii protein rough er peptidebinding cleft blocked invariant chain ii trimer prevent binding cellular peptides peptides endogenous pathway would loaded onto class mhc invariant chain also facilitates export class ii mhc er golgi apparatus followed fusion late endosome containing endocytosed degraded proteins invariant chain broken stages proteases called cathepsins leaving small fragment known clip maintains blockage peptide binding cleft mhc molecule mhc class iilike structure hladm facilitates clip removal allows binding peptides higher affinities stable class ii mhc presented cell surface mhc class ii complexes synthesized presented apcs unable expressed cell surface indefinitely due internalization plasma membrane apcsantigen presenting cells cells antigens bind recycled mhc class ii molecules early endosomes cells dendritic cells internalize antigens via receptormediated endocytosis create mhc class ii molecules plus peptide endosomallysosomal antigen

loaded onto mhc ii molecule mhc ii molecule travels surface present antigen helper cell mhc ii active helper cells help release cytokines things help induce cells help combat pathogens outside cells several molecules involved two kinases phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol pip providing substrates gtp loading ability guanine exchange factor loads gtp subsequently interacts binds actin myofibers altogether complex contributes maintain mhcii loaded vesicles within immature dendritic cell impeding translocation cell membrane one type mhc class ii deficiency also called bare lymphocyte syndrome
