muscle balance necessary muscles perform customary roles move normally muscle imbalance occurs lack parity corresponding agonist antagonist muscular imbalance also arise muscle performs outside normal physiological muscle muscles considered balanced muscles surround joint work together harmoniously ie appropriate opposing force keep bones aligned meet joint permits normal human muscles categorized either functional pathological muscle imbalance caused either adaptation functional muscle dysfunction muscle suffering pathology classic symptoms muscle imbalances usually pain associated affected symptoms vary depending stage muscular imbalance functional pathological commonly exhibit small tissue damage lesions accompanied change muscle movement symptoms may occur injury surgery recuperation joint affected left untreated causing either tension restriction flexibility strength prime tennis elbow common elbow problem among athletes highly associated world class tennis players condition involves common wrist extensor origin particular origin extensor carpi causes tennis elbow includes activity tennis repetitive use extensor muscles forearm may cause acute chronic tendonitis tensinous insertion muscles lateral epicondyle condition common painters plumbers carpenters studied shown autoworkers butchers cooks also get tennis elbow often rest lazy eye particular strabismus may result coordination extraocular muscles prevents person directing eyes unison towards fixation main cause strabismus usually muscular imbalance six surrounding muscles allow eyes focus eye focus different images sent brain confusing resulting brain ignoring image weaker eye left untreated cause loss vision ignored eye called symptoms strabismus include decreased vision double vision headaches asthenopia eye scoliosis medical condition persons spine several irregular curves located neck symptoms scoliosis mild cases usually exhibit abnormal posture back pain tingling numbness legs worse cases exhibit breathing problems fatigue permanent deformities rare cases heart functional imbalances muscles adapt response detailed muscle movement patterns including unequal values strength flexibility antagonistic muscle groups usually apparent athletes different sports ranging soccer type imbalance first stage painless atraumatic causes minimal tissue adaptive change activity studies confirm find link muscle imbalance athletes perform elite levels also relates injury occurrence treated muscle specific pathological muscle imbalance occurs imbalance muscles begin inhibit pathological muscle imbalance may may result traumatic event usually associated pain dysfunction although cases pain apparent however pathological muscle imbalances ultimately lead joint dysfunction changes normative muscle movement would good note imbalance progress either tissue damage pain altered movement pattern constant tightness study shown athletes exhibit shoulder pain linked decreased rotator cuff muscle strength concluded susceptible rotator cuff tears type ii superior labrum anterior posterior muscle imbalance characterized different factors namely muscle imbalance body diagnosis varies specific areas area needs handled differently signs include joint pain muscular pain abnormal joint movement patterns cases muscle tears diagnosed demonstrating one following although treatment tennis elbow prior unknown etiology remained unclear tests confirmed cause imbalance agonistantagonist functional treatment includes antiinflammatory medicines rest equipment check physical therapy braces steroid injections shock wave therapy symptoms persist months doctors may recommend although treatment varies depending bad eye alignment also underlying causes treatment strabismus may include orthoptics term used eye muscle training treatment provided orthoptists also treatment may include wearing eye patches aimed strengthening weaker eye inhibiting stronger eye alternative eye patches use opaque lens treatments may include eye drops temporarily inhibit stronger eye age eye muscle surgery done correct muscular balance ocular although cause scoliosis sometimes remain unknown idiopathic scoliosis treatment available targets strengthening back muscles milder cases usually require medical attention severe cases require either muscle strengthening exercises aimed back muscles even special back braces surgery recommended case studies shown treatment special back brace among children ranging years successful using method muscle training scoliosis cured nonsurgical terms selective muscle weakness poor flexibility muscular imbalance frequently regarded etiological factor onset musculoskeletal variety areas affected causing different symptoms hence also different treatments available general cases muscle strengthening techniques developed use weak tight long time muscular imbalance many different theories revolved around wasnt first manual muscle testing appeared written therapists henry florence kendall discusses muscle weakness polio patients treatments approaching tight weak dr george goodheart dr vladimir janda took paths treating patients muscular imbalance goodheart focusing muscle weakness primary cause muscle imbalance whilst janda took muscle tightness approach developed large following continues evidence support two different approaches muscular imbalance first biomechanical approach believed cause due repeated movements one direction sustained postures widespread kendall second neuromuscular imbalance due certain muscle groups tight weak popularized janda approach based movement patterns evolve today many different types therapists treat muscle imbalance include chiropractors osteopaths physical therapists medical doctors massage therapists assessing tightness weakness primary cause muscular httpsenwikipediaorgwikimuscleimbalance
