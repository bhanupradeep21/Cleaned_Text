fibronectin determined fibronectin important glycoprotein cell adhesion tissue alternatively spliced could result generation twenty completing postdoctoral research oxford kornblihtt returned argentina accepted position assistant professor molecular cell biology facultad de ciencias exactas naturales university buenos aires appointed full professor present professor emeritus kornblihtt also senior conicet investigator conicet works research team study regulation alternative ribonucleic acid splicing alternative splicing occurs gene expression allowing exons gene excluded included resulting single gene generating multiple proteins major projects kornblihtt lab focus coupling transcription alternative splicing alternative splicing chromatin alternative splicing spinal muscular atrophy ultraviolet light irradiation alternative splicing alternative splicing kornblihtt lab focuses mechanisms couple transcription alternative splicing regulation alternative premrna splicing transcription process genetic sequence gene transcribed changed dna rna allow protein one significant accomplishments kornblihtt research came kornblihtt research team able alternative splicing assay combined promoter swapping demonstrate transcription promoters affect outcome splicing later determined coupling transcription splicing dependent upon transcriptional elongation speed kinetic coupling impact transcribing rna polymerase ii kornblihtt research found elongation affects alternative splicing events slow elongation increasing inclusion approximately exons skipping approximately mammalian additional area kornblihtt study investigated impact chromatin structure alternative splicing kornblihtt research team demonstrated alternative splicing impacted chromatin structure rate found tighter chromatin structure provides lower rates elongation looser chromatin structures provide higher rate elongation studies contributed relationship alternative splicing epigenetics kornblihtt team used

projects kornblihtt team worked regulation alternative premrna splicing develop new mechanisms smn protein development using single gene generate multiple kornblihtt lab continues work gene sma therapy focus specifically exon inclusion work conjunction oligonucleotide treatments continuation longterm research alternative splicing kornblihtt team also studied impact dna damage induced ultraviolet light uv irradiation alternative splicing human skin cells research demonstrated dnadamage response sunlight causes phosphorylation rna polymerase slowing enzyme research found uv irradiation necessary trigger alternative splicing many genes promoting death damaged mutated adding research performed human cells kornblihtt team expanded research study transcription alternative splicing plants plant arabidopsis thaliana used investigate external lighting conditions affected alternative splicing research showed chloroplast photosynthesis occurs senses light sends signal cell
