body odor body odour bo present animals intensity influenced many factors behavioral patterns survival strategies body odor strong genetic basis also strongly influenced various factors gender diet health body odor human males plays important role human sexual attraction powerful indicator mhchla significant evidence suggests women attracted men whose body odor different indicating immune genes different may produce healthier humans formation body odors caused factors diet sex health medication major contribution comes bacterial activity skin gland humans three types sweat glands eccrine sweat glands apocrine sweat glands sebaceous glands eccrine sweat glands present birth latter two become activated puberty among different types human skin glands body odor primarily result apocrine sweat glands secrete majority chemical compounds skin flora metabolize odorant happens mostly axillary armpit region although gland also found areola anogenital region around humans armpit regions seem important genital region body odor may related human bipedalism genital armpit regions also contain springy hairs help diffuse body main components human axillary odor unsaturated hydroxylated branched fatty acids acid acid hmha sulfanylalkanols particularly odoriferous steroids androstenone androstenol bound carried two apocrine secretion odorbinding proteins skin body odor influenced actions skin flora including members corynebacterium manufacture enzymes called lipases break lipids sweat create smaller molecules like butyric acid greater bacteria populations corynebacterium jeikeium found armpits men whereas greater population numbers staphylococcus haemolyticus found armpits women causes male armpits give rancidcheeselike smell whereas female armpits give fruityonionlike staphylococcus hominis also known producing thioalcohol compounds contribute smaller molecules smell give body odor characteristic propionic acid propanoic acid present many sweat samples acid breakdown product amino acids propionibacteria thrive ducts adolescent adult sebaceous glands propionic acid chemically similar acetic acid similar characteristics including odor body odors may identified pungent cheesy vinegarlike smell although certain people might find pleasant lower isovaleric acid butanoic acid source body odor result actions bacteria staphylococcus also present several types strong cheese factors food drink gut genetics affect body many animals body odor plays important survival function strong body odor warning signal predators stay away porcupine stink also signal prey animal example animals species feign death survive like opossums state produce strong body odor deceive predator prey animal dead long time already advanced stage decomposing animals strong body odor rarely attacked predators although still killed eaten birds prey tolerant carrion odorscitation needed body odor important feature animal physiology plays different role different animal species example predator species hunt stalking big small cats absence body odor important spend plenty time energy keep body free odor predators hunt visually locating prey running long distances dogs wolves absence body odor critical animals body odor intensifies moments stress humans body odor serves means chemosensory signal communication members species signals called pheromones transmitted variety mediums common way human pheromones transmitted bodily fluids human pheromones contained sweat semen vaginal secretions breast milk signals carried fluids serve range functions reproductive signaling infant person produces unique spread pheromones identified differentiation allows formation sexual attraction kinship ties sebaceous apocrine glands become active

producing sources particular many apocrine humans apocrine glands ability secrete pheromones steroid compounds produced within peroxisomes apocrine glands enzymes mevalonate pheromones factor seen mating selection reproduction humans women sense olfaction strongest around time ovulation significantly stronger phases menstrual cycle also stronger sense pheromones used deliver information major

research suggests possible role human pheromones biological basis sexual humans olfactorily detect bloodrelated mothers identify body odor biological children stepchildren preadolescent children olfactorily detect full siblings halfsiblings stepsiblings might explain incest avoidance westermarck babies recognize mothers smell mothers fathers relatives identify baby connection genetically
