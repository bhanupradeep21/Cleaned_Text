dutch anatomist frederik named danish physician harald hirschsprung following description typically hirschsprung disease diagnosed shortly birth although may develop well adulthood presence megacolon baby fails pass first stool within hours delivery normally babies pass first meconium within hours within signs symptoms newborns include swollen belly vomiting green brown vomit flatulence older children signs symptoms include chronic constipation flatulence swollen belly fatigue failure symptoms include symptoms bowel perforation vomiting constipation poor feeding lethargy diarrhea symptoms bowel obstruction would include vomiting bile abdominal distension pass stools hours birth raise suspicion hirschsprung disease suspicion also risen passage stools suppository rectal exam enema children respond constipation treatment six months also raise suspicion disease enterocolitis acute complication hirschsprung disease characterised sudden onset fever abdominal distension vomiting passage bloody stools release explosive gas stools rectal cases diagnosed later childhood usually age child may experience fecal retention constipation abdominal hirschsprungs disease also present part multi system disorders disorder may occur association genetic disorders half isolated cases linked specific genetic mutation occur within occur autosomal dominant cause remaining cases otherwise normal parents one child condition next child risk several genes specific regions chromosomes loci shown suggested associated hirschsprungs disease ret protooncogene accounts highest proportion familial sporadic cases wide range mutations scattered along entire coding protooncogene cause cancer mutated ret gene codes proteins assist cells neural crest movement digestive tract development embryo neural crest cells eventually form bundles nerve cells called ganglions ednrb codes proteins connect nerve cells digestive tract thus mutations two genes could directly lead absence certain nerve fibers colon research suggests several genes associated hirschsprungs also new research suggests mutations genomic sequences involved regulating ednrb bigger impact hirschsprungs disease
