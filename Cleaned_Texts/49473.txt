shortlasting unilateral neuralgiform headache conjunctival injection tearing sunct syndrome rare headache disorder belongs group headaches called trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia symptoms include excruciating burning stabbing electrical headaches mainly near eye typically sensations one side body headache attacks typically accompanied cranial autonomic signs unique sunct attack last five seconds six minutes may occur times daily tacs caused activation autonomic nervous system trigeminal nerve face cases described medical onset symptoms usually come later life average age although majority patients men age uncommon find sunct present among age groups including children infants people affected sunct often describe headache attacks excruciating pain attacks severe enough disrupt daily activities hospitalization necessary affected individualscitation needed average number attacks per day around ranging attacks divided three groups single stabs groups stabs attacks sawtooth pattern shortest longest duration respectively attacks usually last five seconds seconds pain described excruciating stabbing pulsating electric burning nature attacks longer duration pain changes following sawtooth pattern characterized multiple stabs typically longer attacks painful due psychological effects patients often feel agitated attack occur mostly orbital supraorbital temporal region also occur retroorbital behind orbit eye region side top back head second third trigeminal divisions teeth neck ear negligible percentage attacks less occur sunct often accompanies cranial autonomic symptoms including lacrimation tear flow ipsilateral ptosis drooping eyelid side attacks eyelid edema swelling due fluid accumulation nasal blockage conjunctival injection redness eye depending division trigeminal nerve innervates area affected autonomic symptoms may less obvious shortlasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks cranial autonomic features suna subset sunct constitutes less reported cases may diagnosed fewer autonomic symptoms observed attacks due rarity conditions small number properly diagnosed patients allow establishing clear definition main difference sunct suna clinical presentation secondary autonomic symptoms sunct conjunctival injection red eyes lacrimation side headache present suna one two symptoms absent autonomic symptoms may present instead suna attacks may also sometimes longer minutes total majority sunct attacks occur chronically however occur episodically chronic sunct attacks occur regularly irregularly without distinct refractory period whereas episodic sunct attacks occur certain period time cease another period episodes attacks last days months attack episodes one year observed sunct go remission even chronic period relapse either spontaneously due time sunct occurs spontaneously however attacks triggered simple daily stimuli touching face scalp washing chewing eating talking coughing blowing nose showering also triggered light including sunlight fluorescent lights injuries stimuli capable triggering cluster headache including alcohol smoke strong smells warm environment also trigger sunct cases patients episodic sunct exhibit symptoms biannually spring fall periodicity suggests hypothalamus responsive day length photoperiod regulating circadian seasonal rhythms role sunct must properly distinguished cluster headaches since cluster headaches also occur several times per day separate attacks share common symptoms however cluster headaches usually last longer three hours occur less often three five attacks per day accompany cranial autonomic symptoms ihs standard criteria diagnosis sunct specifically includes pain trigeminal division face especially orbital region often cranial autonomic symptoms last relatively short periods time five seconds several minutes times per day sunct major subset accompany cranial symptoms complete separation two inappropriate since sunct necessarily always accompany cranial autonomic signs exact statistical data available due common misdiagnosis setting diagnostic criteria international headache classification established international headache society criteria diagnosing sunct therapeutic purposes iscitation needed symptoms sunct often lead misdiagnosis paroxysmal hemicrania also categorized group inefficiency indomethacin usually indicates sunct paroxysmal misdiagnosis indecisive diagnosis past made difficult obtain accurate statistics sunct proper diagnosis broaden data availability facilitate discovery new treatment options useful statistics pathophysiology sunct incompletely understood recent studies suggest existence relationship hypothalamus condition functional mri deep brain stimulation large patient pool showed activation posterior hypothalamus attacks primary sunct sides contralaterally opposite functional mri studies suggest brain stem activation attacks activation trigeminocervical complex related structures results innervation branches trigeminal upper cervical exists direct connection trigeminal nucleus caudalis located brain stem posterior hypothalamus therefore possible stimulation peripheral trigeminal nerve activates hypothalamus hypothalamus turn communicates trigeminal nucleus caudalis via neurotransmitters orexincitation needed elevated levels prolactin secretion regulated hypothalamus seem associated sunct attacks patients pituitary tumor experience attacks night patients exhibit higher levels prolactin night even hormone levels including prolactin normal throughout sunct considered primary headache condition also occur secondary symptom conditions however patient diagnosed sunct primary conditioncitation needed pituitary tumor causes sunct secondary headache patients pituitary tumor complain shortlasting heachaches upon removal tumor symptoms sunct may disappear although occurs rarely paranasal sinusitis also cause secondary sunct symptoms sunct cases removed permanently endoscopic sinus diagnostic criteria indecisive pathophysiology remains unclear permanent cure available antiepileptic medications membranestabilizing drugs pregabalin gabapentin topiramate lamotrigine improve symptoms effective permanent longterm treatment lamotrigine exhibits longterm prevention reduction patients according case reports observational studies however titration dose necessary due adverse skin lamotrigine found effective treatment according later openlabel study percent patients responding treatment compared oxcarbazepine duloxetine carbamazepine topiramate pregabalin gabapentin intravenous lidocaine abolish symptoms administration reduce frequency duration around percent patients responded treatment one however administration intravenous lidocaine requires careful monitoring ecg blood methylprednisolone therapy shows promise shortterm prevention attacks even though mechanism action yet calcium channel blocker verapamil reported useful alleviating symptoms lower frequency duration attacks even though patients experience worsened various medications often used headache syndromes nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs acetaminophen tricyclic antidepressants calcium channel antagonists relieve symptoms sunct attempts alter oxygen supply attacks alleviate symptoms since headaches caused decreased oxygen supply however elevated blood oxygen level affect symptoms researchers nowwhen focus administration various combination medications therapies treat symptoms male patient first diagnosed sunct patient experienced unilateral
