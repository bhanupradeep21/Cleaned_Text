musculoskeletal disorders msds injuries pain human musculoskeletal system including joints ligaments muscles nerves tendons structures support limbs neck msds arise sudden exertion eg lifting heavy arise making motions repeatedly repetitive strain repeated exposure force vibration awkward injuries pain musculoskeletal system caused acute traumatic events like car accident fall considered musculoskeletal msds affect many different parts body including upper lower back neck shoulders extremities arms legs feet examples msds include carpal tunnel syndrome epicondylitis tendinitis back pain tension neck syndrome handarm vibration msds arise interaction physical factors ergonomic psychological social occupational msds caused biomechanical load force must applied tasks duration force applied frequency tasks activities involving heavy loads result acute injury occupationrelated msds motions repetitive maintaining static even activities require lot force result muscle damage activity repeated often enough short msd risk factors involve tasks heavy force repetition maintaining nonneutral particular concern combination heavy load although poor posture often blamed lower back pain systematic review literature failed find consistent people vary tendency get msds gender factor women higher incidence msds obesity also factor overweight individuals higher risk msds specifically lower growing consensus psychosocial factors another cause theories causal relationship found many researchers include increased muscle tension increased blood fluid pressure reduction growth functions pain sensitivity reduction pupil dilation body remaining heightened state sensitivity although consensus workplace stressors found associated msds workplace include high job demands low social support overall job researchers consistently identified causal relationships job dissatisfaction msds example improving job satisfaction reduce per cent workrelated back disorders improving job control reduce per cent workrelated wrist workers maintain posture long work days often several years even natural postures like standing lead msds like low back pain postures less natural twisting tension upper body typically contributors development msds due unnatural biomechanical load evidence posture contributes msds neck shoulder repeated motion another risk factor msds occupational origin workers perform movements repeatedly long periods time eg typing leading carpal tunnel syndrome lifting heavy objects another source back injury common nurses due patient lead shortterm pain longterm injury leading herniated discsslipped discs wear joints muscles involved motion workers repetitive motions high pace work little recovery time workers little control timing motions eg workers assembly lines also prone msds due motion force needed perform actions job also associated higher msd risk workers movements require force fatigue muscles quicker lead injury andor additionally exposure vibration experienced truck drivers construction workers example extreme hot cold temperatures affect workers ability judge force strength lead development vibration exposure also associated handarm vibration syndrome symptoms lack blood circulation fingers nerve compression tingling andor recent epidemiological studies identify gender significant risk factor occurrence msds among workers genderrelated occupations eg assessment msds based selfreports symptoms pain well physical examination doctors rely medical history recreational occupational hazards intensity pain physical exam locate source pain sometimes lab tests xrays doctors look specific criteria diagnose different musculoskeletal disorder based location type intensity pain well kind restricted painful movement patient popular measure msds nordic questionnaire picture body various areas labeled asks individual indicate areas experienced pain areas pain interfered normal recent machine learning algorithms diagnose musculoskeletal disorder gait patterns captured motion capture prevention msds relies upon identification risk factors either selfreport observation job measurement posture could lead risk factors determined several intervention methods could used prevent development msds target msd prevention efforts often workplace order identify incidence rates disorders exposure unsafe groups particular risk identified modifications physical psychosocial environment approaches prevention workplace settings include matching persons physical abilities tasks increasing persons capabilities changing tasks performed changing employers also utilize engineering controls administrative controls prevent injury happening implementation engineering controls process designing redesigning workplace account strengths weaknesses needs working population examples would workstation layout changes efficient reducing bending moving necessary tools within shorter reach workers employers may also utilize administrative controls like reducing number hours certain position limiting overtime including breaks shifts order reduce amount time risk encouraging use proper ergonomics includes matching physical ability worker correct job deals designing equipment correct limiting heavy lifting training reporting early signs injury examples prevent employers provide support employees order prevent msd workplace involving employees planning assessing developing standards procedures support proper ergonomics prevent one focus ergonomic principles maintaining neutral postures postures muscles normal length able generate force reducing stress possible injury muscles tendons nerves bones therefore workplace everyday life ideal muscles joints maintain neutral additionally prevent hand wrist finger injuries understanding use pinch grips best fine motor control precise movements low force power grips best highforce movements done repeatedly important employees general tasks outside choice tools match proper grip conducive neutral postures important employers consider purchasing order reduce injuries low back spine recommended reduce weight frequency lifting cycles well decreasing distance body load reduce torque force back workers individuals repeated lifting avoid fatigue failure shape objects lifted also considered especially employers objects easier grip lift access present less stress spine back muscles objects awkwardly shaped difficult national institute occupational safety health niosh published ergonomic recommendations several industries including construction mining agriculture healthcare retail among msds increasing healthcare issue globally second leading cause example us million strains sprains treated total cost treating msds estimated billion per approximately canadian population living disability nearly half due neck pain one common complaints one fifth adults worldwide reporting pain according labour force survey carried uks health safety executive hse million working days lost due workrelated musculoskeletal disorders workers workplace msd episodes involve multiple parts msds frequent health complaint european united states asian pacific third leading reason disability early retirement incidence rate msds among working population newly diagnosed msds per fulltime median days away work due msds cases per fulltime workers msd caused worker away work msds widespread many occupations including heavy biomechanical load like construction factory work lighter loads like office transportation warehousing industries highest incidence rate musculoskeletal disorders incidence rate cases per fulltime healthcare manufacturing agriculture wholesale trade retail recreation industries incidence rates per fulltime example national survey us nurses found reported msd prior year mainly lower back neck back common sites msds workers followed upper limbs lower bureau labor statistics reports new cases msds per fulltime workers per year due overexertion bodily reaction repetitive members united states army medical command band army band center study concluded musicians
