nociception assay nocioception nocioperception assay evaluates ability animal usually rodent detect noxious stimulus feeling pain caused stimulation nociceptors assays measure existence pain behaviors withdrawal licking immobility vocalization sensation pain unitary concept therefore researcher must conscious nociception assay use formalin assay popular chemical assay nociception entails injection dilute solution formalin surface rodents hindpaw followed scoring stereotypical behaviors flinching licking biting affected behaviors last approximately hour early acute stage directly injection reflecting direct activation nociceptors late tonic phase minutes injection reflecting typically formalin assay used rats however formalin concentrations scoring methods modified suit one major advantage formalin assay models inflammatory pain limited duration approximately hour additionally described assay produces response two discrete stages allowing researchers model acute tonic pain using single noxious chemical writhing test peripheral nociceptive activity test compound determined number abdominal writhes induced intraperitoneal injection acetic von frey assay introduced maximilian von frey modified weinstein uses von frey hair fibers small pieces nylon rod approximately mm length varying diameters test rodents sensitivity mechanical unclear whether process really considered noxious versus simply annoying assay test mechanical nociception simply mechanical sensibility test animal stands elevated mesh platform von frey hairs inserted mesh poke animal normal reactions animal include withdrawing licking shaking paw possible vocalization depend variability within experiment example tarsal surface hind paw typically associated lower withdrawal thresholds compared dorsal surface exact force fiber determined also important note thresholds usually initially decreasing successive tests become stable sessions algorithms updown bruceton analysis available concentrate testing dynamic part range subsequent curve fitting parameter estimation similarly alternatively automated von frey systems recently discovered gradually increase force single probe researcher observe withdrawal responses occur sensitivity acute thermal stimulation common test used live species pain behavioral reflex evoked noxious heat stimuli relatively good predictor pain sensitivity reduction various analgesics one significant limitation thermal assays lies specificity validity results animals models human little known functional mechanics nociceptive afferents murine subjects thus translation pain response observed animals humans two versions tail withdrawal assay commonly employed pain sensitivity classic radiant heat test heat source targeted onto small area tail latency withdraw tail away heat source measured tailimmersion test container liquid heated cooled nociceptive temperature normally animal subject placed tail immersed liquid latency withdraw tail liquid measured animal subjects used must restrained fairly high degree performing tail withdrawal test due exact positioning necessary direct noxious stimuli restraint usually accomplished placing subjects small plexiglas tubes clothcardboard pockets subjects either habituated voluntarily primary advantage tail withdrawal assays forms thermal nociception testing hotplate test hargreaves test relative stability results repeated observations painreflex latency observations tests usually much variable across within subjects obtained tail withdrawal assay heatconductive surface porcelain metal heated temperature induce nociceptive response animal subject normally subject placed onto surface prevented leaving platform blockades latency painreflex behavior one complication assay unsuitability repeated testing animals subjected hotplate test past display behavioral tolerance phenomenon characterized decreased latencies reduced sensitivities antinociceptive another complication hotplate test determining constitutes behavioral pain response liftinglicking paws vocalization attempting climb cylinder also delivering heat stimulus controlled fashion presents difficulties due section varying temperatures based upon surface area exposure whether animal moving tail flick assay tail flick test uses highintensity beam light aimed rodents tail detect normal rodents noxious heat sensation induced beam light causes prototypical movement tail via flexor withdrawal investigator normally measures time takes reflex induced factor influenced rodents sex age body critical parameter tail flick assay beam intensity stimuli producing latencies larger seconds generally create variable another important factor consider level restraint used rodents held tightly may exhibit greater tail flick latencies due heightened stress hargreaves assay uses highintensity beam light directed hindpaw rather tail induce pain investigator measures time takes animal withdraw contrast tail flick assay rodents often unrestrained radiant heat source focused hindpaw cutoff latency hargreaves assay commonly set main advantage test tail flick assay allows independent assessment treatment effects sides one common applications nociception assays test effectiveness new pain medications drugs like one perform comparative tests measure differences effects drug varying populations men versus women young versus old tests also identify certain harmful diseases abnormalities subjects display atypical nociception test responses additionally nociception tests used test heritability nociception one also use nociception assays assess physiology pain pathways role capsaicin receptors play pain pathways measured comparing results nociception assays mice without addition useful tests make sure
