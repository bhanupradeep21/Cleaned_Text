carl hirschie johnson americanborn biologist researches chronobiology different organisms notably bacterial circadian rhythms johnson completed undergraduate degree honors liberal arts university texas austin later earned phd biology stanford university began research mentorship dr colin currently johnson stevenson professor biological sciences vanderbilt carl johnson born washington dc first began college university texas austin planned go medical school rather pursue however quickly developed passion research working undergraduate student chronobiology lab directed dr michael menaker johnson asserts music led science originally began research job menaker pay classical voice lessons classical music remained major avocation continues sing music chorus nashville symphony also free time enjoys johnson graduated ba honors liberal arts plan ii honors program university texas austin time became involved undergraduate research mentorship dr michael menaker whose lab studying biological clocks birds johnsons exposure practice experimental research dr menakers lab inspired go graduate school instead following original plan become went earn phd biology stanford university first working renowned leader chronobiology colin pittendrigh moving david epels laboratory finish degree subsequently johnson conducted postdoctoral work cell developmental biology harvard university completed dr jw woody hastings john woodland hastings biologist famous work bioluminescence many organisms including hastings became close friend mentor johnson johnson came vanderbilt university initiate independent research program biology professor vanderbilt since johnsons initial foray research undergraduate menakers lab working pineal gland chronobiology projects graduate school stanford colin pittendrigh johnson attempted discover circadian rhythms variety organism leeches cockroaches also worked earthworms see whether would completely recover circadian rhythms upon regeneration lesioned parts brains also developed method measure ph levels inside cells search rhythmic acidbase relationships however one projects ultimately resulted publication namely paper clocks control ph bread mould neurospora johnson switched david epels marine biology lab fourth year graduate school work ph change sea urchin starfish eggs upon fertilization excellent system apply method developed earlier measure ph levels inside successfully published number papers postdoctoral studies hastings johnson returned biological clocks field worked mainly rhythms bioluminescent alga gonyaulax later algal model system genetics chlamydomonas prior late chronobiologists believed bacteria simple express circadian johnson accept dogma early examining haloarchaea possible presence biological clocks studies haloarchaea productive studies suggested possibility circadian rhythms johnson along colleagues collaborators used luciferase reporter system prove synechococcus elongatus phylum cyanobacteria showed evidence daily bacterial circadian rhythms hour synechococcus expressed freerunning rhythms temperature compensation ability entrain defining properties circadian organisms also regulate cell division forbidden allowed therefore johnson coworkers challenged original belief bacteria daily biological cycles moreover identified central elements bacterial clock namely kaiabc gene cluster determined currently idea bacterial circadian rhythms exist least prokaryotes well accepted chronobiology community prokaryotes important model system studying johnson team developed patented new method studying interaction molecules based f√∂rster resonance energy transfer fret also known fluorescent resonance energy transfer modified existing technique fret instead using light activate fluorophores attached proteins interest employed bioluminescent proteins luciferase activity bret eliminates need light excitation avoids changes light generally causes circadian clocks resetting clock phase avoids light excitation case fret bret also helpful tissues autofluorescent light excitation causes phototoxicity photoresponses retina photobleaching partnership new method measuring proteinprotein interactions gives researchers ability develop novel reporters intracellular calcium hydrogen ions method projected extremely useful researchers dealing live cell cultures cell extracts purified proteins johnson lab currently applying biophysical methods explain central bacterial clock proteins kaia kaib kaic oscillate together laboratory dr martin egli dr johnsons lab led concerted effort apply structural biology techniques insight circadian clock lab also used mutants codon bias cyanobacteria provide first rigorous evidence adaptive significance biological clocks johnson lab expanding study bacterial circadian rhythms cyanobacteria purple currently lab also conducting studies circadian system mammals vivo vitro using luminescence tool monitor circadian rhythms finally johnson lab studying circadian sleep phenotypes mouse models serious human neurodevelopmental disorder called angelman syndrome lab hopes find chronotherapeutic ways ameliorate sleep disorders
