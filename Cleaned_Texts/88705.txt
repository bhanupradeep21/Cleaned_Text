beings born sexual energy energy thought develop five stages oral anal phallic latency genital stages first stage oral stage occurs birth two years age key component oral stage childs fascination mouth specifically putting items mouth breast feeding etc child thought get great pleasure objects placed mouth second stage anal stage occurs months age three years stage childs main focus anus experience toilet training thought quite pleasurable third phase phallic stage occurs three six years age stage main focus child discovering genital region children become aware bodies bodies children well parents bodies children also become aware anatomical sex differences male female genitalia freud believed stage boys idea needed compete fathers order possess mothers also believed girls felt

result road also intellectual disability even death result extreme cases neglect dependency needs usually cases biological needs general depression sadness loneliness likely results dependency needs met regardless individuals age many experiments relating importance dependency need conducted years three influential experiments outlined study conducted harry harlow questioning current theories dependency love time harlow team stated love began developing feeding bond infant mother notion applied family members well also thought humans along social animals lived organized societies order regularize sexual contact harlow fascinated concept love nurturing worked monkeys test theories berger harlows monkey experiment newborn monkeys separated mothers almost immediately birth raised substitute mothers made either wire wood covered soft cloth one experiments wire wood mothers presented infant monkey cage one wore nipple infant able nurse monkeys nursed wire mother others cloth mother according berger harlow found even wire mother source food infant monkey spent time cloth surrogate harlow also found cloth mother provided food infant monkeys also able provide comfort security interpretation made harlow liking cloth surrogate mother showed importance affection emotion nurturing dependency motherchild relationships phenomenon infant dependency need first noticed rené spitzs orphan study study researchers learned higher mortality rates infants maintained orphanages obvious factors inadequate nutrition contagious diseases etc ruled researchers discovered mortality rates could greatly ameliorated nurses charge infants orphanages cuddle way approximated amount cuddling infants would normally receive parents spitzs orphan study focused two groups children starting children infants continued way reached years age first group children raised orphanage children group received minimal care let alone special oneonone time caregiver second group infant received individual care various women caregivers serving prison sentence caregivers children first year lives children group turned two years old dramatic differences occurred results experiment showed drastic differences found children raised orphanage received minimal care less developmental progress children raised prison kids could walk could talk orphanage kids signs intellectual disability psychologically socially underdeveloped age whereas prison group children reached point full development age division defined previously dependency needs vital originally
