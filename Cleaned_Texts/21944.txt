matechoice copying nonindependent mate choice occurs female animal species copies another fellow females mate words nonindependent matechoice females sexual preferences get socially inclined toward fellow behavior speculated one driving forces sexual selection evolution male also hypothesized matechoice copying induce speciation due selective pressure certain preferred male moreover matechoice copying one form social learning animals behave differently depending observe surrounding words animals tend process social stimuli receive observing behavior conspecifics execute similar behavior mate choice copying found wide variety different species including limited invertebrates like common fruit fly drosophila fish guppies poecilia ocellated birds like black mammals norway rat rattus studies focused females male mate copying also found sailfin mollies poecilia matechoice copying requires highly developed form social recognition observer ie copier female recognizes demonstrator ie chooser female mating target male later recognizes target male mate though might seem simple observer females actually copy choice haphazard demonstrator female instead copy based perception demonstrator females guppies poecilia reticulata instance females likely copy mate choice larger sized fish copy mate choice fish smaller besides immediate copying based visual cues hypothesized observer females tend later choose males qualities target male demonstrator mated however known whether generalization preference holds true observers inability discriminate target male similarlooking males accounts interestingly instances observer female tend copy demonstrators female choice geographical region ie location observed demonstrator sexually interact target male observer female presented target male different location less likelihood observer would execute mate cases direct visual observation sexual interaction demonstrator target necessary female rodents instance use olfactory stimuli reference whether target male chosen females female rodent may choose mate target male smell females associated male urine indication mated fellow mentioned earlier mate choice copying developed form social recognition requires highly efficient cognitive processes observer female able identify demonstrator female target male also execute suitable behavior ie copying response observed words execution mate choice copying intricate behavior likely involves coordinated function endocrine system digestive system nervous system reproductive addition sex hormones neurotransmitters oxytocin ot argininevasopressin avp involved mediating social recognition demonstrator target well sexual approach target ot proven particular importance mediation matechoice copying ot geneknockout female mice failed recognize demonstrator female target moreover ot geneknockout mice showed significantly decreased sexual interest males even males previously observed mating demonstrator results likely attributed ots indispensable role stimulating sexual arousal feelings trust female mice absence ot hindered knockout female mice trusting demonstrator females mating choice experiencing general sexual attraction research also shown ot regulated estrogen testosterone part estrous cycles female mice go matechoice copying evolved eliminate possible time energy fact matechoice copying exists various species due differential abilities females choosing desirable male good quality words females capability taking good decisions comes therefore matechoice copying behavior evolved social learning educate naive choose desirable male allowing good quality genes propagated population instance na√Øve female mice entered estrus cycle first time might choose male urine associated smell older females estrus therefore matechoice copying reduces error frequency matechoice among inexperienced females guaranteeing increased relative fitness copying another example seen black grouse tetrao tetrix naive females first breeding season tend mate later experienced females former copy choice matechoice copying also becomes effective females constrained time ie breeding season soon end case females tend copy others choice avoid going timeconsuming choice process might cost able mate matechoice copying also effective eliminating stress females monogamous species gouldian finches erythrura gouldiae would otherwise mate lessdesirable poorquality another hypothesis also proposed game theory applies matechoice copying behavior females choose whether observer demonstrator based abundance female might tend become observer population demonstrators abundant increase chances access highquality male vice despite fact matechoice copying theory reduces relative fitness males chosen reduces risks injury possible death aggressive courtship behaviors would otherwise participated chosen highquality evidence shown species females display cryptic mate choice males tend display reverse mate choice copying avoid mating females visually observed mating higherquality rival mate choice behavior displayed male mainly avoid wasting energy sexual interaction might necessarily increase relative fitness female chose sperms rival fertilize also instances males certain species get choosier sex due higher parental investment offspring females example males practice matechoice copying would sailfin mollies poecilia various evidence fitness costs mate choice copying however suggested depending solely social cues choose potential mate always advantageous fact might cases lead mating unfit poorquality male chosen maladaptively demonstrator moreover species males display matechoice copying atlantic mollies poecilia mexicana demonstrator male might employ known deception hypothesis demonstrator male pretends mate undesirable female deceive observer male choosing deceitful behavior facilitated demonstrators ability change behavior senses presence observer well observers inability recognize behavior demonstrator consequently observer male mates undesirable poorquality female negatively affecting survival observer males offspring turn relative researchers suggested alternative hypotheses might explain females might display nonindependent mate choice hypotheses include kinassociated genetic preferences common environmental effects consexual cueing associative proponents hypothesis argue females tend choose mate target male due females shared innate preferences traits target male words genetic similarity females due kinship reflected mate choice behavior researchers view mere act social females tend mate choice due abiotic factors rather matechoice instance distribution food resources might limit foraging ability females explore potential mates farther regions therefore females confined region might end mating male holds greatest potential among rivals targeted demonstrator another influencing biotic factor predation females threatened predation would avoid foraging mate instead mate male best quality traits confined best quality male might cases polygamous species fallow deer dama dama outsider female deer ie female part harem might choose mate harems dominant male female attracted part harems large group females rather attracted dominant male aside mate choice copying part large female group would provide outsider female protection company food sometimes nonindependent mate choice direct copying observed mating preference fact result association observer female constructs mating target male receiving desired instance species males present females nuptial gift prerequisite mating female observer females likely associate mating target male nuptial gift might association might lead observer female mate target male demonstrator mated even though lot evidence support hypothesis offers plausible explanation females species might exhibit nonindependent mate
