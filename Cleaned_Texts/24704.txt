increase testosterone exaggerated sexual dimorphisms increased aggression increased interest males species may mark mud undergo physiological changes perform characteristic displays order make visually appealing males also use olfaction entice females mate using secretions glands soaking deer also leave personal scent marking around urinating legs urine soaking hair covers tarsal glands male deer often breeding rut known rutting period domestic sheep management tupping males often rub antlers horns trees shrubs fight wallow mud dust selfanoint herd estrus females together displays

markings using different scent glands scent glands include pedal glands found toes preorbital glands found corners eyes tarsal glands found lower inside hind legs metatarsal glands found outside hind

bulls male elks run herd satellite bulls frequently spar one another rut turn make sparring bugle vocalization made exclusively bulls typical bugle consists three acoustic parts low frequency onglide sounds guttural tone ascends highest frequency part call termed whistle last portion call offglide returns lowfrequency function behind acoustic structure bugle directly correlated males physiology different frequencies travel varied terms physiology larger animal gets lower frequency sound able increase size comes increase vocal fold length longer vocal folds confer increased ability produce lower frequency relationship bugle directed toward bulls toward cows demonstrate size thus fitness bull vocalizing bull direct bugle toward cows gathering chasing estrus cow herd bull direct bugle toward another bull express dominance herd satellite bull may use bugle challenge herd reason highfrequency portion bugle due propagative efficiency differing frequencies varying environments studies shown bulls harem increases diameter meaning cows become dispersed tends vocalize frequently within closer higherpitched section call propagates environment better bull uses congregate harem becoming spatially dispersed thus harder acoustic analyses comparing bull elk bugles cow elk cohesion calls show notable degree acoustic similarity indicating vocalizations may perform congregating function bugle often used bull condense ability produce highfrequency vocalization large animal explained larger body mass positively correlates longer vocal folds thus lower frequency emission larger body size also corresponds decreased ability emit high frequency bull elk overcome unique anatomical mechanism produces sound using different pathway vibrations vocal bull elk constrict supra laryngeal vocal tract specifically nasal cavity order create smaller opening exhaled air pass air moves opening causes tissues vibrate produce high frequency sound waves comprise whistle portion anatomical
