benefit providing improved traction wet better grasp wet results called question study failed reproduce improvement handling wet objects wrinkled however study gripping efficiency found wrinkles decreased force required grip wet objects supporting traction prior study common explanation based water absorption keratinladen epithelial skin immersed causing skin expand resulting larger surface area forcing wrinkle usually tips fingers toes first wrinkle thicker layer keratin absence hairs secrete protective oil called sebum study however lewis pickering studying patients palsy median nerve
