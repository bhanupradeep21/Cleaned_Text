transit signal due planet substantially larger estimated kepler occurs sources light simply star transited binary system cases surface area producing light assumed given transit signal larger assumed since roughly stellar systems binaries koi signals could planets within binary systems consequently larger estimated assuming planets likely form binary systems single star systems however additional

september study muirhead et al reports recalibration estimated radii effective temperatures several dwarf stars kepler sample yields six new terrestrialsized candidates within habitable zones stars several kois contain transiting objects hotter stars transit indicating smaller objects white dwarfs formed mass transfer objects include believed binary system containing two aclass stars highly eccentric orbits semimajor axis au periastron tidal distortions cause periodic brightening system addition tidal forces induce resonant pulsations one stars making known stellar system exhibit triple star system comprising two low mass solar masses stars orbiting period days semimajor axis au together orbit star period days semimajor axis au three stars eclipse one another allows precise measurements masses radii makes low mass stars known fully convective stars accurate determinations parameters ie better several percent stars constitute eclipsing binary system cm
