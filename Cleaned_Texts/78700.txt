opposite condition seen chinshakiangosaurus derived sauropodomorph suggests wide cheekless gape may evolved twice sauropodomorpha aardonyx sauropods advanced characteristics limbs aardonyx suggest habitually bipedal evidence bipedalism seen forelimbs structure radius ulna limited degree manus could pronated length humerus percent femur however characteristics found fore hind limbs aardonyx show trend toward habitual quadrupedalism would eventually lead obligatory quadrupedalism seen sauropods proximal end ulna possesses incipient craniolateral process gives bone yshape similar although subtle obligatory quadrupedal sauropodomorphs radius shifted cranially radial fossa allows ulna cradle radius craniolaterally characteristics suggest development towards greater quadrupedalism aardonyx although hindlimbs aardonyx clearly show evidence bipedalism retention convex proximal lateral profile femur position cranial trochanter far lateral margin femur also evidence indicates shift toward quadrupedalism features femur suggests gait aardonyx slower basal sauropodomorphs shaft femur straighter fourth trochanter distally placed repositioning fourth trochanter distal position causes caudofemoralis longus muscle main femoral retractor muscle greater leverage mechanical advantage conversely decrease velocity femoral retraction consequently aardonyx powerful slower walker typical
