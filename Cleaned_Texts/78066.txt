majungasaurus məˌdʒʌŋɡəˈsɔːrəs lit mahajanga lizard genus abelisaurid theropod dinosaur lived madagascar million years ago end cretaceous period making one last known nonavian dinosaurs went extinct extinction event genus contains single species majungasaurus crenatissimus dinosaur also called majungatholus name considered junior synonym majungasaurus like abelisaurids majungasaurus bipedal predator short snout although forelimbs completely known short hind limbs longer stocky distinguished abelisaurids wider skull rough texture thickened bone top snout single rounded horn roof skull originally mistaken dome pachycephalosaur also teeth upper lower jaws abelisaurids genus one first abelisaurs discovered first found although thought species megalosaurus named known several wellpreserved skulls abundant skeletal material majungasaurus recently become one beststudied theropod dinosaurs southern hemisphere appears closely related abelisaurids india rather south america continental africa fact important biogeographical implications majungasaurus apex predator ecosystem mainly preying sauropods like rapetosaurus also one dinosaurs direct evidence cannibalism french

distinctive skull ornamentation including swollen fused nasals frontal horn ceratosaurs including carnotaurus rajasaurus ceratosaurus bore crests head structures likely played role intraspecific competition although exact function within context unknown hollow cavity inside frontal horn majungasaurus would weakened structure probably precluded use direct physical combat although horn may served display variation ornamentation majungasaurus individuals evidence sexual scientists suggested unique skull shape majungasaurus abelisaurids indicate different predatory habits theropods whereas theropods characterized long low skulls narrow width abelisaurid skulls taller wider often shorter length narrow skulls theropods well equipped withstand vertical stress powerful bite good withstanding torsion comparison modern mammalian predators theropods may used strategy similar ways long narrowsnouted canids delivery many bites weakening prey abelisaurids especially majungasaurus may instead adapted feeding strategy similar modern felids short broad snouts bite hold prey subdued majungasaurus even broader snout abelisaurids aspects anatomy may also support biteandhold hypothesis neck strengthened robust vertebrae interlocking ribs ossified tendons well reinforced muscle attachment sites vertebrae back skull muscles would able hold head steady despite struggles prey abelisaurid skulls also strengthened many areas bone mineralized skin creating characteristic rough texture bones particularly true majungasaurus nasal bones fused thickened strength hand lower jaw majungasaurus sported large fenestra opening side seen ceratosaurs well synovial joints certain bones allowed high degree flexibility lower jaw although extent seen snakes may adaptation prevent fracture lower jaw holding onto struggling prey animal front teeth upper jaw robust rest provide anchor point bite low crown height majungasaurus teeth prevented breaking struggle finally unlike teeth allosaurus theropods curved front back abelisaurids like majungasaurus teeth curved front edge straighter back cutting edge structure may served prevent slicing instead holding teeth place examination teeth majungasaurus indicates theropod replaced teeth anywhere times faster theropods replacing entire set within span two months gnawing bone may significant reason rapid tooth majungasaurus largest predator environment known large herbivores time sauropods like rapetosaurus scientists suggested majungasaurus perhaps abelisaurids specialized hunting sauropods adaptations strengthen head neck biteandhold type attack might useful sauropods would tremendously powerful animals hypothesis may also supported hindlegs majungasaurus short stocky opposed longer slender legs theropods majungasaurus would moved fast similarsized theropods would trouble keeping slowmoving sauropods robust hindlimb bones suggest powerful legs shorter length would lowered animals center gravity thus majungasaurus may sacrificed speed majungasaurus tooth marks rapetosaurus bones confirm least fed sauropods whether actually killed although sauropods may prey choice majungasaurus discoveries published detail finds madagascar indicate presence majungasaurus diet numerous bones majungasaurus discovered bearing tooth marks identical found sauropod bones localities marks spacing teeth majungasaurus jaws size majungasaurus teeth contain smaller notches consistent serrations teeth majungasaurus large theropod known area simplest explanation feeding members suggestions triassic coelophysis cannibal recently disproven leaving majungasaurus nonavian theropod confirmed cannibalistic although evidence cannibalism may occurred species unknown majungasaurus actively hunted kind scavenged however researchers noted modern komodo monitors sometimes kill competing access carcasses lizards proceed cannibalize remains rivals may suggest similar behavior majungasaurus scientists reconstructed respiratory system majungasaurus based superbly preserved series vertebrae ua recovered maevarano formation vertebrae ribs contained cavities pneumatic foramina may resulted infiltration avianstyle lungs air sacs birds

severe physical trauma resulting loss tail tip followed osteomyelitis infection last remaining vertebrae alternatively infection may come first led end tail becoming necrotic falling first example tail truncation known nonavian theropod small number specimens preserved pathologies majungasaurus suggest multitude injuries occurred obtained course lives individuals studied furthermore small number injured majungasaurus specimens observed amongst recovered indicates well preserved individuals generally lack observable pathologies select individuals shown possessed multiple pathologies general pattern also noted large nonavian theropods patterns may result snowball effect one injury infection increased likelihood additional maladies injuries due functional impairment compromised immune systems individuals initial injury majungasaurus known many wellpreserved specimens different ages well studied regards growth development throughout ontogeny skull majungasaurus specifically jugal postorbital quadratojugal seems become taller robust additionally skull bones became fused eye sockets became proportionally smaller indicates shift dietary preferences juveniles research michael demic et al indicates among slowestgrowing theropods based studies lines arrested growth several bones found majungasaurus took twenty years reach maturity may result harsh environment lived however abelisaurids also found comparably slow growth specimens majungasaurus recovered maevarano formation mahajanga province northwestern madagascar including complete material came anembalemba member although majungasaurus teeth also found underlying masorobe member overlying miadana member sediments dated radiometrically evidence biostratigraphy paleomagnetism suggest deposited
