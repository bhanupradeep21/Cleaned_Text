commercial service provides certain types portable toilets delivers empty containers picking full ones service transports safely disposes reuses collected excreta cost collection excreta usually borne users suitable development support functioning partnerships cbs used provide lowincome urban populations safe collection transport treatment excrement lower cost installing maintaining cases cbs based

like payperuse public toilets household subscription containerbased sanitation services enable customers discontinue usage choose advantage low upfront cost another similarity public toilets capital required installing household toilets sanitation systems prohibitive containerbased sanitation toilets installed little upfront cost underlying principles containerbased system appear superficially similar models excreta management also contain excreta insitu might bucket toilets pan latrines excreta carried open containers likely emptied proper treatment india term manual scavenging refers emptying pit latrines key distinction containerbased sanitation system include manual collection containers containers cartridges sealed excreta treated people come contact waste throughout entire service chain containment emptying transportation treatment disposal reuse proponents also note users freedom choice containerbased toilets portable customers could choose another service provider containerbased sanitation toilet typically requires water often moved quite easily removable container excreta routinely exchanged empty container full toilet bowl often lid odor eliminated adding dry cover material using biodegradable plastic film goal eliminate human contact feces reduce odor avoid attracting insects cases containerbased sanitation systems require separation urine excrement therefore urinediverting dry toilet often used types toilets simple minimize volume waste excreta container diverted urine often drained soil water table low enough also stored long enough pathogen dieoff via desiccation biodegredation used plant solar exposure highly correlated biosolids meet epa class pathogen containers vary size liters liters depending particular system sealing containers transported service providers centralized facilities waste removed processed containers disinfected delivered customer waste processing take many different forms simple pathogen reduction full
