marked changes behavior broodiness usually associated female birds although males bird species become broody nonavian animals also show broodiness wild birds egg incubation normal essential phase

induce broodiness even breeds normally go environmental conditions stimulate broodiness heavy breeds chickens warm weather tends bring removing eggs day sight hens helps avoid broodiness domestic poultry also wild species captivity continued egg laying means eggs laid would occur natural poultry farming battery cages also helps avoid hens stop laying become broody commercial poultry breeders
