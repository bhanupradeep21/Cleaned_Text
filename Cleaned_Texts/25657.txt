identifying unidentified flying objects ufos difficult task due normally poor quality evidence provided report sighting unknown observations subsequent reporting often made untrained astronomy atmospheric phenomena aeronautics physics nevertheless officially investigated ufo sightings us air forces project blue book identified due honest misidentifications natural phenomena aircraft prosaic explanations early us air force attempts explain ufo sightings unexplained sightings routinely numbered one five reports however early right cias robertson panel percentages unexplained sightings dropped precipitously usually percent given year project blue book closed cases classified truly unidentified ufos explained sometimes termed ifos identified flying objects following major studies undertaken past years reported identification ufos project sign lists order investigate credibility existence following factors must considered technical method support lift wings fuselage lift wingless rotor vertical jet magnus effect aerostatic lighterthanair craft method propulsion thrust propeller reciprocating engine combination jet rocket ramjet aerodynamic example katzmayer defined

astronomer j allen hynek consultant air forces project blue book provide serious scientific investigation ufos hendry spent months personally investigating ufo reports hendry published conclusions ufo handbook guide investigating evaluating reporting ufo hendry admitted would like find evidence extraterrestrials noted vast majority cases prosaic explanations found reports definitely probably identifiable unidentified hardcore events defied conceivable conventional reports project blue book special report compiled included reported ufo sightings battelle employed four scientific analysts sought divide cases knowns unknowns third category insufficient information also broke knowns unknowns four categories quality excellent poor order case deemed identified two analysts independently agree solution case called unidentified four analysts agree report classified unidentified defined reports sightings wherein description object maneuvers could fitted pattern known object phenomenon cases judged identified unidentified insufficient information make determinationcitation needed bbsr broke results based whether identification considered certain merely doubtful example astronomical aircraft ifo categories considered certain doubtful overall listed ifos thought solved certainty still considered doubtful addition case lacking adequate data placed insufficient information category separate ifos ufos battelle bbsr study included many internal military reports cases designated military military witnesses tended submit better quality reports much fewer reports rated insufficient information higher percentages unknowns previous breakdown percentage ufos rose case quality military civilian subcategories summary table best reports rated excellent good worst reports doubtful poor key study bbsr statistically compare ifos ufos six characteristics color number objects shape duration observations speed light brightness significant differences two classes probably ufos representing merely failure properly identify prosaic phenomena could already account ifos hand differences statistically significant would suggest ifos ufos indeed distinctly different phenomena initial results characteristics except brightness tested significant less much less brightness greater removing astronomical sightings knowns redoing test two categories number speed significant less remainder results indicated statistically significant difference characteristics ascribed ufos ifos perhaps significant initial results suggested two characteristics brightness speed significance actually increased revised test like air force astronomer allan hendry found small percentage cases hoaxes sightings actually honest misidentifications prosaic phenomena hendry attributed inexperience misperception cases hendry deemed clear prosaic explanations ifos unknowns ufos ufos hendry reported might still prosaic explanation cases possible plausible explanation completely unexplained remaining miscellaneous cases garbage cases hendry deemed witnesses unreliable reports hopelessly contradictory lacking sufficient information overall three major categories cases astronomical explanations aircraft balloons breakdown allowed readily explained five main classes objects bright stars planets advertising planes aircraft meteors reentering space debris balloons various types mostly weather advertising balloons also prank balloons hendry also used case classification system developed mentor j allen hynek established cufos study carried summary table bbsr hendry found three classes objects aircraft large majority identifiable ufo reports referred ifos two studies example hendrys study bright stars planets made cases meteors much lesser extent reentering space debris made hovering aircraft helicopters blimps aircraft appear hovering airplanes seen night front headlights approach landing often confuse witnesses aircraft strobe lights bbsr reported much higher percentage balloons hendry claims misidentification afterthefact analyses direct observations often misconstrued skeptics ufo advocates alike suggest experiences exist merely explained prosaic causes instance

receiving hundreds reports every month normal terrestrial events eg overflights international space station space shuttle satellites flares light iridium satellites appearance typical meteors

international space station venus brightest object sky often visible early morning evening sky even experienced witnesses especially unfamiliar surroundings unusual atmospheric conditions fail identify venus correctly however location venus easily calculable professional astronomers said many ufo reports received concerned citizens due observations astronomer phil plait particular suggested venus responsible majority ufo brightest meteors known bolides long lasting fireballs leave trail sky visible hour passing events relatively rare witnessed large area earth since events occur kilometers atmosphere witnessing events familiar meteors easily fooled thinking meteor ufo meteors predictable degree accuracy planets stars manmade objects satellites occurrences difficult prove

cia released report indicating many ufo reports classified aircraft like needed increase civilian drone usage popularity throughout may moving identification objects away ufos towards stationary cloud formations often appear mountains happen winds eddies help shape clouds lens shaped clouds people see flying saucers light distortion air turbulence cause celestial bodies move limited degree visual perceptual effect called autokinetic effect caused small involuntary eye movements staring starlike light black background without frame reference observers may cause stars planets appear start stop

driving vehicle witnesses may believe ufo following even though celestial body actually stationary even police normally reliable witnesses occasionally fooled sightings bright stars planets hendrys cases caused celestial bodies witnesses greatly underestimated distances objects giving distance estimates ranging feet miles km according hendry moving clouds may also sometimes confuse observers creating induced motion hendry believes occasionally makes observers also believe objects suddenly disappeared make rapid departure fata morgana type mirage responsible ufo sightings making objects located astronomical horizon appear hovering sky also magnifies images makes look unrecognizable ufos seen radar also due fata morgana since water vapor air create radar mirages readily temperature inversions create optical mirages according gepansepra official ufo investigation france well known atmospheric ducting explanation certain optical mirages particular arctic illusion called fata morgana distant ocean surface ice essentially flat appears viewer form vertical columns spires castles air people often assume mirages occur rarely may true optical mirages conditions radar mirages common due role played water vapor strongly affects atmospheric refractivity relation radio waves since clouds closely associated high levels water vapor optical mirages due water vapor often rendered
