hemlock native temperate regions europe north africa western asia species c chaerophylloides c fontanum c sphaerocarpum native southern africa plants genus conium eudicots flowering plants distinguished two cotyledons embryonic leaves tricolpate threepored pollen typically biennial forming basal rosettes first year growth sprouting rigid hollow flower stalk second germination occurs spring autumn occasionally plants germinate early spring annual instead plants grow best wet poorly drained areas nutrient rich soil grow well nitrogen rich soil able tolerate high levels heavy metals arsenic cadmium lead conium plants diploid chromosome number haploid number grow one three meters tall varying species produce hermaphroditic flowers typically insect pollinated conium plants herbaceous growing nonwoody hollow hairless stems generally stem striated light green however coloring varies species variety express purple blotching throughout purple blotching localized near base others markings alternate leaves pinnately compound finely divided exact pinnation patterns varying species leaf type example stem leaves c maculatum plants typically pinnate basal leaves pinnate leaves petioles light green similar stem coloring species varieties express purple blotching leaves terminal inflorescences made many small flowers colored white yellow green depending species flowers grouped together umbrella shaped umbels plants genus conium compound umbels multiple dome shaped clusters branching central point flowers around mm across umbrella shaped umbels range cm two seeded fruit one significant distinguishing factors species relatively round slightly flattened dark green brown depending species range mm long species distinctive light brown ribs ribs noticeably crenulate scalloped edges others show relatively unpronounced rib plant typically produces seeds germinate suitable conditions however seeds remain viable years dispersal producing large number seeds growing

crushed additionally species c maculatum stands purple blotching genus name conium references greek word koneios spin whirl alluding dizzying effects plants poison vernacular hemlock commonly refers species c maculatum also refers cicuta species water hemlock species similar physical features highly toxic genus conium erected carl linnaeus several botanists jfm cannon gh leute jh ross historically made argument southern african species conium significant distinctions even claim genus independent species argue populations southern africa may result chance introduction individuals represented genetically limited range total variability species believe species conium synonymous c maculatum others believe two three distinct southern african species conium known ancient greeks

botanist olive mary hilliard english botanist brian laurence burtt together published classifications south african journal botany december plants world online accepts six conium chaerophylloides growing two three meters tall distinguished unique yellowgreen flowers groups many small flowers make obconical umbels outer rays individual flowers form angle point attachment giving umbel conelike shape fans base inflorescence produce round mm long dark brown green fruit deep lightly colored conium fontanum expresses similar obconical umbel arrangement produces slightly larger fruit develops white flowers characteristic species conium genus fruit usually larger mm long ridges dark green brown color rest plants grow one three meters tall depending conium hilliburttorum always recognized distinct species within genus like c sphaerocarpum plants white flowers grouped hemispherical umbels small fruit however researchers argue fruit ovary anatomy significantly distinguish c sphaerocarpum develop similar sized fruit however c hilliburttorum fruit displays prominent ribs whereas c sphaerocarpum fruit relatively smooth c hilliburttorum ovaries covered tubercules small lumpy outgrowths like c chaerophylloides fruit however c chaerophylloides plants yellow green flowers grow much larger fruit much conium maculatum distinguished red purple blotching along hairless green stem varieties southern african species express moderate degree blotching base stem simply green grows white flowers umbrellashaped conium sphaerocarpum produces similarly colored slightly smaller fruit less mm long ovary relatively smooth almost completely flat inconspicuous ridges additionally small white flowers arranged hemispherical umbels umbels outer rays protrude horizontally forming semisphere shape flat
