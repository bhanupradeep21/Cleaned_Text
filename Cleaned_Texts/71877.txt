flatline electrical time sequence measurement shows activity therefore represented shows flat line instead moving one almost always refers either flatlined electrocardiogram heart shows electrical asystole flat electroencephalogram brain shows electrical activity brain death specific cases involved various definitions death cardiac flatline also called asystole possibly generated malfunction electrocardiography device recommended first rule true asystole emergence condition definition cardiac flatline referred asystole identified using ecgekg electrocardiogram test asystole occurs electrical mechanical activities heart causes ecgekg flatline asystole occurs hearts electrical mechanical activities stop also results causes hypoxia acidosis hypokalemia hyperkalemia hypovolemia toxins pulmonary thrombosis coronary thrombosis additional causes could also include tension pneumothorax cardiac tamponade conditions treated immediately ecg flat line also occurs
