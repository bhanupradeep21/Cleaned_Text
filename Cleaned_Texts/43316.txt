universes arrays rubber balls oranges food herbivorous mites trays introduced predator prey mite species various permutations specifically huffaker seeking understand spatial heterogeneity varying dispersal ability species affected longterm population dynamics survival contrary previous experiments topic especially georgii gause found longterm coexistence possible select environmental conditions published findings paper experimental studies predation dispersion factors aim huffaker experiment shed light upon fundamental nature interaction establish ecosystem predatory prey species

patchiness system replacing oranges rubber balls similar size referred resultant systems universes huffaker created series universes experiment trying different arrangements reach universe predator population would annihilate prey population instead two species could coexist huffaker set three different universes examine effect patchiness prey species population dynamics prey species mites initially placed one orange population observed recorded several weeks huffaker noted one source error difference nutritional value oranges oranges replaced every days mites chance deplete nutritional value oranges completely replacement temperature humidity kept constant universe half exposed oranges clumped together universe b half exposed oranges spread orange balls universe c oranges exposed alternated rubber balls huffaker found mites migrated new oranges original orange habitat food source depleted overpopulated universe produced fluctuating mite population due complete exploitation orange resources leading population spikes followed rapid declines universe b stable oscillations lower average population huffaker attributed combination dispersal difficulty food supply two universes dealt food supply food sources close together dispersal play major role population dynamics huffaker created nine different universes examine effect interaction spatial heterogeneity

cases extinction near extinction prey species universes except universe one population oscillation predator prey species cases species became extinct initial peak decline extinction would occur predator species completely exploited prey species lacking food source would starve death contrast universe three population peaks huffaker wrote utilizing large complex environment make less likely predators contact prey positions essentially possible produce three waves oscillations density predators prey waves represent direct reciprocal predatorprey dependence obvious central huffaker investigations concept interactions general predation believed reduce prey populations however notable exceptions rule example plants shown increase growth rates response model describes basic population dynamics predation solution equations simple onepredator species oneprey species model stable linked oscillation population levels predator prey however time lags respective population growths modeled oscillations tend amplify eventually leading extinction species ricker model exemplifies dynamic russian ecologist georgii gause demonstrated tendency toward extinction among populations series experiments found experiments didinium nasutum predator paramecium caudatum prey nausatum overexploited p caudatum leading first extinction subsequently experiment huffaker probing gause conclusion overexploitation specifically examining environmental factors grouping patchiness ease motion could affect population dynamics point achieving coexistence multiple cycles main questions huffaker set experiment relation adequately described gause theory overexploitation may effects changes physical conditions upon degree stability permanence relation order influence stability population density parameters shelter physical adversity environment food disease natural enemies kinds short questions seek understand effect spatial heterogeneity population system spatial heterogeneity variation environment space eg differences oranges balls huffaker expanding upon gauses experiments introducing heterogeneity gauses experiments found predator prey populations would become extinct regardless initial population size however gause also concluded community could selfsustaining refuges prey population experiments huffaker attempted show refuges necessary maintenance prey populations believed instead spatial heterogeneity differing effects species dispersal ability could create moving refuge prey population indeed creating patchy system facilitated prey dispersal predator dispersal huffaker able achieve system underwent three cycles population prevent extinction mites huffaker introduced spatial heterogeneity several ways like gause manipulated dispersal within system addition petroleum jelly barriers toothpicks added heterogeneity landscape allowed prey mites disperse readily predator mites also patchily distributing oranges huffaker created system subpopulations aggregating stable metapopulation two manipulations spatial heterogeneity allowed natural fluctuations extinctions populations occur locally without causing extinctions overall metapopulation huffaker experimental universes showed many circumstances interactions lead extinction populations interactions spatial heterogeneity dispersal ability predator prey species distribution food sources create environment predator prey species coexist distribution one prey species placed oranges impediments predator movement created petroleum jelly divisions sections oranges dispersal aid wooden sticks prey species worked together create spatially heterogeneous environment predator prey species survived three population cycles huffaker ultimately concluded added spatial heterogeneity mite populations could continued oscillate beyond three cycles looking forward huffaker noted importance understanding concepts respect understanding impact monocultures ie low spatial
