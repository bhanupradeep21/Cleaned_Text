testicular atrophy medical condition one testicles testes diminish size may accompanied reduced testicular function testicular atrophy related temporary shrinkage surrounding scrotum might occur response cold temperature testicles involved testosterone sperm production signs symptoms testicular atrophy overlap related infertility low testosterone prepubescent person testicular atrophy may underdevelopment secondary sex characteristics eg lack penis sexually developed individuals testicular atrophy may accompanied lower sex drive increased breast additional signs symptoms vary depend specific cause testicle shrinkage causes include alcohol anabolic steroid testosterone replacement direct damage diagnosis testicular atrophy includes physical examination testicles well imaging measure testicular testosterone blood level also taken assess function additional tests may ordered depending suspected causes shrinkage treatment potential reversibility testicular atrophy also dependent causemedical citation needed different signs symptoms associated testicular atrophy depending persons age symptoms puberty centered around stunting sexual characteristics associated hormonal changes symptoms puberty include wider range factors signs symptoms may stem underlying conditions cause testicular atrophy perceptible sign testicular atrophy shrinkage signs symptoms puberty include testosterone hormone found primarily portion maleassigned reproductive system called testes normally measured nanograms per deciliter testosterone charge growth production many sexual attributes people testes including facial hair pubic hair penis size vocal muscle mass changes regulation sex drive sperm production normal testosterone levels people testes yet hit puberty less nanograms per deciliter low testosterone defined hypogonadism people testes hypogonadism people testes established hormonal inhibition testosterone either inherited acquired later stage life circumstances prepubescent hypogonadism many sexual developmental characteristics may altered testosterone affects hair growth regulating follicle turn affects specific growth phases hair follicle person testes hits puberty androgen steroid sex hormone produced increased rate creates terminal hair follicles terminal hair follicles create thicker pigmented hair also regulated testosterone production testosterone also impacts prepubescent penis size providing penile tissue girth density drop testosterone values mainly due significant impairment leydig cells brought upon hypogonadism leydig cells located testes serve create testosterone androgen damaged production testosterone signs symptoms puberty includemedical citation needed typical testosterone levels people testes puberty range nanograms per deciliter low testosterone values people testes postpuberty would considered value nanograms per deciliter decreased testosterone values caused testicular atrophy lead explain many signs symptoms listed including reduced sex drive infertility soft testicles reduction hair lower muscle mass throughout body testosterone plays important role physiologically stimulating sex drive people testes testosterone levels drop normal values libido sexual drive reduced lead development erectile dysfunction condition penis able get stay indirectly affect fertility well addition testosterone important muscle mass formation increases amount lean muscle mass body testosterone encourages metabolic activity body turn stimulates protein synthesis protein synthesis highly important development enlargement muscle therefore lack testosterone would alter metabolic process leading decrease muscle signs symptoms testicular atrophy due secondary medical condition include secondary medical conditions may cause signs symptoms listed include testicular cancer chronic alcohol use sexually transmitted infections orchitis varicoceles torsion shrinkage testicles common advanced age overall reproductive function high alcohol usage lowers testosterone levels direct damage leydig cells produce testosterone affecting hormones involved signaling leydig cells produce result testicular atrophy common feature among individuals high alcohol testicular malformations low testosterone levels also commonly found people alcoholic cirrhosis negative effect alcohol use worsened liver damage excessive alcohol intake cause inflammation degradation cells liver cause testicular abnormalities including testicular anabolic steroid use testosterone replacement therapy trt found cause testicular atrophy similar anabolic steroids trt used either prescription illicitly mimic effects testosterone produced body building muscle maintaining sex however also inhibit bodys production sperm testosterone lead shrinkage testicular atrophy also side effect estrogen lead reduced testosterone production testicular abnormalities due changes secretion gonadotropins hormones involved regulating testosterone production hormonal effects may due inflammation oxidative stress caused might inform whether healthcare providers decide monitor survived hormonal changes potential fertility orchitis inflammation testicles due bacterial viral infection lead testicular mumps historically significantly associated orchitis testicular atrophy become rare countries high mumps vaccination varicoceles testicular torsion conditions direct damage testicles potentially lead testicular varicoceles pooling blood veins deliver blood away testicles relatively common occurring approximately adolescent adults currently clearly established often varicoceles actually become direct cause issues related testicular torsion twisting testicle within scrotum rapidly result damage due interruption blood flow affected unlike testicular torsion considered medical possible correlation cystic fibrosis impact bilateral testicular atrophy cystic fibrosis disease causes mucus buildup various evidence shown cystic fibrosis affects multiple systems human body including reproductive system around people cystic fibrosis testicles infertile due missing vas deferens tube male reproductive system carries sperm additionally cystic fibrosis result atrophy male reproductive organs causing dehydrated secretions recent times connection syndrome found healthcare provider may initially assess size shape well firmness texture ultrasonography used detect testicular volume testicular volume measured less ml sign testicular addition testicular atrophy recognized greater loss testicular volume postoperative testicle less volume opposite assessment testicular function also dependent lab tests low testosterone potential cause testicular atrophy laboratory values blood samples confirm low free bioavailable due high levels oxidative stress semen may also higher levels sperm dna fragmentation people varicoceles cases people testicular damage undergo repair varicoceles testicular treatment selective estrogen receptor modulators serms alone addition selfadministered injections hcg aim correct hormonal imbalances caused anabolic steroid use help prevent reverse testicular atrophy people testicular atrophy due testicular torsion immediately referred surgery regardless ultrasound findings since delays rapidly decrease rate recovery consequences treating result decreased fertility may result need orchiectomy surgical procedure remove one immediate treatment reduce recovery time testes still chance testes undergo atrophy second time performance orchiectomy individuals diagnosed testicular atrophy possible negative impact testosterone levels long term result individuals typically monitored reoccurrence testicular atrophy low testosterone addition drug therapies surgical interventions treat testicular atrophy lifestyle modifications might also recommended healthcare lifestyle modifications target factors contribute infertility people testes limiting abstaining alcohol intake smoking drugs anabolic steroids cannabis opioids help infertility additionally diet modifications might encouraged reach balanced diet higher intake fish fruits vegetables nuts seeds whole grains healthier oils olive oil canola reducing intake red meats processed meats saturated trans fats also lead improved fertility outcomes poor diet otherwise lead oxidative stress causes sperm damage leading lower testicular volume lower sperm quality ensuring enough vitamin mineral intake might also recommended since fatty acids antioxidant vitamins zinc selenium might help reduce damage oxidative stress reduce inflammation zinc intake boosted meats nuts selenium intake boosted whole httpsenwikipediaorgwikitesticularatrophy
