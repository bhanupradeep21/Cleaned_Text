genetic code using nucleic acid homopolymers translate specific amino acids experiment extract prepared bacterial cells could make protein without presence intact living cells artificial form rna consisting entirely uracilcontaining nucleotides polyuridylic acid polyu added extract causing form protein composed entirely amino acid phenylalanine experiment cracked first codon genetic code showed rna controlled production specific types protein discoveries frederick griffith improved oswald avery discovered substance responsible producing inheritable change diseasecausing bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae neither protein lipid rather deoxyribonucleic acid dna colleagues colin macleod maclyn mccarty suggested dna responsible transferring genetic information later erwin discovered makeup dna differs one species another experiments helped pave way discovery structure dna help maurice wilkins rosalind franklins xray crystallography james watson francis crick proposed dna structured double one main dna mystery scientists needed figure number bases found code word codon transcription scientists knew total four bases guanine cytosine adenine thymine also knew known amino acids george gamow suggested genetic code made three nucleotides per amino acid reasoned amino acids four bases coding units could single combinations pairs combinations rather thought triplets possible combinations coding unit genetic code however proposed triplets overlapping later explained crick wobble concept seymour benzer late developed assay using phage mutations provided first detailed linearly structured map genetic region crick felt could use mutagenesis genetic recombination phage delineate nature genetic crick brenner et al experiment using phages triplet nature genetic code confirmed used frameshift mutations process called reversions add delete various numbers nucleotide triplet added deleted dna sequence encoded protein minimally affected thus concluded genetic code triplet code cause frameshift reading correctly concluded code degenerate multiple triplets correspond single amino acid nucleotide sequence read specific starting order decipher biological mystery nirenberg matthaei needed cellfree system would build amino acids proteins following work alfred tissieres failed attempts created stable system rupturing e coli bacteria cells releasing contents allowed synthesize protein correct kind rna added allowing nirenberg matthaei control experiment created synthetic rna molecules outside bacterium introduced rna e coli system experiments used mixtures amino acids individual experiment amino acids cold nonradioactive one hot radioactively tagged could detect tagged amino acid later varied hot amino acid round experiment seeking determine amino acids would incorporated protein following addition particular type synthetic rna key first experiments done polyu synthetic rna composed uridine bases provided leon heppel maxine may matthaei used phenylalanine hot amino acid hour control tube polyu showed background level counts whereas tube polyu added showed counts per milligram subsequent experiments showed cold amino acids necessary protein product biochemical characteristics demonstrating chain repeated uracil bases produced protein chain made solely repeating amino acid phenylalanine experiment determine number bases per codon consistent triplet codon uuu coding phenylalanine analogous experiments synthetic rnas found polyc directed synthesis polyproline nirenberg recounts labs severo ochoa james watson earlier done similar experiments polya failed detect protein synthesis polylysine unlike proteins soluble trichloroacetic acid using synthetic rnas randomly incorporated two bases different ratios produced proteins containing one type amino acid could deduce triplet nature genetic code narrow codon possibilities amino nirenbergs group eventually decoded amino acid codons however required additional ingenious experimental methods see nirenberg leder experiment august international congress biochemistry moscow nirenberg presented polyu experiments first small group francis cricks urging thousand attendees work enthusiastically received nirenberg became famous paper describing work published experiment ushered furious race fully crack genetic code nirenbergs main competition esteemed biochemist severo ochoa dr ochoa dr arthur kornberg shared nobel prize physiology medicine previous discovery mechanisms biological synthesis ribonucleic acid deoxyribonucleic acid however many colleagues national institutes health nih supported nirenberg aware may lead first nobel prize intramural nih scientist dewitt stetten jr nih director first hired nirenberg called period collaboration nihs finest indeed interpretation genetic code function protein synthesis marshall w nirenberg robert w holley har gobind khorana awarded nobel prize physiology working independently dr holley cornell university discovered exact chemical structure transferrna dr khorana university wisconsin madison mastered synthesis nucleic dr nirenberg showed excluding nonsense codons every combination triplet ie codon composed four different nitrogencontaining bases found dna rna produces specific amino new york times said nirenbergs discovery science biology reached new frontier leading revolution far greater potential significance atomic hydrogen bomb scientific community saw experiments highly important beneficial however concerned new area molecular genetics example arne tiselius nobel laureate chemistry asserted knowledge genetic code could lead methods tampering life creating new diseases controlling minds influencing heredity even perhaps certain desired addition nobel prize dr nirenberg
