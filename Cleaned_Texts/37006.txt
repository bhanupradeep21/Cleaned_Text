decisionmaking mental activity integral part planning action taking variety contexts vast range levels including limited budget planning education planning policy making climbing career ladder people world engage activities underlying crosscultural differences decisionmaking great contributing factor efficiency crosscultural communications negotiations conflict resolution considerable amount literature cognitive science devoted investigation nature human decisionmaking however large portion discusses results obtained cultural subject pool predominantly pool american undergraduate students notwithstanding limitation results usually implicitly explicitly generalized gives rise homefield disadvantage particular cultural group taken starting point becomes much harder researches notice mark peculiarities existing within result characteristic group study taken granted ascribed general population tendency aggravated researcher belongs cultural group study case researcher subjects exposed physical social situational contexts daily basis much everyday functioning automatic words driven current features environment processed without conscious leads building implicit attitude values beliefs hard spot become apparent individuals decisionmaking models different cultural backgrounds different culture backgrounds tend form different mind processing decision making example westerners tend form affective processing easterners tend form analytical processing moreover affective feeling based decision makings tend faster done spontaneously whereas cognitive reasonbased decision making tends deliberate scientists recently become involved conducting studies decisionmaking across cultures results show fact crosscultural differences behavior general decisionmaking strategies particular

might accountable diversity individuals everyday behavior social orientation currently existing cultures compared one another collectivismindividualism scale societies usually described individualistic independent social orientation differentiating characteristics groups autonomy selfexpression interpretation happiness socially disengaging emotion collectivists societies interdependent social orientation members endorse harmony relatedness connection dont view bounded separated others experience happiness sense closeness others typically interdependent societies found among eastern nations independent societies found among western nations subgroups within nation also compared independencyinterdependency scale example working class us tends interdependent compared middle class numerous factors geographical mobility industrialization political systems affect social orientation depending stance researcher assumes role culture plays decisionmaking one following models used think predict decisionmaking behavioral patterns given culture occidental philosophies known extensive use analytical thinking methodical approach solving complex problems breaking constituent parts identifying cause effect patterns constituent parts oriental philosophies well known emphasis holism idea properties given system determined explained components parts alone system whole determines parts discrepancy brings differences values beliefs practically displayed different cultures manage public institutions example culturally determined attitudes towards age gender roles end result well reflected way cultures build run healthcare systems oriental cultures hold age proxy experience hence wisdom individual mind duty without focusing final results activity women best suited play certain roles hand occidental cultures hold age correlated wisdom individual focus end drive achieve women equal men differences become obvious healthcare systems oriental occidental cultures compared indian healthcare setting customers much less likely sue physicians usually representative older generation even enough evidence malpractice due fact age treated proxy experience knowledge hence decision sue physician deficiencies doesnt occur choice option indian patients representatives oriental culture indian setting physicians however normally accountable care given even though rarely blamed unfavorable results explained fact hold high regard means action end another distinguishing feature indian hospitals women mostly employed receptionists billing clerks admission assistants trend hiring policy explained gender role expectation dimension inculcated oriental cultures belief element predefined place system individuals come oriental cultures philosophies promoting holistic thinking found better occidental counterparts noticing changes backgrounds whereas individuals occidental cultures use analytic reasoning tend better recognizing changes focal objects differences perception might result different standpoints corresponding philosophies taken consideration explaining profound divergences willing westerners easterners compromise make consumer choices much lowcontext westerners likely notice changes salient objects likely believe single right answer pursue even slightest indication one option better others whereas highcontext easterners begin decisionmaking process already favoring compromise individuals high lowcontext cultures also differ communication styles former prefer less direct style thereby less explicit stating feelings desires intentions communicating verbally latter contrary less likely camouflage message conceal culturally normative communication style also enhances peoples responsiveness transmitted message influences perception communicator influences hiring decisions hr agents lowcontext cultures likely hire direct assertive somewhat aggressive candidates whereas reverse pattern observed highcontext cultures individuals different cultures tend different views self affects individuals cognition goals social interactions consequently influences behavior goals decision individuals individualists cultures tend independent selfconstrual thus experience happiness socially disengaging emotion eg pride collectivists cultures tend interdependent selfconstrual experience happiness socially engaging emotion eg peace harmony former likely make decisions fulfill personal accomplishment whereas latter likely make decisions promote social connectedness reflected differences teamwork styles group composed members low independent selfconstrual prefer cooperative strategy competitive one whereas group composed members high independent self construal preferred competitive strategy cooperative individuals cultures interdependent social orientation believe public good overrides individual benefit whereas individuals cultures independent social orientation believe every individual strive achieve best thereby engaging decisionmaking process former likely take consideration injunctive norms guarding stability within society former likely follow introjected goals instance indians found accommodate authority figures significant others respond others expectations choosing clothes wear party advanced training courses corresponding case americans likely act accordance beliefs beneficial didnt demonstrate deference syndrome western cultures independent strength integrity demonstrated true ones opinions tastes swayed social pressure conform opposed seeing individual freedom prerequisite authentic life interdependent cultures evaluate freedom terms costs benefits addition individualist societies dominant independent selfconstrual typical western society likely rely feelings consequently impulsive decision making compared people interdependent selfconstrual typical eastern difference decision making patterns cultures independent interdependent social orientations situations risktaking involved namely members cultural groups high independency show riskaversive pattern observed risk material nature observed risk social nature cushion hypothesis attempts explain difference suggests members collectivist society prone risktaking financial domain know likely receive help friends extended family fall collectivism endorses social relatedness interdependence social networks societies serve potent materialrisk insurance correspond notion social capital decisionmaking corporate world grouporiented societies however much different using japanese culture example people large corporations exhibit high degree risk aversion fear decision negative consequences reflect badly entire corporation one reasons consensus decision making another reason keep surface level harmony involving many people possible riskaversion tendency among members individualist societies observed even contexts involve financial risks indirectly instance decisionmaking contexts involve estimating risk revealing private information gain access mobile affect forecasts play important role driving decisions members independent interdependent societies differ degree rely expected enjoyment making choices eurocanadians representatives independent social orientation place weight expected enjoyment whereas east asians representatives interdependent social orientation warn excessive hedonism concern social obligations precludes uncompromising pursuit positive pattern observed higher education setting eurocanadian east asian students choices courses enroll compared eurocanadian students show shortterm orientation tend enroll courses promise fun whereas east asian students enroll courses think beneficial careers thus show longterm high degree tolerance power distance interdependent societies reflects tendency shun arrogance consider humility virtue times collectivist societies tolerance power distance also practical implication instance tourist decisionmaking styles members individualist societies lower levels tolerance power distance less likely exhibit brand consciousness making choices concerning travelling arrangements compared collectivist lot differences collectivist individualist collectivists buy brand extension product low fit core product focus much product fit core product also focus size company guess quality product contrast situation individualists focus much brand extension product fit product size company doesnt matter guess quality example core product company ice cream high fit product yogurt low fit product pen collectivist company large company might think pen maybe good quality individualist think maybe pen good doesnt fit company identity kind cognitive thinking might effect decisionmaking term marketing company strategy focus concern corporate identity especially collectivists believe much brand extension product fit core product also believe size company reliability literature automatic cognition suggests behavior shaped exposure elements social world way occurs awareness intention learn stereotyped attitudes later influence decisions shared schematic representations certain culture individual primed concept often implicit instruction think aspects relevant information become activated influence decisionmaking example individuals instructed underlie first person plural pronouns text thus primed concept collectivism show statistically significant increase inclination make decisions according values concept primed individuals across cultures cultural personal knowledge cultural knowledge tends reflect large sample lifes events whereas personal knowledge focuses individual atypical experiences distinction cultural personal knowledge accessibility day day members cultural group primed set beliefs attitudes behavioral patterns contributes buildingup storing cultural knowledge thus cultural knowledge accessible even high cognitive work load personal knowledge recording single experience doesnt undergo many repetitions thats takes deliberate attempt access requires time effort consider following example independent individuals believed better respond promotionbased information whereas individuals interdependent self construal believed better respond preventionbased information high time pressure condition hypothesis borne north americans likely make mind buy sun screen watched promotionbased commercial east asians likely make purchase watched preventionbased commercial low time pressure condition subjects time deliberate difference becomes less salient even disappears individuals collectivist cultures less inclined act accordance cultural beliefs dont experience peer pressure accordance collectivist culture dictates japanese chinese students likely compared american italian students decide whether eat fast food restaurants contingent norms adopted societies less likely make choices contingent personal however peculiarity much salient make plans whether eat friends less salient decide whether eat fast food restaurant latter context likelihood act contingent attitudes significantly increases cultural knowledge recruited individuals need provide reasons decision need provide reasons evokes informationprocessing strategy relies topdown application rules principles instead bottomup processing relies personal knowledge explained help supposition individuals feel pressure conform asked provide reasons dont want outsiders asked explain choices feel freer rely personal found chinese significantly lower tendency compromise earlier found one characteristic traits asked provide reasons consumer decisions americans contrary likely compromise accountable provide explanations choice widely shared cultural knowledge provides individuals validated framework interpret otherwise ambiguous experience thus providing followers sense epistemic security providing protection uncertainty unpredictability individuals cultures vary degree need firm answers individuals high tolerance ambiguity found less likely act accordance culture shapes prevalence cultural factors decision content decision motives situational demands affordances shapes functional factors translate decision modes calculation recognition rule role affectbased decision modes however number universal tendencies across cultures example action called members independent interdependent social orientations tend employ role rule casebased decision making much accessible allow less cognitive load whereas calculationbased mode less frequent relationship decisions resourcerich physical environment becomes due modern technologies larger number cultures support development technologies increases resources extracted environment inevitably allows greater diversity cultures occupy given area cultural variants available members modernized societies transmitted people kin friends even acquaintances young people likely create novel recombinations diverse cultural variants although choice wide range choices increasingly available world waves modernization created complex cultures substantial diversity within decreased intergroup diversity destroying smallscale believe different catering culture also make difference decisionmaking people collectivist culture pay attention process example found many chinese foods japanese foods always need day cook even need month longer side found western people belong individualism likely make easy eat alone quickly however development modernization communication catering culture great influence crossculture difference found teenagers collectivist student china korea japan seems like individualism found change observing eating habits still validity study get research although young people collectivist may characteristic individualism still assume might collectivist stage always think individualism collectivism something native however eastern young people didnt act interdependent person like parents would also interesting study see individualist young people become collectivist kind change many researchers always think eastern country collectivist however still found japan always different eastern countries china korea history share writing past japan always makes different choice like world war ii china korea looking forward doctrine mean called zhongyong chinese made become invaders however japan shows different way thinking became one members aggressor cant simply say bad problems research need find actually cause culture collectivism work even three countries share many things still big differences still important researchers study deeper collectivism found real motivation makes people interdependent
