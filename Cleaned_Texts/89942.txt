deafness conductive hearing loss principle based decades research showing bone conduction stimulation teeth initiates auditory sensations evidence shows teeth vibrations lead audiofrequency vibration transmissions via soft tissue transmissions travel skull foramina skull cavity channel inner ear fluids stimulating subsequently sonitus medical developed soundbite hearing system use principles nonsurgical removable hearing system multicenter clinical trial conducted validated soundbite safe effective provides substantial benefit individuals singlesided deafness ssd trial participants wore soundbite days using device average hours per day based clinical trial results soundbite improves ability individuals ssd understand speech environment background noise average onethird trial participants found system improved hearing ability results extensive clinical trial showed soundbite effective surgically implanted bone conduction systems improving ability understand speech environment background another multicenter clinical study confirmed previous findings soundbite safe effective provides significant benefit patients study participants wore soundbite month benefit
