drug checking pill testing way reduce harm drug consumption allowing users find content purity substances intend consume enables users make safer choices avoid dangerous substances use smaller quantities avoid dangerous drug checking services developed last twentyfive years twenty countries considered although attempts implement countries hindered local laws drug checking initially focused mdma users electronic dance music events services broadened drug use become complex developments strongly affected local laws culture resulting diverse range services mobile services attend events festivals fixed sites town centres entertainment districts instance staff may may able handle illegal substances limits use testing techniques staff legally possession substances people intending take drugs provide small sample testing service often less single dose test results may provided immediately short waiting period later drug checking services use time discuss health risks safe behaviour service services also provide public health information drug use new psychoactive substances trends national earliest reported drug checking activity began amsterdam november group university hospital amsterdam samples obtained psychiatrists working people used earliest reported drug checking service drug information monitoring system netherlands supported ministry health welfare sport since service tested drug samples national network twentythree testing facilities service users receive results within week via phone email service publishes aggregated results describing substances use

testing happens onsite without facetoface interaction public samples medical incidents tested alerts issued multiple incidents trend identified static testing sites provide testing services clients
