mechanism carrying film arranged opposed extremities patients skull sits xray generator film xray source rectangular collimated also height beam covers mandibles maxilla regions arm moves movement may described rotation around instant center shifts dedicated trajectory manufacturers propose different solutions moving arm trying maintain constant distance teeth film generator also moving solutions try project teeth arch orthogonally possible impossible select ideal movement anatomy varies much person person finally compromise selected manufacturer results magnification factors vary strongly along film patient positioning critical regard sharpness distortionscitation needed two kinds film moving mechanisms one using sliding flat cassette holds film another using rotating cylinder around film wound two standard sizes dental panoramic films cm cm cm x cm smaller size film receives less xray dosage compared bigger size dental xrays radiology moving film technology involving chemical developing process digital xray technology based electronic sensors computers one principal advantages compared film based systems much greater exposure latitude means many fewer repeated scans reduces costs also reduces patient exposure radiation lost xrays also reprinted digital file saved significant advantages include instantly viewable images ability enhance images ability email images practitioners clients without needing digitize first easy reliable document handling reduced xray exposure darkroom required chemicals used one particular type digital system uses photostimulable phosphor plate aka psp phosphor plate place film xray exposure plate sheet placed special scanner latent formed image retrieved point point digitized using laser light scanning digitized images stored displayed computer screen method old film based technology current direct digital imaging technology similar film process involves image support handling differs chemical development process replaced scanning process much faster film processing resolution sensitivity performances contested however clear advantage able fit existing equipment without modification replaces existing film also sometimes term digital xrays used designate scanned film documents handled computers types digital imaging technologies use electronic sensors majority first convert xrays light using csi layer captured using ccd cmos image sensor use hybrid analogtodigital arrangement first converts xray electricity using cdte layer electricity rendered image reading section based cmos technology current stateoftheart digital systems image quality vastly superior conventional filmbased systems latest advancements also seen addition cone beam technology standard digital panoramic devices orthopantomograms opts used health care professionals provide information normally person bites plastic spatula teeth especially crowns viewed individually whole orthopantomogram process takes one minute patients actual radiation exposure time varies seconds machine excursion around skull collimation machine means rotating xrays project limited portion anatomy onto film given instant rotation progresses around skull composite picture maxillofacial block created arm rotates film moves way projected partial skull image limited beam section scrolls exposes entirely overlapping individual images projected film magnification beam divergent images differing focus points also element images move velocity target film distant others closer instant rotation center velocity film controlled fashion fit exactly velocity projection anatomical elements dental arch side closest film therefore recorded sharply elements different places recorded blurred scroll different velocity dental panoramic image suffers important distortions vertical zoom horizontal zoom vary differently along image vertical horizontal zooms determined relative position recorded element versus film generator features closer generator receive vertical zoom horizontal zoom also dependent relative position element focal path features inside focal path arch receive horizontal zoom blurred features outside receive less horizontal zoom blurred result image showing sharply section along mandible arch blurred elsewhere example radioopaque anatomical region cervical vertebrae neck shows wide blurred vertical pillar overlapping front teeth path anatomical elements recorded sharply called focal path persons undergo panoramic radiography usually required remove earrings jewellery hair pins glasses dentures orthodontic articles removed may create artifacts image especially contain metal reduce usefulness also need person stay absolutely still second cycle takes machine expose film reason radiographers often explain person beforehand machine like medical imaging utilizing ionizing radiation minute degree direct ionizing damage indirect damage free radicals created ionization water
