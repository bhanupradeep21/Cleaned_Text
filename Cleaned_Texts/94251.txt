antihistamines drugs treat allergic rhinitis common cold influenza typically people take antihistamines inexpensive generic patented drug bought without prescription provides relief nasal congestion sneezing hives caused pollen dust mites animal allergy side antihistamines usually shortterm chronic allergies increase risk health problems antihistamines might treat including asthma sinusitis lower respiratory tract consultation medical professional recommended intend take antihistamines longerterm although people typically use word antihistamine describe drugs treating allergies doctors scientists use term describe class drug opposes activity histamine receptors sense word antihistamines subclassified according histamine receptor act upon two largest classes antihistamines work binding histamine receptors mast cells smooth muscle endothelium body well tuberomammillary nucleus brain antihistamines target histamine used treat allergic reactions nose eg itching runny nose sneezing addition may used treat insomnia motion sickness vertigo caused problems inner ear bind histamine receptors upper gastrointestinal tract primarily stomach antihistamines target histamine used treat gastric acid conditions eg peptic ulcers acid reflux antihistamines also target receptors receptors histamine receptors exhibit constitutive activity antihistamines function either neutral receptor antagonist inverse agonist histamine currently marketed known function inverse histamine makes blood vessels permeable vascular permeability causing fluid escape capillaries tissues leads classic symptoms allergic reaction runny nose watery eyes histamine also promotes antihistamines suppress histamineinduced wheal response swelling flare response vasodilation blocking binding histamine receptors reducing histamine receptor activity nerves vascular smooth muscle glandular cells endothelium mast cells antihistamines also help correct eustachian tube dysfunction thereby helping correct problems muffled hearing fullness ear even itching sneezing inflammatory responses suppressed antihistamines act antihistamines desloratadine found effective complement standardized treatment acne due antiinflammatory properties ability suppress sebum refer compounds inhibit activity since receptor exhibits constitutive activity either neutral receptor antagonists inverse normally histamine binds receptor heightens receptors activity receptor antagonists work binding receptor blocking activation receptor histamine comparison inverse agonists bind receptor block binding histamine reduce constitutive activity effect opposite antihistamines inverse agonists receptor previously thought clinically used treat allergic reactions mast cellrelated disorders sedation common side effect readily cross barrier drugs diphenhydramine doxylamine may therefore used treat insomnia also reduce inflammation since expression nfÎºb transcription factor regulates inflammatory processes promoted receptors constitutive activity agonist ie histamine binding combination effects cases metabolic ones well lead firstgeneration antihistamines analgesicsparing potentiating effects opioid analgesics extent nonopioid ones well common antihistamines utilized purpose include hydroxyzine promethazine enzyme induction especially helps codeine similar prodrug opioids phenyltoloxamine orphenadrine tripelennamine may also intrinsic analgesic properties orphenadrine example secondgeneration antihistamines cross barrier much lesser extent firstgeneration antihistamines minimize sedatory effects due focused effect peripheral histamine receptors however upon high doses secondgeneration antihistamines begin act central nervous system thus induce drowsiness ingested higher quantity additionally secondgeneration antihistamines notably cetirizine interact cns psychoactive drugs bupropion like exist inverse agonists neutral antagonists act histamine receptors found mainly parietal cells gastric mucosa part endogenous signaling pathway gastric acid secretion normally histamine acts stimulate acid secretion drugs inhibit signaling thus reduce secretion gastric acid among firstline therapy treat gastrointestinal conditions including peptic ulcers gastroesophageal reflux disease formulations available counter side effects due crossreactivity unintended receptors cimetidine example notorious antagonizing androgenic testosterone dht receptors high doses examples include classification drugs used inhibit action histamine receptor receptors primarily found brain inhibitory autoreceptors located histaminergic nerve terminals modulate release histamine histamine release brain triggers secondary release excitatory neurotransmitters glutamate acetylcholine via stimulation receptors cerebral cortex consequently unlike sedating stimulant cognitionmodulating effects examples selective include inhibit activity receptor examples inhibit action histidine decarboxylase mast cell stabilizers drugs prevent mast cell degranulation first receptor antagonists discovered marketed piperoxan discovered first compound antihistamine effects piperoxan analogues toxic used phenbenzamine antergan first clinically useful antihistamine introduced medical use subsequently many antihistamines developed diphenhydramine benadryl synthesized tripelennamine pyribenzamine patented promethazine phenergan synthesized launched least antihistamines chlorphenamine piriton less sedating antihistamine synthesized hydroxyzine atarax vistaril antihistamine used specifically sedative tranquilizer developed first nonsedating antihistamine terfenadine seldane developed subsequently nonsedating antihistamines like loratadine claritin cetirizine zyrtec fexofenadine allegra developed introduction firstgeneration antihistamines marked beginning medical treatment nasal research drugs led discovery receptor antagonists also development receptor antagonists affected nose affected history led contemporary research drugs receptor antagonists affect receptor people use receptor antagonist treat allergies use secondgeneration united states government removed two second generation antihistamines terfenadine astemizole market based evidence could cause heart much published research exists compares efficacy safety various antihistamines research exist mostly shortterm studies studies look people make general another gap research information reporting health effects individuals longterm allergies take antihistamines long period newer antihistamines demonstrated effective treating however research comparing relative efficacy uk national health service wrote people safely take antihistamines antihistamines may suitable young children pregnant breastfeeding taking medicines people conditions heart disease liver disease kidney disease studies antihistamines reported people younger effects people age well older people likely experience drowsiness antihistamine use younger continuous andor cumulative use anticholinergic medications including firstgeneration antihistamines associated higher risk cognitive decline dementia older also research caucasians ethnic groups represented evidence report antihistamines affect women differently different studies reported antihistamine use children various studies finding evidence certain antihistamines could used children years age drugs safer younger older research regarding effects commonly used medications upon certain cancer therapies suggested consumed conjunction immune checkpoint inhibitors may influence response subjects particular treatment whose tcell functions failing antitumor activity upon study records mouse studies associated common medications ranging
