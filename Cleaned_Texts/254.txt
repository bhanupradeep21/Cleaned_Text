distance matrix come number different sources including measured distance example immunological studies morphometric analysis various pairwise distance formulae euclidean distance applied discrete morphological characters genetic distance sequence restriction fragment allozyme data phylogenetic character data raw distance values calculated simply counting number pairwise differences character states hamming distance distancematrix methods phylogenetic analysis explicitly rely measure genetic distance sequences classified therefore require msa multiple sequence alignment input distance often defined fraction mismatches aligned positions gaps either ignored counted distance methods attempt construct alltoall matrix sequence query set describing distance sequence pair constructed phylogenetic tree places closely related sequences interior node whose branch lengths closely reproduce observed distances sequences distancematrix methods may produce either rooted unrooted trees depending algorithm used calculate frequently used basis progressive iterative types multiple sequence alignment main disadvantage distancematrix methods inability efficiently use information local highvariation regions appear across multiple neighborjoining methods apply general data clustering techniques sequence analysis using genetic distance clustering metric simple neighborjoining method produces unrooted trees assume constant rate evolution ie molecular clock across lineages upgma unweighted pair group method arithmetic mean wpgma weighted pair group method arithmetic mean methods produce rooted trees require constantrate assumption assumes ultrametric tree distances root every branch tip equal method uses weighted least squares method clustering based genetic closely related sequences given weight tree construction process correct increased inaccuracy measuring distances distantly related sequences practice distance correction necessary evolution rates differ among distances used input algorithm must normalized prevent large artifacts computing relationships closely related distantly related groups distances calculated method must linear linearity criterion

methods involves inclusion least one outgroup sequence known distantly related sequences interest query usage seen type experimental control outgroup appropriately chosen much greater genetic distance thus longer branch length sequence appear near root rooted tree choosing appropriate outgroup requires selection sequence moderately related sequences interest close relationship defeats purpose outgroup distant adds noise care also taken avoid situations species sequences taken distantly related gene encoded sequences highly conserved across lineages horizontal gene transfer especially

tree recovered many scientists eschew distance methods various reasons commonly cited reason distances inherently phenetic rather phylogenetic distinguish ancestral similarity symplesiomorphy derived similarity synapomorphy criticism entirely fair currently implementations parsimony likelihood bayesian phylogenetic inference use timereversible character models thus accord special status derived ancestral character states models tree estimated unrooted rooting consequently determination polarity performed analysis primary difference methods distances parsimony likelihood bayesian methods fit individual characters tree whereas distance methods fit characters nothing inherently less phylogenetic approachcitation needed practically distance methods avoided relationship individual characters tree lost process reducing characters distances methods use character data directly information locked distribution character states lost pairwise comparisons also complex phylogenetic relationships

however even pairwise distances genetic data corrected using stochastic models evolution mentioned may easily sum different tree one produced analysis data model using maximum likelihood pairwise distances independent branch tree represented distance measurements taxa separates error resulting characteristic branch might confound phylogeny stochastic variability change evolutionary parameters abnormally long short branch length propagated relevant distance measurements resulting distance matrix may better fit alternate presumably less optimal tree despite potential problems distance
