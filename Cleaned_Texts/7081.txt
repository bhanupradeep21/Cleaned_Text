important rule joint bodily issues concluding hip dysplasia present even hip dysplasia present possible conditions coexist masked complete cure although many options alleviate clinical signs aim treatment enhance quality life dogs hip dysplasia need surgery well home physical therapy program keeping trim strong using pain medication problem controlled medications often surgery considered traditionally two types surgery reshape joint reduce pain help movement hip replacement completely replaces damaged hip artificial joint similar human hip replacements non surgical intervention dependent many factors including age weight degree hip laxity lifestyle owner tolerance cost incurred medication physical weight control often single important thing help dog arthritis reducing dogs weight enough control symptoms arthritis many weight control goal prevent dog becoming overweight reduce mechanical stresses applied hip joints general terms ribs easily palpated indentation front hip reasonable exercise stimulates cartilage growth reduces also regular walks taken early stages dysplasia help prevent loss muscle mass hips exercise fit individual dogs maximum intensity level goal maintain muscle tone cardiovascular function without causing pain stiffness inflammation joint exercise also improves joint range motion turn keeps dog comfortable swimming nonweight bearing exercise useful means maintaining muscle tone range motion without placing concussive forces joint though swimming primarily frontlegged medication reduce pain discomfort also reduce damaging often medication consists nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaid doubles antiinflammatory painkiller typical nsaids used hip dysplasia include carprofen meloxicam often sold rimadyl metacam used treat arthritis resulting dysplasia although nsaids tepoxalin zubrin prednoleucotropin plt combination cinchophen prednisolone sometimes prescribed incorporating fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid dha eicosapentaenoic acid epa diet result improved symptoms disease fatty acids help decrease inflammation occurs osteoarthritis well improve locomotion dogs disease epa dha supplemented diet fish oils glucosamine chondroitin sulfate nutraceuticals also added diet help treat osteoarthritis caused hip dysplasia nutraceuticals help improvement cartilage joint health repairing tissues glucosaminebased nutritional supplement may give body additional raw materials used joint repair glucosamine take weeks start showing effects trial period medication usually least weeks vitro glucosamine shown negative effects cartilage another nutrient help improve structural support body vitamin c vitamin c contributes building blocks collagen help strengthen joints canine massage may alleviate discomfort decrease muscle
