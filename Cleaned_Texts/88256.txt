childhood paediatric acquired brain injury abi term given injury brain occurs childhood birth immediate neonatal period excludes injuries sustained result genetic congenital disorder also excludes resulting birth traumas hypoxia conditions foetal alcohol syndrome encompasses traumatic nontraumatic atraumatic injuries pediatric acquired brain injury pabi number one cause death disability children young adults united statescitation needed affects mostly children ages adolescent ages around worldcitation needed injury traumatic nontraumatic nature patients never return normal following injury many different symptoms amnesia anhedonia apraxia currently isnt cure injury pabi effects family patient also families patient need adapt new changes experience child recommendedwho families decide gain much information injury expect going different program events meetings traumatic injuries could include blow head gunshot stabbing crushing excessive vibration oscillation caused shaking sudden deceleration traumatic injuries might necessarily involve open wound penetration skull meninges open head injury nontraumatic injuries could include caused illnesses tumours encephalitis meningitis sinusitis could also caused infections septicaemia events anoxia hypoxia occasioned strangulation near drowning lead toxicity substance misuse symptoms result acquired brain injury amnesia anhedonia apraxia childhood amnesia inability remember ones childhood researchers found everyday activities speaking running playing guitar described remembered child diagnosed anhedonia would lack interest usual activities hobbies playing sports engaging friends essential child able enjoy fun childhood activities help build social life easily interact others able things young age make harder adapt child gets older apraxia inability execute learned purposeful movements despite desire physical capacity perform movements case child could still memory usual activity riding bike still able accomplish movement prevalence abi amongst schoolaged children uk estimated region based admissions e although professionals consider much higher child admitted e another urgent injury considered overriding concern tempting assume injury acquired childhood likely positive long term outcome one acquired adulthood could assumed child adolescent could better chance developing compensatory strategies whilst still stage significant development learning taking place injury way significant often inherent plasticity brain occasionally mean areas damaged beyond healing relocate function undamaged areas socalled kennard documented cases indeed however frequently case functions associated damaged areas never fully develop deficits present significant disabilities difficulties later significant proportion prior learning development skills already taken place within adults brain often retained post injury however brain earlier stages development damaged might never develop capacity learn skills leading subsequent difficulties could manifest physically socially emotionally delayed physiological responses posttbi lead neurodegeneration various parts brain chronic severe cases children parts brain proven affected include hippocampus amygdala globus pallidus thalamus periventricular white matter cerebellum result lead behavioral cognitive problems child development behavioral changes characterized externalizing internalizing externalizing problems include different forms aggression hyperactivity impulsivity common problems result changes attention focus internalizing issues include psychiatric problems shortterm longterm depression anxiety personality disorders posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd several variables determine outcome behavioral problems children posttbi example children already behavioral issues injury likely develop longterm cognitive another important factor severity injury predictor long behavioral symptoms last increase timecitation needed statistically children develop novel psychiatric disorders months severe tbi mild moderate tbi common personality change due tbi symptoms may last months development ptsd common first weeks postinjury decline course years cases severe tbi one third children develop depressive children severe tbi also effects working memory visual immediate memory prominent consequences intellectual functioning executive functioning including speed processing attention verbal immediate delayed memory recovery observed first years children moderate tbi show decline attention problem solving larger effects visual immediate superior frontal lesions correlate type outcome importantly subcortical network damage may affect recovery due lesions white matter children severe tbi higher risk achieving developmentally appropriate gains catching peers school due crucial stage learning neural networks disrupted children adolescents acquired brain injury cognitive emotional difficulties come injury negatively impact level participation home school social situations puts patient disadvantage wont nearly social able participate school setting ordinary child would involvement social situations important normal development children means gaining understanding effectively work together others group work huge factor academics today childs ability work within groups ineffective furthermore young people acquired brain injury often reported insufficient problem solving skills potential hinder performance various academic social settings important rehabilitation programs deal challenges specific children fully developed time injury effects range relatively mild catastrophic degree affect childs ability function within educational social setting educational attainment quality life indicators young adult survivors childhood acquired brain injury significantly lower uninjured peer childs brain work progress deficits caused injury sustained one age might become apparent much later damaged areas become relevant childs expected developmental milestones known sleeper adults observing child unaware either injury potential effects abi often lead misattribution failure achieve academically socially laziness teenage tantrums going rails evident damage specific areas brain result whole areas knowledge skills abilities lost sometimes however also often case although cognitive abilities left intact including ability retrieve process manipulate information much prior learning remain child prevented developing academically socially functional many ways child abi become socially disadvantaged alienated peers following following indicative problems might follow reintroduction peer group common sequela brain injury much reduced ability process information therefore respond mean child unable keep conversational flow group friends slower rest group pick jokes banter leaving himher feeling frustrated left behind however caring well meaning friends also find difficult accommodate new slowness usual give take resulting affected child alienated left another effect often seen result damage vulnerable frontal lobes childs brain reduced ability inhibit impulse say something long enough calculate whether correct appropriate thing say research shows adolescence time frontal lobe areas brain areas govern ability manage ones behaviours develop enough allow child begin grow start inhibit initial disinhibition lead child saying apparently hurtful aggressive things peers leading antagonism embarrassment also case child abi less able inhibit responses provocations adult authority resulting apparent bad behaviour leading friends friends parents view unsuitable companions disinhibition also lead sexually harmful behaviour particularly coupled lowered sense risk danger child brain injury often become vulnerable exploitation peers strangers reduced ability access process language therefore word find appropriately result increased inclination use readily accessible word swear word aggressive word obviously alienate concern friends could interpret anger aggression everything everything able everything feel governed functioning brain grow see fundamentally product brain experiences shaped child experiences brain injury effects could alter academic abilities likes dislikes friendship groups talents skills plans future relationships parents siblings physical prowess everything made child person knew dissonance selfimage pre injury new one post injury experienced real child tries come terms new death old one limitations possibly imposed effects injury loss academic sporting status indifference antagonism peer group curtailing developing independence understandable parental worry could experienced brain injured child adolescent almost bereavement unusual brain injured child experience feelings worthlessness depression family relationships could also suffer result injury parents struggle come terms feelings bereavement plans hopes child family unit life lived together injury siblings also could find hard come terms loss brother sister knew loved amount time attention emotional energy parents expended injured child childhood acquired brain injury huge variety effects child different times development brain function depending well informed another person injury nature brain development often easy ascribe aspects childs behaviour presentation wrong underlying reason example common parents teachers misread effects cognitive impairment physical issue physical problem behavioural one example could child great difficulty initiating task sequencing elements simple task child fails respond appears straightforward instruction example put away art work go get changed pe found still sitting desk five minutes later teacher might reach conclusion lazy defiant similarly child visual impairment result injury could mistaken clumsy uncoordinated thoughtless knocks milk jug scatterbrained inattentive neglects complete math problems written right hand side board pediatric brain undergoes dramatic changes significant pruning neural networks throughout development whereby areas primary senses motor skills mostly developed age areas like frontal cortices involved higher level reasoning decisionmaking emotion impulsivity continue develop well late teens early therefore patients age brain developmental state influence neuronal systems become affected key structural features pediatric brain make brain tissue susceptible mechanical injury tbi adult brain larger water content brain tissue reduced myelination results diminished shear resistance injury also shown immature brains enlarged extracellular space volume decreased expression glial aquaporin leading increased incidence brain swelling along delayed decrease cerebral blood flow unique features developing brain mediate secondary damage hypoxia excitotoxicity free radical damage neuroinflammation primary even properties secondary events differ developing brain adult brain developing brain overexpression activation nmethyldaspartate receptor nmdar leads increased calcium influx increased capacity excitoxicity compared adult brain developing brain lower glutathione peroxidase activity decreased ability maintain stores glutathione peroxidase therefore developing brain vulnerable oxidative stress adult damage developing brain mechanisms disturb neuronal maturation leading neuronal loss axonal destruction many different ways train children diagnosed pediatric brain injury training mainly tests brain see exactly whats wrong patient areas need focused improvement aim computerized treatment program incorporates goal setting use metacognitive strategies computerbased exercises designed improve various aspects initial meeting child computer program leads clinician intake procedure assists identifying nature severity childs attention difficulties facilitates selection attention training tasks metacognitive strategies tailored needs child clinicians role select specific presenting mental areas impaired well modify tasks strategies response improvements patients helpful way figure problems childadolescent facing also helping gradually improve injury investigators established interventions pediatric bi target family changes one family member affect entire family rehabilitation caregivers often receive skills training improve ability care child brain family realignment adjusting childs environment two major ways parents make distresses injury easier child beneficial ways parents realign household applying consequences minimize problem behaviors increasing amount positive communication parents child injury establishing positive routines
