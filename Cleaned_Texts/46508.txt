biologically active isolates aconitum delphinium plants classified norditerpenoid subdivided based presence absence aconitine based presence carbon barely soluble water soluble organic solvents chloroform diethyl aconitine also soluble mixtures alcohol water concentration alcohol high enough like many alkaloids basic nitrogen atom one sixmembered ring structure aconitine easily form salts ions giving affinity polar lipophilic structures cell membranes receptors making possible molecule pass acetoxyl group position readily replaced methoxy group heating aconitine methanol produce aconitine heated dry state undergoes pyrolysis form pyroaconitine benzoate chemical formula aconitine interact voltagedependent sodiumion channels proteins cell membranes excitable tissues cardiac skeletal muscles neurons proteins highly selective sodium ions open quickly depolarize cell membrane potential causing upstroke action potential normally sodium channels close rapidly depolarization membrane potential causes opening activation potassium channels potassium efflux results repolarization membrane potential aconitine binds channel neurotoxin binding site alpha subunit site bound batrachotoxin veratridine binding results sodiumion channel stays open longer aconitine suppresses conformational change sodiumion channel active state inactive state membrane stays depolarized due constant sodium influx greater potassium efflux result membrane repolarized binding aconitine channel also leads channel change conformation inactive state active state negative neurons aconitine increases permeability membrane sodium ions resulting huge sodium influx axon terminal result membrane depolarizes rapidly due strong depolarization permeability membrane potassium ions increases rapidly resulting potassium reflux release positive charge cell permeability potassium ions also permeability calcium ions increases result depolarization membrane calcium influx takes place increase calcium concentration cell stimulates release neurotransmitter acetylcholine synaptic cleft acetylcholine binds acetylcholine receptors postsynaptic membrane open sodiumchannels generating new action potential research mouse nervehemidiaphragm muscle preparation indicate low concentrations μm aconitine increases electrically evoked acetylcholine release causing induced muscle action potentials generated often concentration higher concentration μm aconitine decreases electrically evoked acetylcholine release resulting decrease muscle tension high concentration μm sodiumion channels constantly activated transmission action potentials suppressed leading nonexcitable target cells paralysis aconitine biosynthesized monkshood plant via terpenoid biosynthesis pathway mep chloroplast approximately naturally occurring alkaloids isolated identified biosynthesis alkaloids well likewise alkaloids aconitine family synthesized laboratory particular despite one hundred years elapsed since isolation prototypical member family norditerpenoid alkaloids aconitine represents rare example wellknown natural product yet succumb efforts towards total synthesis challenge aconitine poses synthetic organic chemists due intricate interlocking hexacyclic ring system make core elaborate collection oxygenated functional groups periphery handful simpler members aconitine alkaloids however prepared synthetically weisner group discovered total synthesis talatisamine subsequent years also discovered total syntheses total synthesis napelline scheme begins aldehyde step process aring napelline formed takes another steps form lactone ring pentacyclic structure napelline additional steps creates enonealdehyde heating methanol potassium hydroxide causes aldol condensation close sixth final ring napelline oxidation gives rise diketone converted steps similar process demonstrated wiesners synthesis scheme first step synthesis generation conjugated dienone steps followed addition benzyl vinyl ether produce steps compound converted ketal addition heat dmso oxylene rearranges ketol steps formed lastly talatisamine scheme synthesized diene nitrile first step form tricycle steps
