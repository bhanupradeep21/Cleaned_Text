oral candidiasis dentures provide relative acidic moist anaerobic environment mucosa covered denture sheltered oxygen loose poorly fitting dentures may also cause minor trauma thought increase permeability mucosa increase ability c albicans invade conditions favor growth c albicans sometimes dentures become worn constructed allow insufficient lower facial height occlusal vertical dimension leading overclosure mouth appearance sometimes described collapse jaws causes deepening skin folds corners mouth nasolabial crease effect creating intertriginous areas another form candidiasis angular cheilitis develop candida species capable adhering surface dentures made polymethylacrylate exploit microfissures cracks surface dentures aid retention dentures may therefore become covered act reservoirs continually reinfecting mucosa reason disinfecting denture vital part treatment oral candidiasis persons wear dentures well correcting factors like inadequate lower facial height fit dentures quantity quality saliva important oral defenses decreased salivary flow rate change composition collectively termed salivary hypofunction hyposalivation important predisposing factor xerostomia frequently listed cause xerostomia subjective objective ie symptom present without actual changes saliva consistency flow rate whether poor diet especially hematinic deficiencies iron vitamin folic acid predispose oral causing diminished host defense epithelial integrity example iron deficiency anemia thought cause depressed cellmediated sources state deficiencies vitamin pyridoxine also limited evidence diet high carbohydrates predisposes oral vitro studies show candidal growth adhesion biofilm formation enhanced presence carbohydrates glucose galactose smoking
