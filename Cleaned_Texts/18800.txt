anteosaurus meaning antaeus reptile extinct genus large carnivorous dinocephalian synapsid lived end guadalupian middle permian capitanian stage million years ago south africa mainly known cranial remains postcranial bones measuring ft long weighing kg lb anteosaurus largest known carnivorous nonmammalian synapsid largest terrestrial predator permian period occupying top food chain middle permian skull jaws teeth show adaptations capture large prey like giants titanosuchids tapinocephalids dinocephalians large pareiasaurs many dinocephalians cranial bones anteosaurus pachyostosed lesser extent tapinocephalid dinocephalians anteosaurus pachyostosis mainly occurs form hornshaped supraorbital protuberances according paleontologists structure would implicated intraspecific agonistic behaviour including headpushing probably mating season contrary scientists believe pachyostosis served reduce cranial stress bones skull biting massive prey young anteosaurus started life fairly narrow lean skulls grew bones skull became progressively thickened process known pachyostosis creating characteristic robust skull roof anteosaurus study inner ear revealed anteosaurus largely terrestrial agile predator highly advanced senses vision balance coordination also fast would able outrun competitors prey alike thanks advanced adaptations body wellsuited projecting forward hunting evidently headbutting anteosaurus dinocephalians became extinct million years ago mass extinction end capitanian large bradysaurian pareiasaurs also reasons extinction obscure although research shown temporal association extinction dinocephalian important volcanism event china known emeishan confusion surrounds etymology name anteosaurus often translated meaning lizard previous lizard primitive lizard latin prefix ante means zoologist paleontologist david meredith seares watson gave explanation named anteosaurus according ben prefix come latin ante would refer giant greek mythology antaios
