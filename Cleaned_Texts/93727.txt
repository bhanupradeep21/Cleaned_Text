robert andrews millikan march december american experimental physicist nobel prize physics measurement elementary electric charge work photoelectric effect millikan graduated oberlin college obtained doctorate columbia university became assistant university chicago became full professor millikan began series experiments determine electric charge carried single electron began measuring course charged water droplets electric field results suggested charge droplets multiple elementary electric charge experiment accurate enough convincing obtained precise results oildrop experiment replaced water tended evaporate quickly millikan took similar skill experimental verification equation introduced albert einstein describe photoelectric effect used research obtain accurate value planck constant millikan left university chicago become director norman bridge laboratory physics california institute technology caltech pasadena california undertook major study radiation physicist victor hess detected coming outer space millikan proved radiation indeed extraterrestrial origin named cosmic rays chairman executive council caltech schools governing body time retirement millikan helped turn school one leading research institutions united also served board trustees science service known society science public millikan elected member american philosophical american academy arts united states national academy robert andrews millikan born march morrison went high school maquoketa iowa received bachelors degree classics oberlin college doctorate physics columbia university first earn phd close sophomore year greek professor asked teach course elementary physics preparatory department next year reply know physics answer anyone well greek teach physics right said take consequences try see purchased averys elements physics spent greater part summer vacation home trying master subject doubt ever taught better life first course physics intensely interested keeping knowledge ahead class may caught interest millikans enthusiasm education continued throughout career coauthor popular influential series introductory ahead time many ways compared books time treated subject way thought physicists also included many homework problems asked conceptual questions rather simply requiring student plug numbers formula starting professor university chicago millikan worked oildrop experiment measured charge single electron j j thomson already discovered chargetomass ratio electron however actual charge mass values unknown therefore one two values discovered could easily calculated millikan graduate student harvey fletcher used oildrop experiment measure charge electron well electron mass avogadro constant since relation electron charge known professor millikan took sole credit return harvey fletcher claiming full authorship related result millikan went win nobel prize physics part work fletcher kept agreement secret publication first results contradictory observations felix ehrenhaft started controversy two improving setup millikan published seminal study elementary charge one fundamental physical constants accurate knowledge value great importance experiment measured force tiny charged droplets oil suspended gravity two metal electrodes knowing electric field charge droplet could determined repeating experiment many droplets millikan showed results could explained integer multiples common value coulomb charge single electron somewhat lower modern value x coulomb probably due millikans use inaccurate value viscosity although time millikans oildrop experiments becoming clear exist things subatomic particles everyone convinced experimenting cathode rays j j thomson discovered negatively charged corpuscles called chargetomass ratio times hydrogen ion similar results found george fitzgerald walter kaufmann known electricity magnetism could explained basis charge continuous variable much way many properties light explained treating continuous wave rather stream photons beauty oildrop experiment well allowing quite accurate determination fundamental unit charge millikans apparatus also provided hands demonstration charge actually quantized general electric companys charles steinmetz previously thought charge continuous variable became convinced otherwise working millikans apparatus controversy selectivity millikans use results second experiment measuring electron charge issue discussed allan former highenergy experimentalist current philosopher science university colorado franklin contends millikans exclusions data affect final value charge obtained millikans substantial cosmetic surgery reduced statistical error enabled millikan give charge electron better onehalf one percent fact millikan included data discarded error would less would still resulted millikans measured charge better anyone else time slightly larger uncertainty might allowed disagreement results within physics community millikan likely tried avoid david goodstein argues millikans statement drops observed day period used paper clarified subsequent sentence specified drops upon complete series observations made goodstein attests indeed case notes five pages tables separate two einstein published paper particle theory light millikan convinced wrong vast body evidence already shown light wave undertook decadelong experimental program test einsteins theory required building described machine shop vacuo order prepare clean metal surface photoelectrode results published confirmed einsteins predictions every millikan convinced einsteins interpretation late wrote einsteins photoelectric equation judgment looked upon present resting upon sort satisfactory theoretical foundation even though actually represents accurately behavior photoelectric effect autobiography however declared work scarcely permits interpretation einstein originally suggested namely semicorpuscular photon theory light although millikans work formed basis modern particle physics conservative opinions century developments physics case photon theory another example textbook late version unambiguously states existence ether mentions einsteins theory relativity noncommittal note end caption einsteins portrait stating last list accomplishments author special theory relativity general theory relativity great success explaining otherwise unexplained phenomena predicting new ones millikan also credited measuring value plancks constant using photoelectric emission graphs various solar astronomer george ellery hale convinced millikan begin spending several months year throop college technology small academic institution pasadena california hale wished transform major center scientific research education years later throop college became california institute technology caltech millikan left university chicago become caltechs chairman executive council effectively president millikan served position caltech scientific research focused study cosmic rays term coined entered debate arthur compton whether cosmic rays composed highenergy photons millikans view charged particles comptons view millikan thought cosmic ray photons birth cries new atoms continually created counteract entropy prevent heat death universe compton eventually proven right observation cosmic rays deflected earths magnetic field hence must charged particles millikan vice chairman national research council world war time helped develop antisubmarine meteorological devices wartime service investigation inspector general william wood determined millikan attempted steal another inventors design centrifugal gun order profit wood recommended termination millikans army commission subsequent investigation frank mcintyre executive assistant army chief staff exonerated received chinese order jadewhen war millikan contributed works league nations committee intellectual cooperation replacement george e hale prominent researchers
