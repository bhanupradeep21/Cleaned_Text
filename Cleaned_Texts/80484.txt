child mania rating scales cmrs diagnostic screening measure designed identify symptoms mania children adolescents aged using diagnostic criteria dsmiv developed pavuluri also short measure assesses childs mood behavior symptoms asking parents teachers rate often symptoms caused problem youth past month clinical studies found cmrs reliable valid completed parents assessment childrens bipolar cmrs also differentiate cases pediatric bipolar disorder adhd disorder well delineating bipolar metaanalysis comparing different rating scales available found cmrs one best performing scales terms telling cases bipolar disorder apart clinical cmrs also found provide reliable valid assessment symptoms longitudinally course combination showing good reliability validity across multiple samples clinical settings along free brief score make cmrs promising tool especially since checklists available youths assess manic symptoms child mania rating scale cmrs created complement already existing measures like altman selfrating mania scale young mania rating scale formulated adults purpose cmrs assess symptoms mania pediatric bipolar disorder accurately discriminate symptoms mania symptoms important cmrs accurately discriminate symptoms adhd core symptoms adolescent bipolar disorder adhd shared two disorders hyperactivity impulsivity cmrs designed specifically younger children may may ability accurately answer questions behavior result questionnaire filled parents areor caregivers work children daily basis previous mania scales designed use either clinician patient therefore cmrs unique

though goldstandard screening tool pediatric bipolar disorder cmrs described promising useful tool example institutional protocols diagnosing evaluating bipolar disorder children may use cmrs initial screening tool establish need evaluation mania addition parent version cmrs cmrsp used research studies detect changes childrens mania symptoms due pharmacotherapy cmrs first measure specifically developed purpose screening bipolar disorder offers alternative broadband rating scales like child behavior checklist used screening tool bipolar disorder children mixed findings regarding furthermore cmrsp brief full versions shown effective distinguishing mania adhd brief version effectively retains characteristics original cmrs allowing wider application longitudinal psychometric studies cmrs

cmrs suffers problems selfreport inventories scores easily exaggerated minimized person completing case parent phenomenon called social desirability bias like questionnaires way instrument

youth also may matter although child mania rating scale shown valid reliable measure mania children one concern validity might change youth becomes adolescent parents teachers less influence awareness
