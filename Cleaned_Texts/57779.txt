bryconops genus freshwater fish family iguanodectidae south america consists small fish halfafoot long slender bodies silvery scales though mild color variation several species identified way humeral patch mark near pectoral fin others reddish ocellus eyespot one lobes dorsal fin many bryconops prefer clearwater environments strong current though partial slowmoving blackwater several endemic locale majority species brazil venezuela rivers river basins house species bryconops include tapajos orinoco tocantins negro madeira species bryconops evaluated far conservation status believed lowrisk species greatest threats population levels come almost entirely form anthropogenic hazards including mining dam construction farmland settlement destruction riparian zone nonetheless several

giacopinii largest reaches cm tl total length tail fin slender somewhat compressed elongate described mouth often terminal certain morphological consistencies within genus contributed accepted status monophyletic though said monophyly remains somewhat unclear largely based shared physical bryconops often silver shade therein sometimes darker back andor greenish three species b b b hint blue scales

bryconops long considered belong family characidae incertae still listed resources adw characidae enormously varied family many genera similar position however research examined morphological phylogenetic evidence prompted taxonomists move bryconops different family iguanodectidae also done keep characidae genera piabucus iguanodectes iguanodectidae well also moved based research piabucus
