atraumatic restorative treatment method cleaning tooth decay dental caries teeth using hand instruments dental hatchet spoonexcavator placing filling use rotary dental instruments dental drills prepare tooth performed settings access dental equipment drilling local anaesthetic injections required art considered conservative approach removes decayed tissue hand instruments avoiding removing tissue necessary preserves much tooth structure possible also avoids pulp irritation minimises patient discomfort art used small medium deep cavities decay reached tooth nerve dental caused dental caries shallowmediumsized cavities lesions decayed tissue removal carried soft tissue demineralised dentine completely removed harder tissue reached firm dentine deeper cavities lesions reach dentine thickness radiograph removal decay must carried carefully order avoid reaching tooths pulp dental nerve soft tissue left cavity floor decision much decay remove whether carry decay removal firm dentine stop soft dentine reached depends depth cavity filling needs minimum thickness material remain possibility reaching tooths pulp nerve exposed sometimes deep cavities accessed rotary burs vigorously hand instruments compromising tooths vitality dental radiographs need taken evaluate depth cavity extension decay deep close pulp soft decayed tissue removed cavity floor avoid risk pulp exposure art suitable primary baby teeth permanent dentition adult teeth large evidence basespecify supporting art firstly introduced dentist jo frencken introduced tanzania access dental treatments using drills restricted limited dentist availability lack electricity piped water result childrens teeth generally decayed caused paininfection removal required time dentists tried use hand instruments open andor enlarge small cavities selectively remove decayed tissue followed placement glass ionomer cement adhesive filing also releases fluoride helps tooths recovery decay remineralisation treatment tested clinical trials found effectivecitation needed although art initially developed response needs populations less access dental care similar outcomes invasive treatments local anaesthetic drilling tooth dental bur means suitable use type setting deprived communities dental clinics widely adopted mainstream care due atraumatic approach also proven beneficial patients dental anxiety learning disabilities even adequate dental care neither drilling local anaesthetics requiredcitation needed international caries consensus collaboration iccc meeting held leuven art recommended international group experts cariology restorative paediatric dentistry option treat decayed primary permanent teeth decay restorative options indicated cavities difficult clean using toothbrushes fluoride two different art procedures different aims preventive art fissure sealant noncavitated teeth restorative art filling decayed cavitated adult teeth erupt behind baby back teeth deep grooves fissures susceptible accumulating food debris dental plaque stagnate lead decay also difficult toothbrush properly erupting susceptible decay difficult keep dry enough use resinbased sealant material successfully however sealing tooth pits fissures helps make cleaning tooth easier stops accumulation plaque biofilm high viscosity glass ionomer cement hvgic used seal teeth covering pits fissures done cleaning tooth placing layer hvgic back teeth using finger pressure keep place dry hvgic material sets excess material removed necessary adjusted fit bite using hand instrumentscitation needed enamel hardouter surface tooth cavitated even small breach due tooth decay cavity enlarged special hand instruments necessary enable access soft decayed tooth tissue removing much decay necessary cavity cleaned water dried filled hvgic filling seals cavity preventing food debris dental plaque stagnating inside cavity also promotes remineralisation dental tissues affected decay cavity sealed decay bacteria left floor cavity get access oxygen sugar continuecitation needed art fillings used art fillings used summary success arthvgic restorations different type although originally developed use developing countries due atraumatic approach art become increasingly well accepted developed although art alone insufficient improve oral health people low middleincome countries sustainable manner collaborating centre oral health care planning future scenarios nijmegen included basic package oral care bpoc aims improve oral health deprived communities costeffective manner package comprises three components arthvgic restorations successfully used single surface lesions primary permanent multisurface lesions tooth decay spread across one surface tooth systematic reviews metaanalyses show mean failure rate arthvgic restorations higher occlusal lesions wide range cases evidence hall technique may successfulcitation needed multiple surface cavities posterior permanent teeth insufficient data draw conclusions use effectiveness therefore case alternative treatments attempted might include selective caries removal followed restoration using conventional filling materials usually resin composite depending clinical hvgic proven perform better dentine conditioner cavity conditioner used prior placement restorative material conditioner made polyacrylic acid aluminum chloride hexahydrate helps improve bonding gic tooth surface eliminating smear layer also advantage sealing dentinal tubules eliminate approach comprises use chemical material eg papacarie carisolv contains enzymes proteases soften decayed tooth structure removing decay art chemical materials used conjunction hand instruments removing dental caries advantage improving treatment comfort reducing pain heat vibration experienced make art accepted training oral health personnel october three oral health teams included family health programme area teams
