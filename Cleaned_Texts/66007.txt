thyroid storm rare severe lifethreatening complication hyperthyroidism occurs overactive thyroid activity leads hypermetabolism end result death cardiac arrest multiple organ characterized high fever temperatures often fast often irregular heart beat elevated blood pressure vomiting diarrhea agitation hypertension wide pulse pressure occurs early mid crisis hypotension accompanying shock occurring late heart failure heart attack may occur death may occur despite episodes occur either known hyperthyroidism whose treatment stopped become ineffective untreated mild hyperthyroidism developed intercurrent illness primary treatment thyroid storm inorganic iodine antithyroid drugs propylthiouracil methimazole reduce synthesis release thyroid hormone temperature control intravenous fluids also mainstays management beta blockers often used reduce effects thyroid patients often require admission intensive care lifethreatening medical emergency thyroid storm mortality rate despite without treatment condition likely fatal mortality rate historically condition considered untreatable hospital mortality rates approaching thyroid storm characterized acute onset symptoms hyperthyroidism fast heart rate restlessness agitation accompanied features fever temperatures often hypertension mental status changes diarrhea individuals exhibit varying signs organ dysfunction patients may experience liver dysfunction jaundice yellowing skin considered poor prognostic sign cardiac heart symptoms include abnormal heart rhythms myocardial infarction heart attack congestive heart failure may lead cardiovascular collapse mortality high situations individuals may experience classic signs restlessness agitation instead present apathetic signs weakness transition hyperthyroidism thyroid storm typically triggered nonthyroidal insult including limited fever sepsis dehydration myocardial infarction psychiatric individuals higher risk thyroid storm hyperthyroidism incompletely treated antithyroid drugs discontinued many individuals underlying primary causes hyperthyroidism graves disease toxic multinodular goiter solitary toxic adenoma amiodarone however thyroid storm occur individuals unrecognized thyrotoxicosis experiencing nonthyroid surgery labor infection exposure certain medications radiocontrast dyescitation needed precise mechanism development thyroid storm poorly understood human body thyroid hormone may free biologically active bound thyroid binding hormone biologically inactive transported release thyroid hormone tightly regulated feedback system involving hypothalamus pituitary gland thyroid gland hyperthyroidism results dysregulation system eventually leads increases levels free transition simple hyperthyroidism medical emergency thyroid storm may triggered conditions see causes lead following individuals thyroid storm tend increased levels free thyroid hormone although total thyroid hormone levels may much higher uncomplicated rise availability free thyroid hormone may result manipulating thyroid gland setting individual receiving radioactive iodine therapy free thyroid hormone levels may acutely increase due release hormone ablated thyroid tissuecitation needed decrease thyroid hormone binding protein setting various stressors medications may also cause rise free thyroid along increases thyroid hormone availability also suggested thyroid storm characterized bodys heightened sensitivity thyroid hormone may related sympathetic activation see sympathetic nervous system activation times stress may also play significant role thyroid sympathetic activation increases production thyroid hormone thyroid gland setting elevated thyroid hormone density thyroid hormone receptors esp betareceptors also increases enhances response catecholamines likely responsible several cardiovascular symptoms increased cardiac output heart rate stroke volume seen thyroid stormcitation according newer theories thyroid storm results allostatic failure situation thyrotoxicosis hampers development nonthyroidal illness would help save energy critical illness situations high metabolic usually critical illness eg sepsis myocardial infarction causes shock thyroid function tuned result syndrome occasionally also low tsh concentrations syndrome impaired plasma protein binding thyroid hormones endocrine pattern referred euthyroid sick syndrome ess nonthyroidal illness syndrome ntis thyroid allostasis critical illness tumours uraemia starvation tacitus although ntis associated significantly worse prognosis also assumed represent beneficial adaptation type allostasis cases critical illness accompanied thyrotoxicosis comorbidity prevents downregulation thyroid function therefore consumption energy oxygen glutathione remains high leads increased new theories imply thyroid storm results interaction thyrotoxicosis specific response organism oversupply thyroid diagnosis thyroid storm based presence signs symptoms consistent severe multiple approaches proposed calculate probability thyroid storm based clinical criteria however none universally adopted clinicians instance burch wartofsky published burchwartofsky

impending thyroid storm greater suggests current thyroid alternatively japanese thyroid association jta criteria derived large cohort patients thyroid storm japan published provide qualitative method determine probability thyroid storm jta criteria separate diagnosis thyroid storm definite versus suspected based specific combination signs symptoms patient exhibits require elevated free triiodothyronine free thyroxine definite thyroid hyperthyroidism tsh suppressed free serum total elevation thyroid hormone levels suggestive thyroid storm accompanied signs severe hyperthyroidism diagnostic may also correlate uncomplicated moreover serum may normal critically ill patients due decreased conversion potential abnormalities include main strategies management thyroid storm reducing production release thyroid hormone reducing effects thyroid hormone tissues replacing fluid losses controlling thyroid storm requires prompt treatment hospitalization often admission intensive care unit cases heart failure leading hemodynamic collapse cardiocirculatory support including vaecmo may high fever temperature control achieved fever reducers paracetamolacetaminophen external cooling measures cool blankets ice packs dehydration occurs due fluid loss sweating diarrhea vomiting treated frequent fluid severe cases mechanical ventilation may necessary suspected underlying cause also guidelines recommend administration inorganic iodide potassium iodide lugols reduce synthesis release thyroid hormone high dosage iodine may reduce synthesis thyroid hormone via wolffchaikoff effect release via plummer guidelines recommend iodine administered antithyroid medications started iodine also substrate synthesis thyroid hormone may worsen hyperthyroidism administered without antithyroid antithyroid drugs propylthiouracil methimazole used reduce synthesis release thyroid hormone propylthiouracil preferred methimazole due additional effects reducing peripheral conversion however commonly used etiology involves subacute thyroiditis antithyroid medications always used use administration beta blockers eg metoprolol recommended reduce effect circulating thyroid hormone end propranolol high doses common firstline treatment reduces peripheral conversion active form thyroid nonselective beta blockers suggested beneficial due inhibitory effects peripheral deiodinases recent research suggests associated increased therefore cardioselective beta blockers may high levels thyroid hormone result hypermetabolic state result increased breakdown cortisol hormone produced adrenal gland results state relative adrenal insufficiency amount cortisol guidelines recommend corticosteroids hydrocortisone dexamethasone preferred prednisolone methylprednisolone administered patients thyroid storm however doses altered individual patient ensure relative adrenal insufficiency adequately treated minimizing risk side plasmapheresis removes cytokines antibodies thyroid hormones
