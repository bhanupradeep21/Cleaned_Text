usan inn ban marketed amidate shortacting intravenous anaesthetic agent used induction general anaesthesia short procedures reduction dislocated joints tracheal intubation cardioversion electroconvulsive therapy developed janssen pharmaceutica introduced intravenous agent europe united common side effects include venous pain injection skeletal muscle emergency settings etomidate used sedative hypnotic agent used conscious part rapid sequence induction induce used anaesthetic agent since rapid onset action safe cardiovascular risk profile therefore less likely cause significant drop blood pressure induction addition etomidate often used easy dosing profile limited suppression ventilation lack histamine liberation protection myocardial cerebral thus etomidate good induction agent people hemodynamically etomidate also interesting characteristics people traumatic brain injury one anesthetic agents able decrease intracranial pressure maintain normal arterial sepsis one dose medication appear affect risk another use etomidate determine speech lateralization people prior performing lobectomies remove epileptogenic centres brain called etomidate speech memory test esam used montreal neurological however retrospective cohort studies support use safety etomidate addition action use anesthetic etomidate also found directly inhibit enzymatic biosynthesis steroid hormones including corticosteroids adrenal adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitor available intravenous parenteral administration useful situations rapid control hypercortisolism necessary oral administration us state florida used drug death penalty procedure mark james asay executed august became first person us executed etomidate one drugs etomidate replaces midazolam sedative drug companies made harder buy midazolam executions etomidate followed rocuronium bromide paralytic finally potassium acetate place commonly used potassium chloride injection stop heart potassium acetate first used purpose inadvertently execution etomidate suppresses corticosteroid synthesis adrenal cortex reversibly inhibiting enzyme important adrenal steroid production leads primary adrenal using continuous etomidate infusion sedation critically ill trauma patients intensive care units associated increased mortality due adrenal continuous intravenous administration etomidate leads adrenocortical dysfunction mortality patients exposed continuous infusion etomidate days increased mainly due infectious causes etomidateinduced adrenal suppression use patients sepsis controversial cortisol levels reported suppressed hours single bolus etomidate population risk adrenal reason many authors suggested etomidate never used critically ill patients septic could increase however authors continue defend etomidates use septic patients etomidates safe hemodynamic profile lack clear evidence study jabre et al showed single dose etomidate used rapid sequence induction prior endrotracheal intubation effect mortality compared ketamine even though etomidate cause transient adrenal addition recent metaanalysis done hohl could conclude etomidate increased authors metaanalysis concluded studies needed lack statistical power conclude definitively effect etomidate mortality thus hohl suggests burden prove etomidate safe use septic patients research needed advise giving prophylactic dose steroids eg hydrocortisone etomidate used one small prospective controlled patients undergoing colorectal surgery verified safety giving stress dose corticosteroids patients receiving etomidate retrospective review almost people etomidate used induction anaesthesia associated increase risk dying compared given people given etomidate also significantly greater odds cardiovascular morbidity significantly longer hospital given retrospective design study difficult draw firm conclusions data people traumatic brain injury etomidate use associated blunting acth stimulation clinical impact effect yet
