aequorin calciumactivated photoprotein isolated hydrozoan aequorea bioluminescence studied decades protein isolated animal osamu shimomura animal protein occurs together green fluorescent protein produce green light resonant energy transfer aequorin generates blue light discussions jellyfish dna make glowing animals often refer transgenic animals express green fluorescent protein aequorin although originally derive animal apoaequorin protein portion aequorin ingredient dietary supplement prevagen us federal trade commission ftc charged maker false advertising memory improvement claims work aequorin began e newton harvey though harvey unable demonstrate classical luciferaseluciferin reaction showed water could produce light dried photocytes light could produced even absence oxygen later osamu shimomura began work bioluminescence aequorea involved tedious harvesting tens thousands jellyfish docks friday harbor determined light could produced extracts seawater specifically also noted extraction animal creates green light due presence green fluorescent protein changes native blue light aequorin main focus work shimomura two others martin chalfie roger tsien awarded nobel prize work green fluorescent proteins aequorin holoprotein composed two distinct units apoprotein called apoaequorin approximate molecular weight kda prosthetic group coelenterazine say apoaequorin enzyme produced photocytes animal coelenterazine substrate whose oxidation enzyme catalyzes coelenterazine bound called aequorin notably protein contains three ef hand motifs function binding sites protein member superfamily calciumbinding proteins crystal structure revealed aequorin binds coelenterazine oxygen form peroxide binding site first two calcium atoms show times greater affinity calcium third however earlier claims two efhands bind questioned later structures indicated three sites indeed bind thus titration studies show three calciumbinding sites active two ions needed trigger enzymatic studies shown presence internal cysteine bond maintains structure also explained need thiol reagent like beta mercaptoethanol regeneration protein since reagents weaken sulfhydryl bonds cysteine residues expediting regeneration aequorin chemical characterization aequorin indicates protein somewhat resilient harsh treatments aequorin heat held minutes protein lost activity denaturants urea guanidine hydrochloride destroy protein aequorin presumably encoded genome aequorea least four copies gene recovered cdna genome sequenced unclear cdna variants account isoforms early studies bioluminescence aequorea e newton harvey noted bioluminescence appears ring around bell occurs even absence remarkable bioluminescence reactions require oxygen led idea animals somehow store later discovered apoprotein stably bind oxygen required regeneration active form however presence calcium ions protein undergoes conformational change converts prosthetic group excited coelenteramide excited coelenteramide relaxes ground state blue light wavelength nm emitted coelenteramide exchanged entire protein still fluorescent connection bioluminescence fluorescence property ultimately important discovery luciferin since emitted light easily detected luminometer aequorin become useful tool molecular biology measurement intracellular early successful purification aequorin led first experiments involving injection protein tissues living animals visualize physiological release calcium muscle fibers since protein widely used many model biological systems including rats mice cultured cultured cells expressing aequorin gene effectively synthesize apoaequorin however recombinant expression yields apoprotein therefore necessary add coelenterazine culture medium cells obtain functional protein thus use blue light emission measure concentration coelenterazine hydrophobic molecule therefore easily taken across plant fungal cell walls well plasma membrane higher eukaryotes making aequorin suitable reporter plants fungi mammalian aequorin number advantages indicators protein large low leakage rate cells compared lipophilic dyes dii lacks phenomena intracellular compartmentalization sequestration often seen voltagesensitive dyes disrupt cell functions embryo development moreover light emitted oxidation coelenterazine depend optical excitation problems autofluorescence primary limitation aequorin prosthetic group coelenterazine irreversibly consumed produce light requires continuous addition coelenterazine media issues led developments genetically
