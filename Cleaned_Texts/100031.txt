social perception interpersonal perception study people form impressions make inferences people sovereign social perception refers identifying utilizing social cues make judgments social roles rules relationships context characteristics eg trustworthiness others domain also includes social knowledge refers ones knowledge social roles norms schemas surrounding social situations people learn others feelings emotions picking information gather physical appearance verbal nonverbal communication facial expressions tone voice hand gestures body position movement examples ways people communicate without words realworld example social perception understanding others disagree one said one sees roll eyes four main components social perception observation attribution integration confirmation observations serve raw data social interplay three sources persons situations behavior sources used evidence supporting persons impression inference others another important factor understand talking social perception attribution attribution expressing individuals personality source cause behavior event fully understand impact personal situational attributions social perceivers must integrate available information unified impression finally confirm impressions people try understand find create information form various biases importantly social perception shaped individuals current motivations emotions cognitive load capacity cognitive load complete amount mental effort utilized working memory combined determines people attribute certain traits traits interpreted fascination research social perception date back late social psychology first discoveredcitation needed research social perception done realization significance understanding predicting social world continues grow processes social perception begin observing persons situations behaviors gather evidence supports initial impression although society tries train people judge others based physical traits social perceivers help influenced others hair skin color height weight style clothes pitch voice etc making first impression people tendency judge others associating certain facial features specific personality types example studies indicate people perceived stronger assertive competent small eyes low eyebrows angular chin wrinkled skin small forehead people tend associate babyfaced people impotence able easily predict sequences results event based extent depth past experiences similar event ability anticipate outcomes situation also greatly influenced individuals cultural background inevitably shapes types experiences situational observations either lead humans preset notions certain events explain causes human nonverbal communication helps people express emotions attitudes personalities dominant form nonverbal communication use facial expressions channel different emotions greatly influenced charles darwins research facial expressions book expression emotions man animals believed humans regardless culture race encode decode six primary emotions happiness sadness anger fear surprise disgust universally way encode means communicate nonverbal behavior decode means interpret meaning intention nonverbal behavior decoding sometimes inaccurate due affect blend facial expression two differently registered emotions andor display rules culturally dictated rules nonverbal behaviors acceptable nonverbal cues body language eye contact vocal intonations affect social perception allowing thinslicing thinslicing describes ability make quick judgements finding consistencies events based narrow frames experience observations drawn persons situations behavior next step make inferences identify individuals inner dispositions large component social perception attribution attribution use information gathered observation help individuals understand rationalize causes ones others behaviors psychological research attribution began work fritz heider subsequently developed others harold kelley bernard weiner people make attributions understand world around order seek reasons individuals particular behavior people make attributions able make judgments cause causes certain behavior attribution theory study systems models people implement make attributions behavior others attempts explain use information social environment understand others behavior one common bias people exhibit attribution called fundamental attribution error fundamental attribution error tendency people attribute others actions behaviors internal traits opposed external example may manifest real world pointed research furnham gunter ones view justness poverty may affected ones financial status one experienced poverty may see less deserved might someone impoverished way fundamental attribution error barrier empathizing others one consider circumstances involved actions others unlike conventional attribution theories twostep process attribution suggests people analyze others behaviors first automatically making internal attribution considering possible external attributions may affect initial heiders valuable contribution topic attribution dichotomy attempting decide individuals behave certain way make either internal external internal attribution also called dispositional attribution personal assumption individual acting certain way due something individual personality character attitude external attribution also called situational attribution inference individual acting certain way due situation assumption individuals would respond way similar situation essentially people first assume persons behavior due personality attempt modify attribution also factoring persons according edward jones keith daviss correspondent inference theory people learn individuals behavior chosen freely anticipated results small number favorable three factors people use basis inferences according american social psychologist harold kelley individuals make attributions utilizing covariation principle covariation principle claims people attribute behavior factors present certain behavior occurs factors absent three types covariation information particularly helpful consensus distinctiveness consistency single individual large majority individuals behave similarly reaction specific stimulus individuals behavior attributed stimulus high consensus individuals behavior due specific stimulus compared individuals behavior reaction stimuli within broader category helps judge whether level distinctiveness information high thus attributed stimulus lastly consistency information used see happens behavior another time individual stimulus remain unless snap judgement made observing persons situations behavior people integrate dispositions form impressions norman h anderson american social psychologist developed information integration theory theory states impressions made perceivers personal dispositions weighted average target individuals differences among perceivers due people using standard frame reference judging evaluating others people also tend view skills traits favorable others also impressions formed others also influenced current temporary mood perceiver concept called priming also affects perceivers impressions others priming tendency recently perceived implemented concepts words come mind easily influence understanding new trait information also impacts peoples impressions others psychologist solomon asch first discover existence one trait tends indicate existence traits asch claimed central traits exist exert strong effect perceivers overall lastly sequence trait realized also influence traits impact research shows tendency information presented beginning sequence greater effect impressions information presented later concept called primacy implicit personality theory type model people use group various kinds personality qualities put another way implicit personality theories describe way observer uses traits displayed another person form impressions person people pay attention variety cues including visual auditory verbal cues predict understand personalities others order fill gap unknown information person assists social interactions certain traits seen especially influential formation overall impression individual called central traits traits less influential impression formation called peripheral traits traits central peripheral fixed vary based context instance saying person warm versus cold may central impact individuals impression formation paired traits industrious determined peripheral impact paired traits shallow kim demonstrate forming impressions others individuals assess others evaluative dimension say asked describe personality traits others individuals rate others goodbad dimension peoples implicit personality theories also include number dimensions strongweak dimension activepassive dimension

implicit personality theories others rated vary person person goodbad dimension appears part peoples implicit personality theories making integrating attributions individuals form impressions subject confirmation biases threat selffulfilling prophecy true people fall biases identified social psychologists biases may yet identified despite misjudgments four reasons soundly demonstrate peoples competence social perceivers accuracy social perception relates connection judgments people make others psychological attributes reality attributes regards people judged three slightly varying approaches interpreting accuracy pragmatic constructivist realistic approaches empirical research suggests social perception mostly accurate degree accuracy based four major moderator variables moderators attributes judge target trait judged information judgment based realistic accuracy model ram explains moderators result process accurate judgment process accurate personality judgment starts target revealing relevant information must available judge identifies uses form final accurate social perception important also rather neglected difficult provide set list criteria checkedoff accuracy subjective nature past assumption peoples judgements also considered erroneous often mistaken many researchers chosen pursue facets research instead assumptions proved incorrect research research methods became sophisticated genuine effort put analyzing accurate social tasit awareness social inference test audiovisual test past clinical assessment social perception test based upon several critical components social perception crucial social competence using complex dynamic visual auditory cues assess critical components test assesses ability identify emotions skill impaired
