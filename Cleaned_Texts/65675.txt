elucidated hupehsuchian morphological disparity establishing spectrum forelimb shapes broad fanlike paddles eretmorhipus one end narrow pointed flippers parahupehsuchus according authors diversity enhances morphological hence behavioral variations among hupehsuchians likely enabled hupehsuchians divide resources allowed turn high taxonomic diversity within limited geographic members
