petri dish alternatively known petri plate cellculture dish shallow transparent lidded dish biologists use hold growth medium cells originally cells bacteria fungi small container named inventor german bacteriologist julius richard common type culture plate petri dish one common items biology laboratories entered popular culture term sometimes written lower case especially nontechnical later called petri dish originally developed german physician robert koch private laboratory precursor method petri assistant koch berlin university made final modifications used today penicillin first antibiotic discovered alexander fleming noticed penicillium mold contaminating bacterial culture petri dish killed bacteria around petri dishes usually cylindrical mostly diameters ranging millimetres height diameter ratio ranging squarish versions also petri dishes traditionally reusable made glass often heatresistant borosilicate glass proper sterilization since plastic dishes usually disposable also dishes often covered shallow transparent lid resembling slightly wider version dish lids glass dishes usually plastic dishes may closefitting covers delay drying alternatively glass plastic versions may small holes around rim ribs underside cover allow air flow culture prevent water petri dishes especially plastic ones usually feature rings andor slots lids bases less prone sliding one another stacked sticking smooth surface small dishes may protruding base secured microscope stage direct versions may grids printed bottom help measuring density microplate single container array flatbottomed cavities essentially small petri dish makes possible inoculate grow dozens hundreds independent cultures dozens samples time besides much cheaper convenient separate dishes microplate also amenable automated handling inspection petri dish developed german physician julius richard petri name given working assistant robert koch berlin university petri invent culture dish rather modified version kochs used agar medium developed walther koch published precursor dish booklet titled zur untersuchung von pathogenen organismen methods study pathogenic known bible described new bacterial culture method used glass slide agar container basically petri dish circular glass dish cm matching lid called feuchte kammer moist chamber bacterial culture spread glass slide placed moist chamber small wet paper bacterial growth easily koch publicly demonstrated plating method seventh international medical congress london august louis pasteur exclaimed cest un grand progr√®s monsieur great progress using method koch discovered important pathogens tuberculosis mycobacterium tuberculosis anthrax bacillus anthracis cholera vibrio cholerae research tuberculosis awarded nobel prize physiology medicine students also made important discoveries friedrich loeffler discovered bacteria glanders burkholderia mallei diphtheria corynebacterium diphtheriae georg theodor august gaffky bacterium typhoid salmonella enterica petri made changes circular dish used often asserted petri developed new culture incorrect instead using separate glass slide plate culture media placed petri directly placed media glass dish eliminating unnecessary steps transferring culture media using wet paper reducing chance published improved method eine kleine modification des koch schen plattenverfahrens minor modification plating technique although could named koch final method given eponymous name petri petri dishes widely used biology cultivate microorganisms bacteria yeasts molds suited organisms thrive solid semisolid surface culture medium often agar plate layer mm thick agar agarose gel containing whatever nutrients organism requires blood salts carbohydrates amino acids desired ingredients dyes indicators medicinal drugs agar ingredients dissolved warm water poured dish left cool medium solidifies sample organism inoculated plated dishes left undisturbed hours days organism grows possibly incubator usually covered placed upsidedown lessen risk contamination airborne spores virus phage cultures require population bacteria grown dish first becomes culture medium viral inoculum petri dishes widespread microbiological research smaller dishes tend used largescale studies growing cells petri dishes relatively expensive petri dishes used visualize location contamination surfaces kitchen counters clothing food preparation equipment animal human application petri dishes may filled culture medium protrudes slightly edges dish make easier take samples hard objects shallow petri dishes prepared way called replicate organism detection counting rodac plates available petri dishes also used cell cultivation isolated cells eukaryotic organisms immunodiffusion studies solid agar liquid medium petri dishes may used observe early stages plant germination grow plants asexually isolated cells petri dishes may convenient enclosures study behavior insects small animals due large open surface petri dishes effective containers evaporate solvents dry precipitates either room temperature ovens desiccators petri dishes also make convenient temporary storage samples especially liquid granular powdered ones small objects insects seeds transparency flat profile allows contents inspected naked eye magnifying glass lowpower microscope without removing
