sulfatereducing microorganisms srm sulfatereducing prokaryotes srp group composed sulfatereducing bacteria srb sulfatereducing archaea sra perform anaerobic respiration utilizing sulfate terminal electron acceptor reducing hydrogen sulfide therefore sulfidogenic microorganisms breathe sulfate rather molecular oxygen terminal electron acceptor reduced water aerobic respiration sulfatereducing microorganisms also reduce oxidized inorganic sulfur compounds sulfite dithionite thiosulfate trithionate tetrathionate elemental sulfur polysulfides sulfate reduction sulfatereducing microorganisms also capable reactions like disproportionation sulfur compounds depending context sulfatereducing microorganisms used broader sense including species reduce sulfur compounds narrower sense including species reduce sulfate excluding strict thiosulfate sulfur reducers example sulfatereducing microorganisms traced back billion years ago considered among oldest forms microbes contributed sulfur cycle soon life emerged many organisms reduce small amounts sulfates order synthesize sulfurcontaining cell components known assimilatory sulfate reduction contrast sulfatereducing microorganisms considered reduce sulfate large amounts obtain energy expel resulting sulfide waste known dissimilatory sulfate use sulfate terminal electron acceptor electron transport anaerobes however examples
