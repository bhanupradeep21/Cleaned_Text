colossosuchus extinct genus large mystriosuchine phytosaur upper triassic tiki formation india among largest known phytosaurs reaching length ft among characteristic features domeshaped head downturned tip upper jaw colossosuchus part endemic radiation phytosaurs india closely related two additional forms yet named genus monotypic including species colossosuchus techniensis fossils colossosuchus recovered redmudstone fluvial tiki formation located within rewa gondwana basin india remains stem monotypic bonebed meaning collection bones stem single species bonebed yielded skull mandible specimen approximately postcranial remains corresponding minimum individual animals primarily juveniles subadults specimens stored indian institute technology kharagpur type specimen cranium consisting partial rostrum skull table braincase genus name combines latin colossus reference great size obtained animal greek souchus crocodile common suffix used phytosaurs due resemblance modern crocodiles species name techniensis honors indian institute overall cranium colossosuchus appears domeshaped viewed side tip elongated upper jaw known terminal rosette strongly turned downward angle rosette large bulbous front flattened downward curvature much steeper phytosaurs series parallel crests run exclusively along left side premaxilla maxilla nares located eyes like phytosaurs unlike crocodiles opening nares pair prenarial fossa present colossosuchus shares diandongosuchus naris elevated eyes septum located rim narial openings similar diandongosuchus well ebrachosuchus several species parasuchus setting apart leptosuchomorphs nares overlap antorbital fenestra length condition also seen mystriosuchines volcanosuchus nasal bone covered bandlike ornamentation replaced dendritic branched ornamentation skulltable nasal bone meets frontal bone ushaped depression found supratemporal fenestra open dorsolaterally meaning top side skull located skulltable postorbitalsquamosal bar depressed oriented sides parietalsquamosal bar convex positioned descends beneath skull table shaft mandible broad width mandibular symphysis dentition consists three parts tripartite meaning several sets teeth present consist large teeth found terminal rosette distinct premaxillary maxillary tooth sets sets colossosuchus apart basal mystriosuchines draws parallels leptosuchomorphs mystriosuchines besides colossosuchus feature tripartite dentition four teeth located either side terminal rosette first three large roughly equal size first two tooth pairs firmly located bottom snout tip third fourth pair originate side bone angled slightly outward final pair smaller followed three small anterior premaxillary teeth general colossosuchus high tooth count around teeth present either side upper jaw neural arches possess welldeveloped laminae fossae similar seen angistorhinus smilosuchus adamanensis well smilosuchus gregorii sacrum consists three vertebrae like smilosuchus adamanensis redondasaurus cf body size colossosuchus determined use multiple different methods according prior publications including heckert et al head body proportions changed among phytosaurs evolutionary history according basal taxa parasuchus larger heads p hislopi head makes total length later phytosaurs hypothesized proportions similar modern crocodilians like saltwater crocodile accounting total length based datta ray propose colossosuchus would derived proportions assuming skull makes body length would yield maximum length ft prevent overestimating size two additional regression equations used one based length femur based skull length former yielded maximum length ft considered underestimate latter resulted maximum length ft ft estimate favored datta ray argue line body size seen derived phytosaurs including smilosuchus would consequently mean colossosuchus among largest known phytosaurs discovered estimates however apply largest known individuals represent average size attained colossosuchus fact fossils discovered mass death site instead provides wide range sizes known individuals range juveniles fullly mature adults skeletally immature members species generally smaller ft characterized comparably big eyes lacking ornamentation unfused bones poorly developed muscle scars subadults transitionals individuals thought occupy size range ft skeletal maturity appears reached length greater phylogenetic analysis conducted colossosuchus based dataset author debajit data included different taxa compossed phytosaurs euparkeria outgroup analysis built around total anatomical characters regarded skull including traits previously included analysis besides colossosuchus two undescribed phytosaur skulls india also included strict consensus tree yielded analysis poorly resolved features multiple polytomys yet also displays much clearer separations specifically members mystriosuchinae clearly set apart nonmystriosuchine phytosaurs within subfamily leptosuchomorphs likewise form distinct cluster species colossosuchus found mystriosuchine forming distinct clade together two undescribed skulls included grouping sits alongside volcanosuchus rutiodon clade formed angistorhinus brachysuchus base mystriosuchinae diverges also poorly resolved leptosuchomorpha although information provided strict consensus limited clearer results yielded tree resulting majority rule tree agrees broader ideas present strict consensus clears several polytomys present former specifically angistorhinus brachysuchus still form clade found basalmost grouping mystriosuchinae next diverging group colossosuchus undescribed indian skulls found earliest branching three indian forms recovered sister taxa group consisting clade formed rutiodon volcanosuchus derived leptosuchomorphs results majority rule tree shown euparkeria capensis diandongosuchus fuyuanensis wannia scurriensis parasuchus bransoni parasuchus angustifrons parasuchus hislopi ebrachosuchus neukami angistorhinus grandis brachysuchus megalodon colossosuchus techniensis volcanosuchus statisticae rutiodon carolinensis leptosuchomorpha general placement repeated second paper year brownstein likewise recovered colossosuchus mystriosuchine parasuchid brownstein conducted multiple phylogenetic analysis utilizing different datasets parsimony bayesian analysis placement various taxa shifted among analysis colossosuchus marginally affected differing sets parsimony bayesian analysis using datta reys dataset still found basal rutiodon volcanosuchus although brachysuchus angistorhinus found significantly derived bayesian analysis bayesian analysis using dataset jones butler hand differed placed colossosuchus derived nonleptosuchomorph tiki formation known diversity abundance phytosaur remains besides colossosuchus also yielded smaller volcanosuchus large amount teeth belonging derived species phytosaur addition remains tiki formation least two phytosaurs known lived time different parts india diverse phytosaur fauna highlights endemic nature group generally appears distinct forms inhabiting restricted ranges rather individual genera cosmopolitan distribution additionally indian taxa noted survived early norian extinction event effectively caused disappearance nonleptosuchomorph phytosaurs global scale however neither precise causes extinction event indian phytosaur community survived understood bonebed yielded remains colossosuchus may formed mass death family group consisting adults performing parental
