social monogamy mammals defined sexually mature adult organisms living many definitions social monogamy social organization found invertebrates reptiles amphibians fish birds mammals confused genetic monogamy refers two individuals reproduce one social monogamy describe sexual interactions patterns reproduction monogamous pairs rather strictly refers patterns living rather sexual genetic monogamy describe reproductive patterns possible species genetically monogamous socially monogamous likely species practice social monogamy genetic monogamy social monogamy consists limited sharing territory obtaining food resources raising offspring together unique characteristic monogamy unlike polygamous species parents share parenting even though tasks shared monogamy define degree paternal investment breeding mammalian species socially monogamous including species mate life ones mate extended period monogamy common among primates primate species socially lifelong monogamy rare however exemplified species prairie vole microtus vast majority monogamous mammals practice serial social monogamy another male female accepted new partnership case partners addition species exhibit shortterm monogamy involves partnership termination ones partner still alive however usually lasts least one breeding monogamy usually occur groups high abundance females rather ones females occupy small socially monogamous mammals live significantly lower population densities solitary additionally mammals exhibit malebiased dispersal however monogamous mammalian species display femalebiased socially monogamous species exhibit pair bonds occur two sexually mature organisms affective component specific individual last longer one reproductive cycle quantifiable strength quality pair bonding exhibit sexual behaviors andor biparental pair bonding exhibit however organisms identify one another pair end death mate separation mate directly mating lack distress separated mate lack socially monogamous species exhibit pair bonding pair bonding animals practice social monogamy characteristics aid identifying species socially monogamous biological level social monogamy affects neurobiology organism hormone pathways vasopressin vasopressin related distress hormone organism feels separated mate oxytocin associated affective component social interactions mates biological factors give way genetic component evolution could act via selection evolve social monogamy facultative monogamy type monogamy occurs male fully committed one female chooses stay mating opportunities available type monogamy species rarely spend time families lack paternal care towards elephant shrews rhynchocyon chrysopygus elephantulus rufescens agoutis dasyprocta punctata grey duikers sylvicapra grimmia pacaranas dinomys branickii common examples mammalian species display type monogamy addition species characterized occupy low areas large expand obligate monogamy type ii monogamy practiced species live overlapping territories females rear young without help species indris indri indri night monkeys aotus trivirgatus african dormice notomys alexis hutias capromys melanurus observed family groups live together number generations several factors associated type ii one key factors monogamous pairings group living advantages living groups include limited group living advantages however describe monogamy polygyny evolved species mentioned possible conditions may account cases monogamous behavior mammalian species may several hypotheses evolution mammalian monogamy extensively studied hypotheses apply majority monogamous species apply limited number vasopressin hormone induces male prairie vole mate one female form pair bond exhibit mateguarding behavior ie increase degree monogamous presence vasopressin receptor ventral forebrain associated pair bonding necessary genetic differences gene also play role monogamy voles long alleles exhibit monogamous tendencies preferring mate stranger opposite sex whereas voles short alleles displayed lesser degree partner vasopressin responsible forming attachment male female prairie vasopressin also regulates paternal finally vasopressin activity results postmating aggression allows prairie voles protect oxytocin hormone regulates pair bond formation along blocking either oxytocin vasopressin prevents formation pair bond continues allow social blocking hormones resulted pair bond reduced oxytocin also attenuates negative effects cortisol hormone related stress monogamy helps produce positive health effects male marmosets received oxytocin antagonist increased hpaaxis activity response stressor treated showing oxytocin associated pair bond lessens physiological responses stress also marmosets previously elevated cortisol levels spent time close proximity mate marmosets previously normal cortisol dopamine neurotransmitter produces pleasurable effects reinforce monogamous behavior haloperidol dopamine antagonist prevented partner preference didnt disrupt mating apomorphine dopamine agonist induced pair bonding without mating showing dopamine necessary formation pair bond prairie addition mating induced increase turnover dopamine nucleus result statistically significant may indicate mating induce pair bond formation via dopaminergic reward system elevated testosterone levels associated decreased paternal decreased testosterone levels associated decreased rates infanticide experienced marmoset fathers decreased testosterone levels exposure infants scent infants stranger suggesting offspringspecific olfactory signals regulate testosterone induce paternal behavior female distribution seems one best predictors evolution monogamy species possible monogamy evolved due low female availability high female dispersion males unable monopolize one mate period time species kirks dikdik madoqua kirkii rufous elephant shrew elephantulus rufescens biparental care common species however exhibit monogamous mating systems presumably due high dispersal rates komers brotherton indicated significant correlation mating systems grouping patterns species furthermore monogamous mating system female dispersion found closely related main conclusions occurrence monogamy mammals phenomenon common species japanese serow capricornis crispus exhibits behaviordefinition needed example believed biparental care important role evolution mammalian females undergo periods gestation lactation well adapted take care young long period time opposed male partners necessarily contribute rearing differences parental contribution could result males drive seek females order increase reproductive success may prevent spending extra time helping raise helping female young rearing could potentially jeopardize males fitness result loss mating opportunitiescitation needed monogamous species exhibit type care mainly improve offsprings however occur biparental care extensively studied california deermouse peromyscus californicus species mice known strictly monogamous mates pair long period time level extrapair paternity considerably shown event female removal male takes direct care offspring acts primary hope survival young females attempt raise young cases mate removed often succeed due high maintenance costs raising presence males survival offspring much probable thus best interest parents concept also applies species ilike fattailed dwarf lemurs cheirogaleus medius females also successful raising offspring without paternal help lastly study performed wynneedwards campbells dwarf hamsters phodopus campbelli survived presence parents survived father several key factors may affect extent males care primates thought risk infanticide primary driver evolution socially monogamous primates unusual species socially monogamous additionally trait evolved separately every major primates also experience higher rates infanticide animals infanticide rates high opie atkinson dunbar shutlz found strong evidence male infanticide preceded evolutionary switch social monogamy primates rather biparental care female distribution suggesting infanticide main cause evolution social monogamy needed consistent findings indicate percentage infant loss significantly lower monogamous polyandrous due length gestation lactation female mammals infanticide killing offspring adult individuals relatively common since strong male male competition reproduction species behaviour infanticide could adaptative strategy enhance fitness rates infanticide low monogamous groups larger forementioned ultimate causes monogamy mammals phenotypic consequences sexual size dimorphism mammals words thought monogamous species males would tend similar lower body size one females males monogamous species compete strongly hence investing greater physical abilities would costlier males comparatively conclude sexual dimorphism reduced longterm pair bonding observing polygynous species tend greater sexual size dimorphism httpsenwikipediaorgwikisocialmonogamyinmammalianspecies
