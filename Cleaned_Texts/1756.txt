subcutaneous emphysema sce se occurs gas air accumulates seeps skin normally gas present subcutaneous refers subcutaneous tissue emphysema refers trapped air pockets since air generally comes chest cavity subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs around upper torso chest neck face axillae arms able travel little resistance along loose connective tissue within superficial subcutaneous emphysema characteristic cracklingfeel touch sensation described similar touching warm rice sensation air skin known subcutaneous crepitation form crepitus numerous etiologies subcutaneous emphysema described pneumomediastinum first recognized medical entity laennec reported consequence trauma later johns hopkins hospital dr louis hamman described postpartum woman indeed subcutaneous emphysema sometimes known hammans syndrome however medical circles instead commonly known macklins syndrome l macklin cc mt macklin cumulatively went describe pathophysiology subcutaneous emphysema result puncture parts respiratory gastrointestinal systems particularly chest neck air may become trapped result penetrating trauma eg gunshot wounds stab wounds blunt trauma infection eg gas gangrene cause gas trapped subcutaneous tissues subcutaneous emphysema caused medical procedures medical conditions cause pressure alveoli lung higher tissues outside common causes pneumothorax chest tube become occluded blood clot fibrinous material also occur spontaneously due rupture alveoli dramatic condition caused surgery called surgical term spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema used cause subcutaneous emphysema typically dangerous however symptom dangerous underlying conditions although underlying conditions require treatment subcutaneous emphysema usually small amounts air reabsorbed body however subcutaneous emphysema uncomfortable may interfere breathing often treated removing air tissues example using large bore needles skin incisions subcutaneous catheterization signs symptoms spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema vary based cause often associated swelling neck chest pain may also involve sore throat neck pain difficulty swallowing wheezing difficulty chest xrays may show air mediastinum middle chest significant case subcutaneous emphysema detected touching overlying skin feel like tissue paper rice touching bubbles causes move sometimes make crackling air bubbles painless feel like small nodules touch may burst skin tissues surrounding sce usually swollen large amounts air leak tissues around head face swell cases subcutaneous emphysema around neck may feeling fullness neck sound voice may sce particularly extreme around neck chest swelling interfere breathing air travel many parts body including abdomen limbs separations fatty tissue skin prevent air conditions cause subcutaneous emphysema may result blunt penetrating sce often result stabbing gunshot subcutaneous emphysema often found car accident victims force crash chest trauma major cause subcutaneous emphysema cause air enter skin chest wall neck pleural membranes punctured occurs penetrating trauma chest air may travel lung muscles subcutaneous tissue chest alveoli lung ruptured occurs pulmonary laceration air may travel beneath visceral pleura membrane lining lung hilum lung trachea neck chest condition may also occur fractured rib punctures fact patients rib fractures also subcutaneous rib fractures may tear parietal pleura membrane lining inside chest wall allowing air escape subcutaneous subcutaneous emphysema frequently found pneumothorax air outside lung chest may also result pneumomediastinum air mediastinum pneumopericardium air pericardial cavity around tension pneumothorax air builds pleural cavity exerts pressure organs within chest makes likely air enter subcutaneous tissues pleura torn broken subcutaneous emphysema results pneumothorax air may enter tissues including face neck chest armpits pneumomediastinum result number events example foreign body aspiration someone inhales object cause pneumomediastinum lead subcutaneous emphysema puncturing airways increasing pressure affected lungs enough cause subcutaneous emphysema chest wall commonly among first indications barotrauma damage caused excessive pressure suggests lung subjected significant thus phenomenon may occur diving trauma parts respiratory system lungs rupture bronchial tube may also cause subcutaneous air may travel upward neck pneumomediastinum results bronchial rupture downward torn trachea larynx soft tissues may also occur fractures facial bones neoplasms asthma attacks adverse effect heimlich maneuver injury pneumatic tools also known cause subcutaneous emphysema even extremities arms also occur result rupture esophagus usually late subcutaneous emphysema common result certain types surgery example unusual chest may also occur surgery around esophagus particularly likely prolonged potential causes positive pressure ventilation reason technique occurrence frequently unexpected may also occur result oral cricothyrotomy pneumonectomy entire lung removed remaining bronchial stump may leak air rare serious condition leads progressive subcutaneous air leak pleural space incision made thoracotomy cause subcutaneous infrequent occasions condition result dental surgery usually due use highspeed tools air cases result immediate onset usually painless swelling face neck crepitus crunching sound typical subcutaneous emphysema often present subcutaneous air visible one main causes subcutaneous emphysema along pneumothorax improperly functioning chest thus subcutaneous emphysema often sign something wrong chest tube may clogged clamped tube may need replaced large amounts air leaking new tube may since mechanical ventilation worsen pneumothorax force air tissues subcutaneous emphysema occurs ventilated patient indication ventilation may caused unusual subcutaneous emphysema result positive pressure another possible cause ruptured trachea may injured tracheostomy tracheal intubation cases tracheal injury large amounts air enter subcutaneous endotracheal tube puncture trachea bronchi cause subcutaneous air trapped skin necrotizing infections gangrene occurring late sign gas hallmark sign subcutaneous emphysema also considered hallmark fournier symptoms subcutaneous emphysema result infectious organisms produce gas fermentation emphysema occurs due infection signs infection systemic ie spread beyond initial location also air able travel soft tissues neck mediastinum retroperitoneum space behind abdominal cavity areas connected fascial punctured lungs airways air travels perivascular sheaths mediastinum enter subcutaneous spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema thought result increased pressures lung cause alveoli spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema air travels ruptured alveoli interstitium along blood vessels lung mediastinum tissues neck significant cases subcutaneous emphysema easy diagnose characteristic signs cases signs subtle making diagnosis medical imaging used diagnose condition confirm diagnosis made using clinical signs chest radiograph subcutaneous emphysema may seen radiolucent striations pattern expected pectoralis major muscle group air subcutaneous tissues may interfere radiography chest potentially obscuring serious conditions also reduce effectiveness chest hand since subcutaneous emphysema may become apparent chest xrays pneumothorax presence may used infer latter subcutaneous emphysema also seen ct scans air pockets appearing dark areas ct scanning sensitive commonly makes possible find exact spot air entering soft mt macklin cc macklin published insights pathophysiology spontaneous macklins syndrome occurring result severe asthmatic attack presence subcutaneous

emphysema complication insufflation laparoscopic surgery sudden rise endtidal following initial rise occurs insufflation first min raise suspicion subcutaneous note changes pulse oximetry airway pressure subcutaneous emphysema unlike endobronchial intubation capnothorax pneumothorax embolism subcutaneous emphysema usually time sce need treatment though conditions results may however amount air large interfere breathing occasionally progresses state massive subcutaneous emphysema quite uncomfortable requires surgical drainage amount air pushed airways lung becomes massive usually due positive pressure ventilation eyelids may swell much patient see pressure air may impede blood flow areolae breast skin scrotum labia lead necrosis latter urgent situations requiring rapid adequate severe cases compress trachea require severe cases subcutaneous emphysema catheters placed subcutaneous tissue release small cuts blow holes may made skin release subcutaneous emphysema occurs due pneumothorax chest tube frequently used control latter eliminates source air entering subcutaneous volume subcutaneous air increasing may chest tube removing air rapidly enough may replaced larger suction may also applied tube remove air progression condition monitored marking boundaries emphysema patients since treatment usually involves dealing underlying condition cases spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema may require nothing bed rest medication control pain perhaps supplemental breathing oxygen may help body absorb subcutaneous air air subcutaneous tissue usually pose lethal
