nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors nsais one two categories aromatase inhibitors ais ais divided two categories steroidal aromatase inhibitors sais type inhibitors nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors type inhibitors based mechanism action structure nsais mainly used treat breast cancer women nsais binding reversible process nsais binds aromatase enzyme noncovalent interactions aromatase inhibitors ais used treat breast cancer main target aromatase enzyme responsible high estrogen level nsais used treat hormonedependent breast cancer almost cancer cells express either estrogen progesterone receptors possibility antiestrogen treatment work hormone receptors cancer cells treatment likely efficient receptors need estrogen progesterone grow hormones present cancer cell gets message proliferate possibly die ais inhibit enzyme aromatase converts testosterone estrogen used clinically treatments breast cancer postmenopausal women currently two types nsais used breast cancer anastrozole letrozole used firstline therapy metastatic breast cancer also adjuvant nsai letrozole also used ovulation induction women polycystic ovary syndrome generally clomiphene citrate used induce ovulation women treatment unsuccessful resistant occurs cases letrozole used blocks estrogen therefore reduces negative estrogen feedback pituitary release folliclestimulating hormone fsh pituitary gland decreased estrogen maintains negative feedback hypothalamicpituitary axis estrogen production blocked inhibition aromatase releases hypothalamicpituitary axis estrogenic negative feedback thus increasing fsh secretion stimulates progress ovarian follicles therefore nsais women pcos contribute prominent studies shown letrozole adverse antiestrogenlike effects endometrial thickness cervical mucus seems explained short letrozole seems effective clomiphene citrate ovulation pregnancy rate shown effective terms ovulation rate live birth aminoglutethimide nsais therefore inhibits aromatase among example used treat absence seizures cushings syndrome postmenopausal breast cancer prostate first aromatase inhibitor discovered aminoglutethimide classified firstgeneration ais still used today despite causing side effects lack target enzyme specificity also effects cytochrome furthermore affects synthesis aldosterone thyroid hormone clinically aminoglutethimide caused undesirable central nervous system side effects example ataxia lethargy later generations second third developed aim higher potency safety selectivity inhibit aromatase specifically biosynthesis like firstgeneration therefore many adverse effects generally well tolerated serious adverse effects common adverse effects like flushing headache musculoskeletal pain vaginal aromatase enzyme belongs cytochrome family located chromosome human body aromatase consists βstrands major sheet minor sheets αhelixes function catalyze final step estrogen synthesis aromatization androgen specific involves hydroxylation uses nadph donor electrons methyl group removed leads creation aromatic active binding site aromatase enzyme subunit heme moiety heme moiety relation βface natural hormone androstenedione coordinates structure androstenedione contains two ketones form hydrogen bonds amino acids also active binding site group interacts amino acid additionally binding site androstenedione make van der waals forces several amino acids specifically binding nsais depends binding site aromatase fit substratebinding site aromatase enzyme nsais specific sais therefore enzymes may inhibited also cytochrome groups possible develop selective drugs cytochrome aromatase amino acid sequence arom well defined members cytochrome family resulting specific inhibition binding nsais aromatase noncovalent nsais competitive inhibitors disconnect active binding site inhibition aromatase stops therefore continuous amount nsais required inhibit thirdgeneration nsais profitable positioned triazole group flat aromatic ring good fit binding site aromatase triazole group coordinates heme group active binding site aromatase enzyme potently inhibits hydroxylation aromatase responsible estrogen sexhormone plays major role womens body estrogen also plays major role stimulating breast cancer binds activates estrogen receptor er er activated activates genes responsible multiple actions breast cancer activated er effect cellular division protease activity inhibition cell death formation new blood vessels aromatase inhibitors affect ability estrogens production androgens inhibiting aromatase enzyme activity part estrogen two categories ais based mechanism action structure three generations nsais inhibit estrogen production various places metabolic pathway generations common inhibit aromatase enzyme responsible conversion testosterone androstenedione estradiol estrone first secondgeneration nsais aminoglutethimide fadrozole also reducing effect production aldosterone cortisol thirdgeneration anastrozole letrozole selective inhibit aromatase enzyme effect steroidogenic mechanism nsais reversible binding process nsais binds aromatase enzyme noncovalent nsais destroy enzyme like sais interaction occurs heme group cytochrome aromatase pharmacokinetic properties nsais variable aminoglutethimide oral administration usual dosage range mgday drug good oral bioavailability absorbs rapidly completely aminoglutethimide good distribution around body partly metabolized liver acetylation elimination halflife drug hours drug excreted unchanged anastrozole administered orally standard daily dose mg anastrozole good oral bioavailability rapidly absorbed takes hours drug reach maximum serum concentration shown ingestion food significantly influence plasma concentration drug takes days treatment reach steadystate serum anastrozole distributes completely around body drug bound plasma proteins elimination anastrozole slow elimination halflife hours drug dose excreted urine part excreted feces largest part drug dose metabolized less excreted unchanged liver main site drug metabolism drug metabolized glucuronidation hydroxylation ndealkylation metabolites mainly excreted letrozole standard daily dose mg drug around oral bioavailability means drug absorbed fast entirely intake food affect extent absorption small reducing effect rate absorption takes weeks treatment reach steadystate serum letrozole distributes rapidly around body thoroughly distributed tissues around drug bound plasma proteins especially albumin elimination letrozole slow elimination halflife approximately days main route elimination drug metabolism liver pharmacologically inactive metabolite carbinol caused cytochrome isoenzymes also metabolism drug unknown synthesis nsais completed numerous ways example synthesis potent drug nsais letrozole acknowledged bowman et al described two synthesis methods first method serious limitation detectable amount undesirable isomer present second method uses nbutyllithium corrosive harmful substance therefore needs certain storage treatment example synthesis letrozole takes minutes gives yield begins bromide followed alkylation triazole latter step carbanion generation nucleophilic aromatic general nsais azole ring system like imidazole triazole attached planar aromatic structures heterocyclic nitrogen atom important factor nsais structureactivity relationship interacts heme iron enzymes inhibit hydroxylation reactions parts structure interact apoprotein moiety active binding site aromatase enzyme combination binding heme group active site results great effect specific effective nsais azole derivatives high affinity aromatase enzyme azole derivatives containing imidazole ring fadrozole liarozole together derivatives containing triazole ring letrozole anastrozole effect instead examined letrozole shown position nitrogen atom either position triazole important good inhibition aromatase derivatives containing triazole ring used firstline nsais well tolerated selective highly effective effective aromatase inhibitor letrozole inhibit aromatase enzyme peripheral studies shown selectivity nsais increased change triazole system bioisosteres also enhancing aromatic structures side demonstrated arrangement imidazole imidazolemethyl ring could give better inhibition triazole tetrazole azoles additionally nsais contain group considered effective letrozole triazole ring important binding heme moiety aromatase enzyme also cyano benzyl moiety significant partly imitates steroid backbone natural hormone androstenedione cyano groups para position benzonitrile electronwithdrawing important activity acts carbonyl group two aryl groups also play important role qsar models made figure mostvaluable structural physicochemical parameters nsais inhibitory activity models demonstrate precise understanding nsais effectiveness dipole moment molar refractivity considered meaningful physicochemical properties affect inhibition aromatase implies bulky complex flexible steric characteristic molecules important also often hydrophobic properties matter thereby nsais activity mostly dependent size shape drug structure along steric characteristics interaction azole group heme prosthetic initial discovery estrogens bioactivity urinary extracts contributed momentum greater understanding structure biosynthesis secretion function various estrogens mainly due independent work edward doisy adolf butenandt isolated estriol estrone estradiol urine pregnant blocking biosynthesis using drugs seen employing agents specifically affect estrogen production shown highest promise thus creating aromatic ring steroid molecule final step pathway estrogen biosynthesis inhibited gave rise trivial name aromatase enzyme catalyzing aminoglutethimide marketed anticonvulsant later doctor sinai hospital detroit proclaimed produced increased symptoms addisons disease lab
