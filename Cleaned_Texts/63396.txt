sleep disorder common repercussion traumatic brain injury occurs patients tbi distinguished two categories primary secondary damage primary damage includes injuries white matter focal contusion cerebral edema mostly occurring moment trauma secondary damage involves damage neurotransmitter release inflammatory responses mitochondrial dysfunctions gene occurring minutes days following trauma patients sleeping disorders following tbi specifically develop insomnia sleep apnea narcolepsy periodic limb movement disorder furthermore circadian sleepwake disorders occur increased level anxiety depression associated higher levels sleep disturbances tbi depression anxiety treated patients successful treatment sleep may tbi patients sleepiness show impaired cognitive function vigilance performance impairs daily sleep known neuroprotective role elimination neurotoxic waste products neural growth plasticity furthermore specific neuroplastic recovery effect post mild tbi therefore sleep disturbance may negative effect injury recovery rehabilitation outcomes leading long term may related less nonrem sleep due higher amount stage tbi patients obstructive sleep apnea show reduced cardiac function obstructive sleep apnea also associated structural changes indirect consequences sleep disorders tbi exacerbation many complications comorbidities include fatigue posttraumatic stress symptoms posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd chronic animal studies rodents showed sleep deprivation traumatic brain injury associated multiple potentially negative effects brain homeostasis including changes glutamate concentration energy consumption well brain summary sleep disorders occurring tbi patients associated low healthrelated quality life shorter survival different kinds tbi cause different brain dysfunctions research suggests tbi results damage sleepregulation centers including reticular activation system specifically damage suprachiasmatic nuclei scn leads disturbances circadian considering hypersomnia mostly areas involving maintenance wakefulness damaged rostral pons caudal midbrain sleep disorders frequently reported patients mild tbi reasons could increased awareness postinjury changes mild tbi patients may determined return preinjury life age groups affected sleep disorders tbi including several risk factors associated occurring sleep disorders lower years education severity head injury occurrence residuals symptoms example headache neurodegeneration impaired neurotransmitter function cerebrovascular autoregulatory dysfunction neuroinflammation dysregulation circadian hormones melatonin also consequence leading sleep order make diagnosis subjective evaluation objective sleep tests subjective evaluations include selfreport questionnaires sleep diaries assess sleep pattern patients objective sleep tests include mental physical examinations laboratory tests test medical background polysomnography psg typically possible assess tests prior injury therefore often clear whether sleeping disorder result preexisting careful assessment patients determining nature sleeping disorder essential finding effective explicit treatment sleep disorders following tbi several interventions general sleep disturbance tested patients tbi order provide proper treatment best divide injury recovery stages given treatments differs different seen deterioration sleep quality subacute phase mtbi linked worsening behavioural neuropsychiatric somatic general treatment sleep disorders following tbi distinguished pharmacological nonpharmacological interventions pharmacological treatments administered carefully medication highly addictive resulting withdrawal syndromes cause even sleep disturbances eg possible medications zopiclone lorazepam proven effective people also benzodiazepine benzodiazepinereceptor antagonists antidepressants administered especially patients insomnia studies shown negative effects hypnotics increased risk patients hypersomnia modafinil armodafinil methylphenidate amphetamines often used treatment day time medication always prescribed expert make sure correct medicament taken appropriate dose nonpharmacological treatments involve different interventions starting sleep includes sleep promoting activities maintaining regular strict sleep schedule avoiding heavy meals bedtime order restore natural sleepwake treatments options infrared light aim treat circadian rhythm disorders delayed sleep phase disorder especially patients hypersomnia bright light therapy morning proven prolongation slowwave sleep increases glymphatic clearance metabolic waste products lead improvements sleep furthermore studies showed ameliorated sleep pattern due acupuncturecitation needed patients tbi sleep apnea due tbi treated positive airway helps development regular breathing pattern sleep prevents waking cognitive behavioral therapy also shown effectively improve sleep tbi patients aims improve sleep habits behaviors identifying changing thoughts behaviors affect ability person sleep sleep well improvement quality sleep decrease depressive severity associated use nearinfrared light intracellular animals studies showed sleep deprivation prior brain injury might healthy effects five days complete sleep deprivation rats traumatic brain injury acted protection ischemic injury habitual deceased total amount sleep time tbi reduced several theories protectional effects sleep disturbances injury rats firstly may alter pattern gene activation deactivation could lead higher degree lack sleep might increase levels extracellular adenosine also mostly neuroprotective tbi furthermore sleep deprivation might lead form ischemic precondition habituates brain byproducts cellular studies run assess role caffeine rats sleeping results regarding rats studies come positive humans caffeine believed worsen sleep fragmentation insomnia lastly insufficient quantity quality sleep may cause rebound sleep post injury increase sleep enhanced regeneration research needed investigate findings transferred treatment humans tbi
