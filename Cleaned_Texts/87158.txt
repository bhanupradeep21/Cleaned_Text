drm paradigm procedure cognitive psychology used study false memory humans procedure pioneered james deese henry l roediger iii kathleen mcdermott extended line research paradigm became popular procedure typically involves oral presentation list related words eg bed rest awake tired dream wake snooze blanket doze slumber snore nap peace yawn drowsy requires subject remember many words list possible typical results show subjects recall related absent word eg sleep known lure frequency presented asked experience test half participants report sure remember hearing lure indicating false memory memory event never occurred simplicity paradigm ease drm studies conducted helped drm paradigm become popular among human memory researchers well researchers fields foundations drm paradigm developed james deese working johns hopkins university article prediction occurrence particular verbal intrusions immediate recall deese attempted better understand reciting previously learned list words people sometimes recall word never presented orally presented undergraduate students lists words strongly associated absent critical lure immediately list presented asked students recall items list found critical lure recalled time result varied different lists although words list associated critical lure deese found likelihood false recall depended heavily ability list words activate critical lure example deese claimed list containing short could produce recall lure man list containing man could produce recall lure research false memories tended rely experiences stories rather word lists frederic bartlett famously pioneered area research studies remembering using indian folktale war ghosts studies british college students learn indian folktale recall found performance decreased time also found time students remembered story manner increasingly followed british cultural although many researchers trouble replicating bartletts number researchers followed precedent using meaningful prose probe false memories leaving controlled method list learning underrepresented studies looked false memories word lists results robust tended show small little attention given deeses experiment early henry l roediger iii came across article decided explore findings roediger eventually offered project phd student kathleen mcdermott completed experiments part phd first roediger mcdermott replicated deeses research using six lists deeses study successful producing false recall roediger read lists words class students list asked recall many words possible list following recall sixth list students given penandpaper recognition memory test list words comprising studied unstudied items including critical lures students rated confident word appeared one previous lists results showed students recalled critical lure time confident critical lures actually appeared follow study roediger mcdermott conducted second experiment allowed better experimental control time created extra lists similar used deese except new lists items instead design manipulated minor ways major difference second experiment inclusion rememberknow judgement task task applied recognition test order determine whether subjects recognise item based memory based familiarity subjects first asked item one seen old one new items classified old subjects asked judge mentally relive experience item presented remember confident occurred without memory event know roediger mcdermott predicted subjects recalling absent word high sense familiarity induced presented lists would predominantly judge old critical lures known rather remembered prediction supported second experiment showed increase recall absent critical lures level marginally significantly greater actually presented words paired recognised critical lures judged remembered results show clear evidence subjects remembering events never robustness drm effect simplicity experimental methods welcomed area research small effects elaborate stimuli norm furthermore paradigm allowed researchers move past reliance recognition tests false memories recall tests better showing false memories recognition tests subjects required access recall memory full rather able rely sense familiarity roediger mcdermott able demonstrate robust effect using recall tests well recognition tests employing simple wordlist stimuli lastly perhaps importantly experiments able show subjects confidently recognised absent word consciously remembered lure appearing list rather relying feeling familiarity make old judgement roediger mcdermott quick point results could explained associative model presentation associated words could spread activation associative network absent lure word thus false recognition words could due residual activation model explains higher false recognition second experiment product activation spread due longer wordlists used theory parallels prototype theory claims presentation patterns match prototype activates increases recognition prototype even never terms roediger mcdermotts study prototype theory would suggest list words activate lure word prototype easily recognisable however fact subjects reported remembering presentation critical lure suggests sort explicit awareness lure presentation words explained prototype theory associative models memory supplement idea associative model roediger mcdermott suggest retrieval processes might play important role explaining drm phenomenon suggest simply recalling actual list words availability lure increases point mistaken presented word however research showed retrieval processes could account findings without also including encoding processes roediger colleagues later found providing subjects warning developing false memories effect presented recall phase experiment reduce false memories presented lists read attempts explaining phenomenon attributed sourcemonitoring error suggesting subjects could memory thinking lure reading list mistakenly attributing memory list presentation rather alternatively scholars claimed drm effect better explained discrepancyattribution hypothesis whereby surprise tested drives effect rather spreading activation although findings relate directly controversy roediger mcdermott assert results show individuals claim vivid memory event taken conclusive evidence event actually critics however argued drm paradigm reflect real life events nature stimuli setting study conducted critics like kathy pezdek shirley lam suggested inappropriate compare recognition word implantation memory entire childhood roediger mcdermott maintain use college students laboratory setting mundane stimuli strengthens point conditions promote accurate remembering yet false memories still drm paradigm easy use produces clear robust effect roediger mcdermott included full copies lists used paper paradigm become popular research tool help answer number questions false memory research using drm paradigm highly contested implications criminal justice system memory plays imperative role criminal proceedings evidence coming witnesses victims suspects interrogations much means reliability minimization false memories extreme studies conducted drm understand important relationships like correlation false memories varying stress levels understand effects high stress environment correlation false memories age understand reliability child although studies relate witness testimonial process used make broad claims criminal justice system overall ecological validity experiments low due specific nature replication task making difficult generalize findings researchers also proposed use drm lists investigating controversial issue recovered memories childhood sexual abuse studies shows individuals claiming recovered previously forgotten memories childhood sexual abuse likely falsely recall recognize critical lures individuals finding directly related selfreported traumatic experiences rather studies found fantasy proneness scored dissociative experiences scale des main factor rather selfreported similar study found individuals higher ptsd scores greater fearfulavoidant attachment tendencies showed less proficient memory monitoring childhood sexual abuse word lists future research approach topic scientists university missouri used drm paradigm look brain activity real false memories found evidence suggests different brain processes may underlie retrieval real false memories falsememory retrieval showing distinctly different patterns neural activity retrieval real work false memories conducted using drm paradigm including delving deeper methods memory recall five experiment study using different examples drm paradigms previous work researchers recorded data consistent dualretrieval processes free recall retrieval processes direct access retrieval detailed items verbatim memory reconstruction retrieval sense meaning gist memory also used understanding robust results drm tests reaffirm notion gist traces source false another important application drm paradigm examining paradigm shifts children adults studies show younger children lower rates false recall recognition likely due less developed semantic memory therefore lacking ability make connections outside word lists similarly another study found information processing differences encoding children adults result lower rate false recall among children due inability activate lexical connections word drm paradigm also used probe number psychological issues including stereotypes influence human thought process employed drug types impairments suffered patients paradigm successfully used stimuli including auditory
