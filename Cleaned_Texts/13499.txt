mouth ulcer aphtha ulcer occurs mucous membrane oral mouth ulcers common occurring association many diseases many different mechanisms usually serious underlying cause rarely mouth ulcer heal may sign oral cancer ulcers may form individually multiple ulcers may appear ie crop ulcers formed ulcer may maintained inflammation andor secondary infection two common causes oral ulceration local trauma eg rubbing sharp edge broken filling braces biting ones lip etc aphthous stomatitis canker sores condition characterized recurrent formation oral ulcers largely unknown reasons mouth ulcers often cause pain discomfort may alter persons choice food healing occurs eg avoiding acidic sugary salty spicy foods beverages ulcer ˈʌlsər latin ulcus ulcer break skin mucous membrane loss surface tissue disintegration necrosis epithelial mucosal ulcer ulcer specifically occurs mucous membrane ulcer tissue defect penetrated epithelialconnective tissue border base deep level submucosa even within muscle ulcer deeper breach epithelium compared erosion excoriation involves damage epithelium lamina erosion superficial breach epithelium little damage underlying lamina mucosal erosion erosion specifically occurs mucous membrane superficial epithelial cells epidermis mucosa lost lesion reach depth basement erosions heal without scar excoriation term sometimes used describe breach epithelium deeper erosion shallower ulcer type lesion tangential rete pegs shows punctiform small pinhead spots bleeding caused exposed capillary ulcers erosions result spectrum conditions including exact pathogenesis dependent upon cause simple mechanisms predispose mouth trauma ulceration xerostomia dry mouth saliva usually lubricates mucous membrane controls bacterial levels epithelial atrophy thinning eg radiotherapy making lining fragile easily stomatitis general term meaning inflammation within mouth often may associated pathologically mouth represents transition gastrointestinal tract skin meaning many gastrointestinal cutaneous conditions involve mouth conditions usually associated whole gastrointestinal tract may present mouth eg orofacial granulomatosisoral crohns similarly cutaneous skin conditions also involve mouth sometimes mouth sparing skin different environmental conditions saliva thinner mucosa trauma teeth food mean cutaneous disorders produce characteristic lesions skin produce nonspecific lesions vesicles bullae blistering mucocutaneous disorders progress quickly ulceration mouth moisture trauma food teeth high bacterial load mouth means ulcers may become secondarily infected cytotoxic drugs administered chemotherapy target cells fast turnovers malignant cells however epithelia mouth also high turnover rate makes oral ulceration mucositis common side effect chemotherapycitation needed erosions involve epithelial layer red appearance since underlying lamina propria shows full thickness epithelium penetrated ulceration lesion becomes covered fibrinous exudate takes yellowgrey color ulcer breach normal lining seen cross section lesion crater halo may present reddening surrounding mucosa caused inflammation may also edema swelling around ulcer chronic trauma may produce ulcer keratotic white thickened mucosa malignant lesions may ulcerate either tumor infiltrates mucosa adjacent tissues lesion originates within mucosa disorganized growth leads break normal architecture lining tissues repeat episodes mouth ulcers indicative immunodeficiency signaling low levels immunoglobulin oral mucous membranes chemotherapy hiv mononucleosis causes immunodeficiencyimmunosuppression oral ulcers may become common manifestation autoimmunity also cause oral ulceration mucous membrane pemphigoid autoimmune reaction epithelial basement membrane causes desquamationulceration oral mucosa numerous aphthous ulcers could indicative inflammatory autoimmune disease called behçets disease later involve skin lesions uveitis eyes vitamin c deficiency may lead scurvy impairs wound healing contribute ulcer detailed discussion pathophysiology aphthous stomatitis see aphthous stomatitiscauses diagnosis mouth ulcers usually consists medical history followed oral examination well examination involved area following details may pertinent duration lesion present location number ulcers size color whether hard touch bleeds rolled edge general rule mouth ulcer heal within weeks examined health care professional able rule oral cancer eg dentist oral physician oral surgeon maxillofacial previous ulcers healed makes cancer unlikely ulcer keeps forming site healing may caused nearby sharp surface ulcers heal recur different sites likely ras malignant ulcers likely single number conversely multiple ulcers unlikely oral cancer size ulcers may helpful distinguishing types ras location minor ras mainly occurs nonkeratinizing mucosa major ras occurs anywhere mouth oropharynx induration contact bleeding rolled margins features malignant ulcer may nearby causative factor eg broken tooth sharp edge traumatizing tissues otherwise person may asked problems elsewhere eg ulceration genital mucous eye lesions digestive problems swollen glands neck lymphadenopathy general unwell feelingcitation needed diagnosis comes mostly history examination following special investigations may involved blood tests vitamin deficiency anemia leukemia epsteinbarr virus hiv infection diabetes microbiological swabs infection urinalysis diabetes biopsy minor procedure cut small sample ulcer look microscope without immunofluorescence may required rule cancer also systemic disease ulcers caused local trauma painful touch sore usually irregular border erythematous margins base yellow healing progresses keratotic thickened white mucosa halo may due various factors saliva relative thinness oromucosa trauma teeth chewing etc vesicles bullae form mucous membranes oral cavity tend fragile quickly break leave ulcers aphthous stomatitis local trauma common causes oral ulceration many possible causes rare comparisoncitation needed mouth ulcers associated recurrent aphthous stomatitis caused local trauma mucous membrane lining mouth thinner skin easily damaged mechanical thermal heatcold chemical electrical means irradiationcitation needed common causes oral ulceration include rubbing sharp edges teeth fillings crowns false teeth dentures braces orthodontic appliances accidental biting caused lack awareness painful stimuli mouth eg following local anesthetic used dental treatment person becomes aware anesthetic wears offcitation needed eating hard foods eg potato chips damage lining mouth people cause damage inside mouths either absentminded habit type deliberate selfharm factitious ulceration examples include biting cheek tongue lips rubbing fingernail pen toothpick inside mouth tearing subsequent ulceration upper labial frenum may sign child abuse nonaccidental iatrogenic ulceration also occur dental treatment incidental abrasions soft tissues mouth common dentists apply protective layer petroleum jelly lips carrying dental work minimize thiscitation needed lingual frenum also vulnerable ulceration repeated friction oral sexual activity cunnilingus rarely infants ulcerate tongue lower lip teeth termed rigafede thermal burns usually result placing hot food beverages mouth may occur eat drink local anesthetic worn normal painful sensation absent burn may occur microwave ovens sometimes produce food cold externally hot internally led rise frequency intraoral thermal burns thermal food burns usually palate posterior buccal mucosa appear zones erythema ulceration necrotic epithelium peripherally electrical burns commonly affect oral commissure corner mouth lesions usually initially painless charred yellow little bleeding swelling develops fourth day following burn area becomes necrotic epithelium sloughs electrical burns mouth usually caused chewing live electrical wiring act relatively common among young children saliva acts conducting medium electrical arc flows electrical source tissues causing extreme heat possible tissue caustic chemicals may cause ulceration oral mucosa strongenough concentration contact sufficient length time holding medication mouth instead swallowing occurs mostly children psychiatric care simply lack understanding holding aspirin tablet next painful tooth attempt relieve pulpitis toothache common leads epithelial necrosis chewable aspirin tablets swallowed residue quickly cleared mouthcitation needed caustic medications include eugenol chlorpromazine hydrogen peroxide used treat gum disease also capable causing epithelial necrosis concentrations silver nitrate sometimes used pain relief aphthous ulceration acts chemical cauterant destroys nerve endings mucosal damage increased phenol used dental treatment cavity sterilizing agent cauterizing material also present overthecounter agents intended treat aphthous ulcerations mucosal necrosis reported occur concentrations materials used endodontics also caustic part reason use rubber dam result radiotherapy mouth radiationinduced stomatitis may develop associated mucosal erosions ulceration salivary glands irradiated may also xerostomia dry mouth making oral mucosa vulnerable frictional damage lubricating function saliva lost mucosal atrophy thinning makes breach epithelium likely radiation bones jaws causes damage osteocytes impairs blood supply affected hard tissues become hypovascular reduced number blood vessels hypocellular reduced number cells hypoxic low levels oxygen osteoradionecrosis term area irradiated bone heal damage usually occurs mandible causes chronic pain surface ulceration sometimes resulting nonhealing bone exposed soft tissue defect prevention osteradionecrosis part reason teeth questionable prognosis removed start course aphthous stomatitis also termed recurrent aphthous stomatitis ras commonly called canker sores common cause oral ulceration general population noncontagious condition three types aphthous stomatitis exists based appearance namely minor major herpetiform major aphthous ulceration minor aphthous ulceration common type presenting small diameter roundoval ulcers yellowgrey color erythematous red halo ulcers heal permanent scarring days ulcers recur intervals months major aphthous ulceration less common minor type produces severe lesions symptoms major aphthous ulceration presents larger cm diameter ulcers take much longer heal days may leave scarring minor major subtypes aphthous stomatitis usually produce lesions nonkeratinized oral mucosa ie inside cheeks lips underneath tongue floor mouth less commonly major aphthous ulcers may occur parts mouth keratinized mucosal surfaces least common type herpetiform ulceration named condition resembles primary herpetic gingivostomatitis herpetiform ulcers begin small blisters vesicles break sized ulcers herpetiform ulcers appear crops sometimes hundreds number coalesce form larger areas ulceration subtype may cause extreme pain heals scarring may recur frequentlycitation needed exact cause aphthous stomatitis unknown may genetic predisposition people possible causes include hematinic deficiency folate vitamin b iron stopping smoking stress menstruation trauma food allergies hypersensitivity sodium lauryl sulphate found many brands toothpaste aphthous stomatitis clinically detectable signs symptoms outside mouth recurrent ulceration cause much discomfort affected treatment aimed reducing pain swelling speeding healing may involve systemic topical steroids analgesics pain killers antiseptics antiinflammatories barrier pastes protect raw many infections cause oral ulceration see table common herpes simplex virus herpes labialis primary herpetic gingivostomatitis varicella zoster chicken pox shingles coxsackie virus hand foot mouth disease human immunodeficiency virus hiv creates immunodeficiencies allow opportunistic infections neoplasms proliferate bacterial processes leading ulceration caused mycobacterium tuberculosis tuberculosis treponema pallidum syphiliscitation needed opportunistic activity combinations otherwise normal bacterial flora aerobic streptococci neisseria actinomyces spirochetes bacteroides species prolong ulcerative process fungal causes include coccidioides immitis valley fever cryptococcus neoformans cryptococcosis blastomyces dermatitidis north american entamoeba histolytica parasitic protozoan sometimes known cause mouth ulcers formation cystscitation needed epsteinbarr viruspositive mucocutaneous ulcer rare form epsteinbarr virusassociated lymphoproliferative diseases infiltrating epsteinbarr virus ie ebvinfected b cells cause solitary wellcircumscribed ulcers mucous membranes many drugs cause mouth ulcers side effect common examples bisphosphonate commonly prescribed osteoporosis cytotoxic drugs eg methotrexate ie chemotherapy nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may prescribed angina propylthiouracil eg used hyperthyroidism recreational drugs cause ulceration eg rarely persistent nonhealing mouth ulcer may cancerous lesion malignancies mouth usually carcinomas lymphomas sarcomas others may also possible either tumor arises mouth may grow involve mouth eg maxillary sinus salivary glands nasal cavity perioral skin common type oral cancer squamous cell carcinoma main risk factors longterm smoking alcohol consumption particularly combined betel use common sites oral cancer lower lip floor mouth sides underside tongue mandibular alveolar ridge possible tumor anywhere mouth appearances vary greatly typical malignant ulcer would persistent expanding lesion totally red erythroplasia speckled red white erythroleukoplakia malignant lesions also typically feel indurated hardened attached adjacent structures rolled margins punched appearance bleeds easily gentle someone unexplained mouth ulcer persisting weeks may indicate need referral gdp gp hospital exclude oral viral infections mentioned also classified vesiculobullous diseases example vesiculobullous diseases include pemphigus vulgaris mucous membrane pemphigoid bullous pemphigoid dermatitis herpetiformis linear iga disease epidermolysis rarely allergic reactions mouth lips may manifest erosions however reactions usually produce frank ulceration example one common allergen balsam peru individuals allergic substance oral exposure may experience stomatitis cheilitis inflammation rash painful erosion lips oropharyngeal mucosa angles balsam peru
