developmental coordination disorder dcd also known developmental motor coordination disorder developmental dyspraxia simply dyspraxia ancient greek praxis activity neurodevelopmental disorder characterized impaired coordination physical movements result brain messages accurately transmitted body deficits fine gross motor skills movements interfere activities daily living often described disorder skill acquisition learning execution coordinated motor skills substantially expected given individuals chronological age difficulties may present clumsiness slowness inaccuracy performance motor skills eg catching objects using cutlery handwriting riding bike use tools participating team sports swimming also often accompanied difficulty organisation andor problems attention working

difficulties cause significant persistent limitations functioning eg activities daily living school work vocational leisure activities difficulties coordinated motor skills solely attributable disease

coordinated motor skills substantially expected given individuals chronological various areas development affected dcd may persist children dcd may exhibit delays early development sitting crawling walking poor ability difficulties childhood activities running jumping hopping catching sports swimming slowness frequent tripping bruising poor handwriting skills difficulties self care difficulties skills using cutlery tying shoelaces poor spatial understanding difficulty following instructions poor time management often losing adulthood addition childhood history condition may manifest difficulty learning new motor skills applying skills different busy environment poor organisation time management skills missed deadlines lateness appointments earliness coping strategy awkward pauses answering conversation often history underachievement education workplace although skills acquired neat handwriting handwriting speed much lower evidence research clinical practice indicates dcd physical disorder may deficits executive functions behavioural organisation emotional regulation extend beyond motor impairments independent diagnoses addition physical motor impairments developmental coordination disorder associated problems memory especially working typically results difficulty remembering instructions difficulty organizing ones time remembering deadlines increased propensity lose things problems carrying tasks require remembering several steps sequence cooking whilst general population experience problems extent much significant impact lives dyspraxic however many dyspraxics excellent longterm memories despite poor shortterm many dyspraxic people benefit working structured environment repeating routine minimises difficulty timemanagement allows commit procedures longterm memory people developmental coordination disorder sometimes difficulty moderating amount sensory information body constantly sending result dyspraxic people may prone sensory overload panic moderate extreme difficulty physical tasks experienced people dyspraxia fatigue common much energy expended trying execute physical movements correctly dyspraxic people hypotonia low muscle tone also detrimentally affect whole body movement motor coordination issues mean major developmental targets including walking running climbing jumping affected difficulties vary person person
