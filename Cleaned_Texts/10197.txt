timeline human evolution outlines major events evolutionary lineage modern human species homo sapiens throughout history life beginning billion years ago recent evolution within h sapiens since last glacial period includes brief explanations various taxonomic ranks human lineage timeline reflects mainstream views modern taxonomy based principle phylogenetic nomenclature cases open questions clear
