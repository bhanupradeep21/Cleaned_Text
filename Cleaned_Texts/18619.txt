wolfram syndrome also called didmoad diabetes insipidus diabetes mellitus optic atrophy deafness rare autosomalrecessive genetic disorder causes childhoodonset diabetes mellitus optic atrophy deafness well various possible disorders including first described four siblings dr j wolfram disease affects central nervous system especially brainstem wolfram syndrome initially thought caused mitochondrial dysfunction due symptoms several reports mitochondrial mutations however established wolfram syndrome caused endoplasmic reticulum two genetic forms described wolfram syndrome wolfram syndrome wolframin provides instructions making wolframin protein gene active cells throughout body strong activity heart brain lungs inner ear pancreas pancreas provides enzymes help digest food also produces hormone insulin insulin controls much glucose type sugar passed blood cells conversion energycitation needed within cells wolframin located structure called endoplasmic reticulum among many activities endoplasmic reticulum folds modifies newly formed proteins correct shape function properly endoplasmic reticulum also helps transport proteins fats materials specific sites within cell cell surface function wolframin unknown based location endoplasmic reticulum however may play role protein folding cellular transport pancreas wolframin may help fold protein precursor insulin called proinsulin mature hormone controls blood glucose levels research findings also suggest wolframin may help maintain correct cellular level charged calcium atoms calcium ions controlling much stored endoplasmic reticulum inner ear wolframin may help maintain proper levels calcium ions charged particles essential hearingcitation needed mutations identified individuals form nonsyndromic deafness hearing loss without related signs symptoms affecting parts body called individuals deafness hear low tones lowfrequency sounds tuba moon hearing loss unlike forms nonsyndromic deafness affect high tones highfrequency sounds birds chirping frequencies sound mutations replace one protein building blocks amino acids used make wolframin incorrect amino acid one mutation deletes amino acid wolframin mutations probably alter shape wolframin could affect function function wolframin unknown however unclear mutations cause hearing loss researchers suggest altered wolframin disturbs balance charged particles inner ear interferes hearing processcitation needed mutations gene cause wolfram syndrome also known acronym didmoad syndrome characterised childhoodonset diabetes mellitus dm results improper control glucose due lack insulin gradual loss vision caused optic atrophy oa nerve connects eye brain wastes away deafness syndrome sometimes cause diabetes insipidus di condition kidneys conserve water complications affect bladder nervous system may also occur researchers identified mutations cause wolfram syndrome mutations delete insert dna gene result little wolframin present cells mutations replace one protein building blocks amino acids used make wolframin incorrect amino acid mutations appear reduce wolframin activity dramatically researchers suggest loss wolframin disrupts production insulin leads poor glucose control diabetes mellitus unclear mutations lead features wolfram syndromecitation needed dysfunction gene cause patients past medical history help diagnosis may indicate symptoms diabetes mellitus developing vision loss blood tests assist diagnosis determine systems within body affected mri scans also help diagnose determine level damage brain body systemscitation needed known direct treatment current treatment efforts focus managing complications wolfram syndrome diabetes mellitus diabetes however number symptoms managed improve quality life include insulin diabetes alongside medications desmopressin treat diabetes insipidus antibiotics uti hearing aids cochlear implants hearing loss supportive aids visual loss magnifying glasses new treatment advances include research evaluating er calcium stabilizers repurposed drugssmall molecules reduce er stress reduce apoptosis thus slowing progression wolfram syndromecitation needed three tiered approach toward treatment wolfram syndrome includes stopping disease progression protecting regrowing remaining tissue replacing repairing pathogenic first symptom typically diabetes mellitus usually diagnosed around age next symptom appear often optic atrophy wasting optic nerves around age first signs loss colour vision peripheral vision condition worsens time people optic atrophy usually blind within years first life expectancy people suffering syndrome recent advances research occurred toward establishing treatment slow progression wolfram syndrome search er calcium stabilizer molecular prosthetic ongoing endoplasmic reticulum er calcium levels lower patients wolfram syndrome leading cell dysfunction death dantrolene sodium currently investigation determine delay progression wolfram er stress caused expression mutant wolframin protein ultimately result cell death apoptosis research currently underway evaluate several possible repurposed drugs small molecules reduce er stress wolfram syndrome slow progression disease sodium valproate currently investigation determine slow progression wolfram httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwolframsyndrome
