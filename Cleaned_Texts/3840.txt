psychology visual capture dominance vision sense modalities creating process visual senses influence parts somatosensory system result perceived environment congruent actual stimuli phenomenon visual system able disregard information different sensory system conveying provide logical explanation whatever output environment provides visual capture allows one interpret location sound well sensation touch without actually relying stimuli rather creating output allows individual perceive coherent environment one example visual capture known ventriloquism effect refers perception speech sounds coming direction true direction due influence visual stimuli apparent thus ventriloquism illusion occurs speakers voice visually captured location dummys moving mouth rather speakers carefully unmoving another example visual capture occurs sound would normally perceived moving left right heard person viewing visual stimulus moving right left case sound stimulus appear moving right two sensory stimuli presented simultaneously vision capable dominating capturing occurs visual cues distract sensations causing origin stimulus appear produced visual cue therefore individual environment multiple stimuli reach brain hierarchy vision guide rest somatosensory cues perceived though align visual experience despite original source may research found visual auditory reflexive spatial orienting controlled common underlying neural furthermore studies shown vision effect cognitive neuroscience provides significant effect visually attended dominance seen visualhaptic task vision capable making better judgements object physically touching also determined certain amounts visual capture occur depending task sometimes allowing visual system entirely dominant others provide haptic cues thalamus section brain responsible relaying sensory motor signals cerebral cortex stimuli pass thalamus specific regions dedicated sense therefore able sort multiple parts environment individual experiences given moment two regions specific vision hearing respectively may responsible order sensory information coded perceived within cerebral cortexcitation needed retina back eye perceives stimuli allowing travel occipital tract lateral geniculate nucleus lgn within thalamus data transmitted occipital lobe orientation recognizable factors processedcitation needed lgn located near medial geniculate nucleus mgn responsible organizing auditory stimuli one hears specific sound two systems closely located research shown might vision responsible taking perception environment resulting visual capture multiple senses organized response sent brain processing possible visual cues recorded stronger therefore everything perceived way senses function visual cue resulting cohesive experience individual driven visual system therefore fitting definition visual capturecitation needed phenomenon first demonstrated frenchman j tastevin studying tactile aristotle illusion illusion produces sensation touching two objects crossing ones fingers holding spherical object visual capture used explain vision could overcome effect determine actually going attention tied visual cues experiment conducted michael posner indicating visually direction stimulus appear response time improve decrease correct direction attended conversely indicator misleading response time increases ability attend specific direction allows faster reaction time despite participant physically shifting visual focus prestimulus indicator evidence vision impact reaction time demonstrates vision neurological effect attentional processcitation needed thus clear vision capable manipulating perception individual environment perceptual manipulation tastevin considered visual capturecitation needed number studies demonstrated visual capture effect example alais burr using ventriloquism effect found vision capable taking auditory senses specifically welllocalized visual means stimuli producing sound well vision close together seems direct relationship formed perception separate stimuli correlate another example visual capture comes ehrsson spense passingham used rubber hand prove vision capable determining senses react participants watched rubber hand stroked hand also stroked similar fashion allowing individual attribute sensation watching rather happening body therefore rubber hand manipulated example hitting hammer participant feels immediate shock pain fear hand danger serves evidence visual system capable manipulating individual perceives another sense coming actually manipulate one reacts experience well given vision taking study remington johnston yantis found attention involuntarily drawn away given task visual stimulus interferes study participants presented four boxes told image would precede letter memorize conditions either attend box different one four focus center however even though told attend certain box participant consistently drawn image letter cases resulting longer response time conditions except results prove consistent need vision dominate senses attention immediately drawn away controlled research visual capture work favor vision constantly dominant shams kamitani shimojo found visual illusion induced sound controlled environment flash light accompanied series auditory beeps results show participant views flash series flashes corresponding beeps experiment hearing seemed dominant sense clear still plenty determined visual capture although like studies proves connection two senses comes integrating perception example visual capture experienced daily life ventriloquism ventriloquists make speech appear coming puppet rather mouths situation visual capture allows audio stimuli controlled vision system produce congruent experience sound coming puppet another popular example visual capture happens watching movie theater sound appears coming actors lips although may seem true sound actually coming speakers often spread across theater rather directly behind wherever characters mouth may also phenomenon known crossing street individual hear sound oncoming car however look left next car blocks away safe cross look right car passing even notice occurs individual attributes sound oncoming traffic first car unaware closer car therefore example visual capture reassigning audio cue incorrect visual cue resulting mistake could far costly expectedcitation needed phantom limb sensation amputated limb still attached cause pain distress amongst many amputees thought incurable however vilayanur ramachandran created mirror box allows amputee place intact limb one side box observe amputated limb looking mirror image actual visual capture visual system able override somatosensory system send feedback brain arm actually okay specific pain resulted numerous solutions problems individuals phantom limb pain could train brain via visual capture limb actually cramped position amputated rather free move around act normal limb mcgurk effect phenomenon occurs reception auditory stimulus determined visual system example syllable ba repeated one sees individual saying individual perceived saying ba however audio played person saying word fa fact utterance completely forgotten person hear word fa vision able dominate auditory system produce response guided strictly vision auditory system silenced visual capture evident visual system able reorganize environmental stimuli produce cohesive explanation would make sense combining different understanding visual capture potential lead numerous benefits future beyond solving peoples pain phantom limb syndrome numerous potential applications visual capture already surroundsound systems built provide unique listening experiences put right middle action however sound come every direction improvements visual quality movies sound vision localized best provide coherent moviegoing experiencecitation needed
