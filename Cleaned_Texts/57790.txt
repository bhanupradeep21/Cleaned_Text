breast cancer management takes different approaches depending physical biological characteristics disease well age overall health personal preferences patient treatment types classified local therapy surgery radiotherapy systemic treatment chemo endocrine targeted therapies local therapy efficacious early stage breast cancer systemic therapy generally justified advanced metastatic disease diseases specific phenotypes historically breast cancer treated radical surgery alone advances understanding natural course breast cancer well development systemic therapies allowed use breastconserving surgeries however nomenclature viewing nonsurgical management viewpoint definitive surgery lends two adjectives connected treatment timelines adjuvant surgery neoadjuvant surgery mainstay breast cancer management surgery local regional tumor followed preceded combination chemotherapy radiotherapy endocrine hormone therapy targeted therapy research ongoing use immunotherapy breast cancer

requiring removal part pectoralis major muscle main muscle anterior chest wall operation lymph nodes axilla also considered removal past large axillary operations took nodes establish whether cancer spread unfortunate side effect frequently causing lymphedema arm side removal many lymph nodes affected lymphatic drainage recently technique sentinel lymph node sln dissection become popular requires

prophylactically breast reconstruction surgery rebuilding breast breast cancer surgery included holistic approaches cancer management address identity emotional aspects disease reconstruction take place time cancerremoving surgery months years later women decide reconstruction opt prosthesis instead cryoablation experimental therapy available women small earlystage breast cancer treatment freezes defrosts tumors using small needles harmful tissue damaged ultimately technique may provide alternative invasive surgeries potentially limiting side radiation therapy adjuvant treatment women undergone lumpectomy women mastectomy surgery cases purpose radiation reduce chance cancer recur locally within breast axilla radiation therapy involves using highenergy xrays gamma rays target tumor post surgery tumor site radiation effective killing cancer cells may remain surgery recur tumor removed radiation therapy delivered external beam radiotherapy brachytherapy internal radiotherapy intraoperative radiotherapy iort case external beam radiotherapy xrays delivered outside body machine called linear accelerator linac contrast brachytherapy involves precise placement radiation sources directly treatment site iort includes onetime dose radiation administered breast surgery radiation therapy important use breastconserving therapy reduces risk local recurrence radiation therapy eliminates microscopic cancer cells may remain near area tumor surgically removed dose radiation must strong enough ensure elimination cancer cells however radiation affects normal cells cancer cells alike causing damage normal tissue around tumor healthy tissue repair cancer cells repair well normal cells reason radiation treatments given extended period enabling healthy tissue heal treatments using external beam radiotherapy typically given period five seven weeks performed five days week recent large trials uk start canadian confirmed shorter treatment courses typically three four weeks result equivalent cancer control side effects protracted treatment schedules treatment takes minutes newer approach called accelerated partial breast irradiation apbi uses brachytherapy deliver radiation much shorter period time apbi delivers radiation immediate region surrounding original typically completed course one radiation treatment mainly effective reducing risk local relapse affected breast therefore recommended cases breast conserving surgeries less frequently mastectomy indications radiation treatment constantly evolving patients treated europe likely past recommended adjuvant radiation breast cancer surgery compared patients north america radiation therapy usually recommended patients lumpectomy quadrantresection radiation therapy usually indicated patients advanced stage iv disease except palliation symptoms like bone pain fungating lesions general recommendations would include radiation factors may influence adding adjuvant radiation therapy radiotherapy delivered many ways commonly produced linear accelerator usually involves treating whole breast case breast lumpectomy whole chest wall case mastectomy lumpectomy patients earlystage breast cancer may eligible newer shorter form treatment called breast brachytherapy approach allows physicians treat part breast order spare healthy tissue unnecessary radiation improvements computers treatment delivery technology led complex radiotherapy treatment options one new technology using imrt intensity modulated radiation therapy change shape intensity radiation beam making beamlets different points across inside breast allows better dose distribution within breast minimizing dose healthy organs lung however yet demonstrated difference treatment outcomes tumor recurrence level side effects imrt breast cancer compared conventional radiotherapy treatment addition conventional radiotherapy also deliver similar dose distributions utilizing modern computer dosimetry planning equipment external beam radiation therapy treatments breast cancer typically given every day five days week five within past decade new approach called accelerated partial breast irradiation apbi gained popularity apbi used deliver radiation part breast conservation therapy treats area tumor surgically removed plus adjacent tissue apbi reduces length treatment five days compared typical six
