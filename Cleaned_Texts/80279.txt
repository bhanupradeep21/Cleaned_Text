chordotonal organs stretch receptor organs found insects located made clusters scolopidia either directly indirectly connect two joints sense movements relative one another extero proprioceptive functions example sensing auditory stimuli leg word coined vitus graber though interpreted stretched two points like string sensing vibrations chordotonal organs composed single scolopidium single sensory bipolar neuron tympanal ear notodontid moth several thousand scolopidia equipped four sensory neurons mosquito johnstons bipolar sensory neurons apical dendritic structure cilium densely packed microtubules surrounded two specialized cells scolopale cell attachment cap cell plus glial mechanically gated ion channels located distal ciliary dilation characteristic part upper dendritic cilium cavity scolopale cell sensory neuron filled specialized receptor lymph similar endolymph surrounds mechanosensory hair bundles cochlear hair cells high potassium low dendritic cilia one two

may confer different viscoelastic properties sensory chordotonal organ individual sensory neurons respond different types mechanosensory stimuli example sound vs gravity respond particular stimulus different tuning properties example tuned different position one way generate functional diversity sensory neurons different types mechanosensory channels intrinsic properties example johnstons organ drosophila melanogaster sensory neurons detect sound may express nompc ion channel belongs transient receptor potential trp superfamily detect gravity may express another member trp channel another way generate functional diversity sensory neurons attached joint different types connections example femoral chordotonal organ locust ligament sensory neurons embedded divided several strands sequentially pulled joint flexed providing mechanism differential activation sensory neurons different position femoral chordotonal organ located femur insect leg detects position speed acceleration
