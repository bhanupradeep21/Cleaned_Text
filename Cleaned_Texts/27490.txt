upper airway resistance syndrome uars sleep disorder characterized narrowing airway cause disruptions symptoms include unrefreshing sleep fatigue sleepiness chronic insomnia difficulty concentrating uars diagnosed polysomnograms capable detecting respiratory effortrelated arousals treated lifestyle changes orthodontics surgery cpap uars considered variant sleep although scientists doctors believe distinct upper airway resistance syndrome first recognized stanford university late article described name along relationship obstructive sleep apnea published guilleminault et symptoms uars similar obstructive sleep apnea inherently overlapping fatigue insomnia daytime sleepiness unrefreshing sleep anxiety frequent awakenings sleep common symptoms oxygen desaturation minimal absent uars minimum oxygen saturation many patients experience chronic insomnia creates difficulty falling asleep staying asleep result patients typically experience frequent sleep patients uars snore patients experience hypotension may cause lightheadedness patients uars also likely experience headaches irritable bowel predisposing factors include high narrow hard palate abnormally small intermolar distance abnormal overjet greater equal millimeters thin soft palatal mucosa short uvula subjects history early extraction absence wisdom teeth increased prevalence uars east upper airway resistance syndrome caused upper airway narrows without closing consequently airflow either reduced compensated increase inspiratory efforts increased activity inspiratory muscles leads arousals sleep patients may may aware

apneas hypopneas occur patients intact nerves able dilate genioglossus muscle key compensatory mechanism utilized presence airway obstruction damages nerves definitively known hypothesized caused long term effects gastroesophageal reflux andor uars diagnosed using respiratory disturbance index rdi patient considered uars apneahypopnea index ahi less rdi greater equal unlike apneahypopnea index respiratory disturbance index includes respiratory effortrelated arousals rdi ahi rera definition sleep apnea changed include patients uars using rdi determine sleep apnea severity diagnosis uars based findings polysomnogram polysomnograms uars patient apneas hypopneas many respiratory effortrelated arousals reras periods increased respiratory effort lasting ten seconds ending arousal whether event classified rera hypopnea depends definition hypopnea used sleep american academy sleep medicine currently recognizes two definitions scoring respiratory effortrelated arousals currently designated optional aasm thus many patients receive sleep studies may receive negative result even based symptoms patients commonly misdiagnosed idiopathic insomnia idiopathic hypersomnia chronic fatigue syndrome fibromyalgia psychiatric disorder adhd studies found children uars frequently misdiagnosed adhd one study found uars osa present children studies show symptoms adhd caused uars significantly improve remit treatment surgically treated behavioral modifications include getting least hours sleep various lifestyle changes positional sleeping ones side rather supine position using positional pillows provide relief modifications may sufficient treat severe avoiding sedatives including alcohol narcotics help prevent relaxation airway muscles thereby reduce chance collapse avoiding sedatives may also help reduce nasal steroids may prescribed order ease nasal allergies obstructive nasal conditions could cause left untreated uars develop obstructive sleep apnea treatments osa positive airway pressure therapy effective stopping progression airway pressure therapy similar obstructive sleep apnea works stenting airway open pressure thus reducing airway resistance use cpap help ease symptoms uars therapeutic trials shown using cpap pressure four eight centimeters water help reduce number arousals improve cpaps promising treatment uars effectiveness reduced low patient oral appliances protrude tongue lower jaw forward used reduce sleep apnea snoring hold potential treating uars approach remains oral appliances may suitable alternative patients tolerate nasal
