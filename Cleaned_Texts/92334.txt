bobblehead doll syndrome rare neurological movement disorder patients usually children around age begin bob head shoulders forward back sometimes sidetoside involuntarily manner reminiscent bobblehead doll syndrome related cystic lesions swelling third ventricle brain symptoms bobblehead doll syndrome diverse including physical neurological common form treatment surgical implanting shunt relieve swelling bobblehead doll syndrome first reported movement disorder patients however performing several tests scans brain characteristic movement found neurological origincitation needed main physical symptom bobblehead doll syndrome obvious diagnose involves two three bobs per second head sometimes also include shoulders upper torso patient unaware movements unable control unless directed stop given simple mental tasks basic arithmetic spelling words however task completed patient bobbing tends resume minute thus bobbing described doctors volitional able stopped making conscious bobbing also disappears patient asleep common feature movement disorderscitation needed supplemental symptom head bobbing presence ataxia several patients reported difficulty walking running climbing steps bobbing likely constant bobbing interrupted patients ability balance requires input several sources including vestibular ocular somatosensory motor systems although nature movements physical source neurological generally stemming dysfunction parts nervous system control motor functioncitation needed typical symptom patients diagnosed bobblehead doll syndrome enlargement head due accumulation cerebrospinal fluid third ventricle dilatation impairs communication ventricles well function surrounding quite often swelling present along cystic lesions third ventricle surrounding periventricular structures reference bobblehead doll syndrome third ventricular cystic lesion causes obstruction foramina monro communicates lateral ventricles proximal cerebral aqueduct sylvius communicates fourth ventricle also reported caused cystic choroid plexus papilloma third ventricle obstructive hydrocephalus blockage thought produce characteristic bobblehead patients seen onset bobblehead doll syndrome presence suprasellar cyst arachnoid mater meninges obstructs foramen susceptible acquiring bobblehead doll syndrome range newborns oldest reported patient years however majority cases involve children yet reach pubertycitation needed although exact pathogenesis bobblehead doll syndrome still unknown many theories theories acknowledge striking similarity symptoms bobblehead doll syndrome movement disorderscitation needed presence cystic lesions causing swelling third ventricle common feature patients dilatation causes pressure applied surrounding structures third ventricle diencephalon possible back forth movement fluid within cyst causes rhythmic pressure diencephalic motor one key periventricular structures pathway thalamus responsible relaying motor signals cerebral cortex well regulating consciousness sleep alertness disappearance head movements asleep implies origin may lie within extrapyramidal system part motor system controls coordination movement tracts associated extrapyramidal system controlled various structures central nervous system cerebellum basal ganglia basal ganglia plays large part controlling motor function thus abnormalities system result movement disorders parkinsons disease dyskinesia share commonalities bobblehead doll ticlike movements swelling third ventricle associated bobblehead doll syndrome similar movement disorders caused diseases corpus callosum aforementioned basal ganglia swelling added pressure applied formations causing basic functions disturbed pneumoencephalographic studies patients parkinsons huntingtons dystonia musculorum deformans discovered along patients bobblehead doll syndrome statistically significant swelling third ventricle existed thus researchers believe connection bobblehead doll syndrome movement disorders movements caused particular lesion rather hindrance multiple neuronal structures pathways case bobblehead doll syndrome disturbance related structures proximal third research conducted order find neurophysiologic basis bobblehead doll syndrome connection movement disorders rare occurrence disorder progress another theory exists behind cause bobblehead doll syndrome states constant head movements create temporary relief intraventricular obstruction shifting cyst foramina reduction cyst size points fact bobbing may learned behavior way relieve symptoms several methods exist diagnosing patient bobblehead doll syndrome involve brain scans look swelling use cisternography observe obstruction cerebrospinal fluid csf flow among ventriclescitation needed order try investigate flow dynamics cerebrospinal fluid doctors utilize cisternography injects radiolabeled substance csf via lumbar puncture csf flow tracked taking pictures incremental times however cisternography declining use physicians opting use mri instead assess csf cerebrospinal fluid flow important diagnosing bobblehead doll syndrome disturbances csf dynamics contributed blockages connections ventricles foramen aqueducts blockages telltale signs cyst present also csf flow freely begin accumulate leading hydrocephalus csf secreted choroid plexuses located roofs ventricles travelling ventricle csf leaves fourth ventricle flows around brain stem cerebellum hemispheres finally subarachnoid space complete cycle csf moves back basal cisternae start patients bobblehead doll syndrome impairment exists ability reabsorb csf arachnoid granulations leading presently doctors utilize magnetic resonance imaging get image affected area swelling exists third ventricle along cystic lesions accompanied characteristic head bobbing diagnosis bobblehead doll syndrome likely doctor propose available treatment options listed bobblehead doll syndrome precise classification major medical catalogs rarity complexity although movement disorder caused neuronal obstruction ventricle communication thus grouped hydrocephalus world health organizations international classification diseases icd needed single cure exists bobblehead doll syndrome caused several compounding disorders however times surgery fully resolve movement disorder successful surgical procedures include surgical removal lesion insertion ventriculoperitoneal shunt ventriculocisternostomycitation needed case choroid plexus papilloma surgical removal cystcontaining lesion within third ventricle caused full recovery mobile nature cystic lesion led intermittent obstruction foramen monro proximal aqueduct producing bobblehead symptoms removed symptoms often doctors implant shunt reduce intracranial pressure caused accumulation csf third ventricle typically succeed restricting swelling allowing proper flow csf relief head bobbing disappear bobblehead doll syndrome longer however one case year shunt placement patient switched forwardback bobbing sidetoside swaying discernible reasoning switch found hypothesis emerged case cerebellar malformations cause bobblehead doll suprasellar arachnoid cysts discovered endoscopic ventriculocystocisternostomy optimal treatment option fenestrating opening cystic membrane removing fluid obstructions aqueduct resolved patients receiving treatment full recovery common although surgery agreed upon primary treatment option patients bobblehead doll syndrome surgical treatment reported completely remove symptoms half cases reason stems late diagnoses significantly decrease hope full recovery lead permanent profound obstructive thus prognosis depends upon time elapsed first signs disorder time surgical treatment early diagnosis treatment highly important successful treatment bobblehead doll rarity syndrome since cases reported cases average onset head bobbing years months old surgical intervention occurred average age years httpsenwikipediaorgwikibobbleheaddollsyndrome
