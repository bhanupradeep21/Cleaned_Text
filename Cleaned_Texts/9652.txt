reproductive system gastropods slugs snails varies greatly one group another within large diverse taxonomic class animals reproductive strategies also vary greatly see mating gastropods many marine gastropods separate sexes male female terrestrial gastropods however hermaphroditescitation needed courtship part behaviour mating gastropods families pulmonate land snails one unusual feature reproductive system reproductive behavior creation utilization love darts throwing identified form sexual gastropods defined snails slugs belonging larger group called gastropods unique reproductive systems varying significantly one taxonomic group another separated three categories marine freshwater reproducing marine freshwater environments makes getting sperm egg much easier gastropods land much difficult get sperm majority gastropods internal fertilization prosobranch species external gastropods capable either male female hermaphrodites makes reproduction system unique amongst many invertebrates hermaphroditic gastropods possess egg sperm gametes gives opportunity c obtusus snail species eastern alps easternmost populations species strong evidence selfing reproductive system marine gastropods class opisthobranchia order archaeogastropoda class prosobranchia continuous cycle alternating male female reproductive role prevalence immediately spawning late summer predominance female reproductive functions terminated gametogenesis initiates immediately start predominance male reproductive role gametes remain gonads throughout winter early spring female reproductive role takes may fertilization gametes form zygotes cycle comes full circle late summer needed many taxonomic groups marine gastropods separate sexes ie dioeciousgonochoric main gastropod clades great majority species separate sexes true patellogastropoda vetigastropoda cocculiniformia neritimorpha caenogastropoda within clade littorinimorpha however superfamily calyptraeoidea protandrous sequential hermaphrodites protandry means individuals first become male later become female see example genus crepidula within main clade heterobranchia informal group opisthobranchia simultaneous hermaphrodites sets reproductive organs within one individual time also marine pulmonates also hermaphroditic example see airbreathing sea slug family onchidiidae family airbreathing marine limpets siphonariidae although land snails pulmonates hermaphrodites contrast seadwelling prosobranch snails dioeciousgonochoric words separate sexes includes snails families pomatiidae aciculidae cyclophoridae others land snails opercula helps identify winkles gone ashore words snails within clade littorinimorpha informal group architaenioglossa members snail family pulmonata includes carboniferous land sails freshwater snails order basommatophora protandrous hermaphrodites meaning born male later life become female family snails male phase ends december followed egg maturation

reproductive system strictly hermaphroditic gonads hermaphrodite duct duct designed transport sperm eggs leads portion reproductive tract duct splits strictly male strictly female female portion includes fertilization pouch posterior anterior mucus glands open pallial cavity leads small muscular vagina male portion reproductive tract includes short posterior vas deferens longer anterior vas deferens posterior vas deferens followed prostate anterior vas deferens flows haemocoele enlarged blastula filled blood head opens muscular penis engulfed small portion skin called prepuce species freshwater gastropod family caenogastropoda class prosobranchia largely selffertilizing however many generations selfing physiological barrier halts sperm generation organism allows introduction foreign sperm gametes form ovotesties organ produces ova sperm pass hermaphroditic duct albumen gland junction common duct splits either vas deferens oviduct stored needed either mating
