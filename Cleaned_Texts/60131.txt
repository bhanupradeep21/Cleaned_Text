carnivore ˈkɑːrnɪvɔːr meateater latin caro genitive carnis meaning meat flesh vorare meaning devour animal plant whose food energy requirements derive animal tissues mainly muscle fat soft tissues whether hunting technical term mammals order carnivora carnivoran sonamed member species group carnivorous diet similarity name order name diet causes confusion many carnivorans meat eaters large small cats felidae obligate carnivores see classes carnivore highly variable ursids example arctic polar bear eats meat almost exclusively diet meat almost bear species omnivorous one species giant panda nearly exclusively dietary carnivory distinguishing trait order many mammals highly carnivorous diets members order carnivora cetaceans example eat animals paradoxically members almost exclusively planteating hooved mammals animals depend solely animal flesh nutrient requirements called hypercarnivores obligate carnivores whilst also consume nonanimal food called mesocarnivores facultative carnivores omnivores clear carnivore top food chain adults preyed upon animals termed apex predator regardless whether obligate facultative carnivore outside animal kingdom several genera containing carnivorous plants predominantly insectivores several phyla containing carnivorous fungi preying mostly microscopic invertebrates nematodes amoebae springtails carnivores sometimes characterized type prey example animals eat mainly insects similar invertebrates called insectivores eat mainly fish called piscivores carnivores may alternatively classified according percentage meat diet diet hypercarnivore consists meat mesocarnivore hypocarnivore less balance consisting nonanimal foods fruits plant material fungi omnivores also consume animal nonanimal food apart general definition clearly defined ratio plant vs animal material distinguishes facultative carnivore obligate true carnivores whose diet requires nutrients found animal flesh obligate carnivores might able ingest small amounts plant matter lack necessary physiology required fully digest obligate carnivorous mammals ingest vegetation emetic food upsets stomachs selfinduce obligate carnivores diverse amphibian axolotl consumes mainly worms larvae environment necessary consume algae felids including domestic cat require diet primarily animal flesh specifically cats high protein requirements metabolisms appear unable synthesize essential nutrients retinol arginine taurine arachidonic acid thus nature must consume flesh supply characteristics commonly associated carnivores include strength speed keen senses hunting well teeth claws capturing tearing prey however carnivores hunt scavengers lacking physical characteristics bring prey addition hunting carnivores scavenge opportunity arises carnivores comparatively short digestive systems required break tough cellulose found plants many hunting animals evolved eyes facing forward enabling depth perception almost universal among mammalian predators reptile amphibian predators eyes facing sideways predation eating one living creature another nutrition predates rise commonly recognized carnivores hundreds millions perhaps billions years indeed began singlecelled organisms multicellular creatures carnivory predates clear distinction plants animals herbivory carnivory earliest predators microbial organisms engulfed grazed others earliest fossil record poorest first predators could date back anywhere gya billion years rise eukaryotic cells around gya rise multicellular organisms gya rise mobile predators around mya gya probably around gya attributed early predatory many early remains show evidence boreholes markings attributed small predator among familiar species first vertebrate carnivores fish amphibians moved land early tetrapods large amphibious piscivores first tetrapods landdwelling vertebrates piscivorous amphibians called labyrinthodonts gave rise insectivorous vertebrates later predators scientists assert dimetrodon first terrestrial vertebrate develop curved serrated teeth enable predator eat prey much larger amphibians continued feed fish later insects reptiles began exploring two new food types tetrapods carnivory plants herbivory carnivory natural transition insectivory medium large tetrapods requiring minimal adaptation contrast complex set adaptations necessary feeding highly fibrous plant mesozoic theropod dinosaurs tyrannosaurus rex thought probably obligate carnivores though theropods larger carnivores several carnivorous mammal groups already present notable gobiconodontids triconodontid jugulator deltatheroidans cimolestes many repenomamus jugulator cimolestes among largest mammals faunal assemblages capable attacking earlytomidcenozoic dominant predator forms mammals hyaenodonts oxyaenids entelodonts ptolemaiidans arctocyonids mesonychians representing great diversity eutherian carnivores northern continents africa south america sparassodonts dominant australia saw presence several marsupial predators dasyuromorphs thylacoleonids miocene present dominant carnivorous mammals carnivoramorphs carnivorous mammals dogs deltatheridiums share several dental adaptations carnassialiforme teeth long canines even similar tooth replacement aberrant thylacoleonids diprodontan dentition completely unlike mammal eutriconodonts like gobiconodontids
