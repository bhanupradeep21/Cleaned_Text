centronuclear myopathies cnm group congenital myopathies cell nuclei abnormally located center muscle cells instead normal location periphery symptoms cnm include severe hypotonia hypoxiarequiring breathing assistance scaphocephaly among centronuclear myopathies xlinked myotubular myopathy form typically presents birth thus considered congenital myopathy however centronuclear myopathies may present later life myopathies clinical manifestations mtmcnm notably muscle weakness associated disabilities congenital forms often present neonatal low muscle tone severe weakness delayed developmental milestones particularly gross motor milestones head control crawling walking pulmonary complications presumably due weakness muscles responsible respiration involvement facial muscles may cause ophthalmoplegia ptosis mutation gene causing cnm may also cause susceptibility malignant hyperthermia potentially lifethreatening reaction patients centronuclear myopathies remain ambulatory throughout adult life others may never crawl walk may require wheelchair use mobility substantial variability degree functional impairment among various centronuclear myopathies although condition affects voluntary muscles several children cardiac arrest possibly due additional stress placed observed features high arched palate long digits bell shaped chest long face myotubular myopathy affects muscles impact intelligence shape formcitation needed xlinked myotubular myopathy traditionally fatal condition infancy life expectancy usually less two years appears substantial variability clinical severity different genetic abnormalities gene published cases show significant differences clinical severity among relatives genetic abnormality gene truncating mutations cause severe early lethal phenotype missense mutations associated milder forms prolonged survival centronuclear myopathies typically milder presentation better prognosis autosomal dominant cnm tends less severe phenotype autosomal recessive recently researchers discovered mutations gene dynamin chromosome site responsible autosomal dominant form centronuclear condition known dynamin centronuclear myopathy abbreviated research indicated patients slowly progressive muscular weakness usually beginning adolescence early adulthood age range genetic abnormality associated xlinked form myotubular myopathy xlmtm first localized x chromosome site codes myotubularin protein highly conserved lipid phosphatase involved cellular transport trafficking signalling approximately males myotubular myopathy diagnosed muscle biopsy mutations mutations genetic centronuclear myopathies genetic abnormality sexlinked eg located x chromosome considered autosomal autosomal abnormalities either dominant recessive often referred ad autosomal dominant ar autosomal many researchers use term myotubular myopathy mtm cases genetic test come back positive abnormalities genetic mutations gene x chromosome cases centronuclear nucleus center appearance muscle biopsy normal genetic test would referred centronuclear myopathy time specific genetic site identified give detailed subclassificationcitation needed possible combinations inheritance myotubular myopathy follows sporadic cases also reported previous family history cases presumably due new mutation present either parent examination muscle biopsy material nuclear material located predominantly center muscle cells described myotubular centronuclear appearance terms describing muscle biopsy myotubular centronuclear almost synonymous terms point similar cellularappearance among mtm cnm thus pathologists treating physicians use terms almost interchangeably although researchers clinicians increasingly distinguishing phrasescitation needed general clinical myopathy muscle biopsy showing centronuclear nucleus center muscle cell appearance would indicate centronuclear myopathy cnm commonly diagnosed cnm myotubular myopathy mtm however muscle biopsy analysis alone reliably distinguish myotubular myopathy forms centronuclear myopathies thus genetic testing required diagnostic workup often coordinated treating neurologist united states care often coordinated clinics affiliated muscular dystrophy associationcitation needed electrodiagnostic testing also called electrophysiologic includes nerve conduction studies involves stimulating peripheral motor sensory nerve recording response needle electromyography thin needle pinlike electrode inserted muscle tissue look abnormal electrical activitycitation needed electrodiagnostic testing help distinguish myopathies neuropathies help determine course workup electrodiagnostic abnormalities seen myopathies also seen neuropathies nerve disorders electrodiagnostic abnormalities common myopathies neuropathies include abnormal spontaneous activity eg fibrillations positive sharp waves etc needle emg small amplitudes motor responses compound muscle action potential cmap nerve conduction studies many neuropathies however cause abnormalities sensory nerve studies whereas myopathies involve muscle normal sensory nerves important factor distinguishing myopathy neuropathy needle emg careful analysis motor unit action potential muap size shape recruitment patterncitation needed substantial overlap electrodiagnostic findings various types myopathy thus electrodiagnostic testing help distinguish neuropathy myopathy effective distinguishing specific myopathy present muscle biopsy perhaps subsequent genetic testing requiredcitation needed currently cure myotubular centronuclear myopathies treatment often focuses trying maximize functional abilities minimize medical complications involvement physicians specializing physical medicine rehabilitation physical therapists occupational therapistscitation needed medical management generally involves efforts prevent pulmonary complications since lung infections fatal patients lacking muscle strength necessary clear secretions via coughing medical devices assist coughing help patients maintain clear airways avoiding mucous plugs avoiding need tracheostomy tubescitation needed monitoring scoliosis also important since weakness trunk muscles lead deviations spinal alignment resultant compromise respiratory function many patients congenital myopathies may eventually require surgical treatment scoliosiscitation needed overall incidence myotubular myopathy male live incidence centronuclear myopathies extremely rare nineteen families identified cnm throughout world symptoms currently range majority need walk aids stick walking frame total dependence physical mobility aids wheelchairs stand aids latter variety rare two cases known cnm community approximately males diagnosis myotubular myopathy muscle biopsy mutation identifiable genetic sequence many patients myotubular myopathy die infancy prior receiving formal diagnosis possible muscle biopsy genetic testing may still helpful even neonatal death since diagnostic information assist family planning genetic counseling well aiding accurate diagnosis relatives might also genetic abnormalitycitation needed dr spiro new york city neurologist published medical report boy myopathy upon muscle biopsy showed nuclei muscle cells located center muscle cells instead normal location nuclear appearance reminded nucleusinthecenter appearance myotubular stage embryonic development thus coined term myotubular myopathy spiro speculated embryonic muscle development seen boy due growth arrest myotubular phase causing myopathycitation needed three decades later fully understood whether theory regarding halted delayed embryonic muscle development correct research suggests theory may acceptable infantonset myotubular myopathy mutations gene x chromosome may acceptable autosomal forms centronuclear research suggests growth arrest mechanism may responsible forms mtm regardless whether myopathy caused arrest myotubular stage historical reasons name myotubular myopathy persists widely reference term myotubular myopathy mtm genetic abnormality x chromosome determined involved substantial percentage individuals myotubularcentronuclear appearance muscle biopsy researchers named gene segment similarly protein typically produced gene called myotubularincitation needed several global advocacy groups working closely educate newly affected families care guidelines joshua frase foundation comprehensive resource care guidelines centronuclear myopathies united states children congenital myopathies often receive therapy services early intervention programs eip providing services birth years old administered state residence child years old special education services provided federal individuals disabilities education act idea myopathies eligible classified conditions causing muscular weakness idea meant protect rights every disabled student receive free appropriate public education fape least restrictive environment ideally meaning integrated nondisabled classmatescitation needed centronuclear myopathies involve pathology skeletal muscles generally without brain involvement cognitive deficits even motor deficits weakness associated impairments may impede individuals ability access educational curriculum eg difficulties lifting carrying books difficulties grasping writing instrument endurance difficulties throughout school day etc recurrent respiratory infections may result missed school dayscitation needed although forms centronuclear myopathy considered rare commonly known form cnm myotubular myopathy mtm terms centronuclear myopathy myotubular myopathy sometimes literally myopathy disease muscle tissue myo derives word muscle pathos means disease dozens different myopathies myopathies conditions cause muscle weakness diseases cause weakness medical conditions affecting sites outside muscle including problems brain stroke cerebral palsy multiple sclerosis
