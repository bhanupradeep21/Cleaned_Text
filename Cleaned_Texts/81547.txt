patagornis genus extinct flightless predatory birds family phorusrhacidae known terror birds lived argentina early middle miocene santa cruz formation patagonia contains numerous patagornis agile medium sized patagornithine likely pursuit predator genus name means bird patagonia location fossils found species name prominent american paleontologist othniel charles marsh also named notable fossil birds american west like hesperornis recently federico agnolin promoted reusing florentino ameghino name tolmodus inflatus name patagornis marshi used years paper alvarenga höfling would make name patagornis marshi nomen nudum tolmodus inflatus valid name due frequent despite use patagornis marshi great resurgence use recent years proper nomenclature hasnt established iczn generic name tolmodus means bold tooth due misinterpretation holotype premaxilla tooth mammal species name means inflated due large argentine bone wars competition argentine paleontologists francisco moreno florentino ameghino former colleague alcides mercerart described new genus species phorusrhacid patagornis marshi based mandibular symphysis missing tip though thought piece premaxilla fossil found alongside many parts skeleton likely individual symphysis including vertebrae fragments many others parts hindlimbs specific locality fossils found isnt known detail besides came upper middle miocene strata santa cruz formation santa cruz argentina paper moreno mercerat named species patagornis patagornis lemoinei patagornis bachmanni based fossils found monte león formation argentina lower miocene also named palaeociconia cristata based vertebrae ungues santa cruz believing fossil stork related biologist karl lambert placed p cristata genus morenomerceraria genus name since use palaeociconia cristata since synonymized patagornis p lemoinei p bachmanni species morenos rival ameghino also unknowingly found described many fossils patagornis marshi miocene deposits santa cruz many fossils collected ameghinos brother carlos august ameghino named tolmodus inflatus based fragment right premaxilla collected carlos middle miocene deposits santa ameghino originally considered taxon edentate mammal related phorusrhacos months later june synonymized two realized actually flightless carnivorous birds conclusion made earlier ameghino several years amassed many patagornis fossils many described monograph patagonian fossil complete skeleton includes complete skull mandible one first complete phorusrhacid skulls known many limb elements well complete another synonym patagornis marshi named ameghino phororhacos modicus based humerus tarsometatarsus santa another mistakenly assigned fossil premaxilla wrongfully assigned ameghino rhea ameghino also believed fossils came cretaceous eocene pyrotherium beds actually miocene end argentine bone wars many patagornis fossils collected majority reside museo de la plata natural history museum several fragmentary patagornis specimens also collected american crews princeton university field museum natural history princeton new jersey chicago illinois respectively although fossils found former reside american museum natural history new museo de la plata also collected nearly complete patagornis skeleton including skull though poorly patagornis similar andalgalornis another member subfamily patagornithinae size weight however andalgalornis slightly larger diameter leg bones larger living rhea however back height estimates weight vary walking speed birds determined ratio two leg bones tibiotarsus tarsometatarsus strength patagornis ratio almost meaning taxon agile trait common among smaller patagornithines research therefore showed animal maximum speed kmh speed living rhea anterior margin fenestra antorbitalis patagornis moderately sloped andrewsornis strongly sloping andalgalornis slightly alvarenga hofling describe dorsal portion nostrils symphysis mandibulae slightly curved apex beak end best preserved patagornis skeleton ulna preserved large quill knobs posterior end suggest large wing feathers theorized used assistance running implied ecology limb anatomy shield like extant secretary former theory much likely based anatomy quill knobs presence related llallawavis similar agile ungual phalanges preserved patagornis distant relative mesembriornis large curved thin laterally likely used stab prey based modern predatory study ear anatomy phorusrhacids degrange et al also studied internal ear anatomy preserved llallawavis patagornis several modern discovered hearing patagornis poor smallest hearing range cariamiformes semicircular canals llallawavis much elongated compared short canals patagornis greater body mass inferred sluggish head movements taxon enhanced sensitivity lowamplitude due great preservation patagornis relatives comparisons taxa detailed classification much easier compared phorusrhacids redescription phorusrhacidae herculano alvarenga elizabeth hofling created new subfamily patagornithinae patagornis type genus patagornis similar relatives andrewsornis andalgalornis mediumsized phorusrhacids slender lightly built bodies long narrow mandibular symphyses long slender tibiotarsi tarsometatarsi however phylogenetic analysis degrange et al found patagornis merged phorusrhacinae polytomy physornis phorusrhacos following
