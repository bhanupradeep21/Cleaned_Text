epidemic paralytic disease occurring among hungerstricken rural populations africa diet dominated insufficiently processed results simultaneous malnutrition high dietary cyanide konzo first described giovanni trolli compiled observations eight doctors working kwango area belgian congo democratic republic congo onset paralysis spastic paraparesis sudden symmetrical affects legs arms resulting disability permanent progress typically patient standing walking balls feet rigid legs often ankle initially patients experience generalized weakness first days bedridden days weeks trying walk occasional blurred vision andor speech difficulties typically clear first month except severely affected patients spasticity present first day without initial phase flaccidity initial weeks functional improvement spastic paraparesis remains stable rest patients may experience abrupt aggravating episode eg sudden permanent worsening spastic paraparesis episodes identical initial onset therefore interpreted second onsetcitation needed severity konzo varies cases range hyperreflexia lower limbs severely disabled patient spastic paraparesis associated weakness trunk arms impaired eye movements speech possibly visual impairment although severity varies patient patient longest upper motor neurons invariably affected shorter ones thus konzo patient speech impairment always shows severe symptoms legs armscitation needed recently neuropsychological effects konzo described dr needed character neurological injury clear disease onset associated high intake cyanide diet mostly bitter cassava low protein particularly sulfur amino acids essential detoxification body cyanide thiocyanate removed number studies implicate combination high cyanide intake bitter cassava low intake sulfur amino acids cause shown month month incidence konzo significantly correlated percentage children high urinary thiocyanate content measure cyanide intake importance adequate supply protein sulfur amino acids shown three unrelated konzo epidemics drc people ethnic group living km away konzo near zero konzo prevalence mozambique lived near sea tanzania lived near lake victoria access fish drc lived

prevention konzo shows konzo likely due high cyanidelow sulfur amino acid intake diet bitter cassava konzo occur unless conditions met occurs remote villages six tropical african countries total number reported cases cases never reported estimate cases drc alone konzo spreading geographically cassava grown new areas little knowledge processing methods remove konzo epidemics occur due war causes disruption life poor villages drought plant increases cyanogen content roots cyanide content cassava flour also increases konzo also endemic certain areascitation needed east africa traditional methods processing cassava remove cyanogens consist sun drying heap fermentation inadequately remove cyanogens even year normal central africa soaking retting cassava roots water days adequate short soaking days leaves much cyanogens resulting flour leads west africa roasted product called garri produced different method used produce flour reduces total cyanide content cases konzo reported west cameroon another neurological disease called tropical ataxic neuropathy tan occurs amongst older people west africa including southwest nigeria tanzania uganda kenya also west indies south probably due long term intake cyanogens cassava lower level needed cause recommended three criteria diagnosis konzocitation needed depending severity konzo divided three categories mild individuals able walk without support moderate individuals need one two sticks walk severe affected person unable walk clinical symptoms strikingly similar neurolathyrism also similar viral tropical spastic paraparesis

collective population nearly people time intervention reduced months first months second months third fourth interventions reduced cost per person intervention prevent konzo removing cyanogens cassava flour per person targeted method reduce cyanide intake much cheaper effective preventing konzo broad based interventionscitation needed treatment found affected individuals benefit considerably rehabilitation use adequate walking aids central african republic children operated elongation achilles tendon improved position foot long term consequence remains uncertaincitation needed konzo
