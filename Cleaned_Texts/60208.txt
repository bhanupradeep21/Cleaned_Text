lead poisoning significant health issue affecting raptor populationcitation needed amongst species without rehabilitation many raptors succumb symptoms lead poisoning affected general public may know possibly contributing problem nearly lead poisoning prevented humans paid close attention hunting angling two major contributors avian species affected lead poisoning hunters using lead ammunition anglers using lead hunters shoot animal often leave offal carcass waste woods afterwards becomes problematic hunter chosen use lead bullets shown essentially animals shot lead contain lead fragments one singular standard lead bullet ability kill one study noted deer carcasses examined contained lead fragments one point entry bullet animal small fragments travel centimetres fragments small visibly seen show xray scans animal predators scavengers find animal remains waste consume small lead pieces fragments broken lead absorbed bloodstream due grinding action gizzard thus results plethora health terms fishing tackle peak fishing season found result highest number mortalities caused lead birds may eat fish consumed lead jig sinker fishing line breaks may also try attack fish pulled someone also tackle becomes disposed left behind water fishing grounds birds may accidentally makes issue even worse lead element quickly eliminated degraded stable element results continuous accumulation concentration lead environment time going going though big issue methods wildlife technically exposed lead leadbased paint lead gets digestive tract raptors acidic nature stomach allows breakdown absorption lead fragments tissues bird unlikely cause lead toxicity needs broken bloodstream lead found mimic calciums role body takeover normal cellular pathways processes calcium would typically result calcium homeostasis longer maintained lead enters bloodstream signal transmissions disrupted nerve synapses cholinergic nerve cells become inhibited resulting behavioural change cerebellum affected function nervous system evidently becomes greatly jeopardized bloodstream red blood cells develop decreased lifespan less heme synthesis occurs due enzymes δaminolevulinic acid dehydratase ferrochelatase becoming impaired bird becomes birds initially start showing behavioural changes might first demonstrate difficulties also start demonstrating abnormal head positioning often found staring ground vocalizations may change sound often becomes high pitched honk might beaks partially open hissing noise coming approximately two weeks depending bird becomes visibly weak commonly display trouble walking wings may also start appearing droopy wing tips often seen dragging ground birds might put less effort acquire bird survives weeks lead poisoning may also begin appear emaciated keel bone may become distinct due digestive tract able digest food tract becomes green feces often seen tail feathers side effect severity lead concentration blood also damage renal system reproductive system kidneys affected egg laid may weakened species eagles also found decreased production sperm occur males may experience decrease testicular size also uncommon birds experience blindness result metabolism vitamins result varying impacts lead physically eagles uncommon birds experience muscle tremors lower legs become due varying degrees symptoms raptor might experiencing wildlife rehabbers may easier time holding treating birds less strength available put individual experienced wildlife times identify symptomatic raptor lead poisoning however acute toxicity always easily definitive way determining bird lead poisoning taking blood sample testing lead bird considered normal typically unaffected lead blood found less though impossible symptomatic bird raptor considered experiencing subclinical amounts lead system μgdl eagle blood levels lead considered clinical case chances eagle surviving point slim none liver bone also biopsied test lead toxicity though occur eagle already died birds also xrayed larger pieces lead consumed visible treating patients experiencing lead poisoning goals decrease absorption lead bloodstream get rid toxic lead absorbed help support animal recovery lead already absorbed bloodstream becomes vital treat bird something adsorb lead particles use chelating compounds compounds cause bird eliminate lead body excreting urine common medications used deal edta ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid dtpa diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid recommended use intramuscular injections edta even though intravenously effective due toxic effect edta kidneys dmsa common oral drug may used treatment xray taken lead pieces show removed surgically endoscope gastrotomy gavage stomach though pieces big lead poisoning likely high able survive shown higher quantity lead toxicity seen biggame hunting proven regulating lead ammunition reduce number birds exposed affected lead best option hunters switch nonlead copper ammunition popular alternative hunters say works well even better typical lead bullets though alloy metal ammunition options also used nonlead fishing tackle also hunter refuses switch nonlead ammunition alternative burning carcass next best though burying carcass better leaving open carcass easily dug rodents mammals would also exposed raptors hunters also realize lead meat hunt food use lead ammunition isnt safe human consumption httpsenwikipediaorgwikileadpoisoninginraptors
