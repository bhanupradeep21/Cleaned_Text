although metacognition thus far discussed relation self recent research field suggested view overly instead argued metacognition research also include beliefs others mental processes influence culture beliefs beliefs expansionist view proposes impossible fully understand metacognition without considering situational norms cultural expectations influence conceptions combination social psychology metacognition referred social metacognition social metacognition include ideas perceptions relate social cognition additionally social metacognition include judging cognition others judging perceptions emotional states part process judging others similar judging however individuals less information people judging therefore judging others tends inaccurate effect called fundamental attribution similar cognitions buffer inaccuracy helpful teams organizations well interpersonal example interaction social metacognition selfconcept found examining implicit theories self implicit theories cover wide range constructs self operates two especially relevant entity theory incrementalist entity theory proposes individuals selfattributes abilities fixed stable incrementalist theory proposes constructs changed effort experience entity theorists susceptible learned helplessness may feel circumstances outside control ie theres nothing could done make things better thus may give easily incremental theorists react differently faced failure desire master challenges therefore adopt masteryoriented pattern immediately began consider various ways could approach task differently increase efforts cultural beliefs act well example person accepted cultural belief memory loss unavoidable consequence old age may avoid cognitively demanding tasks age thus accelerating cognitive similarly woman aware stereotype purports women good mathematics may perform worse tests mathematical ability avoid mathematics examples demonstrate metacognitive beliefs people hold self may socially culturally transmitted important effects persistence performance motivation way individuals think attitude greatly affects way behave metacognitions attitudes influence individuals act especially interact metacognitive characteristics attitudes include importance certainty perceived knowledge influence behavior different attitude importance strongest predictor behavior predict information seeking behaviors individuals attitude importance also likely influence behavior certainty considering social behavior like voting person may hold high importance low certainty means likely vote even unsure vote meanwhile person certain want vote may actually vote low importance also applies interpersonal relationships person might hold lot favorable knowledge family may maintain close relations family low importance metacognitive characteristics attitudes may key understanding attitudes change research shows frequency positive negative thoughts biggest factor attitude person may believe climate change occurring negative thoughts toward accept responsibilities climate change must change lifestyle individuals would likely change behavior compared someone thinks positively issue using less electricity helping planet another way increase likelihood behavior change influencing source attitude individuals personal thoughts ideas much greater impact attitude compared ideas therefore people view lifestyle changes coming effects powerful changes coming friend family member thoughts reframed way emphasizes personal importance want stop smoking important rather quitting smoking important family research needs conducted culture differences importance group ideology may alter results people secondary cognitions appropriateness justifiability social judgability stereotypic people know typically unacceptable make stereotypical judgments make conscious efforts subtle social cues influence conscious efforts example given false sense confidence ability judge others people return relying social cultural backgrounds influence social metacognitive assumptions including stereotypes example cultures without stereotype memory declines old age display age differences memory comes making judgments people implicit theories stability versus malleability human characteristics predict differences social stereotyping well holding entity theory traits increases tendency people see similarity among group members utilize stereotyped judgments example compared holding incremental beliefs people hold entity beliefs traits use stereotypical trait judgments ethnic occupational groups well form extreme trait judgments new individuals assumptions group combine implicit theories stereotypical judgments may stereotypes one believes others hold called metastereotypes beran smith perdue found chimpanzees showed metacognitive monitoring informationseeking studies three languagetrained chimpanzees asked use keyboard name food item order get food food container either visible

reward classification noises incorrect rats decline take test would guaranteed smaller reward results showed rats likely decline take test difficulty noise discrimination increased suggesting rats

responses pattern might attributed actively monitor mental states alternatively external cues environmental cue associations could used explain behaviors discrimination task rats might learned association intermediate stimuli decline option time longer response latencies features inherent stimuli serve discriminative cues decline tests therefore templer lee preston utilized olfactorybased delayed match sample dmts memory task assess whether rats capable metacognitive responding rats exposed sample odor first chose either decline take fourchoice memory test delay correct choices odor associated high reward incorrect choices reward decline options accompanied small reward experiment nosample trials added memory test odor provided test hypothesized rats would decline often sample odor presented compared odor presented rats could internally assess memory strength alternatively decline option motivated external environmental cues rats would less likely decline test available external cues presented results showed rats likely decline test nosample trials relative normal sample trials supporting notion rats track internal memory strength rule potential possibilities also manipulated memory strength providing sampled odor twice varying retention interval learning test templer colleagues found rats less likely decline test exposed sample twice suggesting memory strength samples increased longer delayed sample test often declined short delayed test memory better short delay overall series studies demonstrated rats could distinguish remembering forgetting rule possibilities decline use modulated external cues environmental cue associations research metacognition pigeons shown limited success inman shettleworth employed delayed match sample dmts procedure
