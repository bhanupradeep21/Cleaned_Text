believed act voltagegated sodium lacosamide enhances slow inactivation voltagegated sodium channels without affecting fast inactivation voltagegated sodium channels inactivation prevents channel opening helping end action potential many antiepileptic drugs like carbamazepine lamotrigine slow recovery inactivation hence reduce ability neurons fire action potentials inactivation occurs neurons firing action potentials means drugs modulate fast inactivation selectively reduce firing active cells slow inactivation similar produce complete blockade voltage gated sodium channels activation inactivation occurring hundreds milliseconds lacosamide makes inactivation happen less depolarized membrane potentials means lacosamide affects neurons depolarized active long periods time typical
