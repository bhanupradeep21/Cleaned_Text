linguistics mispronunciation act pronouncing word matter mispronunciation contentious one disagreement extent term even meaningful languages pronounced different ways different people depending factors area grew level education social class even within groups area class different people different ways pronouncing certain wordscitation needed speakers must adhere standard pronunciation order understood others standards vary among groups extent group authority claim standard better even right impose standard often main source contentioncitation needed make claims correct pronunciation often cite dictionaries authority point summary principles pronunciation guides dictionaries written may helpful start discussing two distinct standpoints pronunciation standards viewedcitation needed almost every area linguistics treated either prescriptive descriptive way prescription formulation rules explaining things done description formulation rules explaining things actually done applied pronunciation prescriptive approach involves telling people word pronounced way word pronounced way example one might say word nuclear pronounced njuːklɪəɹ nuːklɪəɹ applied pronunciation descriptive approach involves telling people people pronounce word way others pronounce word way example one might say word nuclear pronounced njuːklɪəɹ people nuːkjələɹ people see nucular simplest prescriptive approach requires less work since necessarily depend words actually spoken one could simply write ones pronunciation rules add note saying everyone else practice complicated since prescriber usually add constraints relating orthography way words written etymology way words originated factors hand descriptive approach depends fieldwork differences pronunciation systems used daytoday life among different people researched cataloguedcitation needed advent modern scientific method scholars europe largely looked ancient greek philosophers ways things aristotle still regarded foremost authority many areas knowledge laws logic intended prescriptions rather descriptions thought similar ethos applied areas life prevailing attitude route knowledge studying ancient texts reasoning detached way birth science careful observations things actually worked began advocated instead however methodology took long time applied language england scholars unaware languages actually developed saw modern tongues mere corruptions old ones attempted remodel english along lines latin resulting invention arbitrary rules rejection split infinitive however century william jones detailed comparison several languages including latin greek sanskrit germanic languages proposed may evolved common root language perhaps extinct see indoeuropean language study often considered birth modern linguistics attention paid detailed comparisons languages many mechanisms languages evolve worked became clear languages constantly changing splitting diverging ever since language began largely result centuries trend towards acknowledging diversity within languages natural consequence language evolution effort put studying diversity actively trying reduce however say linguistic uniformity without advantages everyone agreed single common standard grammar vocabulary orthography pronunciation communication would made easier hand much diversity would lost study linguistics would lose lot subject material important debatablecitation needed early dictionaries samuel johnson england later noah webster united states played large role making spelling uniform dictionaries began add pronunciation guides played similar role first american dictionaries least tended avoid listing pronunciations considered nonstandard thus played prescriptive role british tradition far descriptive however following general trend linguistics american dictionaries becoming descriptive british dictionaries becoming less australian ones remaining case respects well pronunciation example pronunciation word nuclear spelled nucular one frowned upon pronunciation listed dictionaries however take mean pronunciation considered either correct incorrect misunderstand role dictionaries playing simply reporting current usagecitation needed following examples processes pronunciation change together explanations speakers view certain pronunciations mispronunciations noticed formal slang english mispronounced many examples words whose etymologies show lost phonemes consonant vowel sounds somewhere histories example silent k start many words english language originally pronounced word knight derives word cniht old english two consonant sounds lost c also h sounded latter voiceless fricative changes happening throughout history would seriously propose reverse pronounce knight cniht however thing happens present day simplified forms widely labelled incorrect example word antarctic etymologically derived word arctic arktik originally cs pronounced former word latter antarktik still usual pronunciation word however speakers omit first c sound antarctic resulting pronunciation antartik disapprove word arctic undergone similar change corresponding change spelling unusual see word artic artik names parks populated areascitation needed adoption words names one language another also process going since time immemorial although causes problems phonology source language almost certainly going different destination language mutation pronunciation inevitable perhaps even thorny issue examples change within language possibility speakers source language may upset may see mangling language issue particularly complex several different ways originally foreign word used within language depending extent integrated extent varies continuously word considered true part language considered much part language havent studied linguistics even know ever foreign many words eg words beef pocket entered english language norman language following conquest thoroughly integrated language generally considered foreign follow usual laws english phonetics perfectly current pronunciations generally changed original ones noone considers mispronunciations words adopted long ago words eg french word née meaning born used maiden names adopted recently still considered foreign retaining diacritics often written italics show foreign status however usually pronounced english way eg nay diphthong instead single vowel sound uncommon labelled mispronunciations still words including proper nouns names people places written foreign words often given native pronunciation example french term mange tout type pea often pronounced nasal vowel otherwise especially proper noun often considered mispronunciation bears noting however apply pronunciation differences dialects language example american surname carter would probably upset hear englishman pronounce name received pronunciation kɑːtə would englishman surname carter offended hearing american pronounce name rhotic accent kɑɹtɚcitation
