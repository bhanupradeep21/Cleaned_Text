migrainous infarction rare type ischaemic stroke occurs correspondence migraine aura symptoms include headaches visual disturbances strange sensations dysphasia gradually worsen causing neurological changes ultimately increase risk ischaemic typically women age experience migraine aura greatest risk developing migrainous infarction especially combined smoking use oral overall population migraines experience aura aura broadly defined gradually developing attacks cause neurological deficits vision sensation visual disturbances commonly associated patients experiencing visual patients experience visual disturbances minutes time median duration visual disturbance typically visual disturbances patients begin zig zag line middle ocular field appears patients describe symptoms expanding red circle centre visual scotoma often occurs visual disturbance moves periphery visual additionally scotoma sometimes occur center visual field appear distinct blindspot although less individuals persistent may also report visual disturbance called visual snow generally describe visual field consisting many small flickering spots may resemble sensory symptoms known occur patients occur longer minutes patients median duration typically sensory aura consist strange sensations pain gradually move hand arm face tongue areas extremely rare patients experience sensory symptoms legs dysphasic symptoms appear patients occurring minutes patients median time span dysphasia patients appears moderate language generation deficit example patient may unable state home sometimes patient may also experience language comprehension deficits may unable comprehend instructions complex public knowledge stroke symptoms scarce people able correctly identify individual experiencing cerebral ischaemia refers severely reduced flow blood brain due narrowing blocking arteries blood vessels causing ischaemic stroke characterised dizziness sudden weakness numbness visual deficits difficulty speaking comprehending speech severe approximately ischaemic strokes caused embolisms obstruction blood vessel brain often due blood clot formed heart travels blood brain barrier usually embolic strokes cause multiple ischaemic lesions found migrainous infarction cases ischaemic strokes caused thrombus blood clot forms cerebral blood vessel reducing flow blood occlusion blood vessels causes localised cytotoxic edema damages energydependent pumps cellular membrane causing intracellular history significant predictor migrainous infarction migrainous infarction patients experienced previously however migrainous infarction also occur migraine without aura although less common migrainous infarction patients never experienced typically month prior cerebral infarction patient experience severe enhanced platelet activation observed directly increases risk developing additionally platelet activation enhanced patients even aurafree headachefree moreover effect exemplified administration nonselective betaadrenergic antagonists eg propranolol often prescribed reduce migraine contrary suggestion initiates ischaemic infarction one theory suggests ischaemia may fact cause theory based finding reduced regional cerebral blood flow rcbf shown present patients due underlying therefore possible infarction occurs due another unknown factor causing ischaemia merely symptom associated processcitation needed migraines direct negative impact control vessels brain causing cerebral vasoconstriction ultimately narrows blood vessels brain leading cerebral hypoxia tissue vasoconstriction blood vessels arteries migraine thought caused use transcranial doppler revealed patients show prolonged diffuse vasospasm even asymptomatic periods although vasospasm tends severe aura diagnosis migrainous infarction patient must meet criteria set international headache society ihs criteria include one persistent aura symptom lasting minutes previous medical history migraine attacks aura clinician must certain infarction better explained another medical problem disorder diagnosis confirmed neuroimaging patients brain exhibits ischaemic infarction area associated overall patients experience aura symptoms longer ct scans magnetic resonance imaging mri magnetic resonance angiography mra common techniques allow localisation brain lesions approximately migrainous infarction patients experience lesions posterior circulation patients also experiencing lesions clot busting agents thrombolytic therapy treatment option migrainous infarction caused enhanced platelet activation leading streptokinase thrombolytic agent aims permit reperfusion allowing restoration blood flow ischaemic recent trials indicate streptokinase improve function month period however risk mortality due intracerebral haemorrhage resulting use thrombolytic agent extremely high therefore treatment using streptokinase alteplase recombinant tissue plasminogen activator enhances conversion plasminogen plasmin aid degradation blood effectiveness depends highly swift administration medication notably treatment administered within hours onset ischaemic stroke effective similar manner streptokinase alteplase increases risk intracranial haemorrhage however mortality rate aspirin class antiaggregation drug often used treat headaches patients administration aspirin patients shown effective reducing platelet factor concentration promotes blood coagulation cause ischaemia therefore aspirins ability reduce concentration people greatly reduces risk migrainous
