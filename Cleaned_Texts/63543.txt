asynchronous mucosal wave vocal folds several possible causes vocal fold cysts generally four components included full diagnosis vocal cord cyst medical voice history head neck exam perceptual assessment voice imaging vocal medical voice history help distinguish patterns misuse phonotrauma assist primary perceptual sign vocal fold cysts hoarseness diagnosis perceptual means alone difficult therefore fourth component diagnosis patient often undergoes imaging imaging commonly done laryngeal videostroboscopy examination vocal folds using flashes light slow image vocal fold movement enough
