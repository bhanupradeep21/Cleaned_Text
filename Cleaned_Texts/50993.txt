less used terms include borderland end zone boundary zone terminal zone varying terms arisen considerable anatomic variability cerebral vascular structure territories brain sharp drop blood pressure frequent cause watershed infarcts frequent location watershed stroke region anterior cerebral artery middle cerebral artery events caused hypotension usually cause blood vessel microemboli experimentally proven cause watershed strokes unclear whether cause effect watershed watershed strokes platelet aggregates block small meningeal arteries watershed regions creating microembolism microemboli usually form thrombi block arteries outright hand often detach move blood circulation eventually block smaller downstream branches arteries causing thromboembolism generally emboli travel far outward size permits along vascular branches brain using hypothesis microemboli viewed cause infarct rather secondary events nevertheless secondary thrombi form infarcts therefore difficult distinguish emboli thrombi watershed best supporting evidence correlative patients display subcortical abnormalities ct scans present microembolic signals carotid microemboli common highrisk patients carotid stenosis however healthier patients strokes usually result thrombi split internal carotid artery neck may cause watershed infarcts territories anterior cerebral artery middle cerebral artery resulting watershed infarcts carotid artery blockages mostly considered due reduced blood flow similar imaging studies severe internal carotid artery ica disease report incidence watershed stroke

stroke watershed stroke diagnosis evaluation stroke includes evaluation blood vessels neck using either doppler ultrasound mrangiography ctangiography formal angiography echocardiogram may performed looking cardiac source emboli blood tests risk factors also may ordered including cholesterol levels triglyceride levels homocysteine levels blood coagulation tests often considered one safest ways treat symptomatic carotid stenosis carotid endarterectomy procedure surgeon gently removes atherosclerotic plaque blood flow hopefully returns normal increasing oxygen concentration normal amounts watershed areas brain potential complications including disturbing portions plaque leading stroke heart attack surgery small risks bleeding infection exist type procedure narrowed blood vessel expanded via angioplasty stenting thin angiography catheter inserted large groin blood vessel advanced stenosis percutaneous treatment less invasive endarterectomy usually requiring local anesthesia endarterectomy still considered safer though percutaneous treatments lead accidental dislodging plaque even arterial carotid angioplasty angiography cather small deflated balloon attached tip advanced carotid stenosis ballon inflated slowly forcing narrowed portion vessel expand carotid stenting follows similar procedure rather using balloon stent metal meshlike tube placed atherosclerotic plaque hopes stabilizing allowing increased blood flow watershed portions brain watershed strokes seldom fatal lead neuromuscular degeneration well degeneration watershed regions brain lead difficulties movement motor coordination well speech longterm care focused around three areas rehabilitative therapy surgical interventions prevention future watershed strokes longterm rehabilitative therapy watershed stroke patients involves physical occupational speech language therapies physical therapy used enhance motor function legs arms impacted occupational therapies provided help alleviate cognitive impairments result watershed stroke effectiveness remains occupational therapy also used effort improve fine motor function damaged result stroke also cause impairments speech production secondary neurocognitive neuromuscular impairments therefore speech language therapies often component longterm care stroke patients intensive speech language therapy shown improve speech deficits associated aphasia resulting endovascular interventions including surgical revascularization increase blood flow area stroke thereby decreasing likelihood insufficient blood flow watershed regions brain result subsequent neuroscientists currently researching stem cell transplantation therapies improve recovery cebreral tissue affected areas brain poststroke intervention proven effective greatly increase number neurons brain recover several interventions often used help prevent recurrence watershed stroke namely nutritional interventions well antiplatelet anticoagulant statin drug use nutritional interventions including increased consumption certain amino acids antioxidants bgroup vitamins zinc shown increase recovery neurocognitive function antiplatelet drugs aspirin well anticoagulants used help prevent blood clots therefore embolisms cause watershed strokes statin drugs also used control hyperlipidemia another risk factor watershed stroke ischemic stroke still major health concern studies conducted determine pathway brain damage occurs identify targets intervention stem cell transplantation may help intervention improve cell recovery although mechanism entirely
