autoimmune hepatitis formerly known lupoid hepatitis plasma cell hepatitis autoimmune chronic active hepatitis chronic autoimmune disease liver occurs bodys immune system attacks liver cells causing liver inflamed common initial symptoms may include fatigue nausea muscle aches weight loss signs acute liver inflammation including fever jaundice right upper quadrant abdominal pain individuals autoimmune hepatitis often initial symptoms disease may detected abnormal liver function tests increased protein levels routine bloodwork observation abnormallooking liver abdominal anomalous presentation mhc class ii receptors surface liver possibly due genetic predisposition acute liver infection causes cellmediated immune response bodys liver resulting autoimmune hepatitis abnormal immune response results inflammation liver lead symptoms complications fatigue disease often diagnosed patients late teens early ages affects women commonly autoimmune hepatitis may present completely asymptomatic cases signs chronic liver disease acute even fulminant hepatic people usually present one nonspecific longlasting symptoms fatigue general ill health lethargy weight loss mild right upper quadrant abdominal pain malaise anorexia itching nausea jaundice joint pain especially affecting small joints rarely rash unexplained fever may appear women absence menstruation amenorrhoea frequent feature physical examination may normal may also reveal signs symptoms chronic liver disease many people laboratory abnormalities initial presentation unexplained increase transaminases diagnosed evaluation reasons others already developed cirrhosis note alkaline phosphatase bilirubin usually normal autoimmune hepatitis may overlap autoimmune conditions mainly type diabetes mellitus ulcerative colitis lupus celiac disease vasculitis autoimmune prevailing theory development autoimmune hepatitis thought interplay genetic predisposition environmental trigger virus drugs herbs immunizations failure native immune system resulting chronic inflammation hepatocytes subsequent fibrosis specific evidence cause sixty percent patients findings associated chronic hepatitis without serologic evidence viral infection disease strongly associated antismooth muscle exact genes triggers responsible remain undefined studies show association earlyonset severe disease serotype lateonset disease diagnosis autoimmune hepatitis best achieved combination clinical laboratory histological findings excluding etiological factors eg viral hereditary metabolic cholestatic druginduced liver diseases requirement histological examination necessitates liver biopsy typically performed needle percutaneous route provide liver tissue number specific antibodies found blood antinuclear antibody ana antismooth muscle antibody sma antiliver kidney microsomal antibodies anti soluble liver antigen sla antigen lp antimitochondrial antibody ama use finding increased immunoglobulin g level presence antimitochondrial antibody suggestive primary biliary cholangitis hypergammaglobulinemia also diagnostic autoimmune hepatitis characterized histologically following nonspecific internal autoimmune hepatitis group developed standardized scoring system clinical diagnosis population studies lacks value individualized simplified scoring system clinical use incorporates titers autoantibodies total igg levels liver histology exclusion viral hepatitis diagnostic basis detected autoantibodies autoimmune hepatitis classified three subtypes distinct clinical presentations diagnoses consider include conditions may cause acute hepatitis chronic liver inflammation may accompanied cirrhosis choice medical treatment based individuals severity symptoms quantitative elevation liver enzymes antibody levels findings liver biopsy ability tolerate side effects medical therapy generally treatment required asymptomatic patients normal liver enzyme antibody levels liver biopsies demonstrate inflammation patients low risk disease progression symptomatic individuals evidence interface hepatitis necrosis liver biopsy recommended offer treatment especially patient young tolerate side effects medical mainstay treatment involves use immunosuppressive glucocorticoids prednisone acute episodes resolution symptoms achieved cases although many eventually experience individuals moderate severe disease may tolerate glucocorticoids lower dose prednisone monotherapy combination azathioprine reasonable alternative budesonide shown effective inducing remission prednisone evidence scarce data needed routinely autoimmune hepatitis respond glucocorticoids azathioprine may given immunosuppressives like mycophenolate ciclosporin tacrolimus liver cirrhosis develop treated patients people highest risk progression cirrhosis incomplete response treatment treatment failure multiple relapses cirrhosis develops management liver cirrhosis autoimmune hepatitis standard regardless etiology liver transplantation standard care people presenting fulminant liver failure progression disease despite multiple lines without treatment tenyear survival rate individuals symptomatic autoimmune hepatitis however treatment tenyear survival rate despite benefits treatment people autoimmune hepatitis generally lower transplantfree survival general outcomes liver transplant generally favorable fiveyear survival greater presentation response therapy may differ according race african americans appear present aggressive disease associated worse strong evidence patients autoimmune hepatitis develop mental health disorders like schizophrenia bipolar disorder later autoimmune hepatitis develop people race age occurs frequently eighty percent cases type subtype women affected times often men type subtype women affected times often european studies suggest disease incidence people affected per population prevalence people per disease bimodal peak occurring ages later life ages autoimmune hepatitis previously called lupoid hepatitis due people associated autoimmune disease like system lupus erythematosus time diagnosis believed cause originally described early
