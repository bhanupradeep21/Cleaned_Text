corneal ulcer also called keratitis inflammatory seriously infective condition cornea involving disruption epithelial layer involvement corneal common condition humans particularly tropics developing countries children afflicted vitamin deficiency high risk corneal ulcer may become blind eyes persisting throughout life ophthalmology corneal ulcer usually refers term corneal abrasion refers scratch corneal ulcers common human eye caused trauma particularly vegetable matter well chemical injury contact lenses infections eye conditions cause corneal ulcers entropion distichiasis corneal dystrophy keratoconjunctivitis sicca dry eye many microorganisms cause infective corneal among bacteria including chlamydia trachomatis fungi viruses superficial ulcers involve loss part epithelium deep ulcers extend stroma result severe scarring corneal descemetoceles occur ulcer extends stroma type ulcer especially dangerous rapidly result corneal perforation treated time location ulcer depends somewhat central ulcers typically caused trauma dry eye exposure facial nerve paralysis exophthalmos entropion severe dry eye trichiasis inturning eyelashes may cause ulceration peripheral cornea immunemediated eye disease cause ulcers border cornea sclera include rheumatoid arthritis rosacea systemic sclerosis lead special type corneal ulcer called moorens ulcer circumferential crater like depression cornea inside limbus usually overhanging edge refractory corneal ulcers superficial ulcers heal poorly tend recur also known indolent ulcers boxer ulcers believed caused defect basement membrane lack hemidesmosomal attachments recognized undermined epithelium surrounds ulcer easily peels back refractory corneal ulcers commonly seen diabetics often occur eye later similar cogans cystic dystrophy melting ulcers type corneal ulcer involving progressive loss stroma dissolving fashion commonly seen pseudomonas infection caused types bacteria fungi infectious agents produce proteases collagenases break corneal stroma complete loss stroma occur within hours treatment includes antibiotics collagenase inhibitors acetylcysteine surgery form corneal transplantation penetrating keratoplasty usually necessary save eye corneal ulcers painful due nerve exposure cause tearing squinting vision loss may also signs anterior uveitis miosis small pupil aqueous flare protein aqueous humour redness eye axon reflex may responsible uveitis pain receptors cornea results release inflammatory mediators prostaglandins histamine acetylcholine sensitivity light photophobia also common symptom corneal ulcer redness affected eye common brow ache head ache may present drooping eyelid may present slit lamp examination shows loss epithelium site ulcer studied marked case sheet edge ulcer studied whether satellite lesion present seen next cornea stained fluorescein ulcer staining ulcer cornea heals two methods migration surrounding epithelial cells followed mitosis dividing cells introduction blood vessels conjunctiva superficial small ulcers heal rapidly first method however larger deeper ulcers often require presence blood vessels supply inflammatory cells white blood cells fibroblasts produce granulation tissue scar tissue effectively healing cornea diagnosis done direct observation magnified view slit lamp revealing ulcer use fluorescein stain taken exposed corneal stroma appears green helps defining margins corneal ulcer reveal additional details surrounding epithelium herpes simplex ulcers show typical dendritic pattern staining rosebengal dye also used supravital staining purposes may irritating eyes descemetoceles descemets membrane bulge forward staining appear dark circle green boundary absorb stain corneal scraping examining microscope stains like grams koh preparation may reveal bacteria fungi respectively microbiological culture tests may necessary isolate causative organisms cases tests may necessary include schirmers test keratoconjunctivitis sicca analysis facial nerve function facial nerve paralysis proper diagnosis essential optimal cause ulcer decided whether infective noninfective bacterial corneal ulcer require intensive fortified antibiotic therapy treat infection fungal corneal ulcers require intensive application topical antifungal agents viral corneal ulceration caused herpes virus may respond antivirals like topical acyclovir ointment instilled least five times day alongside supportive therapy like pain medications given including topical cycloplegics like atropine homatropine dilate pupil thereby stop spasms ciliary muscle superficial ulcers may heal less week deep ulcers descemetoceles may require conjunctival grafts conjunctival flaps soft contact lenses corneal transplant proper nutrition including protein intake vitamin c usually advised cases keratomalacia corneal ulceration due deficiency vitamin supplementation vitamin oral intramuscular route given drugs usually contraindicated corneal ulcer topical used type corneal ulcer prevent healing may lead superinfection fungi bacteria often make condition much worse topical antibiotics used hourly intervals treat infectious corneal ulcers cycloplegic eye drops applied give rest eye pain medications given needed loose epithelium ulcer base scraped sent culture sensitivity studies find pathogenic organism helps choosing appropriate antibiotics complete healing takes anywhere weeks several months refractory corneal ulcers take long time heal sometimes months case progressive nonhealing ulcers surgical intervention ophthalmologist corneal transplantation may required save eye corneal ulcers important rule predisposing factors like diabetes mellitus immunodeficiency conjunctival flap may drawn ulcer alternative
