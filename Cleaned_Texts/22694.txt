contribute resilience macroparasite populations high parasite populations restriction processes tend restrict population growth rates contribute stability populations interventions lead reduction parasite populations cause relaxation densitydependent restrictions increasing percapita rates reproduction survival thereby contributing population persistence contrariwise positive densitydependent facilitation processes make elimination parasite population likely facilitation processes cause reproductive success parasite decrease lower worm burden thus control measures reduce parasite burden automatically reduce percapita reproductive success increase likelihood elimination facilitation processes extinction threshold refers minimum parasite density level parasite persist population interventions reduce parasite density level threshold ultimately lead extinction parasite population facilitation processes increase extinction threshold making easier achieve using parasite control interventions conversely restriction processes complicates control measures decreasing extinction anderson gordon propose distribution macroparasites host population regulated combination positive
