active surveillance observational management increasingly accepted alternative immediate surgery lowrisk papillary thyroid microcarcinoma evidence extrathyroidal extension metastatic spread patients active surveillance observed periodical ultrasound examinations thyroid function tests disease progression detected patients treated surgery incidence thyroid cancer increased recent decades many countries mostly due increase detection small papillary thyroid carcinoma without associated increase mortality thyroid cancer therefore researchers gave warning increased overdiagnosis overtreatment thyroid cancer akira miyauchi proposed active surveillance management associate professor department surgery kagawa medical university present kagawa university faculty medicine registered doctor kuma hospital kobe hyogo prefecture japan president kuma hospital incidence thyroid cancer rapidly increased since however small papillary carcinomas cm smaller maximum diameter called papillary microcarcinoma although thyroid cancer increased mortality thyroid cancer remained stable therefore researchers started warning overdiagnosis overtreatment small papillary thyroid cause behind phenomenon widespread adoption imaging modalities ultrasonography ct scan mri fineneedle aspiration cytology fnac technologies detection diagnosis small cancers became possible previously possible many autopsy reports subjects died nonthyroid diseases reported high incidences small thyroid cancers tagged latent thyroid cancers incidence latent thyroid cancers mm larger reported papillary carcinoma type papillary thyroid carcinoma mm lager detected ultrasonography easily diagnosed ultrasoundguided fnac screening study thyroid cancer japanese adult women using ultrasonography ultrasound guided fnac reported subjects small thyroid incidence almost consistent latent cancer autopsies times prevalence clinical thyroid cancer japanese women reported time considering facts akira miyauchi proposed following hypothesis papillary microcarcinomas stay small harmless late perform surgery show marginal progression observational management performing surgery microcarcinoma may result harm good due consideration proposed observational management clinical trial medical meeting kuma hospital proposal approved study lowrisk papillary microcarcinoma began year management termed active surveillance similar trial begun cancer institute hospital japanese foundation cancer research jfcr tokyo japan active surveillance conducted patients kuma hospital average period years patients cancer institute hospital jfcr average period years results trials institutes cancer growth mm years patients metastasis cervical lymph node patients developed distant metastasis died thyroid cancer none underwent conversion surgery recurrence disease active surveillance performed united states korea italy columbia surveillance managements small number patients disease progression majority patients stable disease observed even surgery patients lowrisk papillary thyroid microcarcinoma wellexperienced thyroid surgeons complications temporary vocal cord paralysis permanent vocal cord paralysis temporary hypoparathyroidism permanent hypoparathyroidism developed incidence incidences unfavorable events significantly higher group immediate surgery group active surveillance also proportions patients requiring thyroid hormone medications scars due thyroid surgery significantly higher group immediate surgery group active surveillance addition medical care costs patients undergoing immediate surgery times costs chose active one may opinion watching progress without surgery may cause psychological concerns anxiety patients davie l et al conducted questionnaire survey patients active surveillance kuma reported patients sometimes cancer concerns said anxiety diminished time importantly patients responded choosing active surveillance best choice comparison immediate surgery group active surveillance group showed immediate surgery group higher rate physical problems discomfort voice cervical region regarding psychological aspects anxiety cancer either difference groups marginally higher immediate surgery results may due factors worried patients opted surgery based favorable results active surveillance conducted kuma hospital cancer institute hospital jfcr active surveillance acknowledged one management strategies medical guidelines clinical practice diagnosis management thyroid nodules edited japan association endocrine surgeons japanese society thyroid surgery premise thorough explanation given patient consent obtained active surveillance lowrisk papillary thyroid microcarcinoma also adopted american thyroid associations management guidelines adult patients thyroid nodules differentiated thyroid medical guidelines clinical practice diagnosis management thyroid nodules published japan association endocrine surgeons japanese society thyroid surgery actively recommends active surveillance lowrisk papillary thyroid generally prognosis clinical papillary thyroid cancer patients aged years older poorer younger patients however quite strangely papillary microcarcinoma patients years younger likely tumor growth lymph node metastases patients aged years however already stated us prognosis papillary thyroid cancer good young patients thus marginal disease progression young patients lead serious condition curiously tumors shrank patient active active surveillance indicated lowrisk thyroid microcarcinoma mm smaller maximum diameter however surgery recommended highrisk thyroid microcarcinoma following conduct active surveillance necessary give thorough explanation possibility performing surgery cancer grows metastases occur lymph node well risks distant metastases although possibility low necessary fully explain risks obtain consent patient procedure regular ultrasound examination neck performed experienced examiners every months first years annually examination tumor growth appearance new lesions lymph node metastases checked findings surgery
