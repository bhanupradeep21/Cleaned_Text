epicrates eunectes stirtoni extant eunectes due warm humid greenhouse climate paleocene region cerrejón coastal plain covered wet tropical forests large river systems inhabited various freshwater animals among native reptiles three different genera dyrosaurs crocodylomorphs survived kpg extinction event independently modern crocodilians genera coexisted alongside titanoboa included large slendersnouted acherontisuchus mediumsized broadheaded anthracosuchus relatively small turtles also thrived tropical wetlands paleocene colombia giving rise several species considerable size rainforests cerrejón formation mirror modern tropical forests regards families make vegetation unlike modern tropical forests paleocene forests fewer species although possible low diversity result wetland nature depositional environment samples localities time frame suggest forests arose shortly following cretaceouspaleogene mass extinction similar composition indicates low plant diversity time direct result mass extinction preceding plants found paleocene forests include floating fern various genera zingiberales initially titanoboa thought acted much like modern anaconda based size environment lived researchers suggesting may fed local crocodylomorph fauna however abstract jason head colleagues noted skull snake displays multiple adaptations piscivorous diet including anatomy

lungfish osteoglossomorphs recovered type description head colleagues correlate gigantism observed titanoboa climate conditions environment poikilothermic ectotherm titanoboas internal temperature metabolism heavily dependent ambient temperature would turn affect animals accordingly large ectothermic animals typically found tropics decrease size one moves away equator following correlation authors suggest mean annual temperature calculated comparing maximum body size poikilotherm animals found two localities based relation temperatures modern neotropics maximum length anacondas head colleagues calculated mean annual temperature least equatorial region paleocene south america estimates consistent hot paleocene climate suggested study published slightly higher estimates derived oxygen isotopes planktonic foraminifer although estimates exceed temperatures modern tropical forests paper argued increase temperature balanced higher amounts however conclusion questioned several researchers following publication paper j kale sniderman used methodology head colleagues pleistocene monitor lizard varanus priscus comparing extant komodo dragon sniderman calculates following method modern tropics able support lizards much larger observed today reverse varanus priscus much larger would implied ambient temperature native range conclusion argued paleocene rainforests may hotter today massive size titanoboa varanus priscus may instead result lacking significant mammalian mark w denny brent l lockwood george n somero also disagreed heads conclusion noting although method applicable smaller poikilotherms constant across size ranges thermal equilibrium achieved relation volume surface area argue large size titanoboa coupled high temperatures proposed head et al would mean animal would overheat easily resting coiled state authors conclude several key factors influence relationship titanoboa temperature area inhabited varying posture could help cool needed basking behavior heat absorption substrate unknown potentially semiaquatic nature animal creates additional factors consider ultimately denny colleagues argue nature giant snake renders poor indicator climate paleocene mean annual temperature must cooler current issues alongside adjustments suggested makarieva addressed head team year arguing denny colleagues misunderstand proposed model retort method takes account variation caused body size furthermore based largest extant snakes making appropriate method also add results recovered consistent large extant snakes also known perform thermoregulation behavior snidermans proposal correlation body size temperature inconsistent modern monitor lizards addressed twofold one head argues komodo dragons poor analogy geographically restricted islands indonesia limiting size could grow green anacondas titanoboa mainland animals secondly response notes size estimates utilized varanus priscus overestimates unreliable based
