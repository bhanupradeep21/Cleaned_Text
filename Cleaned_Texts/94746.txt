foraging theory case costs benefits limitations ultimately determine optimal decision rule predator follow one classical version optimal foraging theory optimal diet model also known prey choice model contingency model model predator encounters different prey items decides whether eat search profitable prey item model predicts foragers ignore low profitability prey items profitable items present profitability prey item dependent several ecological variables e amount energy calories prey item provides predator handling time h amount time takes predator handle food beginning time predator finds prey item time prey item eaten profitability prey item defined eh additionally search time amount time takes predator find prey item dependent abundance food ease locating model currency energy intake per unit time constraints include actual values e h well fact prey items encountered sequentially using variables optimal diet model predict predators choose two prey types big energy value handling time small energy value handling time order maximize overall rate energy gain predator must consider profitability two prey types assumed big profitable small thus predator encounters always choose eat higher profitability never bother go searching however animal encounters reject look profitable unless time would take find long costly worth thus animal eat search time since always favorable choose eat choice eat dependent abundance since length ie difficult find logically dependent density choice eat dependent abundance optimal diet model also predicts different types animals adopt different diets based variations search time idea extension model prey choice discussed equation rearranged give rearranged form gives threshold long must animal choose eat animals reach threshold defined generalists nature generalists include wide range prey items example generalist mouse consumes large variety seeds grains contrast predators relatively short still better choosing eat types animals defined specialists exclusive diets example specialist koala solely consumes eucalyptus general different animals across four functional classes predators exhibit strategies ranging across continuum generalist specialist additionally since choice eat dependent abundance discussed earlier becomes scarce reaches threshold animal switch exclusively eating eating words food within specialists diet becomes scarce specialist sometimes switch generalist previously mentioned amount time takes search prey item depends density prey functional response curves show rate prey capture function food density used conjunction optimal diet theory predict foraging behavior predators three different types functional response type functional response curve rate prey capture increases linearly food density low prey densities search time long since predator spends time searching eats every prey item finds prey density increases predator able capture prey faster faster certain point rate prey capture high predator doesnt eat every prey item encounters point predator choose prey items highest type ii functional response curve rate prey capture negatively accelerates increases food assumes predator limited capacity process food words food density increases handling time increases beginning curve rate prey capture increases nearly linearly prey density almost handling time prey density increases predator spends less less time searching prey time handling prey rate prey capture increases less less finally plateaus high number prey basically swamps type iii functional response curve sigmoid curve rate prey capture increases first prey density positively accelerated rate high densities changes negatively accelerated form similar type ii high prey densities top curve new prey item caught almost immediately predator able choosy doesnt eat every item finds assuming two prey types different profitabilities high abundance predator choose item higher eh however low prey densities bottom curve rate prey capture increases faster linearly means predator feeds prey type higher eh becomes less abundant predator start switch preference prey type lower eh type relatively abundant phenomenon known prey coevolution often makes unfavorable predator consume certain prey items since many antipredator defenses increase handling examples include porcupine quills palatability digestibility poison dart frog crypsis predator avoidance behaviors addition toxins may present many prey types predators include lot variability diets prevent one toxin reaching dangerous levels thus
