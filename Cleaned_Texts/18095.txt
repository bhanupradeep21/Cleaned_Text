sanfilippo syndrome also known mucopolysaccharidosis type iii mps iii rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease primarily affects brain spinal cord caused buildup large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans aka gags mucopolysaccharides bodys lysosomes affected children generally show signs symptoms birth although early indicators respiratory issues birth large head size umbilical early childhood begin develop developmental disability loss previously learned skills later stages disorder may develop seizures movement disorders patients sanfilippo syndrome usually live adolescence early disease manifests young children symptoms usually begin appear two six years affected infants appear normal although mild facial dysmorphism may noticeable mps diseases sanfilippo syndrome produces fewest physical anomalies initial symptomfree interval patients usually present slowing development andor behavioural problems followed progressive intellectual decline resulting severe dementia progressive motor acquisition speech often slow disease progresses increasing behavioral disturbance including temper tantrums hyperactivity destructiveness aggressive behavior pica difficulties toilet training sleep disturbance affected children initially normal muscle strength mobility behavioral disturbances may difficult manage disordered sleep particular presents significant problem care providerscitation needed final phase illness children become increasingly immobile unresponsive often require wheelchairs develop swallowing difficulties seizures lifespan affected child usually extend beyond late teens early individuals mps type iii tend mild skeletal anomalies osteonecrosis femoral head may present severe optic nerve atrophy deafness otitis seen moderate severe cases characteristics include coarse facial features thick lips synophrys stiff difficult clinically distinguish differences among four types sanfilippo syndrome however type usually severe subtype characterized earliest onset rapid clinical progression severe symptoms short median age death children afflicted type important simple treatable conditions ear infections toothaches overlooked behavior problems make examination difficult children mps type iii often increased tolerance pain bumps bruises ear infections would painful children often go unnoticed children mps type iii children mps type iii may bloodclotting problem mutations four different genes lead sanfilippo syndrome disorder inherited autosomal recessive pattern people two working copies gene unaffected people one working copy genetic carriers sanfilippo syndrome symptoms may pass defective gene children people two defective copies develop sanfilippo glycosaminoglycans gags chains sugar molecules found extracellular matrix cell membrane stored secretory granules gags stored cell lysosome degraded enzymes glycosidases sulfatases acetyltransferases deficiency enzymes lead four subtypes mps sanfilippo syndrome types b c considered clinically indistinguishable although mutations different genes responsible disease following discussion therefore applicable four conditionscitation needed urinalysis show elevated levels heparan sulfate four types sanfilippo syndrome show increased levels gags urine however less true sanfilippo syndrome mps disorders additionally urinary gag levels higher infants toddlers older children order avoid false negative urine test due dilution important urine sample taken first thing morningcitation needed diagnosis may confirmed enzyme assay skin fibroblasts white blood cells enzyme assay considered credible diagnostic tool detects whether enzymes normally present cellular pathway responsible breaking heparan sulfate present thereby providing definitive answer test also ideal younger patients collecting viable urine sample difficult impossible another diagnostic tool gene sequencing however genetic mutation carry never seen recorded patient would receive false negativecitation needed prenatal diagnosis possible chorionic villus sampling treatment remains largely supportive behavioral disturbances mpsiii respond poorly medication early diagnosis made bone marrow replacement may beneficial although missing enzyme manufactured given intravenously penetrate barrier therefore treat neurological manifestations disease along many lysosomal storage diseases mpsiii exists model monogenetic disease involving central nervous systemcitation needed several promising therapies development allievex conducting phase iiiii clinical trial enzyme replacement therapy mpsiiib former biomarin clinical ultragenyx former abeona clinical trial lysogene gene therapybased treatment potential therapies include chemical modification deficient enzymes allow penetrate barrier stabilisation abnormal active enzyme prevent degradation implantation stem cells strongly expressing missing enzyme future treatment successful must administered early possible currentlywhen mpsiii mainly diagnosed clinically stage probably late treatment effective neonatal screening programs would provide earliest possible diagnosiscitation needed flavonoid genistein decreases accumulation vitro animal studies clinical experiments suggest symptoms disease may alleviated adequate dose despite reported beneficial properties genistein also toxic side several support
