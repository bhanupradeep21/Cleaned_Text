inbreeding depression reduced biological fitness potential result inbreeding breeding related individuals biological fitness refers organisms ability survive perpetuate genetic material inbreeding depression often result population bottleneck general higher genetic variation gene pool within breeding population less likely suffer inbreeding depression though inbreeding outbreeding depression simultaneously occur inbreeding depression seems present groups organisms varies across mating systems hermaphroditic species often exhibit lower degrees inbreeding depression outcrossing species repeated generations selfing thought purge deleterious alleles populations example outcrossing nematode roundworm caenorhabditis remanei demonstrated suffer severely inbreeding depression unlike hermaphroditic relative c elegans experiences outbreeding inbreeding ie breeding closely related individuals results recessive traits manifesting genomes pairmates similar recessive traits occur offspring present parents genomes genetically similar parents often recessive traits appear offspring normally positive effect genes undergoing purifying selection homozygous state favored however closely related individuals increased likelihood homozygous deleterious genes offspring result unfit alleles confer advantage heterozygous andor homozygousdominant state fitness homozygousrecessive state may even zero meaning sterile unviable offspring example inbreeding depression shown right case recessive allele negative effects order phenotype become active gene must end homozygous aa geneotype aa takes dominance effect recessive genes result detrimental phenotypes causing organism less fit natural environment another mechanism responsible inbreeding depression fitness advantage heterozygosity known overdominance lead reduced fitness population many homozygous genotypes even deleterious recessive even dominant alleles result reduced fitness present homozygously see also hybrid vigour overdominance rare practical applications eg livestock breeding former thought significant may yield completely unviable offspring meaning outright failure pedigree latter result relatively reduced fitness natural selection effectively remove deleterious recessive genes population several reasons first deleterious genes arise constantly de novo mutation within population second offspring deleterious traits fit survival others different deleterious traits extremely unlikely equally affect reproduction especially disadvantageous recessive trait expressed homozygous recessive individual likely eliminate naturally limiting expression phenotype third recessive deleterious alleles masked heterozygosity dominantrecessive trait heterozygotes selected recessive deleterious alleles occur heterozygous state potentially deleterious expression masked corresponding wildtype allele masking phenomenon referred complementation see complementation genetics general sexual reproduction eukaryotes two fundamental aspects genetic recombination meiosis outcrossing proposed two aspects two natural selective advantages respectively proposed adaptive advantage meiosis facilitates recombinational repair dna damages otherwise difficult repair see dna repair adaptive advantage meiosis proposed adaptive advantage outcrossing complementation masking deleterious recessive see hybrid vigor heterosis selective advantage complementation may largely account avoidance inbreeding see kin recognition though unlikely animals avoid hybridization conservation effort appropriate population lost substantial genetic variation genetic drift detrimental effects inbreeding depression apparent similar population different populations species different deleterious traits therefore cross breeding less likely result homozygosity loci offspring known outbreeding enhancement performed extreme cases severe conservation managers zoo captive breeders prevent inbreeding depression however intermixing two different populations give rise unfit polygenic traits outbreeding depression ie yielding offspring lack genetic adaptations specific environmental conditions lowered fitness purebred individuals particular subspecies adapted local environment inbreeding may detrimental beneficial biological effects inbreeding depression humans occasion confounded socioeconomic cultural influences reproductive studies human populations shown age marriage duration marriage illiteracy contraceptive use reproductive compensation major determinants apparent fertility even amongst populations high proportion consanguinous however several small effects increased longer interbirth reduced overall noted certain isolated populations though studies show increased fitness offspring effect lifespan past cousin charles darwin one first scientists demonstrate effects inbreeding depression numerous experiments plants darwins wife emma first cousin concerned impact inbreeding ten children three died age ten younger three others childless longterm humans seek completely minimize inbreeding rather maintain optimal amount inbreeding vs outbreeding close inbreeding reduces fitness inbreeding depression inbreeding brings indeed inbreeding increases speed selection beneficial recessive codominant alleles eg protect small isolated highly inbred population gray wolves isle royale national park michigan usa considered imminent risk gray wolf population experiencing severe inbreeding depression primarily due homozygous expression strongly deleterious recessive defects arising severe inbreeding among wolves included reduced survival reproduction malformed vertebrae syndactyly probable cataracts unusual rope tail anomalous fur separate small inbred population gray wolves scandinavia also found suffer inbreeding depression due homozygous expression deleterious recessive whilst inbreeding depression found occur almost sufficiently studied species taxa notably angiosperms appear suffer lower fitness costs others inbred three mechanisms appear responsible purging differences ploidy selection must cautioned studies failing show absence inbreeding depression certain species arise small sample sizes supposedly outbred control group already suffering inbreeding depression frequently occurs populations undergone recent bottleneck naked mole purging selection occurs phenotypes deleterious recessive alleles exposed inbreeding thus selected lead detrimental mutations removed population demonstrated occur rapidly recessive alleles lethal efficiency purging depend relationship magnitude deleterious effect unmasked homozygotes importance genetic drift purging weaker nonlethal recessive lethal small populations drift strong influence cause fixation sublethal alleles weak fixation single allele specific gene also reduce fitness heterozygote advantage previously present ie heterozygous individuals higher fitness homozygotes either allele although phenomenon seems make usually small contribution inbreeding depression although naturally occurring purging important population survival deliberately attempting purge deleterious mutations population generally recommended technique improve fitness captive bred plants genetic load assessed test analogous inbreeding depression test called autogamy depression test many angiosperms flowering plants selffertilise several generations suffer little inbreeding depression useful species disperse widely therefore find growing novel environment conspecifics polyploidy two paired sets chromosome prevalent angiosperms ferns select animal taxa accounts several copies chromosome opposed two homozygosity less likely occur inbred offspring means recessive deleterious alleles expressed frequently many copies chromosome likely least one contain functional selection heterozygosity rare lost loci undergo purifying selection homozygous inbreeding depression also found occur gradually predicted wild populations highly inbred population scandinavian wolves appears due selection pressure heterozygous individuals generally better condition likely
