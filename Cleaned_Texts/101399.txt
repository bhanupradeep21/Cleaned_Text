confirmed remains sauroctonus recorded russian territory belong species progressus mainly represented cranial relatively complete skeleton discovered usili formation tanzania cataloged described german paleontologist friedrich von huene representative species scymnognathus parringtonia named honor francis rex skeleton reidentified french paleontologist denise sigogneaurussell specimen aelurognathus renamed aelurognathus paleontologist eva v gebauer reclassifies african representative genus claim would confirm however affiliation formally rejected new classifications based cranial anatomical traits show derived gorgonopsians separated two clade russian african origin leaving incertae sedis within latter specimens attributed species concrete affiliation worked date example wellpreserved skull cataloged mentioned briefly study concerning noctural vision nonmammalian synapsids referred cf skull size sauroctonus cm long indicating mediumsized gorgonopsian skull narrow posteriorly small orbits temporal fossa elongated cranial arches narrow dentary bone moderately viatkogorgon sauroctonus also high palatal tuberosities many teeth bones poorly sculpted incisors slightly larger postcanine also postcanine teeth maxillary taxonomic position sauroctonus changed many times decades russian paleontologist leonid petrovich tatarinov classified sauroctonus within family gorgonopsidae subfamily cynariopinae alongside various african genera cynariops scylacognathus book published sigogneaurussell leaves sauroctonus gorgonopsian whose placement mikhail ivakhnenko still classifies sauroctonus within gorgonopsidae without assigning thesis gebauer considers sauroctonus basal repetitive classification changes left sauroctonus uncertain position among gorgonopsians seeing close african genera others consider belong lineage paleontologists christian kammerer vladimir masyutin definitively reclassify sauroctonus group russian gorgonopsians alongside genera inostrancevia pravoslavlevia suchogorgon particular certain shared cranial characteristics precisely close contact pterygoid classification immediately followed next following cladogram showing
