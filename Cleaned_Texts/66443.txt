bongkrek acid also known bongkrekic respiratory toxin produced fermented coconut corn contaminated bacterium burkholderia gladioli pathovar highly toxic heatstable colorless odorless highly unsaturated tricarboxylic acid inhibits adpatp translocase also called mitochondrial adpatp carrier preventing atp leaving mitochondria provide metabolic energy rest bongkrek acid consumed contaminated foods mainly targets liver brain kidneys along symptoms include vomiting diarrhea urinary retention abdominal pain excessive outbreaks found indonesia china fermented coconut cornbased

inexpensiveness tempe bongkrek made extracting coconut meat byproduct coconut milk form cake fermented r oligosporus first outbreak bongkrek poisoning tempe bongkrek recorded dutch researchers however research find cause poisoning conducted indonesian government went economic depression condition caused people make tempe bongkrek instead buying directly welltrained producers result poisonings occurred frequently reaching year dutch scientists named wk mertens ag van veen eijkman institute jakarta started find cause poisoning early successfully identified source poisoning bacterium called pseudomonas cocovenenans bacterium also named burkholderia cocovenenans caused synthesis poisonous substance called bongkrek acid b cocovenenans commonly found plants soil taken coconuts corn leading synthesis bongkrek acid fermentation since consumption contaminated tempe bongkrek caused cases bongkrek acid poisoning indonesia overall reported mortality rate turned due severity situation production tempe bongkrek banned since multiple attempts synthesize bongkrek acid using different numbers fragments since first total synthesis acid ej corey one unique attempts synthesize bongkrek acid done shindos group kyushu university unlike attempts one levs shindos group used three fragments synthesize bongkrek fragments individually synthesized lab synthesis fragment required bongkrek

acid works interrupts transport process cytosolic adp inner membrane mitochondria inhibiting mitochondrial ant interesting part inner membrane mitochondria ant forms internal membrane channel mitochondrial permeability transition pore known mptp bongkrek acid permeable membrane binds surface ant inhibiting ant bongkrek acid binds surface ant acid forms hydrogen bonding interactions ant protein residues hydrogen bonding interactions mainly formed oxygens carboxylic acid fragments bongkrek acid prominent contribution hydrogen bonding interaction comes interaction side chain amino

center ant active site inhibiting action mitochondrial synthesis atp requires adp transport cytosol mitochondrial matrix ant meaning plays critical role providing energy cells first place adpatp exchange heavily depends transition two distinct conformation states ant cytosolic state cstate matrix state mstate cstate active site ant faces toward cytosol attracts cytosol adp mstate active site ant faces toward mitochondrial matrix release cytosol adp attracts synthesized atp interaction acid ant causes conformational change ant bongkrek acid locks ant mstate structure bongkrek acidant shows six transmembrane alpha helices covering active site ant preventing binding adenosine nucleotides means ant receive adp cytosol ultimately preventing synthesis consumption bongkrek acidcontaminated
