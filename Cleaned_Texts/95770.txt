general term positive responses another individuals conformity behavior intended match majority depending context obedience seen moral immoral amoral example psychological research individuals usually confronted immoral demands designed elicit internal conflict individuals still choose submit demand acting humans shown obedient presence perceived legitimate authority figures shown milgram experiment carried stanley milgram find nazis managed get ordinary people take part mass murders holocaust experiment showed obedience authority norm exception regarding obedience milgram said obedience basic element structure social life one point system authority requirement communal living man dwelling isolation forced respond defiance submission commands similar conclusion reached stanford prison experiment although fields studied obedience social psychology primarily responsible advancement research obedience studied experimentally several different ways one classical study stanley milgram part milgram experiment created highly controversial yet often replicated study like many experiments psychology milgrams setup involved deception participants experiment subjects told going take part study effects punishment learning reality experiment focuses peoples willingness obey malevolent authority subject served teacher associations arbitrary pairs words meeting teacher beginning experiment learner accomplice experimenter sat another room could heard seen teachers told give learner electric shocks increasing severity wrong answer subjects questioned procedure researcher accomplice milgram would encourage continue subjects told ignore agonized screams learner desire untied stop experiment pleas life risk suffered heart condition experiment researcher insisted go dependent variable experiment voltage amount shocks classical study obedience conducted stanford university phillip zimbardo main psychologist responsible experiment stanford prison experiment college age students put pseudo prison environment order study impacts social forces participants unlike milgram study participant underwent experimental conditions using random assignment half participants prison guards half prisoners experimental setting made physically resemble prison simultaneously inducing psychological state milgram study found participants would obey orders even obedience posed severe harm others encouragement perceived authority figure twothirds participants willing administer highest level shock learner result surprising milgram thought subjects learned childhood fundamental breach moral conduct hurt another person milgram attempted explain ordinary people capable performing potentially lethal acts human beings suggesting participants may entered agentic state allowed authority figure take responsibility actions another unanticipated discovery tension procedure caused subjects expressed signs tension emotional strain especially administering powerful shocks subjects fullblown uncontrollable seizures one occasion experiment zimbardo obtained similar results guards study obeyed orders turned aggressive prisoners likewise hostile resented guards cruelty guards consequent stress prisoners forced zimbardo terminate experiment prematurely previous two studies greatly influenced modern psychologists think obedience milgrams study particular generated large response psychology community modern study jerry burger replicated milgrams method alterations burgers method identical milgrams except shocks reached volts participants decided whether wanted continue experiment ended base condition ensure safety participants burger added twostep screening process rule participants may react negatively experiment modeled refusal condition two confederates used one confederate acted learner teacher teacher stopped going volts participant asked continue confederate left methodology considered ethical many adverse psychological effects seen previous studies participants occurred moving past volts additionally since milgrams study used men burger tried determine differences genders study randomly assigned equal numbers men women experimental using data previous study burger probed participants thoughts obedience participants comments previous study coded number times mentioned personal responsibility learners well number prods participants used first experiment also measured another study used partial replication milgrams work changed experimental setting one utrecht university studies obedience participants instructed make confederate taking employment test feel uncomfortable participants told make instructed stress remarks confederate ultimately made fail experimental condition control condition told make stressful remarks dependent measurements whether participant made stress remarks measuring absolute obedience number stress remarks relative following utrecht studies another study used stress remarks method see long participants would obey authority dependent measures experiment number stress remarks made separate measure personality designed measure individual burgers first study results similar ones found milgrams previous study rates obedience similar found milgram study showing participants tendency obey declined time additionally burger found genders exhibited similar behavior suggesting obedience occur participants independent gender burgers followup study found participants worried wellbeing learner hesitant continue study also found experimenter prodded participant continue likely stop experiment utrecht university study also replicated milgrams results found although participants indicated enjoy task completed bocchiaro zimbardo study similar levels obedience compared milgram utrecht studies also found participants would either stop experiment first sign learners pleas would continue end experiment called foot door addition studies additional research using participants different cultures including also found participants obedient one major assumptions obedience research effect caused experimental conditions thomas blass research contests point cases participant factors involving personality could potentially influence one blass reviews obedience found participants personalities impact respond people high authoritarian submission likely replicated finding research one experiments found watching portions original milgram studies film participants placed less responsibility punishing learner scored high measures addition personality factors participants resistant obeying authority high levels social obedience also studied outside milgram paradigm fields economics political science one economics study compared obedience tax authority lab versus home found participants much likely pay participation tax confronted finding implies even outside experimental settings people forgo potential financial gain obey authority another study involving political science measured public opinion supreme court case debating whether states legalize physician assisted suicide found participants tendency obey authorities important public opinion polling numbers religious moral although prior research demonstrated tendency obey persists across settings finding suggests personal factors like religion morality limit much people obey authority milgram stanford experiments conducted research settings psychiatrist charles k hofling published results field experiment obedience relationship natural hospital setting nurses unaware taking part experiment ordered unknown doctors administer dangerous doses fictional drug patients although several hospital rules disallowed administering drug circumstances nurses would given patient many traditional cultures regard obedience virtue historically societies expected children obey elders compare patriarchy matriarchy slaves owners serfs lords feudal society lords king everyone god

things picking sergeants hat floor marching right position marching standing formation orders gradually become demanding order soldiers place midst gunfire gets instinctively obedient response milgram experimenters interviewing potential volunteers participant selection process revealed several factors affected obedience outside actual experiment interviews eligibility conducted abandoned complex bridgeport despite dilapidated state building researchers found presence yale professor stipulated advertisement affected number people obeyed researched test obedience without yale professor milgram intentionally staged interviews discover factors affected similar conclusion reached stanford prison actual experiment prestige appearance power direct factor presence men dressed gray laboratory coats gave impression scholarship achievement thought main reason people complied administering thought painful dangerous similar conclusion reached stanford prison experiment raj persaud article comments milgrams attention detail experiment research also conducted amazing verve example milgram ensured experimenter wear grey lab coat rather white one precisely want subjects think experimenter medical doctor thereby limit implications findings power physician authority despite fact prestige often thought separate factor fact merely subset power factor thus prestige conveyed yale professor laboratory coat manifestation experience status associated andor social status afforded image according milgram essence obedience consists fact person comes view instrument carrying another persons wishes therefore longer sees responsible actions critical shift viewpoint occurred person essential features obedience follow thus major problem subject recapture control regnant processes committed purposes besides hypothetical agentic state milgram proposed existence factors accounting subjects obedience politeness awkwardness withdrawal absorption technical aspects task tendency attribute impersonal quality forces essentially human belief experiment served desirable end sequential nature action anxiety another explanation milgrams results invokes belief perseverance underlying cause people counted realize seemingly benevolent authority fact malevolent even faced overwhelming evidence suggests authority indeed malevolent hence underlying cause subjects striking conduct could well
