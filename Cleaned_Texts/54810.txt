overjustification effect occurs expected external incentive money prizes decreases persons intrinsic motivation perform task overjustification explanation phenomenon known motivational crowding overall effect offering reward previously unrewarded activity shift extrinsic motivation undermining preexisting intrinsic motivation rewards longer offered interest activity lost prior intrinsic motivation return extrinsic rewards must continuously offered motivation sustain overjustification effect widely demonstrated many settings one earliest demonstrations effect edward deci colleagues conducted laboratory experiment subjects showing baseline interest solving puzzle exposed two different conditions control group paid three days experimental group paid first day paid second day paid third day subjects given break middle session observed whatever wanted results showed experimental group spent significantly time control group playing puzzle break time day paid significantly less day paid interpreted evidence extrinsic monetary reward significantly reduced intrinsic motivation engage researchers southern methodist university conducted experiment female university students measured subjects continued interest cognitive task word game initial performance different incentives subjects divided two groups members first group told would rewarded competence aboveaverage players would paid belowaverage players would paid less members second group told would rewarded completion pay scaled number repetitions number hours playing afterwards half subjects group told overperformed half told underperformed regardless well subject actually members first group generally showed greater interest game continued playing longer time members second group overperformers continued playing longer underperformers first group underperformers continued playing longer overperformers second group study showed rewards reflect competence higher rewards lead less intrinsic motivation rewards reflect competence higher rewards lead greater intrinsic richard titmuss suggested paying blood donations might reduce supply blood donors test field experiment three treatments conducted first treatment donors receive compensation second treatment donors received small payment third treatment donors given choice payment equivalentvalued contribution charity none three treatments affected number male donors second treatment almost halved number female donors however allowing contribution charity fully eliminated according selfperception theory person infers causes behavior based external constraints presence strong constraint reward would lead person conclude performing behavior solely reward shifts persons motivation intrinsic laboratory studies indicated individuals conditions extrinsic rewards showed diminished intrinsic motivation deci colleagues eg deci ryan developed cognitive evaluation theory explain results subtheory selfdetermination theory cognitive evaluation theory explains control competence underlie intrinsic motivation extrinsic rewards affect intrinsic motivation dependent individuals interpretation intrinsic motivation increases individuals interpret rewards pertaining positive information competence selfcontrol results whereas interpret results indicative external control decreases feelings selfcontrol competence turn decreases intrinsic motivation cognitive evaluation theory also suggests social context another implication intrinsic motivation social cues exert either positive negative effects intrinsic motivation depending messages context conveys regarding persons autonomy competence verbal rewards positive feedback praise predicted experienced controlling hence decreasing intrinsic motivation however verbal rewards informational experienced controlling predicted exert positive selfdetermination theory broad theory motivation work organizations maintains predictions cognitive evaluation theory also recognizes limitations theory organizational conditions predictions apply less relevant realworld settings cognitive evaluation theory fails recognize theory differentiates various types motivational states distinguishes organizational conditions extrinsic rewards effective intrinsic rewards examines individual differences orientation toward intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation discusses managerial behavior enhance intrinsic motivation findings deci et al study supported selfdetermination theory approach work motivation showing managers impact work attitudes employees study reported managerial autonomy support included provision options giving relevant information nonautonomous way acknowledging subordinates perspectives cultivating selfinitiation resulted employees positive workrelated attitudes higher level job satisfaction increased level trust corporate overjustification effect controversial challenges previous findings psychology general effectiveness reinforcement increasing behavior also widespread practice using incentives classroom findings fail account situations whereby nature activities differ cases initial level intrinsic interest activity low introducing extrinsic contingencies may essential producing conclusions challenged separate found tangible rewards offered outperforming others performing uninteresting tasks intrinsic motivation low lead increased intrinsic stated detrimental effects rewards motivation occur specific restricted set conditions could easily set analyses included highinterest lowinterest tasks whereas original metaanalyses conducted deci colleagues restricted analyses tasks participants initially high interest fact metaanalysis showed rewards increase intrinsic motivation tasks initially hold little intrinsic also according eisenberger cameron claimed negative effects extrinsic rewards task interest derived deci study take consideration conditions manufactured laboratory settings produce effects true reflections situations real world example deci study incentive provided one session arbitrarily withdrawn next incentive plans exist real world also reduced intrinsic interest seen subjects may explained negative reaction reward eisenberger colleagues also claimed validity dependent measure highly questionable deci study laboratory results used amount free time spend task dependent measure shown far weaker self reports used measures deci study gives far less weight self reports however selfreports subjects level internal motivation seem direct measure psychological state considerable research also shown rewards tend enhance feelings competence autonomy high standards pressure competitiveness able increase effects example employees view earning incentives enjoyable rather dreaded tool management control findings contrast psychological mechanism effects deci colleagues claimed past also past years notable academic reviews rewards confirmed monetary incentives shown significantly increase additionally activities require significant level mastery engagement attractiveness becomes apparent individual cases external incentives may useful build individuals level token economy programs represent one example evidence showing programs successfully implemented extrinsic rewards increase interest certain broad classes also differences effect among different age groups according deci et al negative effects extrinsic contingencies intrinsic motivation seem severe children college students one possible explanation college students greater cognitive capacity enabling better separate informational controlling aspects rewards hence able interpret rewards indicators effective performance rather controlling behavior causes operate performancegoal orientations therefore speculated differences far greater children employed rebuttal defended original findings concluding analysis cameron flawed camerons inclusion boring tasks analyzing potential overjustification effects made little theoretical practical sense rebuttal argued cognitive evaluation theory consistent structure explaining effects rewards intrinsic motivation pointing several papers supported findings lepper et als study suggest presenting extrinsic rewards poses central problems schooling system fails preserve intrinsic interest learning exploration child may seem possess initial phase school also severe ramifications education system seems almost undermine childrens spontaneous interest process learning instead motivation driven extrinsic rewards research area suggests parents educators rely intrinsic motivation preserve feelings autonomy competence much task unattractive intrinsic motivation insufficient eg household chores extrinsic rewards useful provide incentives behavior school programs provide money prizes reading books criticized potential reduce intrinsic motivation overjustification however study pizza hut program book found participation program neither increased decreased reading although motivating students read rewarding may undermine interest reading may also encourage reading skills necessary developing interest reading cognitive evaluation theory predicts different types rewards exert different effects according theory task noncontingent rewards like benefits based things performance employment consist information regarding autonomy competence effect intrinsic motivation task contingent rewards hand like salary awarded performing completing task experienced controlling hence negative effect intrinsic motivation study conducted deckop cirka reported introducing merit pay programs nonprofit organization led decreased feelings autonomy intrinsic motivation indicating rewards undermine intrinsic motivation work performance contingent rewards like monetary incentives given good performance meeting certain standard experienced highly controlling hence decreasing intrinsic motivation shirom westman melamed study found payforperformance plans resulted lower well bluecollar workers especially evident felt jobs however certain cases reward also conveys information competence turn reduce negative term gamification refers application game design elements nongame order drive participation often goal encouraging greater engagement nongame context providing symbolic rewards points badges virtual currency however number academics critics expressed concern rewards may backfire via overjustification effect drawing directly selfdetermination theory critics gamification express concerns gamified contexts foursquare might provide expected rewards activities adequately meet selfdetermination theorys three innate needs intrinsic autonomy therefore reduce intrinsic interest websites rely usergenerated content sometimes offer monetary rewards contributions may cause contributors succumb overjustification effect stop example amazon mechanical turk allows creator task offer monetary

creative empirical evidence shows expected financial rewards crowd intrinsic motivation size monetary reward simultaneously provides extrinsic motivation size monetary reward large enough compensate loss intrinsic motivation overall engagement decline survey dataset revealed small financial payments reduced volunteer hours among swiss citizens median financial reward provided volunteers caused
