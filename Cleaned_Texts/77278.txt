sinophoneus extinct genus carnivorous dinocephalian therapsid belonging family anteosauridae lived million years ago beginning middle permian lower roadian gansu province northern china known skull adult individual holotype well many skulls juvenile specimens latter first considered belonging different animal named stenocybus reinterpreted immature sinophoneus sinophoneus shows combination characters present anteosaurs bulbous profile snout external nostrils located front canine reminiscent basal anteosaur archaeosyodon massive transverse pterygoids processes enlarged distal ends similar derived anteosaurs anteosaurus titanophoneus first phylogenetic analyzes identified sinophoneus basal anteosaurinae recent analysis positioned outside anteosaurinae syodontinae subclades recovers basal anteosauridae holotype sinophoneus somewhat dorsoventrally deformed skull measuring cm length tip snout occipital cm total length posterior border upper part orbits crushed giving oval shape originally circular temporal arches missing dentition upper jaws lower jaw preserved skull mainly characterized presence median ridge starting eye sockets poorly developed extending tip snout robust protrudes beyond dorsal view nostrils smaller anteosaurs archaeosyodon nostrils entirely located front upper canine whereas anteosaurs mainly located behind canine snout profile bulbous archaeosyodon transverse processes pterygoids enlarged distal end giving palmate morphology ventral view anteosaurus cheng li described small dinocephalian stenocybus acidentatus complete skull igcags v jaw remains second specimen found site sinophoneus although article cheng li compare stenocybus directly sinophoneus consider first sufficiently different anteosauridae place new family name clade later correctly modified stenocybidae russian paleontologist mikhail feodosievich latter also first researcher suggest stenocybus could juvenile form christian kammerer also considered stenocybus young sinophoneus proportions first absence pachyostosis tall narrow skull relatively large orbits smaller temporal fenestra typical characters juvenile therapids addition immature skull stenocybus already shows beginning median ridge snout characteristic sinophoneus well bulbous profile snout latter result kammerer regards stenocybus acidentatus junior synonym sinophoneus conclusion shared liu li new specimens mentioned short note published jiang ji described two new specimens stenocybus snout articulated jaws right dentary almost complete dentition belonging two individuals slightly larger holotype although providing new information anatomy animal number teeth mandible jiang ji believe phylogenetic position stenocybus remains difficult confirm synonymy stenocybus sinophoneus proposed kammerer liu li must proved discovery complete however jiang jis wishes realize months earlier liu described seven new skulls sinophoneus including one associated postcranial remains mentioned short note skulls belong specimens smaller holotype represent various ontogenetic stages confirm skulls stenocybus actually represent several juvenile stages ontogenetic series genus sinophoneus incomplete unrepresented size range known juvenile skulls measuring cm length known adult skull measuring cm however ontogenetic series makes possible identify important morphological changes juveniles adults genus skull juvenile relatively tall narrow pachyostosis absent adult skull becomes much wider lower notably bones palate widen considerably pachyostosis observed bones surrounding orbits medial ridge skull roof weak smallest known specimen pair bosses present midline interorbital region ridge extends pineal foramen point slightly beyond orbit juvenile pronounced adults extends end snout ends prominently nostrils orbits increase slightly size growth contrast dimensions temporal fenestrae increase dramatically triangular shape much smaller orbit smaller specimens size close orbits somewhat larger specimens much larger orbit adult latter therefore equipped mandibular adductor musculature much developed juveniles could inflict proportionally much powerful bites differences indicate sinophoneus juveniles adults certainly occupied distinct ecological niches covet pattern also known south african genus fossils sinophoneus come single locality dashankou site near yumen city western gansu province china stratigraphically belong qingtoushan formation called xidagou whose sediments fluvial radiometric dating known qingtoushan formation liu et al assigns lower roadian age lowermost middle permian thus partially filling olson latter corresponds period time poor fossil record located lower permian dominated pelycosaurs midmiddle permian wordian therapids take first place terrestrial ecosystems roadian age attributed qingtoushan formation estimate derived degree evolution dashankou fauna fauna composed animals belonging ancient lineages rather typical upper carboniferous lower permian temnospondyl dissorophoid bolosauridae also derived forms rather typical middle upper permian anthracosaurs chroniosuchidae ingentidens moradisaurine several therapsids latter however exclusively represented phylogenetically basal taxa raranimus basal therapid known biseridens basal new classification sinophoneus identified liu basal anteosauridae additional argument favor roadian age dashankou moreover latter correlated russian parabradysaurus silantjevi assemblage zone roadian coinciding basal phylogenetic position lower roadian age sinophoneus makes one oldest
