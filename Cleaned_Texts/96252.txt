riney found caughley presented methods determine mortality patterns mammals looked mortality rate curves qx among ungulates rats voles sheep man found followed common pattern u shaped pattern high juvenile mortality followed decrease steady increase mortality punctuated sharp increase mortality pattern shown although age mortality differs among species well cause death disease lack food predation trend mammal species follow important wildlife management since shows regardless natural mortality factors populations tend high juvenile mature deaths working forest service attending university canterbury phd caughley modified lotka fishers equations birth rates populations ones applied seasonally breeding wrote animal world season breeding births treated occurring one point time equations could used seasonally breeding modification gave accurate estimate reproductive value population without overestimating births assuming year around caughley birch published rate increase point misuses equation originally applied mainly insects claim questions asked entomologists necessarily asked mammalogists vice difference questions caused misuse particular equations realm vertebrate studies point rate increase given density population stable age distribution rs obtainable looking mammals assumptions used make age distributions used estimate rs cause second argument maximum rate population stable age distribution increases given environment rm intrinsic rate increase calculated correct however used incorrectly mammalogists thought vertebrate life table fecundity data somehow paralleled caged insects held low density correction infer rate increase given population would initial density higher way corrected misapplication models managing populations would use right equation question asking caughley clarify methods would applicable population ecology also condensed material thought useful analysis vertebrate populations distilled analyses thought relevant

book covers overview population ecology second part applied ecology management last publication conservation biology theory gives history prehistoric historic extinctions well collection case studies contains chapters look different ways population dynamics risks legislation approached perez claims high volume conservation textbooks today one handbook diagnosing treating problems populations diagnostic style part due written two field biologists something clinchy say took sixteen years making first time field biologists written book conservation biology breakthrough conservation textbooks written lab ecologists used teach field ecologists abstract theoretical way caughley advocated use declining population paradigm conservation paradigm seeks discover population declining prevent declines opposes small population paradigm seeks determine long small population declining population paradigm overly theoretical deal population viability analysis effective population size minimum viable populations problems related genetics caughley pointed require model go observe going system cause effect although lack mathematical model hinders generalisations requiring case case shortly caughleys death hedrick colleagues argued declining population paradigm called inclusive population viability analysis first reading difficult discern counter argument since state agree caughley broader understanding synthesis ideas upon closer examination however concept statement one always interpret significance deterministic factors unless proper inclusive pva carried paper reaction caughleys promotion common sense written encouraged use mathematical models caughley however mathematical models used determine rates increase dispersal fecundity truly understand controversy one must read two articles viva articles written rebuttal hedrick colleagues claim caughleys ideas overly simplistic clinchy krebs explain fact simple enough basic distinction conservation biology field
