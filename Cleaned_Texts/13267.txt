social facilitation social phenomenon presence others improves individual task people better tasks people rather task alone situations elicit social facilitation include coaction performing audience appears depend task norman tripletts early investigations describes social facilitation occur instances coaction performing task presence people performing similar task necessarily engaging direct interactions triplett first observed cyclists finding cyclists rode faster speeds competing cyclists compared cycling social facilitation also known occur performing task front audience periods observation sometimes referred audience effects instance exercise meumann found watched individuals could lift heavier weights compared research effects coaction audience effects social facilitation attempt discover types situations always trigger social facilitation robert zajonc theorized perhaps task complexity simple versus complex task could influence whether social facilitation zajonc predicted simple tasks would result social facilitation within group settings whereas complicated tasks would according zajonc tasks easier learn perform others require dominant responses dominant responses behavioral responses top organisms behavioral repertoire making readily available dominant tasks elicit dominant responses typically simpler less effortful easier perform compared tasks eliciting nondominant nondominant responses harder carry sum simple tasks require dominant responses whereas complex tasks require nondominant performing tasks groups simple tasks associated social facilitation however complex tasks presence others becomes distracting attempting elicit nondominant responses require effort later research develops idea coaction audience effects task complexity instance yerkesdodson law applied social facilitation states mere presence people enhance performance speed accuracy wellpracticed tasks degrade performance less familiar compared performance alone presence others tend perform better simple wellrehearsed tasks worse complex new audience effect attempts explain psychologically presence audience leads people performing tasks better cases worse idea explored studies showed presence passive audience facilitated better performance simple task studies showed presence passive audience inhibited performance difficult task one well practiced possibly due psychological pressure stress see law many factors contribute social facilitation many theories proposed try explain phenomena social facilitation defined tendency individuals perform differently mere presence others specifically individuals perform better simpler wellrehearsed tasks perform worse complex new ones relation three main empirical relationships activation evaluation attention theories activation theory describes physiologically aroused affects functioning evaluation theory relates systematic assessment worth merit object attention theory takes account possession mind including focalization concentration consciousness studied effect performance audience tripletts experiment simple design cyclists performance alone compared cyclists performance racing another cyclist found cyclist slowest racing clock another cyclist attributed results competitive instinct releases energy available pedaling alone tripletts study started revolution studies attempting examine theory peoples performance influenced presence others studying competitive nature found children much faster completing given activity winding string competing caused wonder whether simply another individual would effect determine triplett studied race time cyclists found cyclists faster race times presence cyclists theorized faster times presence others made individuals competitive research led triplett theorize presence others increases individuals performances noncompetitive situations well floyd allport coined term social allport conducted studies participants sat either alone participants variety tasks word association tasks multiplication assessments found people performed better group setting alone majority however time social facilitation simply meant increase response merely sight sound others making hazel markus university michigan conducted experiment test hypothesis mere presence others influence individuals task lacked rubric structure likely cause subject apprehensive would evaluated used performance times task dressing undressing familiar unfamiliar clothing compared subjects working alone working presence passive inattentive person working presence attentive spectator compared alone condition social conditions audience incidental audience enhanced performance welllearned aspects task dressing undressing subjects familiar clothing hindered subjects performance complex aspects task dressing undressing using unfamiliar clothing concluded presence others sufficient condition social facilitation social interference effects therefore presence audience causes individual better simple task worse complicated task study donation rates increased presence observers neuroimaging revealed presence observers significantly affected activation ventral striatum choice whether raefelis metaanalysis social facilitation phenomenon three conclusions made firstly presence others heightens individuals physiological arousal individual performing complex task moreover mere presence others increases speed simple task performance decrease speed complex task performance lastly social facilitation effects surprisingly unrelated performers evaluation study done compared performance individuals autism spectrum disorder asd typically developing td individuals task presence another experiment conducted tested hypothesis individual asd respond presence experimenters thus altering results major three approaches social facilitation activation evaluation attention theories activation theory describes arousal relates social facilitation evaluation theory discusses assessed audience affects social facilitation attention theory takes account effect distractions environment social facilitation robert trying figure studies showed peoples performance hindered presence others rather made accurate designed experiment would examine performance someone simple vs complex task front others found people performing simple task presence others could complete greater accuracy alone something psychologists aware time however zajonc found revolutionary time period people attempt perform tasks complex familiar complete less accuracy presence others alone thus social inhibition born robert zajonc developed stern activation theory proposing generalized drive hypothesis social facilitation zajoncs generalized drive hypothesis first theory addressed presence others increased performance sometimes yet decreased times argued presence others serves source arousal heightened arousal increases likelihood organism better welllearned habitual responses reason arousal improves performance simple welllearned tasks impairs performance complex welllearned tasks zajoncs reasoning based yerkesdodson law holds performance works like inverse u function means individuals optimal drive higher simpler wellpracticed tasks individuals optimal drive lower complex lesspracticed tasks presence people arouses us increases drive level individuals performance enhanced task simple high levels energy diminished task tested theories people complete word association tasks alone presence others found tasks done much faster presence others activation theories include alertness hypothesis monitoring hypothesis challenge threat alertness hypothesis says people uncertain observers act presence others become alert performer uncertain observers act situation heightened alertness causes perform better monitoring hypothesis posits social facilitation effects occur performer familiar observers situation cases performer knows observer respond situation take place therefore situations performers arousal increase person unfamiliar observers situation heshe experience uncertainty arousal increase heshe familiar challenge threat hypothesis states people perform worse complex tasks better simple tasks presence others type cardiovascular response task performing simple task presence others people show normal cardiovascular response however performing complex task presence others cardiovascular response similar person threatening position normal cardiovascular response serves improve performance threatlike cardiovascular response serves impede henchy glass proposed evaluation approach social evaluation apprehension hypothesis states mere presence others increases individual activationarousal rather fear evaluated audience studied reactivity male high school college students responses based strength developed prior training found groups felt performance evaluated dominant responses groups simply presence audience without evaluated nickolas cottrell came evaluation apprehension theory theory also explains evaluative pressure source increased productivity presence others rather arousal response identified zajonc theory assumes people learn experience source reward punishments people interact therefore people associate social situations evaluation hence feel apprehensive presence people evaluation apprehension improves performance simple tasks debilitating complex difficult tasks selfpresentation theory another evaluation approach social facilitation theory posits social facilitation product peoples motivation maintain positive self image face presence others motivation leads people behave ways form good impressions therefore results social facilitation evaluative situations situations non evaluative less evaluative social facilitation effects often eliminated addition individuals confident performed better evaluative situations presence others compared working alone extension evaluation approach learned drive hypothesis developed cottrell wack sekerak rittle states activation increases actors feel audience capable evaluating performance words implies cause evaluation apprehension comes learned audience studied participant performed welllearned tasks presence audience focused another event presence audience focused tasks performed found participants performing latter group audience focused participants largely gave dominant weiss miller furthered developed evaluation approach hypothesizing activation increases actors fear negative theory suggests activation increases audience competitors cause negative feelings anxiety actor however goods development evaluation apprehension takes opposite approach hypothesizes activation increases actors expect positive conflicting theories evaluation approach controversy reliability metaanalysis done bond found even individuals presence nonvisible nonevaluative audience activation still occurs increase dominant social orientation theory social facilitation suggests people differ orientation toward social situations individual differences predicts show social facilitation impairment performance theory states individuals positive orientation likely display social facilitation effects whereas individuals negative orientation likely experience impairment performance positive orientation individuals self confident react positively challenges theory states individuals find safety numbers hand individuals negative orientation defined characteristics low self esteem inhibited feeling threatened presence people explanations shifted activation theories attention theories imply withdrawal things necessary order deal effectively others attention theories explain social facilitation include distractionconflict hypothesis overload hypothesis feedbackloop model capacity distractionconflict theory robert baron proposed level performance task predicted amount distractions environment surrounding task theory states distraction source social facilitation simple tasks cause attentional conflict increase motivation increases drive proposed zajonc complex difficult tasks however increase drive enough counteract detrimental effects distraction therefore results impaired performance distraction source social facilitation demonstrated stroop task color word association task stroop task participants shown color name word printed different color participants job provide color word word printed reaction time slower errors arise word color word match however task completed people errors decrease situations presence others may help narrowing focus attention overload hypothesis works according distractionconflict hypothesis saying distracters lead increased arousal rather cognitive overload individual bombarded excessive information working cognitive overload individuals worse complex tasks better simple performance increases simple tasks performers focus attention new stimuli instead irrelevant stimuli characteristic simple tasks performance decreases complex tasks performers focus distracters also need focus relevant stimuli characteristic complex tasks handle information presented feedbackloop model postulates people feel observed focus attention state individuals become aware differences actual behavior anticipated behavior feedbackloop model people better presence others increased awareness capacity model social facilitation focuses role types information processing performance front audience rather performance different type tasks simple complex front audience capacity model suggests tasks require automatic information processing presence others cause problems shortterm memory required automatic information processing performance quality increases however tasks require controlled information processing presence others impede level performance shortterm memory necessary focus attention audience well task selfpresentation approach social facilitation two main theories one regarding arousal drive one without first theory argues presence audience individuals become concerned possible embarrassment occurs negative evaluation leads activation arousal increased drive cause dominant effects second theory argues issue arousal rather simple responses individual wants appear competent presence others task easy individual want make himherself appear even competent exceptionally well task however task difficult fear present incompetent turn make embarrassed impede however significant research done evidence supporting selfpresentation approach main study looking approach done bond include independent measures selfpresentation able conclusively prove validity norman triplett pioneered research social facilitation studying competitive nature children study child given string told wind found children performed much better competing one another research led triplett theorize presence others increases individuals performances noncompetitive situations chapman ran experiment found levels laughter among yearold children highest two children listened funny material together coaction condition furthermore levels laughter higher one child listened funny material presence another child audience condition one child listened funny material alone alone condition results indicate laughter also socially prejudice often considered easily learned performed response therefore following logic zajoncs drive theory social facilitation prejudice also likely socially facilitated individuals may likely express prejudicial views presence others private de castro demonstrated social facilitation affects food intake extending time spent eating meal results also showed presence family friends comparison presence mere companions increases food intake greater degree possibly due release inhibitory restraints intake occurs people feel comfortable around people familiar furthermore males ate food people alone females ate food people alone de castro attributes timeextension model social facilitation time spent meal increased meal social occasion results suggest presence people meal increases intake extending time spent meal probably result social interaction family friends even larger effect probably producing relaxation consequent disinhibition restraint furthermore results also suggest social facilitation similar effects men women asked write many words possible response given word participants produced words presence another person however study replicated individuals stuttered spoke participants produced words alone rather presence another lee edward travis conducted study find kind effect audience

include kind crowd present supportive crowd eg crowd teams home ground hostile crowd eg crowd team playing away game also proximity crowd size crowd could influence result audience effect factors nature task coping skills potential negative effects audience even playing venue home away could things consider examining audience social facilitation widespread phenomenon society many public tasks demonstrate effects costs benefits social facilitation taking exams high school college environment performing sporting events people may perform better fall short depending tasks complexity many experiments people display signs social facilitation even everyday tasks driving effect even seen animals displayed zajonc heingarter hermans study business also use social facilitation advantage specifically online auctions takes account emergence instant messaging communication availability technologies interaction buyers sellers traditional facetoface markets creates phenomena social facilitation presence others impacts behaviour performance study involving javabased internet dutch auction findings indicated social facilitation indeed occur participants improve results stay longer auction conditions higher virtual presence participants also indicate preference auction arrangements higher degrees virtual social facilitations definition explanations without controversy social psychologists first debate whether social facilitation humans mere presence whether must evaluation concluded although influence mere presence others easily concealed many complex social factors one variables contributes power others influence individuals one greatest controversies surrounding social facilitation origination psychologists continue debate whether social facilitation adopted innate biology humans animals social learning either interaction society individual interaction people society general research expansion experiments theories may begin resolve complicate light certain weaknesses inadequacies drive theory explanation social facilitation argued need cognitive approach cognitive model constructed expectancy theory framework shown plausible alternative explanation employee performance effects social facilitation much evidence presented controversy recommended direction future research test furthermore difficulty determining social facilitation approach accurate biggest conflict comes activation mere presence evaluation approaches activation approach stating mere presence audience leads social facilitation evaluation approach stating fear judged capable audience leads social facilitation despite two clearly conflicting schools thought researchers able conclusively prove one httpsenwikipediaorgwikisocialfacilitation
