rheumatoid lung disease disease lung associated ra rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid lung disease characterized pleural effusion pulmonary fibrosis lung nodules pulmonary hypertension common symptoms associated disease include shortness breath cough chest pain fever estimated one quarter people rheumatoid arthritis develop disease likely develop among elderly men history rheumatoid lung separate often associated interstitial lung diseaseild common people may present symptoms none least common exact cause rheumatoid lung disease unknown however associated factors could due largely smoking sometimes medicines used treat rheumatoid arthritis especially methotrexate may result lung prevention ra complex poorly understood disease however characteristic presence antibodies citrullinated proteins anticcp suggests pathogenic mechanisms unique ra recent studies suggest link smoking hladrbse anticcp ra smoking long linked ra worsens articular disease well rheumatoid lung disease exposure cigarette smoke leads activation padi enzymes deaminate arginine citrulline producing autoantigens like citrullinated collagen fibrinogen autoantigenic peptides containing citrulline residues preferentially bound hladrb se proteins presented cells interact ccpspecific b cells found sites containing autoantigen produce inflammatory cytokines autoantibodies accelerate disease bacterial viral infections respiratory tract may also exacerbate pulmonary inflammation rheumatoid lung diagnosis ra formerly based detection rheumatoid factor rf however rf also associated autoimmune diseases
