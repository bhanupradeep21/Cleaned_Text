reproductive system organism also known genital system biological system made anatomical organs involved sexual reproduction many nonliving substances fluids hormones pheromones also important accessories reproductive unlike organ systems sexes differentiated species often significant differences differences allow combination genetic material two individuals allows possibility greater genetic fitness mammals major organs reproductive system include external genitalia penis vulva well number internal organs including gameteproducing gonads testicles ovaries diseases human reproductive system common widespread particularly communicable sexually transmitted vertebrates similar reproductive systems consisting gonads ducts openings however great diversity physical adaptations well reproductive strategies every group vertebrates vertebrates share key elements reproductive systems gameteproducing organs known gonads females gonads connected oviducts opening outside body typically cloaca sometimes unique pore vagina intromittent organ human reproductive system usually involves internal fertilization sexual intercourse process male inserts erect penis females vagina ejaculates semen contains sperm sperm travels vagina cervix uterus fallopian tubes fertilization ovum upon successful fertilization implantation gestation fetus occurs within females uterus approximately nine months process known pregnancy humans gestation ends childbirth delivery following labor labor consists muscles uterus contracting cervix dilating baby passing vagina female genital organ humans babies children nearly helpless require high levels parental care many years one important type parental care use mammary glands female breasts nurse female reproductive system two functions first produce egg cells second protect nourish offspring birth male reproductive system one function produce deposit sperm humans high level sexual differentiation addition differences nearly every reproductive organ numerous differences typically occur secondary sexual characteristics male reproductive system series organs located outside body around pelvic region male contribute towards reproduction process primary direct function male reproductive system provide male sperm fertilization ovum major reproductive organs male grouped three categories first category sperm production storage production takes place testicles housed temperature regulating scrotum immature sperm travel epididymis development storage second category ejaculatory fluidproducing glands include seminal vesicles prostate vas deferens final category used copulation deposition spermatozoa sperm within male include penis urethra vas deferens cowpers gland major secondary sex characteristics include larger muscular stature deepened voice facial body hair broad shoulders development adams apple important sexual hormone males androgen particularly testosterone testes release hormone controls development sperm hormone also responsible development physical characteristics men facial hair deep voice human female reproductive system series organs primarily located inside body around pelvic region female contribute towards reproductive process human female reproductive system contains three main parts vulva leads vagina vaginal opening uterus uterus holds developing fetus ovaries produce females ova breasts involved parenting stage reproduction classifications considered part female reproductive system vagina meets outside vulva also includes labia clitoris urethra intercourse area lubricated mucus secreted bartholins glands vagina attached uterus cervix uterus attached ovaries via fallopian tubes ovary contains hundreds ova singular ovum approximately every days pituitary gland releases hormone stimulates ova develop grow one ovum released passes fallopian tube uterus hormones produced ovaries prepare uterus receive ovum ovum move fallopian tubes awaits sperm fertilization occur occur ie sperm fertilization lining uterus called endometrium unfertilized ova shed cycle process menstruation ovum fertilized sperm attach endometrium embryonic development begin mammal reproductive systems similar however notable differences nonhuman mammals humans instance male mammals penis stored internally erect penis bone additionally males females species remain continually sexually fertile humans females mammalian species dont grow permanent mammaries like human females either like humans groups mammals descended testicles found within scrotum however others descended testicles rest ventral body wall groups mammals elephants undescended testicles found deep within body cavities near reproductive system marsupials unique female two vaginae open externally one orifice lead different compartments within uterus males usually twopronged penis corresponds females two marsupials typically develop offspring external pouch containing teats newborn young joeys attach post uterine development also marsupials unique prepenial mm long newborn joey instinctively crawls wriggles cm clinging fur way mothers pouch regards males mammalian penis similar structure reptiles small percentage birds scrotum present mammals regarding females vulva unique mammals homologue birds reptiles amphibians clitoris however found reptiles place uterus vagina nonmammal vertebrate groups unmodified oviduct leading directly cloaca shared exithole gametes urine feces monotremes ie platypus echidnas group egglaying mammals also lack uterus vagina vulva respect reproductive system resembling reptile domestic canines sexual maturity puberty occurs ages months males females although delayed two years age large breeds mares reproductive system responsible controlling gestation birth lactation well estrous cycle mating behavior stallions reproductive system responsible sexual behavior secondary sex characteristics large crest penises eventoed ungulates sshape rest lie pocket skin belly corpora cavernosa slightly developed erection mainly causes curvature extend leads extension thickening penis cetaceans similar eventoed ungulates penis contains structure called urethral male female birds cloaca opening eggs sperm wastes pass intercourse performed pressing lips cloacae together sometimes known intromittent organ known phallus analogous mammals penis female lays amniotic eggs young fetus continues develop leaves females body unlike vertebrates female birds typically one functional ovary group birds like mammals noted high level parental care reptiles almost sexually dimorphic exhibit internal fertilization cloaca reptiles lay eggs others ovoviviparous animals deliver live young reproductive organs found within cloaca reptiles male reptiles copulatory organs usually retracted inverted stored inside body turtles crocodilians male single median penislike organ male snakes lizards possess pair penislike organs amphibians exhibit external fertilization eggs typically within water though amphibians caecilians internal paired internal gonads connected ducts cloaca fish exhibit wide range different reproductive strategies fish however oviparous exhibit external fertilization process females use cloaca release large quantities gametes called spawn water one males release milt white fluid containing many sperm unfertilized eggs species fish oviparous internal fertilization aided pelvic anal fins modified intromittent organ analogous human small portion fish species either viviparous ovoviviparous collectively known fish gonads typically pairs either ovaries testicles fish sexually dimorphic species hermaphroditic invertebrates extremely diverse array reproductive systems commonality may lay eggs also aside cephalopods arthropods nearly invertebrates hermaphroditic exhibit external fertilization cephalopods sexually dimorphic reproduce laying eggs cephalopods semiinternal fertilization male places gametes inside females mantle cavity pallial cavity fertilize ova found females single likewise male cephalopods single testicle female cephalopods nidamental glands aid development egg penis unshelled male cephalopods coleoidea long muscular end gonoduct used transfer spermatophores modified arm called hectocotylus turn used transfer spermatophores female species hectocotylus missing penis long able extend beyond mantle cavity transfer spermatophores directly female insects reproduce oviparously ie laying eggs eggs produced female pair ovaries sperm produced male one testis commonly two transmitted female mating means external genitalia sperm stored within female one spermathecae time fertilization eggs travel along oviducts fertilized sperm expelled body laid cases via ovipositor arachnids may one two gonads located abdomen genital opening usually located underside second abdominal segment species male transfers sperm female package spermatophore complex courtship rituals evolved many arachnids ensure safe delivery sperm arachnids usually lay yolky eggs hatch immatures resemble adults scorpions however either ovoviviparous viviparous depending species
