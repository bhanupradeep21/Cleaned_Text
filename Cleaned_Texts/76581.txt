alpha solenoid sometimes also known alpha horseshoe stacked pairs alpha helices abbreviated spah protein fold composed repeating alpha helix subunits commonly helixturnhelix motifs arranged antiparallel fashion form alpha solenoids known flexibility like beta propellers alpha solenoids form solenoid protein domain commonly found proteins comprising nuclear pore also common membrane coat
