predicted outcome value theory introduced michael sunnafrank posits people seek information initial interactions relationships determine benefits interpersonal relationships predicting value future outcomes whether negative positive person predicts positive outcome relationship lead increased attraction however person predicts negative outcome would pursue limited interaction possibly relationship processes predicted outcome value directly link continued relationship development communication well stronger attraction intimacy within relationship predicted outcome value theory proposes initial interaction behaviors serve two related functions individuals attempts maximize future relational outcomes first communication directed reducing uncertainty berger calabrese new acquaintances determine likely outcomevalues relational future second communication proceeds manner predicted result positive outcomes broad sense outcome value predictions would lead communicative attempts terminate curtail conversation continue entrylevel conversation escalate conversation relationship beyond level attempts continue escalate would result positive predicted outcome values attempts terminate curtail would result negative predictions given predicted outcome value theory proposes several specific behaviors associated conversational terminationescalation related predicted outcome value levels among sunnafrank posits predicted outcome value positively related amount verbal communication intimacy level communication content nonverbal affiliative expressiveness attraction increases predicted outcome value increases prediction positive future outcomes leads future interactions prediction negative future outcomes ends future interactions people focus discuss topics conversations facilitate positive predicted predicted outcome value theory alternative uncertainty reduction theory charles r berger richard j calabrese introduced uncertainty reduction theory states driving force initial interactions collect information predict attitudes behaviors future relationship development sunnafrank challenges uncertainty reduction theory predicted outcome value theory initial interactions solely reducing uncertainty within relationship motivated predicted outcome value sunnafrank ascertains initial interactions lead continued relationship development person determined future rewards costs relationship looking relationships implications theories many parallels propositions set forth predicted outcome value theory sunnafrank almost exactly mirror eight axioms berger calabreses uncertainty reduction theory looking predicted outcome value theory positive negative predicted outcome values pov produced based initial interactions positive predicted outcome values align positive implications uncertainty reduction words dealing positive feelings initial interaction implications initial interaction unfolded align axioms uncertainty reduction theory example verbal communication positive relationship amount verbal communication predicted outcome value positive pov initial interaction theories imply verbal communication likely increase first axiom uncertainty reduction theory conclusion based second assumption predicted outcome value theory furthermore proxemics according predicted outcome value theory proximity space comfort closeness increases higher povs according uncertainty reduction theory uncertainty reduces allow people comfortable proxemics space display acts affection making negative relationship uncertainty decreases acts proxemics increase disclosure willing disclose increasingly personal information higher initial povs similarly uncertainty reduces also feel comfortable opening reciprocity higher initial pov likely person feel dont need reciprocate conversation uncertainty reduces less urge reciprocate conversation words uncertainty reduces likely person willing listen onesided conversation feel obligated need reciprocate answer similarity higher initial pov likely people feel similar one another two people feel similar one another uncertainty decreases liking higher initial pov higher probability person likes terms friendliness two people like increasingly uncertainty decreases accordingly shared networking two individuals friends common trust higher initial pov shared network friends grows bigger bigger uncertainty decreases axiom disagreed upon two differentiates two based implications idea informationseeking informationseeking according predicted outcome value theory higher initial povs likely two people engaged initial conversation want learn one another contrary pov negative meaning initial interaction good likely two want learn person thus according predicted outcome value theory positive relationship higher pov two people want know hand according uncertainty reduction theory high uncertainty two people likely want know order reduce uncertainty making negative relationship

california davis arizona state university texas university awarded phd masters degrees michigan state sunnafrank continues work research testing predicted outcome value theory sunnafranks study examined potential initial acquaintance association perceived similarity attraction may present though undetected previous interpersonal goals research finds support interpersonal goals claims regarding perceived similarityattraction relationship findings extended sunnafrank sunnafrank millers claim attitude similarity attraction unassociated beginning communicative relationships research supports claim attitude similarity revealed preacquaintance also shows claim generalizes normally occurring perceptions attitude similarity produced initial relational stages results strongly suggested traditional beliefs theoretical interpretations attitude similarityattraction association incorrect least regarding initial acquaintance another study predicted outcome value initial conversations provided initial test several predicted outcome value theory sunnafrank propositions findings supported hypotheses tested demonstrated initial conversations predicted outcome value strongly positively related amount verbal communication intimacy communication content nonverbal affiliation liking perceived recent research designed investigate positive negative predictors possible relationships focusing decisions engage future dates interpersonal attraction homophily nonverbal immediacy linked predicted outcome value relationships initial encounters study investigates variables influence date decisions sixminute speeddating experience results indicated interpersonal attraction nonverbal immediacy significantly predict predicted outcome value future date michael sunnafrank artemio ramirez jr assistant professor communication ohio state university conducted research published journal social personal relationships also featured abc news sunnafrank ramirez studied college freshmen nineweek period determine predicted outcome value relationship development study involved pairing two students sex together first day class introducing one another engaging conversation either three six minutes afterwards researchers asked student predict outcome relationship describing nodding acquaintance casual acquaintance acquaintance close acquaintance friend close friend students also completed extensive questionnaires person determine much liked one another sunnafrank ramirez nineweek period sunnafrank ramirez facilitated classroom environment allowed students continue get know one another end nine weeks students predicted positive outcomes developed strong relationships behavior indicated students sat together class communicated regular basis strongest effect study existed relationships predicted negative outcome students decided initial interaction want relationship progress students acted accordingly restricting conversation avoiding eye contact avoiding period ramirez points power first impressions people want quickly determine person met someone going want hang date spend time future want waste time one important point consider study sunnafrank says college freshmen aggressive pursuing new friendships relationships within social circles behavior tends change time situations life time pretty much claimed work family matters even meet people really like chances much going happen life goes social networks become solidified acting first impression becomes less likely sunnafrank concluded events throughout course relationships change predicted outcome value calls surprising events betraying one another trust back stabbing relationships turn originally predicted however study apparent initial impressions interactions determine outcome relationship predicted outcome value theory college freshmen numerous opportunities develop relationships nineweek period first impressions made lasting impacts
