vanessa atalanta red admiral previously red wellcharacterized mediumsized butterfly black wings red bands white spots wingspan inches first described carl linnaeus edition systema naturae red admiral widely distributed across temperate regions north africa americas europe asia resides warmer areas migrates north spring sometimes autumn typically found moist woodlands red admiral caterpillars primary host plant stinging nettle urtica dioica also found false nettle boehmeria adult butterfly drinks flowering plants like buddleia overripe fruit red admirals territorial females mate males hold territory males superior flight abilities likely successfully court females known unusually calm butterfly often allowing observation close distance flying away also landing using humans perches red admiral found temperate regions north africa north central america europe asia island regions hawaii forewing butterfly bears black ground oblique vermilion band group white subapical spots hindwing larger portion distal margin red row small black spots anal angle elongate blue spot underside partly variegated blue forewing whole similar markings upper hindwing brightly variegated clouded bearing black markings cell resemble figure left wing right middle costal area pale patch distal marginal area row ocelluslike spots sometimes especially female red band forewing bears small white spot middle northern europe one last butterflies seen winter sets often feeding flowers ivy sunny days red admiral also known reemerging individuals showing prominently darker colors first brood butterfly also flies sunny winter days especially southern europe north america red admiral generally two broods march october north america must recolonized spring southern migrants species overwinters south texas red admiral larvae measure approximately inch cm length coloration variable usually black white spots spines spines persist pupal laboratory tests larvae reared various constant temperatures difference pupal period coloration found higher temperatures around degrees celsius pupal period red admiral days degrees celsius period increases days even lower temperatures around degrees celsius pupal period lasts days pupae bright scarlet high temperatures black smaller scarlet area low differential coloration various temperatures may explain summer form red admiral brighter heavily pigmented winter primary host plant red admiral stinging nettle urtica dioica also found false nettle boehmeria cylindrica pennsylvania pellitory parietaria species within certain plants families compositae cannabaceae may also used red admiral identified striking black orange white wing pattern dorsal side dark wings possess orange bands middle forewings outer edge hindwings distal ends forewings contain white spots ventral side wings brown patches red white black hindwings brown marbled pattern red admiral summer winter morphs summer red admirals larger pigmented winter morphs wingspan ranges inches eggs early instar late instar chrysalis adult butterfly dorsal adult butterfly ventral male red admirals territorial perch afternoon sunset larger territories optimal subject intrusion males frequently smaller territories territories tend oval feet long feet wide males patrol territory flying around perimeter times per hour average territory holders interact intruders times per another male encroaches red admirals territory resident chases away intruder often vertical helical path disorient tire intruder minimizing horizontal distance travels perch red admiral immediately returns territory chasing encroaching males time spent patrolling increases number intruder interactions patrolling behavior correlated warmer air temperatures males begin patrolling early continue later warmer overcast skies usually led patrolling later day clear whether later start time due lower air temperature direct effect decreased solar radiation another theory males believe earlier morning cloudy days reduced solar male red admirals court females several hours begin mating female choice males territory opportunity mate females select males traits increase mating success offspring order maintain territory males fly around patrol area times per hour males exceptional flying ability able chase intruding males successfully court mating usually occurs late autumn early winter following collective migration southern regions warmer climate red admirals main host plant stinging nettle abundant migration larval development proceeds winter adults first sighted early spring new generation adults migrates north mating food usually diminished late europe cyclic nature migration confirmed analysing stable isotopes wing samples spring individuals arriving northern europe kaliningrad southern origin autumn isotope analyses revealed samples came surrounding area northern migration red admiral flies high altitudes highspeed winds carry butterfly reducing energy red admirals color vision nm range visible spectrum includes indigo blue green yellow compound eyes transparent crystalline structure called rhabdom similar function human retina butterflies specific lateral filtering pigments coating rhabdom found nymphalid butterflies likely evolved later consequence lack pigment red admiral differentiate colors nm range includes orange red species monarch butterfly express lateral filtering pigments higher wavelengths light altered excite sensory photopigments physiological difference butterfly species provides insight evolutionary adaptation color spring temperatures central england increased degrees celsius summer temperatures increased degree celsius following period warming red admiral appeared six weeks earlier year species butterflies studied central england change duration flight period significant red admiral exhibiting day increase changes migration time length could result increased abundance red admirals northward range expansion warmer climates could lead increase time spent finding mates laying eggs collecting nectar conversely frequent droughts associated climate change would decrease egg survival lead habitat
