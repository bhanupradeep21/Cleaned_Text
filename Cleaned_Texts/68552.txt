powdery scab disease potato caused cercozoan spongospora subterranea f sp subterranea widespread potato growing symptoms powdery scab include small lesions early stages disease progressing raised pustules containing powdery mass eventually rupture within tuber powdery pustules contain resting spores release anisokont zoospores asexual spore two unequal length flagella infect root hairs potatoes powdery scab cosmetic defect tubers result rejection potatoes potatoes infected peeled remove infected skin remaining inside potato cooked general lot known life cycle spongospora subterranea fsp subterranea sss currentlyproposed life cycle based plasmodiophora brassicae closely related betterstudied protozoan proposed due similarity two distinct stages sss exist asexual sexual stages asexual stage zoospore infects root tissue becomes uninucleate plasmodium plasmodium undergoes mitotic nuclear division creates many nuclei within single cell turns multinucleate plasmodium multinucleate plasmodium forms zoosporangium eventually release zoospores process happen relatively quickly act important source secondary inoculum within sexual stage stage follows similar pattern asexual stage exceptions hypothesized two zoospores fuse together form dikaryotic zoospore two separate haploid nuclei nn infect roots infection occurs dikaryotic zoospore develops binucleate plasmodium one pair nuclei nn similar asexual stage plasmodium also replicate nucleus create multinucleate plasmodium many pairs nuclei nn second main different stages occurs pairs nuclei nn fuse karyogamy plasmodium quickly divide numerous resting spores within sporosori spore sack alternatively called cystosori resting spores threelayered walls extremely resistant environment allowing persist soil longer reminder life cycle still unclear however presence zoospores plasmodia zoosporangia resting spores observed field ploidy levels karyogamy events theorized yet proven spongospora subterranea pathogenesis effective cool damp environments northern britain columbia basin southcentral washington northcentral environmental condition particularly critical release infective agents zoospores soilenvironment upon release resting spores zoospores require moisture swim towards host tuber one study found powdery scab significantly common plants grown constant dampness compared plants grown varying moisture study concluded disease risk related environment moisture level level inoculum present inoculum may present able disperse due environmental conditions therefore reach host tissue infect environmental factors affect spongospora subterranea infection directly related agronomic practices increased use fertilizers containing nitrate ammonium nitrogen increase incidence severity powdery thought fertilization increases root growth thus provides tissue infection disease cycling occur also reduced cellulose within cell walls caused excess nitrogen may increase susceptibility host infection apparent environment directly affect host susceptibility dispersal pathogen ultimately setting pace disease cycle subterranea obligate parasite infects ground structures host infection leads hypertrophy hyperplasia host cells eventual however mechanism behind still zoospores infect root hairs attaching outer surface encysting penetrating epidermis lenticels inside multinucleate plasmodium divides spread produce zoospores plasmodium causes infected host cells multiply rapidly enlarge gall rapid multiplication also produces uninucleate cells aggregate together sporosori look like powdery mass within gall gives disease eventually gall swells bursts epidermis tuber releasing spores back soil gall severity depends inoculum level environment potato skin type infection prevalent early stages tuber formation potato tissue infection occur stages development white red skinned potatoes highly susceptible russet skinned somewhat russet skin thicker higher levels lox protein used marker little known variation sexual recombination within subterranea therefore high priority given researching variations within potato cultivars researching hostpathogen relationships powdery scab important implications commercial farming pathogen cause harm pathogen also vector potato moptop virus another plant pathogen result presence greatly threatens potato marketability farmers burst pustules also act wound fungi infect phytophthora erythroseptica phytophthora infestans thus tubers powdery scab increased incidences devastating diseases including pink rot dry rot black dot late potato tubers form powdery scab pustules inhibit ability sold many markets decline buy potatoes ugly scarring even safe eat research yet found effective way peel scabs without damaging potatoes rejected sale create large financial burden additionally soil borne inoculum survive years spores pathogen difficult eliminate present great britain recent potato council funded diagnostic project discovered much fields tested positive soil subterranea currently effective chemical controls therefore cultural management techniques must used using certified clean seeds planting fields historically healthy best form methods may prevent infestation resting spores since infection promoted cool soil temperatures high soil moisture delayed planting also help reduce negative effects pathogen delayed planting reduces growth period cooler soils subsequently decreasing germination spores one limitation method additional decrease early market preplanting chemigation metam sodium reduce propagules common means control include using resistant potatoes crop rotations several cultivars resistant potatoes include granola nicola ditta soilborne inoculum survive many years crop rotations involve alternate species promote partial life cycle pathogen way zoospores germinate without producing new researchers investigated use betaaminobutyric acid baba promoting potato resistance baba triggers plants systemic acquired resistance sar natural plant defense mechanism potatoes inoculated baba later inoculated pathogen subterranea exhibit overall reduction disease
