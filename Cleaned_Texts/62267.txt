qt prolongation measure delayed ventricular repolarisation means heart muscle takes longer normal recharge beats electrical disturbance seen electrocardiogram ecg excessive qt prolongation trigger

concurrent use one drug known prolong qt interval diuretic treatment electrolyte derangements hypokalemia hypomagnesemia hypocalcemia advanced age bradyarrhythmias female sex shown risk factors developing druginduced qt tdp shown occur three times often female patients compared males likely result postpubertal hormonal influence cardiac ion channels qtc interval longer females well stronger
