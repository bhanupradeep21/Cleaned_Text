sinopterus meaning chinese wing genus tapejarid pterodactyloid pterosaur aptianage lower cretaceous jiufotang formation chaoyang liaoning china first described named wang xiaolin zhou zhonghe historically multiple species attributed genus although one considered valid sinopterus known proportionally large skull birdlike pointed beak long bony crest starts tall premaxilla goes back along middle skull form point overhanging rear skull lack teeth type species dongi based ivpp articulated nearly complete skeleton skull individual centimeters inches long wingspan estimated meters feet authors suggested omnivore noted first record tapejarid outside brazil earliest complete maximum adult wingspan pterosaur would metres ft individual size would weighed kg sinopterus known numerous specimens assigned unique species even different genera years type species sinopterus dongi known one specimen described second specimen also described li lü zhang classified species gui said differ dongi mainly smaller size half size dongi presence though later later studies found gui simply represent younger specimen though one large analysis found primitive third specimen referred sinopterus classified new species time given name jii species first named lü yuan type species new genus named huaxiapterus two later studies showed h jii fact closely related sinopterus two species also assigned huaxiapterus h corollatus h benxiensis groups researchers concluded huaxiapterus jii therefore reclassified sinopterus jii two species huaxiapterus require new genus however complete phylogenetic analysis suggested sinopterus may actually intermediate step grade h jii two huaxiapterus species making sinopterus paraphyletic h jii another species lingyuanensis named purportedly differed species proportions nasoantorbital fenestra rostral index relative sizes femur tibia relative sizes first second wing digits paper describing species species huaxiapterus atavismus also however xinjun zhang colleagues considered huaxiapterus invalid genus therefore reassigned h atavismus sinopterus created new combination sinopterus study darren naish colleagues variation within pterosaur growth stages noted numerous species classified sinopterus huaxiapterus based single specimen differentiated features like wing proportions skull length crest shape size naish et al pointed features known variable within single species due growth unlikely high diversity extremely similar species ecosystem differences likely due variation within species suggested larger study would needed untangle question many species sinopteruslike pterosaurs actually existed jiufotang ecosystem related preliminary opinion scientists stated likely one valid species sinopterus dongi huaxiapterus corollatus might valid second species based unique wing leg rodrigo v pêgas et al reviewed recent taxonomic histories tapejarids article made gui lingyuanensis synonymous dongi addition genus

hatchling specimen attributed sinopterus specimen originally classified distinct genus nemicolopterus crypticus name nemicolopterus comes greek words nemos meaning forest ikolos meaning dweller latinised pteron meaning wing specific name crypticus derived greek kryptos meaning hidden thus nemicolopterus crypticus means hidden flying forest dweller type specimen n crypticus catalog number

immature citing amount bone fusion ossification toes gastralia sternum indicating subadult rather hatchling however darren naish argued popular weblog due hypothesis pterosaurs highly precocial bone fusion ossification could occurred early life nemicolopterus might fact hatchling identification formally presented study found nemicolopterus fit growth series young juvenile hatchling sinopterus analysis pterosaur relationships andres colleagues found specimen sister group relationship sinopterus based study hatchling sinopterus skeletons well comparison hatchlings pterosaur species naish colleagues found wing proportions bone strengthflexibility hatchlings similar adults concluded sinopterus capable powered flight shortly hatching found young juveniles would excellent gliders would reliant gliding alone opposed true flight juveniles also seem adapted flight closed environments like dense forests compared adults juveniles therefore probably occupied different ecological niches adults transitioning different niches httpsenwikipediaorgwikisinopterus
