donor coordination problem social choice several donors wants donate money donor supports different set targets goal distribute total donated amount among various targets way respects donors preferences example consider town three recreational facilities require funding theater chess club basketball field two donors alice george wants donate alice wants donate indoor activities theater chess whereas george prefers donate competitive activities chess basketball suppose donors consider facilities substitute goods utility donor sum money distributed facility likes consider following possible distributions alternatively one assume donors consider facilities complementary goods utility donor minimum amount money distributed facility likes case uncoordinated distribution gives donors utility distribution gives donors utility even better distribution cases coordination improve efficiency allocation donor coordination variant participatory budgeting budget donated voters rather given government since donations voluntary important coordination algorithm ensures voter weakly gains participating algorithm ie amount contributed projects approves weakly higher participates donor coordination studied several settings broadly categorized divisible indivisible donor coordination divisible targets similar problem fractional social choice except latter budget fixed advance
