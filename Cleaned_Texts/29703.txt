segmentation gene generic term gene whose function specify tissue pattern repeated unit segmented organism animals constructed segments however drosophila segments also contain subdivided compartments five gene classes contribute segmentation development embryonic drosophila five gene classes include coordinate gene gap gene pairrule gene segment polarity gene homeotic gene embryonic drosophila pairrule gene defines oddskipped evenskipped genes parasegments showing stripes embryo next gene class segment polarity gene individual segments anterior posterior pole resulting fruit fly drosophila melanogaster segment polarity genes help define anterior posterior polarities within embryonic parasegment regulating transmission signals via wnt signaling pathway hedgehog signaling pathway segment polarity genes expressed embryo following expression gap genes pairrule genes commonly cited examples genes engrailed gooseberry drosophila segment polarity last step embryonic development repeated pattern half segment deleted mirrorimage duplicated reversed replace half segment thus forming pattern segmentation polarity occurs release morphogens functions differentiate patterns within development pattern depends gradients drosophila engrailed gene expressed cells within posterior section every role distinguish posterior anterior sections segment engrailed expression generally restricted cells posterior compartment research suggests may gooseberry genes role segmentation believed involved segmentpolarity class segmentation genes required formation larval segments embryogenesis half larval segments replaced remain half segment reversed polarity suggested gooseberry single however believed mechanism controlled two duplicated genes instead one called gooseberry gsb gooseberry neuro research zygotes drosophila indicated several segment polarity genes vital segmentation involved neuroblast formation differentiation cell neuroblast identity thereby developing central nervous research lossoffunction mutations genes drosophila suggests segment polarity genes interactions also responsible neuroblast division affecting quantity neuroblasts well httpsenwikipediaorgwikisegmentpolaritygene
