muscle hypertrophy muscle building involves hypertrophy increase size skeletal muscle growth size component cells two factors contribute hypertrophy sarcoplasmic hypertrophy focuses increased muscle glycogen storage myofibrillar hypertrophy focuses increased myofibril primary focus bodybuildingrelated activities range stimuli increase volume muscle cells changes occur adaptive response serves increase ability generate force resist fatigue anaerobic conditions strength training resistance training causes neural muscular adaptations increase capacity athlete exert force voluntary muscular contraction initial period neuromuscular adaptation muscle tissue expands creating sarcomeres contractile elements increasing noncontractile elements like sarcoplasmic muscular hypertrophy induced progressive overload strategy progressively increasing resistance repetitions successive bouts exercise maintain high level however precise mechanisms clearly understood currently accepted hypotheses involve combination mechanical tension metabolic fatigue muscular damage muscular hypertrophy plays important role competitive bodybuilding strength sports like powerlifting american football olympic weightlifting best approach specifically achieve muscle growth remains controversial opposed focusing gaining strength power endurance generally considered consistent anaerobic strength training produce hypertrophy long term addition effects muscular strength endurance muscular hypertrophy increased strength training shortduration highintensity anaerobic exercises lowerintensity longerduration aerobic exercise generally result effective tissue hypertrophy instead endurance athletes enhance storage fats carbohydrates within well workout increased blood flow metabolically active areas causes muscles temporarily increase size phenomenon referred transient hypertrophy commonly known pumped getting two hours workout typically seven eleven days muscles swell due inflammation response tissue damage longerterm hypertrophy occurs due permanent changes muscle structure biological factors dna sex nutrition training variables affect muscle individual differences genetics account substantial portion variance existing muscle mass classical twin study design similar behavioral genetics estimated variance lean body mass along variance muscle fiber puberty males hypertrophy occurs increased rate natural hypertrophy normally stops full growth late teens testosterone one bodys major growth hormones average males find hypertrophy much easier absolute scale achieve females average muscle mass taking additional testosterone anabolic steroids increase results also considered performanceenhancing drug use cause competitors suspended banned competitions testosterone also medically regulated substance countries making illegal possess without medical prescription anabolic steroid use cause testicular atrophy cardiac long term positive energy balance calories consumed rather burned helpful anabolism therefore muscle hypertrophy increased requirement protein help elevate protein synthesis seen athletes training muscle hypertrophy however scientific consensus whether strengthtraining athletes increased protein training variables context strength training frequency intensity total volume also directly affect increase muscle hypertrophy gradual increase training variables yield muscular message filters alter pattern gene expression additional contractile proteins appear incorporated existing myofibrils chains sarcomeres within muscle cell appears limit large myofibril become point split events appear occur within muscle fiber hypertrophy results primarily growth muscle cell rather increase number cells skeletal muscle cells however unique body contain multiple nuclei number nuclei cortisol decreases amino acid uptake muscle tissue inhibits protein shortterm increase protein synthesis occurs subsequent resistance training returns normal approximately hours adequately fed male another study determined muscle protein synthesis elevated even hours following small study performed young elderly found ingestion grams lean beef g protein increase muscle protein synthesis ingestion grams lean beef g protein groups muscle protein synthesis increased study concluded g protein single meal enhance stimulation muscle protein synthesis young however study didnt check protein synthesis relation training therefore conclusions research controversial review scientific concluded purpose building lean muscle tissue minimum g protein per kilogram body weight required example divided meals snacks spread daycitation needed uncommon bodybuilders advise protein intake high g per kilogram bodyweight per however scientific literature suggested higher necessary protein intakes greater g per kilogram body weight showed greater effect muscle study carried american college sports medicine put recommended daily protein intake athletes g per kilogram body conversely di pasquale citing recent studies recommends minimum protein intake gkg anyone involved competitive intense recreational sports wants maximize lean body mass wish gain weight however athletes involved strength events may need even maximize body composition athletic performance attempting minimize body fat thus maximize body composition example sports weight classes bodybuilding possible protein may well make daily caloric microtrauma tiny damage muscle fibers precise relation microtrauma muscle growth entirely understood yetcitation needed one theory microtrauma plays significant role muscle microtrauma occurs weight training strenuous activities body responds overcompensating replacing damaged tissue adding risk repeat damage reduced damage fibers theorized possible cause symptoms delayed onset muscle soreness doms progressive overload essential continued improvement body adapts becomes resistant stress however work examining time course changes muscle protein synthesis relationship hypertrophy showed damage unrelated fact one authors showed damage subsided protein synthesis directed muscle growth bodybuilding fitness community even academic books skeletal muscle hypertrophy described one two types sarcoplasmic myofibrillarqualify evidence according hypothesis sarcoplasmic hypertrophy volume sarcoplasmic fluid muscle cell increases accompanying increase muscular strength whereas myofibrillar hypertrophy actin myosin contractile proteins increase number add muscular strength well small increase size muscle sarcoplasmic hypertrophy greater muscles bodybuilders studies suggest sarcoplasmic hypertrophy shows greater increase muscle size myofibrillar hypertrophy proves increase overall muscular strength making dominant olympic two forms adaptations rarely occur completely independently one another one experience large increase fluid slight increase proteins large increase proteins small increase fluid relatively balanced combination two examples increased muscle hypertrophy seen various professional sports mainly strength related sports boxing olympic weightlifting mixed martial arts rugby professional wrestling various forms gymnastics athletes skillbased sports basketball baseball ice hockey football may also train increased muscle hypertrophy better suit position play example center basketball may want bigger muscular better overpower opponents low athletes training sports train extensively strength also cardiovascular muscular endurance trainingcitation needed neuromuscular diseases result true hypertrophy one skeletal muscles confirmed mri muscle biopsy muscle hypertrophy result resistance training heavy manual labour muscle hypertrophy described pseudoathletic appearance muscle
