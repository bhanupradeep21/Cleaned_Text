carbon disulfide also spelled carbon disulphide inorganic compound chemical formula structure scs colorless flammable neurotoxic liquid used building block organic synthesis pure carbon disulfide pleasant ether chloroformlike odor commercial samples usually yellowish typically contaminated foulsmelling german chemist wilhelm august lampadius first prepared carbon disulfide heating pyrite moist charcoal called liquid sulfur flüssig composition carbon disulfide finally determined team swedish chemist jöns jacob berzelius swissbritish chemist alexander marcet analysis consistent empirical formula small amounts carbon disulfide released volcanic eruptions marshes manufactured combining carbon coke sulfur lowertemperature reaction requiring utilizes natural gas carbon source presence silica gel alumina reaction analogous combustion methane global productionconsumption carbon disulfide approximately one million tonnes china consuming followed india mostly production rayon united states production carbon disulfide solvent phosphorus sulfur selenium bromine iodine fats resins rubber combustion affords sulfur dioxide according ideal stoichiometry example amines afford xanthates form similarly reaction basis manufacture regenerated cellulose main ingredient viscose rayon cellophane xanthates related thioxanthates derived treatment sodium thiolates used flotation agents mineral processing upon treatment sodium sulfide carbon disulfide affords carbon disulfide hydrolyze readily although process catalyzed enzyme carbon disulfide hydrolase compared isoelectronic carbon dioxide weaker electrophile however reactions nucleophiles highly reversible products isolated strong nucleophiles reactions thermodynamically favored allowing formation products less reactive reduction carbon disulfide sodium affords sodium together sodium chlorination provides route carbon conversion proceeds via intermediacy thiophosgene ligand many metal complexes forming pi complexes one example polymerizes upon photolysis high pressure give insoluble material called carsul bridgmans black named discoverer polymer percy williams trithiocarbonate scss linkages comprise part backbone polymer principal industrial uses carbon disulfide consuming annual production manufacture viscose rayon cellophane also valued intermediate chemical synthesis carbon tetrachloride widely used synthesis organosulfur compounds xanthates used froth flotation method extracting metals ores carbon disulfide also precursor dithiocarbamates used drugs eg metam sodium rubber chemistry used fumigation airtight storage warehouses airtight flat storage bins grain elevators railroad box cars ship holds barges cereal carbon disulfide also used insecticide fumigation grains nursery stock fresh fruit conservation soil disinfectant insects carbon disulfide linked acute chronic forms poisoning diverse range concentrations cause acute subacute poisoning include set mostly neurological psychiatric symptoms called encephalopathia sulfocarbonica symptoms include acute psychosis manic delirium hallucinations paranoic ideas loss appetite gastrointestinal sexual disorders polyneuritis myopathy mood changes including irritability anger effects observed lower concentrations include neurological problems encephalopathy psychomotor psychological disturbances polyneuritis abnormalities nerve conduction hearing problems vision problems burning eyes abnormal light reactions increased ophthalmic pressure heart problems increased deaths heart disease angina pectoris high blood pressure
