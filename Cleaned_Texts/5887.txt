inachuscitation needed confused classified american peacocks genus anartia belonging family european peacock nymphalidae american peacocks close relatives eurasian species peacock butterfly resident

also use tree sap rotten fruits aglais io employs monogamous mating system means mate one partner period timecitation needed due life cycle females receptive eclosion period overwintering pairs mate overwintering difficult find receptive female species range females defensible male males must defend single desirable area females come dense food areas watering holes favourable nesting sites males attempt mate females passing holding desirable territory increases males likelihood finding mate therefore increases reproductive success however individual needs weigh benefits mating costs defending aglais io exhibits type territorial behaviour must defend desirable territory males one males knows territory well successfully chase intruders hand males familiar territory contest two determine stays territory desirable sites increase males quota females sites generally feeding oviposition sites sought females territorial behaviour reinforced fact sites concentrated valuable resources dispersed would less observable territorial find mates defend territory aglais io exhibits perching behaviour male butterflies perch object specific height observe passing flying objects every time see passing object species relevant species fly straight towards object approximately cm away encounter male resident male chase territory resident male encounters female pursue lands mating courtship extended species male goes long chase female allows mate must demonstrate high performance monandrous mating system caused evolution shorter life span males species polygynous butterflies males reproductive success largely dependent life span therefore longer male lives reproduce higher fitness therefore males tend live long females io synchronous eclosion end winter cause males mate reproductive success therefore linked long live selective pressure live longer therefore life span males shorter lifespan like many butterflies hibernate peacock butterfly exhibits many antipredator defence mechanisms wouldbe predators peacock butterflys obvious defense comes four large eyespots wings also uses camouflage emit hissing eyespots brilliantly coloured concentric circles avian predators butterfly include blue tits pied flycatchers small passerine birds first line defence predators many hibernating butterflies crypsis process butterflies blend environment mimicking leaf staying hibernating butterflies peacock second line defence attacked open wings expose eyespots intimidating threat display gives butterfly much better chance escaping predators butterflies rely solely leaf main targets antipredation measures small passerine birds even larger birds chickens shown react stimuli avoid butterfly exposed research shown avian predators attempting attack butterfly hesitate much longer time encounter butterflies display eyespots encounter butterflies whose eyespots covered addition predators delay return butterfly displays predators even flee attacking intimidating predator delays gives attack peacock butterfly much greater chance escaping predation according eye mimicry hypothesis eyespots serve antipredatory purpose imitating eyes avian predators natural contrast conspicuousness hypothesis posits rather recognition eyespots belonging enemy conspicuous nature eyespots typically large bright causes response visual system predator leads avoidance one experiment observed responses avian predators eyespots included increased vigilance delay return peacock butterfly production alarm calls associated groundbased responses eyespot stimuli lend support eye mimicry hypothesis indicated avian predator sensed eyespots belonged potential enemy faced avian predators like blue tit peacock butterfly makes hissing noise well threateningly displaying eyespots however eyespots protect butterfly peacock butterflies sound production capability removed still defend extremely well avian predators eyespots hibernating dark wintering areas peacock butterfly frequently encounters rodent predators small mice predators however visual display eyespots ineffective due darkness environment instead rodent predators show much stronger adverse reaction
