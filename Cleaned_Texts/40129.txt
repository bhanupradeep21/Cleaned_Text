bilipid membrane cell kodecytes retain normal vitality functionality gaining new function inserted fsl constructs combination dispersibility biocompatible media spontaneous incorporation cell membranes apparent low toxicity makes fsl constructs suitable research tools development new diagnostic therapeutic applications kode fsl constructs consist three functional moiety f spacer lipid l
