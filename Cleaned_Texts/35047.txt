well simulating many functions mind language processing decision making motor computationalism claim thinking sense similar computation instead claimed thinking form computation mind turing computationalist theories thought sometimes divided functionalist representationalist functionalist approaches define mental states causal roles allow external internal events causal thought may seen form program executed way many different systems including humans animals even robots according one view whether something thought depends role producing internal states verbal representationalism hand focuses representational features mental states defines thoughts sequences intentional mental sense computationalism often combined language thought hypothesis interpreting sequences symbols whose order governed syntactic various arguments raised computationalism one sense seems trivial since almost physical system described executing computations therefore thinking example argued molecular movements regular wall understood computing algorithm since isomorphic formal structure program question right would lead implausible conclusion wall thinking another objection focuses idea computationalism captures aspects thought unable account crucial aspects human great variety types thinking discussed academic literature common approach divides forms aim creation theoretical

distinction mere representation content judgment affirmation denial mere representation proposition often referred entertaining proposition case example one considers proposition yet made ones mind whether true term thinking refer judging mere entertaining difference often explicit way thought expressed thinking usually involves judgment whereas thinking refers neutral representation proposition without accompanying belief case proposition merely entertained yet forms thinking may involve representation objects without propositions someone thinking reasoning one paradigmatic forms thinking process drawing conclusions premises evidence types reasoning divided deductive nondeductive reasoning deductive reasoning governed certain rules inference guarantee truth conclusion premises example

true false relation conclusion cases concepts general notions constitute fundamental building blocks rules govern objects sorted different person think proposition possess concepts involved example proposition wombats animals involves concepts wombat animal someone possess concept wombat may still able read sentence entertain corresponding proposition concept formation form thinking new concepts

different types situations adjust behavior case problem solving thinking aims reaching predefined goal overcoming certain process often involves two different forms thinking one hand divergent
