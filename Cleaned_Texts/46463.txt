aeolosaurus ˌiːoʊloʊˈsɔːrəs aeolus lizard genus titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur late cretaceous period south america like sauropods would quadrupedal herbivore long neck tail aeolosaurus well known titanosaur represented remains several individuals belonging least two species however like titanosaurs remains skull known holotype aeolosaurus rionegrinus consists series seven tail vertebrae well parts forelimbs right hindlimb discovered angostura colorada formation argentina dates campanian stage late cretaceous million years ago species maximus transferred new genus arrudatitan dinosaur named greek mythological figure aeolus keeper winds homers odyssey frequent winds blow across patagonia remains found generic name also includes greek sauros lizard traditional suffix used dinosaur names specific name rionegrinus refers location rio negro province argentina genus species named described argentine paleontologist jaime powell aeolosaurus widespread genus titanosaur known late cretaceous south america fossils collected allen angostura colorada lago colhué huapí los alamitos formations argentina serra da galga formation aeolosaurus fossils campanian maastrichtian ages cretaceous period type species aeolosaurus aeolosaurus rionegrinus originally named along genus doctoral thesis jaime e powell however according iczn names dissertations valid formally named published following powells thesis ultimately published sometimes incorrectly cited named aeolosaurus gondwanatitan recognized forming new group titanosaurs named second species colhuehuapensis named also third species maximus named maximus moved genus arrudatitan like sauropods aeolosaurus large longnecked quadrupedal herbivore rionegrinus roughly meters ft long tonnes short tons weight according gregory molinapérez larramendi gave larger estimation meters ft tonnes short rionegrinus heavily built titanosaur limb bones similar robustness aeolosaurs aeolosaurus particular distinctive caudal vertebrae genus aeolosaurus diagnosed shared presence downcurved prezygapophyses anterior caudal vertebrae chevrons anterior middle portions tail concave posterodorsal surfaces contain double articular caudal vertebrae aeolosaurus related genus gondwanatitan share anteriorlyinclined neural spines anterior caudal vertebrae middle part tail elongated aeolosaurus vertebral lateral fossae resembled shallow fossae similarly resemble shallow depressions known saltasaurus alamosaurus malawisaurus middle tail vertebraes neural spines angled anteriorly vertebrae vertebrae resemble cedarosaurus venenosaurus tail aeolosaurus apparently curved strongly downward trait likely shared members curvature would likely led posterior portion tail low ground though likely touching curved base tail may enabled caudofemoralis longus extended femur tail vertebrae exert force retracting aeolosaurus like many lithostrotian titanosaurs bore however osteoderms unusual closely resemble osteodermbearing titanosaurs osteoderms probably arranged one two rows along flanks aeolosaurus closely related genera gondwanatitan together gondwanatitan defines clade two aeolosaurus species argentina rionegrinus colhuehuapensis appear closely related brazilian species classification aeolosaurus relatives heavily based features tail vertebrae bones preserved aeolosaurus included several cladistic analyses phylogeny aeolosaurini based gallina otero application clade names according phylogenetic rapetosaurus overosaurus gondwanatitan aeolosaurus rinconsaurus muyelensaurus laplatasaurus uberabatitan bonitasaura futalognkosaurus mendozasaurus currently two named valid species aeolosaurus well several specimens referred genus given species addition gondwanatitan faustoi closest known relative genus proposed represent additional species aeolosaurus aeolosaurus however gondwanatitan typically considered distinct another specimen described consists five tail vertebrae bones forelimb pelvis since two right ulna forearm bones specimen must consist least two individuals bones also associated two osteoderms bony armor plates providing evidence dinosaur armored specimen allen formation rio negro dating back million years ago middle maastrichtian stage specimen bears features characterize genus aeolosaurus younger time period shows enough differences authors recognized possible second additional material quarry described shows quarry contained remains least three individuals another partial skeleton including four tail vertebrae material limbs left side body described recovered los alamitos formation rio negro falls two dates specimen also referred genus aeolosaurus species rionegrinus may represent third however since genus aeolosaurus well known authors chose formally name either possible new species simply known aeolosaurus sp future discoveries may give scientists information variation within genus show specimens belong rionegrinus merit formally named middle caudal vertebra serra da galga formation cpp evaluated diagnostic features genus however clearly belong gondwanatitan likely vertebra represents aeolosaurus genus otherwise unknown serra da galga another series tail vertebrae assigned aeolosaurus original description later determined series belong genus lacks several features found specimens aeolosaurus lived campanian maastrichtian ages late
