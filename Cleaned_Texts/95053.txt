treatment type one choose completely individualized taking consideration persons state condition likingcitation needed steroids mostly used short term quick use use provides improvement considered longterm plan physicians would normally prescribe steroids biopsy analysis treatment also involves central nervous system penetrating chemotherapy options include intrathecal intraventricular systemic chemotherapy must penetrate bloodbrain barrier order effective sometimes mixing multiple forms treatment chemotherapy seems best example significant improvement shown result cranial radiation treatment preceding brief course intrathecal although effective treatment penetrating bloodbrain barrier cause side effects due toxicity nervous system would include dizziness confusion changes mental status another form could use pharmaceuticals shown positive results treatment always consulted physician assess autologous stemcell transplants shown effective treatment however considered certain people due toxicity concerns possible transplant may cause problems like septic lastly radiation normally used rescue type treatment recommended first line treatment doctor would perform localized radiation therapy dose gy lesions limit amount radiation prevent damage nervous system could happen due toxicity radiation syndrome first described jens bing axel valdemar neel observed case women
