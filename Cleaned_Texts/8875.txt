anything comes near following success previous speculative evolution book man dixon realized market popularlevel books use fictional examples settings explain actual factual scientific processes man explained process evolution creating complex hypothetical future ecosystem new dinosaurs instead aimed creating book zoogeography subject general public quite unfamiliar using fictional world nonavian dinosaurs gone extinct explain dixon envisioned dinosaurs undergoing change last million years previous million years existence due dramatic changes climate continents separated cenozoic dinosaurs animals new dinosaurs heavily influenced paleontology time ideas dinosaur renaissance replacing older ideas dinosaurs dumb slow creatures active agile birdlike animals heavily used dixon extrapolated

animals new dinosaurs less divided animals convergently evolved resemble real modern animals instance animals reminiscent giraffes kangaroos animals completely dixon decided dinosaurs achieve human levels intelligence ie dinosauroids new dinosaurs due intelligence proven feature evolutionary advantage according dixons website dinosaur science moved since first publication original introduction

quintessential book dinosaur many animals featured book criticized paleontologists science writers particularly many animals entirely convergent actual modernday animals capacity lank fourlegged terrestrial grazing pterosaur derived cretaceous family azhdarchidae seen writers perhaps worst offender review book researcher gregory paul called creature perhaps worst beast book unbelievable pointing thought infeasible pterosaurs would evolve giraffelike animals dominant already terrestrial dinosaurs researcher david unwin echoed sentiment viewing fourlegged grasseating pterosaurs highly unlikely british paleontologist science writer darren naish offered redeeming look animal pointing pterosaurs become terrestrial azhdarchids likely group azhdarchids would used gait similar giraffes
