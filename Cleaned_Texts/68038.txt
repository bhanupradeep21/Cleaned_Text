type type b personality hypothesis describes two contrasting personality types hypothesis personalities competitive highly organized ambitious impatient highly aware time management aggressive labeled type relaxed receptive less neurotic frantic personalities labeled type b two cardiologists meyer friedman ray rosenman developed theory came believe type personalities greater chance developing coronary heart following results studies considerable controversy role tobacco industry funding early research area reject either partially completely link type personality coronary disease nevertheless research significant effect development health psychology field psychologists look individuals mental state affects physical type personality behavior first described potential risk factor heart disease cardiologists meyer friedman ray rosenman credit insight upholsterer called attention peculiar fact chairs waiting rooms worn arms front edge seat suggested friedman rosenman patients getting chairs frequently otherwise waiting eightandahalfyearlong study healthy men ages friedman rosenman estimated type behavior doubled risk coronary heart disease otherwise healthy individuals enrolled study followed well beyond original time frame study participants asked fill questionnaire asked questions like feel guilty use spare time relax generally move walk eat subsequent analysis indicated although type personality associated incidence coronary heart disease seem risk factor originally called type personality friedman roseman conceptualized type behavior hypothesis describes type individuals outgoing ambitious rigidly organized highly statusconscious impatient anxious proactive concerned time management people type personalities often highachieving workaholics push deadlines hate delays people type personalities experience jobrelated stress less job tend set high expectations may believe others high expectations interestingly type personalities always outperform type b personalities depending task individuals sense time urgency control lead poor results complex decisions however research shown type individuals general associated higher performance moreover type students tend earn higher grades type b typea faculty members shown productive type b behavior counterparts taylor locke lee gist book dealing extreme type behavior type behavior diagnosis treatment friedman suggests dangerous type behavior expressed three major symptoms freefloating hostility triggered even minor incidents time urgency impatience causes irritation exasperation usually described shortfused competitive drive causes stress achievementdriven mentality first symptoms believed covert therefore less observable two type people said hasty impatient impulsive hyperalert potentially hostile research also shown type personalities may used deal reality avoiding difficult realizations therefore type may use certain defenses ways dealing reality avoid difficult realizationsclarification example one study found type personality likely show higher levels denial type b stressful two main methods assessing type behavior first structured interview si developed friedman rosenman second jenkins activity survey si assessment involves interviewers measuring persons emotional nonverbal verbal responses expressive style jas involves selfquestionnaire three main categories speed impatience job involvement harddriving individuals type personalities often linked higher rates coronary heart disease higher morbidity rates undesirable physical type b behavior pattern lacking type behaviors ab personality continuum one either leans type non type type hypothesis type b individuals noted live lower stress levels typically work steadily may enjoy achievement although greater tendency disregard physical mental stress achieve faced competition may focus less winning losing type counterparts enjoying game regardless winning type b individuals also likely poorer sense type b personality types tolerant individuals type evident relationship style members upper management prefer type b individuals see things global perspective encourage teamwork exercise patience decision type individuals proclivity competition aggression illustrated interactions type type bs playing modified prisoners dilemma game type individuals elicited competitiveness angry feelings type type b opponents type b individuals type individuals punished type counterparts type b counterparts type bs punished type bs rivalry type individuals shown aggressive behavior interactions including initial antisocial responses refusal cooperate verbal threats behavioral common misconception type personality better type b personality largely comes play workforce people type personalities often viewed hardworking highly motivated competitive type b personalities often dont feel sense urgency get projects completed relaxed reality personality types required bring set strengths workplace friedman et al conducted randomized controlled trial male female postmyocardial infarction patients ruling probabilistic equivalence diet confounds subjects control group received group cardiac counseling subjects treatment group received cardiac counseling plus typea counseling comparison group received group counseling kind recurrence rate control group treatment group strong statistically significant p finding whereas comparison group experienced recurrence rate investigative studies following friedman rosenmans discovery compared type behavior independent coronary risk factors hypertension smoking contrast results suggest negative effects cardiovascular health associated type personality mitigated modifying type behavior patternscitation needed discrediting socalled type behavior pattern tabp study based searching legacy tobacco documents library suggests phenomenon initially promising results followed negative findings partly explained tobacco industrys involvement tabp research undermine scientific evidence smoking health documents indicate around tobacco industry first became interested tabp tobacco institute research committee received application funding new york university order investigate relationship smoking industrys interest tabp lasted least four decades late involving substantial funding key researchers encouraged prove smoking simply correlate personality type prone coronary heart disease chd hence early industrys strategy consisted suggesting risks smoking caused psychological characteristics individual smokers rather tobacco products deeming causes cancer multifactorial stress key contributing philip morris today altria rj reynolds helped generate substantial evidence support claims funding workshops research aiming educate alter tabp reduce risks chd cancer moreover philip morris primarily funded meyer friedman institute eg conducting crownjewel trial effectiveness reducing tabp whose expected findings could discredit studies associating smoking chd cancer failing control type friedman wrote us occupational safety health administration criticising restrictions indoor smoking reduce chd claiming evidence remained unreliable since account significant confounder type behavior although tabp proven significant three twelve studies though apparently unpaid letter approved blindcopied philip morris friedman falsely claimed receive funding largely national heart lung blood tabp finally became untenable philip morris supported research hostility allowing vice president jetson lincoln explain passive smoking lethality stress exerted nonsmoking spouse media claiming smoking spouse slowly killing examining recent review tabp chd light close relationship tobacco industry becomes evident thirteen etiologic studies review four reported positive three direct indirect link industry also whole tabp studies relationship tobacco lobby majority positive findings furthermore tabp used litigation defence similar psychosocial hence petticrew et al proved tobacco industry substantially helped generate scientific controversy tabp contributing lay circles enduring popularity prejudice type personality even though scientifically scholars argue type behavior good predictor coronary heart according research redford williams duke university hostility component type personality significant risk thus high level expressed anger hostility elements type behavior constitutes research done hecker et al showed hostility component type description predictive cardiac time continued research conducted focused different components type behavior hostility depression anxiety predicting cardiac initial study pointed association type personality heart attacks massive number questions consideration lot questions high probability false positive study undertaken us national institute aging sardinian italian researchers well biostatisticians university michigan specifically tested direct relationship coronary heart disease type personalities results indicated relation simple explanation initial finding chance due multiple questions consideration considerations may changedcitation needed study later questioned nonplausible considered unsafe performed tested effect psychosocial variables particular personality stress risk factors cancer coronary heart disease study four personality types recorded type personality cancerprone type chdprone type alternating behaviors characteristic types type healthy autonomous type hypothesized survive best data suggest type probands die mainly cancer type chd whereas type especially type probands show much lower death rate two additional types personalities measured type type type rational antiemotional type shows

questioned non plausible considered suggested mental attitudes constitute important prognostic factor cancer method treatment cancerprone patients behavior therapy patient taught express hisher emotions freely socially acceptable manner become autonomous able stand hisher rights behavior therapy would also teach cope stressproducing situations successfully effectiveness therapy preventing death cancer chd statistical data associated higher death rates impressive measures therapy attempted group therapy effects dramatic behavior therapy still showed improvement preventing death among cancer chd patientscitation needed study several conclusions made relationship personality cancer exists along relationship personality coronary heart disease personality type acts risk factor
