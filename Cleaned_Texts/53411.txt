bone losscitation needed tallgrens study also showed denture wearers continued bone loss yearscitation needed biting force gum tissue irritates bone melts away decrease volume density carlssons study showed dramatic bone loss first year tooth extraction continues years even without denture partial itcitation needed longer people missing teeth wear dentures partials less bone jaws may result decreased ability chew food well decreased quality life social insecurity decreasing esthetics collapsing lower third face bone loss also results significant decrease chewing force prompting many denture partial wearers avoid certain kinds food food collecting appliance takes enjoyment eating make grocery restaurant choices eat several reports correlate quality length peoples lives ability chewcitation needed dental implant studies branemark countless others show dental implants stop progressive loss stabilize bone long termcitation needed implanted teeth provide stable effective tooth replacement feels natural also provide improved ability chew comfortably missing many teeth improved sense well dental implants become standard replacing missing teeth dentistry physiologically teeth provide greater chewing ability allow us masticate food thoroughly increasing surface area necessary allow enzymes present saliva well stomach intestines digest food chewing also allows food prepared small boli readily swallowed haphazard chunks considerable size even partially endentulous may become extremely difficult chew food efficiently enough swallow comfortably although entirely dependent upon teeth lost individual loses enough posterior teeth make difficult chew may need cut food small pieces learn make use anterior teeth chew enough posterior teeth missing affect chewing abilities also occlusion posterior teeth mutually protected occlusion help protect anterior teeth vertical dimension occlusion missing anterior teeth begin bear greater amount force structurally prepared thus loss posterior teeth cause anterior teeth splay prevented obtaining dental prostheses removable partial dentures bridges implantsupported crowns addition reestablishing protected occlusion prostheses greatly improve ones chewing abilities consequence lack certain nutrition due altered eating habits various health problems occur mild extreme lack certain vitamins e c low levels riboflavin thiamin

main cause toothlessness whereas periodontal disease primary cause tooth loss older age three main ways missing teeth replaced classification system developed american college prosthodontists classification based diagnostic findings used help practitioners determine appropriate treatments patients diagnostic criteria used classify edentulism four categories class ii iii iv class likely successfully treated complete dentures characteristics include class distinguished continued degradation anatomy also characterised specific patient management lifestyle considerations well systemic disease interactions characteristics include classification level surgical revision supporting structures needed allow adequate prosthodontic function conditions need preprosthetic surgery include classification level depicts debilitated edentulous condition surgical reconstruction almost always indicated always accomplished patients health preferences dental history financial considerations surgical revision option prosthodontic techniques specialized nature must used achieve adequate treatment outcome major conditions requiring preprosthetic surgery edentulism affects approximately
