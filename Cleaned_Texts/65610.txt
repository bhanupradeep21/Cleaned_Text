several organic compounds induced similar reactions early century otto folin adapted jaffes research clinical procedure jaffe reaction despite nonspecificity creatinine still widely employed method choice creatinine due speed adaptability automated analysis costeffectiveness oldest methodology continued used medical nonspecificity motivated development new reference methods creatinine analysis century max jaffe distinguished german biochemist pathologist pharmacologist born july formerly grünberg silesia zielona góra attending medical school university berlin studied ludwig traube wilhelm afterward worked assistant medical clinic coauthored paper putrid sputum ernst viktor von leyden led discovery certain characteristic putrid processes earning degree internal medicine served

process known neubauer reaction performing weyls test colorimetric reaction using sodium nitroprusside snp determined precipitated compound double salt although found amount precipitate directly proportional creatinine concentration also noted reaction highly nonspecific could observed many organic based jaffe although jaffes name synonymous clinical creatinine testing paper described principle behind would later become enduring otto folin harvard biochemist adapted jaffes standard neubauer reaction published several papers using jaffe reaction analyze creatinine levels blood folin began using picric acid procedure included lab manual biological career folin modified improved several quantitative colorimetric procedures first took advantage technology available time using duboscq colorimeter measurement precision credited introducing colorimetry modern biochemical folins research focus creatinine renal function indicator since precursors creatinine synthesized point history creatinine considered indicative liver poul kristian brandt rehberg suggested creatinine significant marker renal nonspecificity jaffes reaction causes falsely elevated creatinine results presence protein glucose acetoacetate ascorbic acid guanidine acetone cephalosporins aminoglycosides mainly streptomycin ketone bodies αketo acids organic ammonium also interferent sample plasma care needs taken ammonium heparin used nonspecificity markedly decreased urine samples since urine creatinine levels much higher blood generally contain significant levels interfering jaffe reactions nonspecificity remains important diabetes patients highrisk population develop chronic kidney disease ckd therefore interferences glucose acetoacetate particular artifacts hemolysis lipemia icteremia also affect accuracy hemolysis releases jaffereacting chromogens therefore falsely increase lipemia icteremia inhibit optical readings falsely decrease procedure developed time intention minimize jaffe neubauer described similar precipitation reaction mixing creatinine zinc chloride performing weyls addition snp naoh incubating acetic acid develop color folin developed jaffes reaction clinical procedure neubauers method creatinine measured folins method evolved various techniques implemented remove jaffereacting substances mostly protein sample increase precipitated aluminum silicate called lloyds used remove protein serum improving fullers earth also used reference method adsorption lloyds new concerns arose due nonstandardization procedures different labs reading results different problem resolved advent automated analyzers introduced kinetic reading results rather specific kinetic jaffe methods involve mixing serum alkaline picrate reading rate change absorption spectrophotometrically standardized procedure also removed need sample also introduced two new used algorithmic compensation correct pseudochromogens calibrations yet standardized saw several new technologies promised change way creatinine testing done enzymatic ionexchange methods provided better accuracy enzymatic methods reduced interferences new ones highperformance liquid chromatography hplc sensitive specific become new reference method endorsed american association clinical hplc addressed shortcomings jaffebased methods laborintensive expensive therefore impractical routine analysis frequently ordered renal analyte medical simple easily automated costeffective jaffebased methods persisted century despite isotope dilution mass spectrometry idms became reference improve accuracy creatinine testing new standards developed national institute standards technology college american pathologists cap national kidney disease education program nkdep collaborated nist develop
