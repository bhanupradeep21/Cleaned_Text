smoker macrophages alveolar macrophages whose characteristics including appearance cellularity phenotypes immune response functions affected upon exposure altered immune cells derived several signaling pathways able induce numerous respiratory diseases involved asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases copd pulmonary fibrosis lung smoker macrophages observed firsthand secondhand smokers anyone exposed cigarette contents cigarette smoke extract cse would susceptible macrophages thus turns leading future alveolar macrophages crucial processing inhaled substances including cigarette chemicals particulate chemicals tobacco nicotine tar carbon monoxide stimulate several physiological pathways influence recruitment functions macrophages smoker macrophages recruited circulating monocytes original alveolar macrophages residing lung biochemical processes also lead immunomodulation dysregulated repair processes malfunction macrophages renders individuals susceptible addition inhaled substances enter bloodstream especially nicotine rapidly transported brain leading addiction subsequently distributed throughout body leading carcinoma morbidity cigarette smoking nearly million firsthand smokers millions second hand smokers killed regardless active passive smokers macrophage accumulation found diagnostic methods smokerelated diseases include bronchoalveolar lavage also used examining smokers macrophages addition augmented inflammatory cells alveolar uptake tar cigarettes accumulates alveolar macrophages causes intensity fluorescence however independent cigarette exposure indicates maximum capacity tar uptake excess tar retained macrophages another pigment smoker macrophage hemosiderin involved iron homoeostasis hemosiderinladen pigmented macrophages yellowish brown found bronchiole peribronchiolar alveolar presence dirty macrophages characteristic many smokerelated lung macrophage polarized classic phenotype phenomenon seen cigarette polarization scheme lower markers higher markers reprogram macrophage implies dysregulated inflammation damage healthy lung cells macrophage polarization mediated three major signaling pathways nfκb mapk signaling cascade lead different results depending length smoke history therefore important evaluate characteristics research participants specify experimental conditions examining smoker macrophages anticipated cigarette smoking inhibits signal transduction alters gene expression cytokine profile increasing phenotype trait involved antiinflammation tissue repair also however studies found variation conventional polarization found dual polarization multiple diseases yet direction extent polarization also different across despite contradiction treatments targeting polarization process promising results longterm smoking established diseases cse decrease production proinflammatory cytokines also impairs inhibitory effect nfκb also induces apoptosis alveolar macrophage prolonged exposure cse hence leads polarization meanwhile nfκb pathways activated low concentration cse previously unexposed individuals increased activity nfκb upregulates production proinflammatory cytokines tnfα shortterm exposure attracts macrophages neutrophils lung increase short duration also biases polarization towards phenotype number immune cells however normalized months demonstrating shift signaling direction similar time dose dependent effects cse exerted macrophage polarization mapk signaling pathway involves jnk erk intermediate signaling diseased conditions due longterm smoking inactivation jnk reduces levels reactive nitrogen species proinflammatory cytokines phenotype however brief exposure cse triggers activation erk increases tnfa levels produce inflammatory effects cigarette contents also modulate multiple stat proteins response smoking signaling stimulated potentiate phenotype elevated tgfb meantime toxic nitrogenous chemicals oxidative stress would reduced postsmoke situations reduction associated phenotype downregulation ifnγ signaling nicotine cigarettes modulates signaling pathways binding nicotinic receptors macrophage neurons hence activating cholinergic antiinflammatory changes thus directly mediated binding nicotine macrophage indirectly via vagus nerve upon binding inhibition nfκb activation pathways lead overinhibition proinflammatory cytokines thus imbalance toward antiinflammatory cytokines result may lethal inflammation controlled cigarettes contain small amount iron cumulatively larger quantity daily increasing iron exposure lung airway affects respiratory systemic iron homeostasis modifying cellular response although direct etiologic link established increase intracellular iron level concomitant iron release observed smoker ironloading affects macrophage activation functions excessive extracellular iron favors bacterial growth normally activated alveolar macrophage secretes traps bacterial siderophores prevents bacterial iron uptake iron imbalance locally lung thus results higher risk infection hemosiderin iron storage smokers macrophage rather ferritin formed hemorrhage abnormal metabolism indeed buildup iron causes oxidative stress resulting lung damage mitochondrial level hemosiderinladen macrophage also associated pulmonary hemodynamics parameters used evaluate pulmonary hypertension early stage iron homeostasis associated macrophage polarization reprogramming despite unclear causality cigarette macrophage demonstrates high tf hamp gene activities mediates iron uptake macrophage hand expresses causes iron release supplementing iron mice predisposes macrophage phenotype inhibits inflammation immune functions smoker macrophages compromised airway pathogens likely accumulate cause smoker macrophages reduced expression hladr antigens causing addition nicotine impairs phagocytosis tuberculosis also induces immunosuppression via activation nicotinic meanwhile due impaired signaling macrophages fail recognize pathogens decrease pathogen therefore smokers prone acute respiratory tract infection community acquired asthma proven causal relationship smoking due modified inflammation alveolar macrophages excessively recruited onto airway wall leading narrower airway oxygen pass patients may also affected airway remodeling smokers macrophages affect elastic fibers mucus layer airways tightening lumen causing asthma symptoms asthma include wheezing coughing chest discomfort ameliorate situation drugs either suppress inflammatory response relaxes airway administrated air pass smoking found important causative factor leading altered inflammatory response macrophages smoking induces inflammation across entire airway turns obstructs airflow symptoms copd include persistent coughing wheezing chest infections breathlessness treatments copd usually focus source problem smoking thus general treatment going smoking rehabilitation including nicotine replacement therapy mental therapy advice support quit smoking certain urgent cases direct constriction also occurs bronchodilators allow airway dilate tobacco smoking associated cancer mainly along respiratory tract may also lead cancer bladder renal upon smoking carcinogenic chemicals inhaled affecting inflammation response inflammation plays important role inducing cancer smoking affecting inflammatory response macrophages lungs dysregulated inflammatory response poses higher risk developing cancer along airway symptoms cancer mediated cancer include lumps body sudden weight loss persistent coughing tough swallowing treatments cancer generally surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy treatments directly target cancer cells kill cancer prior smoking rehabilitation programs smoking cessation one effective methods managing numerous smokerelated diseases immune diseases brings short term long term benefits mucus clearance improved hours mortality risk lung cancer halved addition immune system starts recover days inhibitory effects cigarettes macrophages risks morbidity mortality infectious diseases significantly reduced year become comparable nonsmokers years meanwhile life expectancy smoking cessation increased years reduced risks furthermore early cessation age enhances survival rate age compared average cigarette smoking extensively researched understand mechanisms affects macrophages causes diseases meanwhile novel therapies developed target molecular future treatments higher specificity potentially reverse changes macrophage cytokine profile hence improving clinical outcomes related diseases meantime governments around globe encouraging smoking cessation progress however psychological challenge smokers commit quitting often instance smoking cessation associated depression individuals may also experience withdrawal psychological aspect smoking could investigated formulate better rehabilitation strategy aid smoking cessation
