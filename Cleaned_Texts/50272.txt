dcstxsaxitoxin decarbamoylsaxitoxin decarbamylsaxitoxin decarbamoylsaxitocin like saxitoxin hygroscopic solid since saxitoxins derivatives mainly produced gonyaulax tamarensis dinoflagellate long time exact synthesis pathway unknown saxitoxin first paralytic shellfish toxin total synthesis described done kishi research group managed describe synthesis decarbamoylsaxitoxin decarbamoylsaxitoxin enters body via mouth absorbed mucosa later absorbed small absorption toxin distributed body gets removed kidneys excreted via exact biotransformation decarbamoylsaxitoxin known yet people died paralytic shellfish poisoning reported detected oxidation saxitoxin neosaxitoxin recent human liver samples metabolic pathway proposed saxitoxin shown figure update found saxitoxin converted neosaxitoxin human body harmonizes earlier research neosaxitoxin however converted either sugarbinding state pair gonyautotoxin epimers converted sugarbinding state well also sugarbound state saxitoxin formed study shows phase ii conjugation reaction common glucoronidation reaction due substance gets hydrophilic makes easily excretable even though study done saxitoxin exclusively likely metabolic pathway decarbamoylsaxitoxin since major structural difference shown substituent indicated yellow circle figureneeds update hydroxyl substituent decarbamoylsaxitoxin group affected proposed metabolism likely interrupt shown mechanism decarbamoylsaxitoxin known neurotoxin mechanism based saxitoxin namely bind sodium channels shown figure update sodium channels contain negative residues top negatively charged residues part filter sodium decarbamoylsaxitoxin contains two guanidine substructures protonated easily protonation guanidine substructures leads positive charge decarbamoylsaxitoxin positive charge decarbamoylsaxitoxin bind sodium channels binding sodium channels prevents sodium passing channel sodium passage blocked channel fulfil function impossible generate action potential cell blocked sodium channels study performed sodium channels mainly targeted study showed neuromuscular transmission motor axon muscular membrane targeted whereas endplate left unaffected also showed atrioventicular node main target inside heart consequences decarbamoylsaxitoxin paralysis death vitro tests declared decarbamoylsaxitoxin toxic clear case speculated caused alcohol group present decarbamoylsaxitoxin instead amide group saxitoxin however concluded sure decarbamoylsaxitoxin converted compounds body trouble reaching sodium channels vivo tests declared decarbamoylsaxitoxin half toxic coastal waters mostly temperate subtropical regions dinoflagellate blooms occur conditions growth aggregation cause called red tides red waters concentration toxic great risk marine life however also water clear shellfish contain toxins destroyed heating case red tide mussel contain much g human dose mg saxitoxin worldwide limits toxins shellfish cause paralytic shellfish poisoning set Î¼g per g usually within minutes ingestion poisoned shellfish paranesthesia oral region fingertips gradually proceeds neck arms legs toes together general muscular patients start feeling numb due hard make voluntary also symptoms dizziness weakness incoherence occur final stage poisoning respiratory distress full muscular paralysis occur usually hours symptoms sometimes difficult interpret since also associated alcohol increase severity antidote paralytic shellfish poisoning however proper medical care patients survive important treatment assistance patient also
