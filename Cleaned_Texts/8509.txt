halophile greek word saltloving extremophile thrives high salt concentrations chemical terms halophile refers lewis acidic species ability extract halides chemical species halophiles classified domain archaea also bacterial halophiles eukaryotic species alga dunaliella salina fungus wallemia ichthyophaga wellknown species give red color carotenoid compounds notably bacteriorhodopsin halophiles found water bodies salt concentration five times greater ocean great salt lake utah owens lake california lake urmia iran dead sea evaporation ponds theorized possible analogues modeling extremophiles might live salty subsurface water ocean jupiters europa similar halophiles categorized extent halotolerance slight moderate extreme slight halophiles prefer moderate halophiles extreme halophiles salt halophiles require sodium chloride salt growth contrast halotolerant organisms require salt grow saline conditions high salinity represents extreme environment relatively organisms able adapt survive halophilic halotolerant organisms expend energy exclude salt cytoplasm avoid protein aggregation salting survive high salinities halophiles employ two differing strategies prevent desiccation osmotic movement water cytoplasm strategies work increasing internal osmolarity cell first strategy employed archaea majority halophilic bacteria yeasts algae fungi organism accumulates organic compounds known compatible solutes either synthesised accumulated common compatible solutes neutral zwitterionic include amino acids sugars polyols betaines ectoines well derivatives compounds second radical adaptation involves selectively absorbing potassium k ions cytoplasm adaptation restricted extremely halophilic archaeal family halobacteriaceae moderately halophilic bacterial order halanaerobiales extremely halophilic bacterium salinibacter ruber presence adaptation three distinct evolutionary lineages suggests convergent evolution strategy unlikely ancient characteristic retained scattered groups passed massive lateral gene primary reason entire intracellular machinery enzymes structural proteins etc must adapted high salt levels whereas compatible solute adaptation little adjustment required intracellular macromolecules fact compatible solutes often act general stress protectants well particular note extreme halophiles haloarchaea often known halobacteria group archaea require least salt concentration usually found saturated solutions wv salts primary inhabitants salt lakes inland seas evaporating ponds seawater deep salterns tint water column sediments bright colors species likely perish exposed anything highconcentration saltconditioned environment prokaryotes require salt growth high concentration sodium chloride environment limits availability oxygen respiration cellular machinery adapted high salt concentrations charged amino acids surfaces allowing retention water molecules around components heterotrophs normally respire aerobic means halophiles unable survive outside highsalt native environments many halophiles fragile placed distilled water immediately lyse change osmotic conditions halophiles use variety energy sources aerobic anaerobic anaerobic halophiles include phototrophic fermentative sulfatereducing homoacetogenic methanogenic haloarchaea particularly family halobacteriaceae members domain archaea comprise majority prokaryotic population hypersaline currently recognised genera domain bacteria mainly salinibacter ruber comprise prokaryotic community commonly much lower percentage overall times alga dunaliella salina also proliferate comparatively wide range taxa isolated saltern crystalliser ponds including members genera haloferax halogeometricum halococcus haloterrigena halorubrum haloarcula however viable counts
