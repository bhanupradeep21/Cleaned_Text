atrioventricular block av block type heart block occurs electrical signal traveling atria upper chambers heart ventricles lower chambers heart impaired normally sinoatrial node sa node produces electrical signal control heart rate signal travels sa node ventricles atrioventricular node av node av block electrical signal either delayed completely blocked signal completely blocked ventricles produce electrical signal control heart rate heart rate produced ventricles much slower produced sa av blocks benign normal certain people athletes children blocks pathologic abnormal several causes including ischemia infarction fibrosis drugs three types degrees av block firstdegree seconddegree thirddegree thirddegree severe ecg used differentiate different types av blocks however one important consideration diagnosing av blocks ecgs possibility pseudo av blocks due concealed junctional extrasystoles important diagnose avblocks precisely unnecessary pacemaker placement patients pseudoav blocks worsen symptoms create firstdegree av block occurs delay disruption electrical signal moves atrium ventricles av ecg defined pr interval greater msec additionally dropped skipped seconddegree av block occurs electrical signal atria ventricles even impaired firstdegree av block seconddegree av block impairment results failure conduct impulse causes skipped mobitz characterized progressive yet reversible block av node ecg defined progressive prolongation pr interval resulting dropped beat pr interval gets longer longer beat finally dropped patients asymptomatic symptoms respond treatment effectively low risk mobitz av block leading complete heart block cardiac mobitz ii caused sudden unexpected failure hispurkinje cells conduct electrical impulse ecg pr interval unchanged beat beat sudden failure conduct signal ventricles resulting random skipped risks possible effects mobitz ii much severe mobitz risk progression complete heart block asystole thirddegree av block

seconddegree block often thought normal benign conditions people often result severe underlying mobitz ii seconddegree block thirddegree av block normal variants associated underlying common causes include ischemia lack blood flow oxygen heart muscle progressive fibrosis excessive scaring also possible high degree block result cardiac surgery surgeon close proximity electrical conduction system accidentally injured reversible causes mobitz ii thirddegree heart block include untreated lyme disease hypothyroidism hyperkalemia high levels potassium drug toxicity drugs slow conduction electrical signal av node betablockers digoxin calcium channel blockers amiodarone cause heart block taken excessive amounts levels blood get synchronized contraction heart occurs wellcoordinated electrical signal pathway initial electrical signal originates sa node located upper portion right atrium electrical signal travels right left atrium causes two atria contract time simultaneous contraction

ventricles delay accounts ecg period p wave qrs complex creates pr intervalcitation needed av nodes electrical signal travels bundle divides right bundle left bundle located within interventricular septum finally electrical signal travels purkinje fibers division signal right left bundle purkinje fibers allows simultaneous depolarization contraction right left ventricles contraction ventricles

different types av block av block disruption signal traveling atria ventricles results abnormalities pr interval well relationship p waves qrs complexes ecg patient symptomatic suspected av block important ecg also obtained symptoms physicians may also order continuous ecg ie holter monitor implanted cardiac monitor monitor patient symptoms conduction abnormalities longer period time av blocks types av block associated underlying structural heart disease patients may also undergo echocardiogram look heart assess laboratory diagnosis av blocks include electrolyte drug level cardiac enzyme level based upon clinical suspicion physician may lab tests assess reversible causes av block hypothyroidism rheumatologic disorders infections lyme management dependent upon severity degree blockage consistency symptoms well cause av patients firstdegree av block resulting severe lifethreatening symptoms symptomatic bradycardia hypotension thus require similarly patients seconddegree mobitz av block rarely develop lifethreatening symptoms patients asymptomatic require treatment however cases patients mobitz block develop lifethreatening symptoms require intervention patients often respond well atropine may require temporary transcutaneous pacing transvenous pacing longer patients seconddegree mobitz ii thirddegree heart block much likely symptomatic bradycardia hemodynamic instability hypotension additionally increased risk patients mobitz ii heart block developing thirddegree heart block therefore patients often require temporary pacing transcutaneous transvenous pacing wires many ultimately require permanent implanted heart block found caused reversible condition lyme disease underlying condition first treated often lead resolution heart block associated
