property whereas behavioral neurological specialties might consider two separate disciplines typically practiced separately currently neuropsychiatry become growing subspecialty psychiatry closely relates fields neuropsychology behavioral neurology attempts utilize understanding better treat illnesses fall neurological mental disorder classifications eg autism adhd tourettes syndrome given considerable overlap subspecialities resurgence interest debate relating neuropsychiatry academia last work argues rapprochement neurology psychiatry forming specialty beyond subspecialty psychiatry example professor joseph b martin former dean harvard medical school neurologist training summarized argument reunion separation two categories arbitrary often influenced beliefs rather proven scientific observations fact brain mind one makes separation artificial points major arguments detailed neurologists focused objectively organic nervous system pathology especially brain whereas psychiatrists laid claim illnesses mind antipodal distinction brain mind two different entities characterized many differences two specialties however argued division fictional evidence last century research shown mental life roots brain mind argued discrete entities different ways looking system marr argued embracing mindbrain monism may useful several reasons first rejecting dualism implies mentation biological provides common research framework understanding treatment mental disorders advanced second mitigates widespread confusion legitimacy mental illness suggesting disorders footprint
