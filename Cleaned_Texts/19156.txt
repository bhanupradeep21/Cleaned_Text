aortic valve valve heart humans animals located left ventricle aorta one four valves heart one two semilunar valves pulmonary valve aortic valve normally three cusps leaflets although population found congenitally two aortic valve last structure heart blood travels stopping flow systemic circulation aortic valve normally three cusps however discrepancy may called left coronary right coronary noncoronary sources also advocate named left right posterior anatomists traditionally named left posterior origin left coronary anterior origin right coronary right three cusps valve closed contain sinus called aortic sinus sinus valsalva two cusps origin coronary arteries found width sinuses crosssection wider left ventricular outflow tract well wider ascending aorta junction sinuses aorta called sinotubular junction aortic valve located posterior pulmonary valve commissure anterior two cusps join together points toward pulmonary valve two sinuses contain origin coronary arteries congenital disease known transposition great arteries two valves reversed anterior valve aortic valve origin coronaries still follows rule origins sinuses facing pulmonary valve term semilunar refers approximate halfmoon shape valve left ventricle contracts systole pressure rises left ventricle pressure left ventricle rises pressure aorta aortic valve opens allowing blood exit left ventricle aorta ventricular systole ends pressure left ventricle rapidly drops pressure left ventricle decreases momentum vortex outlet valve forces aortic valve close closure aortic valve contributes component second heart sound closure aortic valve permits maintaining high pressures systemic circulation reducing pressure left ventricle permit blood flow lungs fill left ventricle abrupt loss function aortic valve results acute aortic insufficiency loss normal diastolic blood pressure resulting wide pulse pressure bounding pulses endocardium perfuses diastole acute aortic insufficiency also known aortic regurgitation reduce perfusion heart consequently heart failure pulmonary edema develop slowly worsening aortic insufficiency results chronic insufficiency permits heart compensate unlike acute insufficiency compensation hypertrophy left ventricle return normal filling pressures inadequate opening aortic valve often calcification results higher flow velocities valve larger pressure gradients diagnosis aortic stenosis contingent upon quantification gradient condition also results hypertrophy left ventricle normally functioning valve permits normal physiology dysfunction valve results left ventricular hypertrophy heart failure dysfunctional aortic valves often present heart failure nonspecific symptoms fatigue low energy shortness breath exertion common causes aortic regurgitation include vasodilation aorta previous rheumatic fever infection infective endocarditis degeneration aortic valve marfans syndrome aortic stenosis also caused rheumatic fever degenerative common congenital heart defect bicuspid aortic valve fusion two cusps together commonly found turner syndrome diagnosed two options repair replace valve aortic valve repair aortic valve reconstruction describes reconstruction form function native dysfunctioning aortic valve frequently applied treatment aortic regurgitation also become necessary treatment aortic aneurysm less frequently congenital
