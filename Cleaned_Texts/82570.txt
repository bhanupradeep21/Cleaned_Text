lissencephaly ˌlɪsɛnˈsɛfəli meaning smooth set rare brain disorders whereby whole parts surface brain appear caused defective neuronal migration weeks gestation resulting lack development brain folds gyri grooves form cephalic disorder terms agyria gyri pachygyria broad gyri used describe appearance surface brain children lissencephaly generally significant developmental delays vary greatly child child depending degree brain malformation seizure control life expectancy shortened generally due respiratory problems affected children display severe psychomotor impairment failure thrive seizures muscle spasticity symptoms disorder may include unusual facial appearance difficulty swallowing anomalies hands fingers toes symptoms lissencephaly detected via ultrasound twentythree weeks require
