cartilage conduction pathway sound signals transmitted inner ear hiroshi hosoi nara medical university discovered pathway named cartilage conduction hearing cartilage conduction distinct conventional soundconduction pathways air bone realized touching transducer aural cartilage involve vibration skull bone therefore cartilage conduction referred third auditory pathway since approximately years ago two pathways acknowledged transmitting sound inner ear air conduction bone conduction hiroshi hosoi professor nara medical university currently president discovered phenomenon hearing cartilage vibration outer attaching vibrator aural cartilage sound found transmitted inner ear well proposed novel concept cartilage unique property makes capable transmitting new pathway referred cartilage conduction december academic papers published topic international scientific journals moreover cartilageconduction hearing earphones sound collector market since respectively peripheral auditory organ consists outer middle inner cochlea ear outer ear consists pinna external auditory external canal pinna shaped cartilage outer inner halves external auditory canal shaped cartilage bone respectively cartilage part bony part differentiated giving gentle pressure finger transducer placed cartilage part sound heard via cartilage conduction suitable contact position effective conduction cartilage around entrance external auditory canal whereas parts distant entrance eg crus helicis less likely involved cartilage conduction cartilageconduction pathway understood comparison air bone conduction air conduction sound propagated sound source air received outer ear transmitted via ear drum middle ear inner ear bone conduction sound vibrator oscillates skull bone vibration transmitted directly inner ear without passing ear drum middle ear cartilage conduction sound vibrator oscillates aural cartilage generated sound external auditory canal transmitted via ear drum middle ear inner ear case cartilage part external auditory canal plays roles diaphragm loudspeaker therefore sound generated cylindrical external auditory canal person use cartilage conduction sound device cartilage conduction different air conduction sound source external auditory canal different bone conduction require vibration skull hearing aids sound collector cartilage conduction useful patients disorders outer ear including aural atresia underdeveloped ear canal conventional airconduction hearing aids used basic premise cartilageconduction hearing aids cartilage located outside ear canal vibrated allows vibration transmitted despite presence outer ear disorders hearing contributes language development cartilageconduction hearing aids would particularly beneficial children disorders outer ear addition basic clinical studies cartilageconduction hearing aids commenced usa university michigan indonesia university cartilage conduction sound collector released tra company japan sound collector merits washable transducer kept sanitary condition cause uncomfortable feeling fullness ears chewing sound smartphones smartphone prototype uses cartilage conduction manufactured rohm co ltd published japanese society otorhinolaryngologyhead neck smartphone provides clearer sound conventional phones even noisy conditions furthermore sound pressure level easily modified adjusting pressure smartphone outer ear importantly sound leakage bleeding minimized resulting around user far less able hear phone call addition less oil dirt transferred smartphones surface owing smaller contact area users face cartilageconduction phone also used conventional airconduction hearing earphones ear canal physically occluded earphone operates via cartilage conduction type earphone reduce situational awareness users still hear sounds environment around similar cartilageconduction smartphones little sound leaks type first cartilageconduction earphone came onto market current communication income fills one side ears user hears environmental sound opposite free ear cartilage conduction transducers enable ears hear transmitted speech environmental sounds time occlude ears present spatial sound suitable security operation large space earphones communicate counter window cartilage conduction earphones help hearing hearingimpaired people smooth communications counters city offices banks conventional earphones ear peace filled sebum unsuitable public use cartilage conduction transducer designed smooth even shape eg ball disc kept clean wiping japan cartilage conduction earphones distributed counters public hearing devices integrated glasses transducer embedded frame glasses oscillating behind ears presenting sound via cartilage conduction without needing occlude ear canal earphones addition device noticeable others system applied smart glasses telephone glasses glassesbased hearing aids sound wristwatch smartphones user wearing wristwatch communicate people end line simply placing fingers communication robots cartilage conduction considered communicating robots currently loudspeaker systems used convey sounds produced robots however loudspeakers generate loud noises room filled many robots simultaneously emit speech sounds humantorobot communication system needed overcome problem cartilage conduction realize better communication loudspeaker system communicating underwater communication transducer outer ear transmit clear sound even water cartilage conduction useful underwater communication cartilageconduction transducers usable depths water surface audible accessories cartilageconduction transducers designed many shapes eg disk ball presents opportunities fashion jewelry industries eg cartilageconduction earrings sound jewelry june consortium
