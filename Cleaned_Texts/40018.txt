human brains evidence numerical cognition intimately related aspects thought particularly spatial one line evidence comes studies performed numberform individuals report numbers mentally represented particular spatial layout others experience numbers perceivable objects visually manipulated facilitate calculation behavioral studies reinforce connection numerical spatial cognition instance participants respond quicker larger numbers responding right side space quicker smaller numbers socalled spatialnumerical association response codes snarc effect varies across culture however research

number space also shows brain activity regions parietal cortex instance show shared activation spatial numerical various lines research suggest strong flexible connection numerical spatial cognition modification usual decimal representation advocated john colson sense complementation missing usual decimal system expressed signeddigit representation several consumer psychologists also studied heuristics people use numerical cognition example thomas morwitz reviewed several studies showing three heuristics manifest many everyday judgments decisions anchoring representativeness availability also influence numerical cognition identify manifestations heuristics numerical cognition leftdigit anchoring effect precision effect ease computation effect respectively leftdigit effect refers observation people tend incorrectly judge difference larger anchoring leftmost digits precision effect reflects influence representativeness digit patterns magnitude judgments larger magnitudes usually rounded therefore many zeros whereas smaller magnitudes usually expressed precise numbers relying representativeness digit patterns make people incorrectly judge price attractive price ease computation effect shows magnitude judgments based output mental computation also experienced ease difficulty usually easier compare two dissimilar magnitudes two similar magnitudes overuse heuristic make people incorrectly judge difference larger pairs easier computations eg minus pairs difficult computations eg minus numeracy indigenous peoples studied identify universal aspects numerical
