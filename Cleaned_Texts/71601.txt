gene therapy color blindness experimental gene therapy human retina aiming grant typical trichromatic color vision individuals congenital color blindness introducing typical alleles opsin genes animal testing gene therapy began breakthrough squirrel monkeys suggesting imminent gene therapy humans research gene therapy redgreen colorblindness lagged since successful human trials ongoing achromatopsia congenital color vision deficiency affects upwards million people world represents large demand gene therapy retina human eye contains photoreceptive cells called cones allow color vision normal trichromat possesses three different types cones distinguish different colors within visible spectrum three types cones designated l cones containing opsin sensitive different portion visible spectrum specifically l cone absorbs around nm cone absorbs near nm cone absorbs near cones transduce absorbed light electrical information relayed cells along phototransduction pathway reaching visual cortex signals cones compared generate opponent process channels channels perceived balances redgreen blueyellow color vision deficiency cvd deviation individuals color vision typical human trichromatic vision relevant gene therapy cvd classified groups dichromats partial color vision common form dichromacy redgreen colorblindness dichromacy usually arises one three opsin genes deleted otherwise fully nonfunctional effects diagnosis depend missing opsin protanopes common lopsin deuteranopes common mopsin tritanopes rare sopsin accordingly missing cone means one opponent channels inactive redgreen protanopesdeuteranopes blueyellow tritanopes therefore perceive much reduced color space although dichromacy poses critical problems daily life lack access many occupations color vision may safetycritical large disadvantage anomalous trichromats missing opsin gene rather mutated chimeric gene trichromatic vision smaller color gamut typical color vision regarding gene therapy equivalent dichromats blue cone monochromats missing l mopsin therefore color vision treated subset dichromacy since combination gene therapies protanopia deuteranopia would used individuals congenital achromatopsia tend typical opsin genes mutation another gene downstream phototransduction pathway eg protein prevents cones therefore photopic vision functioning achromats rely solely scotopic vision severity achromatopsia much higher dichromacy lack color vision also cooccurring symptoms photophobia nystagmus poor visual acuity gene therapies aim inject functional copies missing mutated genes affected individuals use viral vectors using replicationdefective recombinant adenoassociated virus raav vector cdna affected gene delivered cones back retina typically via subretinal injection intravitreal injections much less invasive yet effective subretinal injections upon gaining gene cone begins express new photopigment effect ideally permanent first retinal gene therapy approved fda voretigene neparvovec treats lebers congenital amaurosis genetic disorder lead blindness treatments also use subretinal injections aav vector therefore foundational research gene therapy

trichromatic gene therapy restore sight mice achromatopsia results positive mice gene therapy form achromatopsia performed dogs cone function day vision restored least months two young dogs achromatopsia however therapy less efficient older young human achromats shown neurological responses measured fmri photopic vision matched patterns generated scotopic vision gene therapy inferred photopic conedriven system least marginally functional methodology investigate novel color vision though one respondent claimed easily interpret traffic may considered first case cure colorblindness humans july study found positive limited improvements congenital benefits gene therapy achromats typically outweigh current risks several challenges large acceptance gene therapy dichromats occur procedure namely subretinal injection quite invasive requiring several incisions punctures eyeball poses significant risk infection complications subretinal injections methods promise become less invasive application retinal gene therapies could also replaced intravitreal injections significantly less invasive theory performed family doctor less permanence therapies also question mancuso et al reported treated squirrel monkeys maintained years color vision however repeat injections needed also concern body developing immune reaction virus body develops sensitivity viral vector success therapy could jeopardized andor body may respond unfavorably editorial j bennett points mancuso et als use unspecified postinjection corticosteroid bennett suggests monkeys may experienced inflammation due however aav virus commonly used study nonpathogenic body less likely develop immune according research david h hubel torsten wiesel suturing shut one eye monkeys early age resulted irreversible loss vision eye even suture study concluded neural circuitry vision wired critical period childhood visual circuitry longer rewired process new sensory input contrary finding mancuso et al success conferring trichromacy adult squirrel monkeys suggests possible adapt preexisting circuit allow greater acuity color vision researchers concluded integrating stimulus new photopigment adult analogous vision loss following visual yet unknown animals gain new photopigment perceiving new color article mancuso et al states monkey indeed gained trichromacy gained ability discriminate red green claim knowledge animal internally perceives way introduce new genetic information change persons phenotype gene therapy color blindness open ethical questions criticisms gene therapy general include issues around governance therapy whether treatment available afford whether availability treatment creates stigma color blindness given large number people color blindness also question whether color blindness furthermore even gene therapy succeeds converting incomplete colorblind individuals trichromats degree satisfaction among subjects unknown uncertain quality life improve worsen
