pixantrone dimaleate actual substance commonly used clinical anthracyclines important chemotherapy agents however use associated irreversible cumulative heart damage investigators attempted design related drugs maintain biological activity possess cardiotoxicity pixantrone developed reduce heart damage related treatment retaining random screening us national cancer institute vast number compounds provided allied chemical company led discovery ametantrone significant antitumor activity investigation regarding rational development analogs ametantrone led synthesis mitoxantrone also exhibited marked antitumor mitoxantrone considered analog doxorubicin less structural complexity similar mode action clinical studies mitoxantrone shown effective numerous types tumors less toxic side
