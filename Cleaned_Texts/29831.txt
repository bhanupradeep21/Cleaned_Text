hypodysfibrinogenemia also termed congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia rare hereditary fibrinogen disorder cause mutations one genes encode factor critical blood clotting fibrinogen mutations result production circulation reduced levels fibrinogen least hypodysfibrinogenemia exhibits reduced penetrance ie family members mutated gene develop disorder similar form dysfibrinogenemia termed congenital dysfibrinogenemia however congenital dysfibrinogenemia differs form hypodysfibrinogenemia four ways congenital dysfibrinogenemia involves circulation normal levels fibrinogen least dysfunctional different set causative gene mutations somewhat different mix clinical symptoms much lower rate hypodysfibrinogenemia causes episodes pathological bleeding thrombosis due low levels circulating fibrinogen also dysfunction portion circulating fibrinogen disorder lead significant bleeding even minor surgical procedures women afflicted disorderoften suffer significant bleeding giving child birth higher rates miscarriages menorrhagia ie abnormally heavy bleeding menstrual study individuals diagnosed hypodysfibrinogenemia presented episodic bleeding presented episodic thrombosis asymptomatic detected abnormal blood bleeding thrombosis generally begin adulthood average age time presentation diagnosis years bleeding frequent severe women childbearing age women may suffer miscarriages menometrorrhagia excessive bleeding child birth andor postpartum period excessive bleeding following major minor surgery including dental extractions occurs females males disorder thrombotic complications disorder often recurrent involve central peripheral arteries deep superficial veins thrombotic events may serious involve occlusion cerebral artery leading stroke splanchnic venous thrombosis pulmonary thrombosis presumptively secondary deep vein circulating fibrinogen glycoprotein made two trimers composed three polypeptide chains aα also termed α encoded fga gene bβ also termed β encoded fgb gene γ encoded fgg gene three genes located long q arm human chromosome positions respectively sites mutations occur code dysfunctional fibrinogen andor reduced fibrinogen levels cause congenital congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia inherited autosomal dominant disorder caused least different types single mutations ten mutations fibrinogen alpha chain gene also termed fga gene fibrinogen beta chain gene also termed fgb gene fibrinogen gamma chain gene also termed fgg gen mutations mainly missense mutations nonsense frameshift mutations occurring causes two fibrinogen abnormalities characterize hypodysfibrinogenemia ie circulation reduced levels fibrinogen least dysfunctional reflect different molecular following table adds information cited examples

polypeptide chain notated x psc altered amino acid codon hypodysfibrinogenemia usually diagnosed individuals history abnormal bleeding thrombosis close blood relative individual initial laboratory findings include decrease serum fibrinogen mass levels measured immunoassay plus reduction inducible blood clot formation ratio functionallydetected fibrinogen mass ie detected induced clots immunoassaydetected fibrinogen mass abnormally low ie contrast individuals congenital dysfibrinogenemia exhibit normal levels fibrinogen measured immunoassay low functionallydetected immunoassaydetected fibrinogen mass ratios ie available specialized laboratories conduct studies define exact gene mutations fibrinogen abnormalities underlying blood relatives proband case evaluated presence hypodysfibrinogenemia individuals disorder need advised inheritance complications preventative measures taken avoid bleeding andor thrombosis since individuals may develop bleeding thrombosis
