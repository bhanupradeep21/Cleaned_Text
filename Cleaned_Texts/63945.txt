parkinsonian gait festinating gait latin festinare hurry type gait exhibited patients parkinsons disease often described people parkinsons feeling like stuck place initiating step turning increase risk disorder caused deficiency dopamine basal ganglia circuit leading motor deficits gait one affected motor characteristics disorder although symptoms parkinsons disease varied parkinsonian gait characterized small shuffling steps general slowness movement hypokinesia even total loss movement akinesia extreme patients pd demonstrate reduced stride length walking speed free ambulation cadence rate double support duration patient difficulty starting also difficulty stopping starting due muscle patients parkinsons disease exhibit gait characteristics markedly different normal gait list abnormal gait characteristics given discussed certainly exhaustive whereas normal gait heel strikes ground toes also called heeltotoe walking parkinsonian gait motion characterised flat foot strike entire foot placed ground less often advanced stages disease toetoheel walking toes touch ground heel addition pd patients reduced foot lifting swing phase gait produces smaller clearance toes patients parkinsons disease reduced impact heel strike mechanism found related disease severity impact decreasing disease progresses also parkinson patients show trend towards higher relative loads forefoot regions combined load shift towards medial foot areas load shift believed help compensating postural imbalance intraindividual variability foot strike pattern found surprisingly lower pd patients compared normal normal gait vertical ground reaction force grf plot two peaks one foot strikes ground second peak caused pushoff force ground shape vertical grf signal abnormal earlier stages disease reduced forces peak heights found heel contact pushoff phase resembling elderly subjects advanced stages disorder gait characterized small shuffling steps pd patients show one narrow peak vertical grf signalcitation needed falls freezing gait two episodic phenomena common parkinsonian gait falls freezing gait pd generally thought closely intertwined several reasons importantly symptoms common advanced stages disease less common earlier stages freezing gait leading falls many instances symptoms often respond poorly sometimes paradoxically treatment dopaminergic medication perhaps pointing common underlying possible demonstrate poor paradoxical dopaminergic medication response challenge paradigm gait assessed withdrawal medication full medication freezing gait freezing gait fog typically transient episode lasting less minute gait halted patient complains hisher feet glued ground patient overcomes block walking performed relatively smoothly pathophysiology phenomenon poorly understood likely extends across disseminated functionalanatomic sadly current treatments fog offer limited benefits range novel approaches actively thought given future research strategies best common form fog start hesitation happens patient wants start walking followed frequency turning fog also experienced narrow tight quarters doorway whilst adjusting ones steps reaching destination stressful situations telephone doorbell rings elevator door opens disease progresses fog appear spontaneously even open runway proven psychological interventions help reduce negative effect psychosocial factors like anxiety depression worsen freezing gait tremor parkinsons based every patient could benefit psychological intervention reduce anxiety depression pain insomnia also reduce effect psychosocial factors worsening motor symptoms falls falls like fog rare earlier stages disorder becomes frequent disease progresses falls result mainly due sudden changes posture particular turning movements trunk attempts perform one activity simultaneously walking balancing falls also common transfers rising chair bed pd patients fall mostly forward falls fall falls occur frequently early disease course may signify another diagnosis progressive supranuclear palsy postural instability upright stance common endstage pd compromises ability maintain balance everyday tasks walking turning standing sitting inability adequately balance bodys center mass base support combined inflexibility body movements due increased rigidity causes patients advanced pd fall whereas postural sway normal stance usually increases patients balance disorders arising stroke head injury cerebellar ataxia often reduced patients pd reason pd problem appears lack flexibility shifting postural responses inflexibility increases tendency fall electromyographic emg studies leg muscles pd patients shown extreme reduction activation tibialis anterior muscle early stance early late swing phases reduction triceps surae muscle bursting pushoff quadriceps hamstring muscles hand show prolonged activation stance phase implies pd patients higher passive stiffness ankle joints show larger background emg activity cocontraction leg muscles stance stiffer joints lead abnormal postural sway pd widely used form treatment ldopa various forms ldopa able pass barrier prodrug decarboxylated brain neurotransmitter dopamine enzyme aromaticlaminoacid decarboxylase way ldopa replace deficit dopamine seen parkinsonism due feedback inhibition ldopa results reduction endogenous formation ldopa eventually becomes counterproductive effect gait parameters stride length kinematic parameters swing velocity peak velocity related energy dopasensitive temporal parameters stride swing duration stride duration variability related rhythm effect falls freezing gait levodopa treatment decreases frequency akinetic type fog tendency shorter fog episodes results indicate primarily ldopa increases threshold fog occur fundamental pathophysiology fog also shown dopamine agonists like ropinirole pramipexole pergolide strong affinity receptors opposed ldopa strong receptor affinity increase frequency effects postural sway parkinsons disease abnormal postural sway stance treatment levodopa increases postural sway movement shown early autonomic postural disturbances partially corrected later occurring postural corrections affected dopamine results indicate nondopaminergic lesions play role postural imbalance pd basal ganglia dysfunction pd causes stop acting internal cue gait parkinsons patients hence various external sensory cues like auditory visual cues developed bypass basal ganglias cueing functions visual cues visual cues commonly transverse lines rods floor floor markers cues shown improve stride length velocity parkinsonian gait substituting kinaesthetic feedback visual feedback regulating movement addition gait initiation shown significantly improved pd patients compared auditory visual cues administered laser canes reported improve gait virtual reality glasses also developed recently aid walking pd auditory cues auditory cues commonly rhythmic cues generated metronome equivalent sometimes embedded music set slightly subjects usual cadence rhythmic auditory cues associated increases velocity cadence sometimes stride gait initiated auditory cues shown little effect gait moreover prediction algorithms support efficient auditory algorithms predict freezing episodes cueing initiated deep brain stimulation dbs pedunculopontine nucleus part brainstem involved motor shown improve gait function patients parkinsons dbs subthalamic nucleus stn globus pallidus also shown positive effects gait abnormalities presented parkinsons disease patients dbs stn reported reduce freezing gait significantly year follow contradictory results reported effects dbs postural stability results seem highly location specific studies report positive effects suggest effectiveness dbs improving postural stability due ability affect nondopaminergic pathways addition dopaminergic pathways believed cause postural sway pd several studies suggest stn stimulation low frequencies hz better alleviates gait deficits commonly used high frequencies attention strategies consciously paying attention walking rehearsing step actually making pd patients shown improve gait sometimes companion walking alongside reminds patient concentrate gait create visual cue step putting foot front person pd person must step causes patient focus attention stepping action thus making voluntary action hence bypassing faulty basal ganglia pathway responsible involuntary actions like walking avoidance dual tasks require motor attention cognitive attention also shown normalize gait pd exercise physical therapy exercise shown positive effects gait parameters pd physiotherapists may help improve gait creating training programs lengthen patients stride length broaden base support improve heeltoe gait pattern straighten patients posture increase arm swing research shown gait training combining overhead harness walking treadmill shown improve walking speed stride harness assists patient maintaining upright posture eliminating need use mobility aid practice normally promotes forward flexed believed activation central pattern generator leads improvement

improving strength overall due pds progressive nature important sustain exercise routine maintain strategies using vertical walking pole also help improve upright postural alignment therapist may also use tiles footprints ground improve foot placement widen patients base creative visualization walking normalized gait pattern mentally rehearsing desired movement also shown patient also challenged walking variety surfaces tile carpet grass foamed surfaces also benefit individuals progress towards normalizing gait subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy sae also called lowerbody parkinsonism cerebellar ataxia two gait disorders whose symptoms seem closely resemble parkinsons however regression analysis studies revealed parkinsons increasing velocity walking changes stride length linearly resembles controls however sae cerebellar ataxia stride length disproportionate contribution increasing velocity indicating sae cerebellar ataxia common underlying mechanisms different mobility issues
