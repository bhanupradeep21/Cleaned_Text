animals exposed tobacco smoke cigarette byproducts use experimental subjects contact smokers case pets houses smoking takes place first recorded attempts artificially induce animal tumors application tobacco products occurred series monographs released international agency research cancer part world health organisation summarized research onwards carcinogenicity tobacco various laboratory set iarc monographs carcinogenicity cigarette smoke determined two ways first application cigarettesmoke condensates skin cigarettesmoke condensates collected passing smoke cold traps recovering retained material cigarettes usually machinesmoked material washed traps using volatile substance acetone removed many procedures collecting cigarettesmokecondensate yet standardized across laboratories including condensate stored numbers fashion cigarettes smoked type solvent used condensate collected painted onto skin animal test subjects examined set intervals assess growth tumors second method described iarc monographs used measure carcinogenicity cigarette smoke animals exposing mainstream cigarette smoke iarc monographs define mainstream cigarette smoke emitted mouth end cigarette therefore smoke human smokers would exposed iarc monographs describe methods equipment scientists developed make effective standardize deliverance mainstream cigarette smoke devices vary wholebody noseonly exposure typically involve machine smoked cigarette smoke pumped small chamber contains animal test subjects variety factors differentiate experience human smoker animal test subjects human smokers inhale smoke voluntarily therefore deeply animal test subjects typically adopt short shallow breaths exposed smoke animal test subjects primarily rodents dogs also significantly morphologically different upper respiratory system humans despite variables doses smoke administered animals determined examining tissue blood samples dogs exposed cigarette smoke via inhalation chambers easily small rodents require different methods cigarette smoke exposure methods include thracheostomy smoke pumped tube directly hole cut dogs throat mask fitted dogs iarc monographs concluded application cigarettesmoke condensates onto skin mice induces tumors benign malignant variety although carcinogenicity tobacco smoke first established humans various types animals also exposed tobacco smoke inhalation attempts yield experimental proof control various experimental factors including types tobacco levels exposure would considered unethical human studies iarc monographs referencing studies used various methods smoke inhalation concluded significantly greater number pulmonary tumors occurred among mice exposed smoke control groups since animal used testing carcinogenicity tobacco smoke syrian golden hamster due resistance pulmonary infections infrequency spontaneously develops pulmonary according iarc monographs studies proven repeatedly confirmed carcinogenicity tobacco smoke hamsters studies referenced iarc monographs found certain groups rats exposed mainstream smoke significantly likely develop lung tumors iarc monographs also referenced studies involving rabbits dogs much less conclusive authors however cited various experimental limitations small test control groups missing data could account lack conclusive multiple studies also conducted determine carcinogenicity environmental tobacco animals studies typically fall categories simulated environmental tobacco administering condensates sidestream smoke observational studies cancer among pets study consequences passive smoking scientists expose animals sidestream smoke emanates cigarettes burning cone paper combination mainstream sidestream iarc monographs conclude mice prolonged exposure simulated secondhand smoke six hours day five days week five months subsequent fourmonth interval dissection significantly higher inicidence multiplicity lung tumors control groups iarc monographs concluded sidestream smoke condensates significantly higher carcinogenic effect upon mice mainstream smoke secondhand smoke recognized risk factor cancer study conducted tufts university school veterinary medicine university massachusetts amherst linked occurrence feline oral cancer exposure environmental tobacco smoke overexpression another study conducted universities concluded cats living smoker likely get feline lymphoma risk increased duration exposure secondhand smoke number smokers study colorado state university researchers looking cases canine lung cancer generally inconclusive though authors reported weak relation lung cancer dogs exposed environmental tobacco smoke number smokers within home number packs smoked home per day amount time dog spent within home effect dogs risk lung tobaccoindustry researcher germany proposed study effects animals lifetime exposure secondhand smoke proposed study blocked philip described internal company report pm philip morris recently succeeded blocking adlkofers plan conduct lifetime animal inhalation study sidestream smoke inbifo study shown inhalation test nonreversible changes sic detected lifetime study results almost certain less favorable based analysis members german industry agreed proposed study study conducted henry ford health system found given information harmful effects passive smoking pets pet owners smoke would motivated quit would ask live quit would stop smoking animals like dogs cats squirrels small animals affected secondhand smoke inhalation also nicotine poisoningcitation needed domestic pets especially dogs usually fall ill owners leave nicotine products like cigarette butts chewing tobacco nicotine gum within reach animalcitation needed littered cigarette butts smokers problem small animals mistake food find particularly urban environmentscitation needed cigarette butts remains cigarette smoking contain filter meant contain tar particles toxins cigarette ammonia arsenic benzene turpentine toxinscitation needed cigarette butts found high quantities litter take months years filter although cigarette litter awareness campaigns encourage smokers avoid littering even carry pocket ashtrays cigarette butts rank number one list worst litter problems us makes easy small animals like puppies squirrels raccoons find unsuspectingly consume nicotine reported trillion cigarette butts wind litter worldwide per year cigarette butts reportedly account waste items found us hazard animals like seagulls turtles placed large bodies water like oceans toxins cigarette butt detrimental marine life researchers san diego state university claim filtertipped cigarette butts toxic especially marine freshwater even one cigarette butt alone soaking water day hazardous enough kill fish litre dolphins blubber marine life toxins concentrate thus dolphins especially affected toxins cigarette butt cause health problems animals like vomiting tremors hypersalivation veterinary medicine published case female labrador retriever ingesting cigarette butts labrador vomited several times increased blood urea nitrogen total protein albumin concentrations hemolysis lipemia also apomorphine hydrochloride activated charcoal administered along fluids days incident dogs health returned normal toxic level nicotine dog cat reported mg one five cigarettes newer product available markets nicotine dissolvables contains mg nicotine per pellet products like camel strips contain mg nicotine per strip though nicotine content low comparison cigarette items attractive unwary small animals like puppies much controversy exists animal testing especially nicotine tobacco products animal activism groups especially vocal claims companies like phillip morris funding animal tobacco research always much tension animal activists groups researchers became especially visible serious attack researcher edythe london ucla professor leading study targeted activists home flooded animal liberation front firebomb also left front house north american animal incident edyth london wrote article titled use animals article london expressed interest solving problem addiction offering help need help quitting tobacco addiction admit funded philip morris usa sees problem philip morris company claims presently conduct internal research use laboratory animals fund external research claim humane responsible manner shown accreditation association assessment accreditation laboratory animal care american spirit claimed turned crueltyfree cigarettes company doesnt conduct cigarette testing using move praised animal activists groups used encourage tobacco companies follow leadership american spirit main argument animal activists besides ethical treatment animals point continuing perform experiments animals prove detrimental effects tobacco already known impact press like claims one experiment vivisectors cut holes beagles throats made breathe concentrated cigarette smoke entire group also claims oregon regional primate research center rhesus monkeys live tight metal cages pregnant monkeys exposed nicotine also disapproval animal activists march dimes funded study nicotine given pregnant rats offspring tested see performed groups like peta using slogans like dont get burned philip morris theyre using money hurt animals peta also claims still question reliability results animal testing tobacco studies according article federal regulatory research agencies almost test methods guarantee effectiveness animal interagency coordinating committee validation alternative methods exists review methods researchers however continue argue longitudinal studies cigarettesmoking still need conducted animal studies superfluous necessary
