sea turtle migration longdistance movements sea turtles superfamily chelonioidea notably longdistance movement adults breeding beaches also offshore migration hatchings sea turtle hatchings emerge underground nests crawl across beach towards sea maintain offshore heading reach open feeding nesting sites adult sea turtles often distantly separated meaning must migrate hundreds even thousands several main patterns adult migration green sea turtle shuttle nesting sites coastal foraging areas loggerhead sea turtle uses series foraging sites others leatherback sea turtle olive ridley sea turtle show fidelity specific coastal foraging site instead forage open sea complex movements apparently towards goal although foraging movements leatherbacks seem determined large part passive drift currents still able return specific sites breed ability adult sea turtles travel precise targets led many wonder navigational mechanisms suggested juvenile adult turtles might use earths magnetic field determine position evidence ability juvenile green sea sea turtles known migrate long distances miles per time travel movement breeding foraging overwintering sites migration begins time hatching hatchlings begin migrate open waters emerging nest juvenile adult sea turtles engage seasonal migration likely due finding thermal habitats seeking areas sufficient food sea turtles move north spring summer seasons nutrient rich bodies water fall winter seasons migrate back southward sea turtles considered ectothermic nonavian reptiles temperature plays major affect metabolic physiological process sea turtle migration shown correlation activity levels within turtles previous research concludes levels higher migration rather size turtles also effect aerobic metabolism

helpful regulating temperatures overall increases aerobic metabolic activity following navigational methods sea turtle migration help increase fitness benefits sea turtle turtles use cues travel deeper waters higher abundance food lower risk predation sea turtles endangered finding area lower predation helps maximize overall fitness keep existent female sea turtles traveling back natal beach order lay offspring hypothesized advantage towards parasitic resistance advantage also increases fitness sea turtle along offspring efficient movement hatchlings away beach shallow coastal waters important reducing length time vulnerable predators target hatchlings beach shallow therefore sea turtle hatchlings move offshore innate behaviour first part hatchling migration called frenzy period involves almost continuous swimming first studies loggerhead leatherback hatchlings shown moonlight reflected sea important visual cue guiding movement beach navigational mechanism becomes handicap nesting sites affected artificial lighting since mean hatchlings head towards artificial lights rather offshore towards moonlit hence use moonlight turtle hatchings navigational cue considered evolutionary trap loggerhead green turtles detect orbital movement waves use information swim perpendicular waves crests means swim offshore since close shore wave crests run parallel beach offshore earths magnetic field used maintain offshore direction therefore head towards open ability head given direction without reference landmarks called compass mechanism magnetic cues used achieve called magnetic hatchling loggerheads mature within north atlantic gyre important stay within current system since water temperatures benign shown loggerheads use magnetic field stay within gyre example exposed fields characteristic region edge gyre responded orienting direction would keep within responses inherited rather learned since hatchlings tested captured reaching ocean adult turtles may learn aspects magnetic field use navigate learned rather innate juveniles often reside coastal feeding grounds green sea turtles loggerheads adult sea turtles divided categories according leatherbacks olive ridley turtles roam widely unpredictably returning specific breeding sites satellite tracking leatherbacks showed tended stay within relatively foodrich areas ocean kemps ridley sea turtles loggerheads flatback sea turtles migrate breeding areas series coastal foraging areas green sea turtles hawksbill sea turtles shuttle fixed foraging nesting sites species ridley sea turtle nest large aggregations thought antipredator adaptation simply many eggs predators consume one unifying aspect sea turtle migrations ability return specific nesting sites vast areas ocean year year may return beach hatched ability called natal philopatry demonstrated green turtles using mitochondrial dna precision migration adults across featureless dynamic oceans requires compass mechanism something
