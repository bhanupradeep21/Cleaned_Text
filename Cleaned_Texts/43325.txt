renal physiology latin rēnēs kidneys study physiology kidney encompasses functions kidney including maintenance acidbase balance regulation fluid balance regulation sodium potassium electrolytes clearance toxins absorption glucose amino acids small molecules regulation blood pressure production various hormones erythropoietin activation vitamin much renal physiology studied level nephron smallest functional unit kidney nephron begins filtration component filters blood entering kidney filtrate flows along length nephron tubular structure lined single layer specialized cells surrounded capillaries major functions lining cells reabsorption water small molecules filtrate blood secretion wastes blood urine proper function kidney requires receives adequately filters blood performed microscopic level many hundreds thousands filtration units called renal corpuscles composed glomerulus bowmans capsule global assessment renal function often ascertained estimating rate filtration called glomerular filtration rate gfr kidneys ability perform many functions depends three fundamental functions filtration reabsorption secretion whose sum called renal clearance renal excretion although strictest sense word excretion respect urinary system urination renal clearance also conventionally called excretion example set term fractional excretion sodium blood filtered nephrons functional units kidney nephron begins renal corpuscle composed glomerulus enclosed bowmans capsule cells proteins large molecules filtered glomerulus process ultrafiltration leaving ultrafiltrate resembles plasma except ultrafiltrate negligible plasma proteins enter bowmans space filtration driven starling forces ultrafiltrate passed turn proximal convoluted tubule loop henle distal convoluted tubule series collecting ducts form urine tubular reabsorption process solutes water removed tubular fluid transported blood called reabsorption absorption substances already absorbed particularly intestines body reclaiming postglomerular fluid stream well way becoming urine soon lost urine unless reclaimed reabsorption twostep process beginning active passive extraction substances tubule fluid renal interstitium connective tissue surrounds nephrons transport substances interstitium bloodstream transport processes driven starling forces diffusion active transport cases reabsorption indirect example bicarbonate transporter reabsorption involves series reactions tubule lumen tubular epithelium begins active secretion hydrogen ion h tubule fluid via nah exchanger key regulatory hormones reabsorption include hormones exert effects principally collecting ducts tubular secretion occurs simultaneously reabsorption filtrate substances generally produced body byproducts cell metabolism become toxic high concentration drugs taken secreted lumen renal tubule tubular secretion either active passive cotransport substances mainly secreted renal tubule h k urea creatinine histamine drugs like penicillin tubular secretion occurs proximal convoluted tubule pct distal convoluted tubule dct example proximal convoluted tubule potassium secreted means sodiumpotassium pump hydrogen ion secreted means active transport cotransport ie antiporter ammonia diffuses renal tubule kidneys secrete variety hormones including erythropoietin calcitriol renin erythropoietin released response hypoxia low levels oxygen tissue level renal circulation stimulates erythropoiesis production red blood cells bone marrow calcitriol activated form vitamin promotes intestinal absorption calcium renal reabsorption phosphate renin enzyme regulates angiotensin aldosterone levels kidney responsible maintaining balance following substances body sensitive ph outside range ph compatible life proteins denatured digested enzymes lose ability function body unable sustain kidneys maintain acidbase homeostasis regulating ph blood plasma gains losses acid base must balanced acids divided volatile nonvolatile see also titratable acid major homeostatic control point maintaining stable balance renal excretion kidney directed excrete retain sodium via action aldosterone antidiuretic hormone adh vasopressin atrial natriuretic peptide anp hormones abnormal ranges fractional excretion sodium imply acute tubular necrosis glomerular dysfunction two organ systems kidneys lungs maintain acidbase homeostasis maintenance ph around relatively stable value lungs contribute acidbase homeostasis regulating carbon dioxide concentration kidneys two important roles maintaining acidbase balance reabsorb regenerate bicarbonate urine excrete hydrogen ions fixed acids anions acids urine kidneys help maintain water salt level body significant rise plasma osmolality detected hypothalamus communicates directly posterior pituitary gland increase osmolality causes gland secrete antidiuretic hormone adh resulting water reabsorption kidney increase urine concentration two factors work together return plasma osmolality normal levels adh binds principal cells collecting duct translocate aquaporins membrane allowing water leave normally impermeable membrane reabsorbed body vasa recta thus increasing plasma volume body two systems create hyperosmotic medulla thus increase body plasma volume urea recycling single effect urea usually excreted waste product kidneys however plasma blood volume low adh released aquaporins opened also permeable urea allows urea leave collecting duct medulla creating hyperosmotic solution attracts water urea reenter nephron excreted recycled depending whether adh still present single effect describes fact ascending thick limb loop henle permeable water permeable sodium chloride allows countercurrent exchange system whereby medulla becomes increasingly concentrated time setting osmotic gradient water follow aquaporins collecting duct opened adh although kidney directly sense blood longterm regulation blood pressure predominantly depends upon kidney primarily occurs maintenance extracellular fluid compartment size depends plasma sodium concentration renin first series important chemical messengers make system changes renin ultimately alter output system principally hormones angiotensin ii aldosterone hormone acts via multiple mechanisms increase kidneys absorption sodium chloride thereby expanding extracellular fluid compartment raising blood pressure renin levels elevated concentrations angiotensin ii aldosterone increase leading increased sodium chloride reabsorption expansion extracellular fluid compartment increase blood pressure conversely renin levels low angiotensin ii aldosterone levels decrease contracting extracellular fluid compartment decreasing blood pressure kidney humans capable producing glucose lactate glycerol glutamine kidney responsible half total gluconeogenesis fasting humans regulation glucose production kidney achieved action insulin catecholamines renal gluconeogenesis takes place renal cortex renal medulla incapable producing glucose due absence necessary simple means estimating renal function measure ph blood urea nitrogen creatinine basic electrolytes including sodium potassium
