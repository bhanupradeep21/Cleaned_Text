cytokines broad loose category small proteins important cell signaling due size cytokines cross lipid bilayer cells enter cytoplasm therefore typically exert functions interacting specific cytokine receptors target cell surface cytokines shown involved autocrine paracrine endocrine signaling immunomodulating agents cytokines include chemokines interferons interleukins lymphokines tumour necrosis factors generally hormones growth factors despite overlap terminology cytokines produced broad range cells including immune cells like macrophages b lymphocytes lymphocytes mast cells well endothelial cells fibroblasts various stromal cells given cytokine may produced one type act cell surface receptors especially important immune system cytokines modulate balance humoral cellbased immune responses regulate maturation growth responsiveness particular cell populations cytokines enhance inhibit action cytokines complex ways different hormones also important cell signaling molecules hormones circulate higher concentrations tend made specific kinds cells cytokines important health disease specifically host immune responses infection inflammation trauma sepsis cancer reproduction word comes

receptors directly linked certain debilitating immunodeficiency states regard also redundancy pleomorphism cytokines fact consequence homologous receptors many authorities think classification cytokine receptors would clinically experimentally useful classification cytokine receptors based threedimensional structure therefore attempted classification though seemingly cumbersome provides several unique perspectives attractive pharmacotherapeutic targets cytokine matching cellsurface receptor subsequent cascades intracellular signaling alter cell functions may include upregulation
