alveolar osteitis also known dry socket inflammation alveolar bone ie alveolar process maxilla mandible classically occurs postoperative complication tooth extraction alveolar osteitis usually occurs blood clot fails form lost socket ie defect left gum tooth taken leaves empty socket bone exposed oral cavity causing localized alveolar osteitis limited lamina dura ie bone lines socket specific type known dry socket associated increased pain delayed dry socket occurs routine dental extractions mandibular lower wisdom teeth impacted buried bone lower jaw erupting since alveolar osteitis primarily infection usually pyrexia fever cervical lymphadenitis swollen glands neck minimal edema swelling erythema redness present soft tissues surrounding socket signs may include symptoms may include causes dry socket completely normally following extraction tooth blood extravasated socket blood clot thrombus blood clot replaced granulation tissue consists proliferating fibroblasts endothelial cells derived remnants periodontal membrane surrounding alveolar bone gingival time turn replaced coarse fibrillar bone finally mature woven clot may fail form poor blood supply eg secondary local factors smoking anatomical site bone density conditions cause sclerotic bone clot may lost excessive mouth rinsing disintegrate prematurely due fibrinolysis degeneration clot may caused conversion plasminogen plasmin formation factors promote fibrinolysis include local trauma estrogens pyrogens bacteria may secondarily colonize socket lead dissolution bacterial breakdown fibrinolysis widely accepted major contributing factors loss bone tissue exposed oral environment localized inflammatory reaction takes place adjacent marrow localizes inflammation walls socket become necrotic bone socket walls slowly separated osteoclasts fragmentary sequestra may bones jaws seem evolutionary resistance process bone exposed sites human body much serious condition dry socket healing delayed tissue must grow surrounding gingival mucosa takes longer normal organisation blood clot patients may develop short term result food debris stagnating socket subsequent action halitogenic main factors involved development dry socket discussed dry sockets commonly occur mandible lower jaw maxilla upper due relatively poor blood supply mandible also food debris tends gather lower sockets readily upper commonly occurs posterior sockets molar teeth anterior sockets premolars possibly size created surgical defect relatively larger blood supply relatively poorer sites dry socket especially associated extraction lower wisdom inadequate irrigation washing socket associated increased likelihood dry dry socket likely occur preexisting infection necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis chronic periodontitis wisdom teeth associated pericoronitis less likely cause dry socket oral microbiota demonstrated fibrinolytic action individuals persons may predisposed developing dry sockets tooth infection socket following tooth extraction different dry socket although dry socket secondary infection may occur addition smoking tobacco use kind associated increased risk dry may partially due vasoconstrictive action nicotine small blood another risk attributed actual inhalation drawing smoke particularly dense filters tightly rolled cigarettes creates small amount suction cause blood clot healing gum become loose dislodged period time smoking days immediately following dental extraction reduces risk dry socket occurring dry socket likely occur following difficult tooth thought excessive force applied tooth excessive movement tooth burnishes bony walls socket crushes blood vessels impairing repair vasoconstrictors present local anesthetics intended increase length analgesia reducing blood supply region reduces amount local anesthetic solution absorbed circulation carried local tissues hence use local anesthetics vasoconstrictors associated increased risk dry socket however occasion use local anesthetic without vasoconstrictors would provide sufficient analgesia especially presence acute pain infection maxillary teeth meaning total dose local anesthetic may need increased adequate pain control extraction balanced increased risk dry socket however use mepivacaine without epinephrine inferior alveolar nerve blocks found similar anesthetic effect lidocaine epinephrine save shorter duration action may considered alternative simple mandibular extractions radiotherapy directed bones jaws causes several changes tissue resulting decreased blood menstrual cycle could determinant risk factor frequency alveolar osteitis studies shown hormonal changes women middle menstrual cycle ones taking oral contraceptives birth control pills higher tendency alveolar osteitis tooth extraction surgery recommended elective surgeries performed menstrual period users nonusers oral contraceptives eliminate effect cyclerelated hormonal changes development alveolar dry socket typically causes pain second fourth day following dental extraction causes post extraction pain usually occur immediately anesthesiaanalgesia worn eg normal pain surgical trauma mandibular fracture delayed onset eg osteomyelitis typically causes pain several weeks following examination typically involves gentle irrigation warm saline probing socket establish sometimes part root tooth piece bone fractures retained socket another cause pain socket causes delayed healing dental radiograph xray may indicated demonstrate suspected evidence suggests rinsing chlorhexidine placing chlorhexidine gel sockets extracted teeth reduces frequency dry another review concluded preventative antibiotics reduce risk dry socket infection pain following third molar extractions healthy authors questioned whether treating people antibiotics prevent one infection would harm overall view potential side effects also antibiotic resistance nevertheless evidence individuals based clinical assessment conditions clear risk may benefit also evidence antifibrinolytic agents applied socket extraction may reduce risk dry dentists oral surgeons routinely debride bony walls socket encourage hemorrhage bleeding belief reduces incidence dry socket evidence support practice suggested dental extractions females taking oral contraceptives scheduled days without estrogen supplementation typically days menstrual also suggested teeth extracted scaled prior prevention alveolar osteitis exacted following postoperative instructions including treatment usually ie pain medications also removal debris socket irrigation saline local medicated dressings also commonly placed although act foreign body prolong healing usually needed due pain dressings usually stopped pain lessened examples medicated dressings include antibacterials topical anesthetics obtundants combinations three eg zinc oxide eugenol impregnated cotton pellets alvogyl eugenol iodoform butamben dentalone bismuth subnitrate iodoform paste bipp ribbon gauze metronidazole lidocaine review treatments dry socket concluded enough evidence determine effectiveness people develop dry socket typically seek healthcare advice several times dental extraction old dressing removed socket irrigated new dressing placed curettage socket increases pain whether overall benefit dry socket occurs total healing time increased postoperative pain also worse normal discomfort accompanies healing following minor surgical procedure pain may last seven forty overall rate dry socket routine dental impacted mandibular third molars wisdom teeth buried females frequently affected males appears related oral contraceptive use rather underlying gender majority dry sockets occur individuals aged dental extractions occur although given individual likely occur increasing possible risk factors include periodontal disease acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis local bone disease pagets disease bone osteopetrosis cementoosseous dysplasia history
