suzhousaurus meaning suzhou lizard genus large therizinosauroid dinosaur early cretaceous china genus known two specimens discovered xiagou formation zhonggou situated xinminbao group findings made fieldworks though suzhousaurus known two specimens earlier named described therizinosauroid adjacent basin nanshiungosaurus bohlini may synonymous former however suzhousaurus compared species due nonoverlapping material loss moreover synonymy result suzhousaurus bohlini n bohlini priority suzhousaurus unusually large early cretaceous therizinosauroid reaching lengths ft nearly kg weight upper arm humerus distinct therizinosaurids making suzhousaurus considered therizinosauroid unlike derived advanced therizinosaurids vertebral column highly pneumatized however pelvis shows marked therizinosauridlike opisthopubic build like therizinosauroids suzhousaurus elongated claws neck browsing robust hindlimbs large trunk ended reduced tail description complete second specimen autapomorphies validity suzhousaurus became clear numerous anatomical traits indicate suzhousaurus nontherizinosaurid therizinosauroid therefore excluded derived therizinosauridae though genus often recovered sister taxon family holotype specimen discovered xinminbao group yujingzi basin consists partial skeleton lacking cranial material contains right humerus right scapulocoracoid dorsal

indicates resemblance giant ground sloths megatherium li colleagues pointed suzhousaurus might identical nanshiungosaurus bohlini earlier named therizinosauroid found geological group also known limited remains resulting species name would suzhousaurus bohlini terms priority however direct comparison difficult overlapping material holotype n bohlini apparently new fairly complete skeleton described specimen contains last three dorsal vertebrae sacrum composed five sacral vertebrae first six caudal vertebrae complete pelvic girdle composed left ilium pubis ischium femora right femur fragmented discovered field team fossil research development center geology mineral resources exploration gansu province also xinminbao group since left pubis specimens share similar traits fossil remains represent another specimen although specimens lack cranial material button colleagues reported isolated dentary tooth referred suzhousaurus collected yujingzi basin near area two described
