fetal warfarin syndrome disorder embryo occurs child whose mother took medication warfarin brand name coumadin pregnancy resulting abnormalities include low birth weight slower growth intellectual disability deafness small head size malformed bones cartilage warfarin oral anticoagulant drug blood thinner used reduce blood clots deep vein thrombosis embolism people prosthetic heart valves atrial fibrillation ischemic warfarin blocks action vitamin k causing inhibition blood clotting factors probonebuilding hormone osteocalcin warfarin teratogen cross mother developing fetus inhibition clotting factors lead internal bleeding fetus inhibition osteocalcin causes lower bone growth well birth defects warfarin induce spontaneous abortion warfarin contraindicated pregnancy key symptoms visible birth vary individuals exposed warfarin utero severity occurrence symptoms dose dependent higher doses mg warfarin daily likely cause immediately noticeable period pregnancy warfarin administered affect category defects develop warfarin taken first trimester pregnancy likely result physical abnormalities warfarin taken second third trimester commonly causes abnormalities central nervous system extreme symptoms severe intellectual disability blindness deafness occur often warfarin used throughout three babies born fetal warfarin syndrome may belowaverage birth weight continue grow reduced children fetal warfarin syndrome show many otolaryngological abnormalities consistent abnormal bone cartilage growth children may present hypoplasia nasal ridge deep groove midline thinned absent nasal choanal atresia narrowing airway posterior nasal cavity cleft lip large soft protrusions larynx facial defects narrowing airways often lead respiratory distress noisy breathing later speech defects narrow airways often widen age allow easier dental problems also seen abnormally large dental buds late eruption deciduous development eyes also affected warfarin microphthalmia abnormally small eyes telecanthus abnormally far apart eyes strabismus misaligned crossed eyes common signs fetal warfarin appearance ectopic lacrimal duct tear duct protrudes laterally onto eye also

relaxation appear newborns severe nervous deficits atrophy optic nerve also cause blindness fetal warfarin inhibition coagulation resultant internal bleeding cause red blood cells present bloodstream low blood pressure newborns fetal warfarin low hemoglobin levels lead partial oxygen starvation high level lactic acid bloodstream acidosis prolonged oozing fluid stump cut umbilical cord common fetal warfarin syndrome appears greater children whose mothers took warfarin warfarin low molecular weight pass maternal fetal bloodstream tight filterlike junctions placental barrier teratogenic effects warfarin well known medication rarely prescribed pregnant women however patients risks associated discontinuing warfarin use may outweigh risk embryopathy patients prosthetic heart valves carry particularly high risk thrombus formation due inorganic surface turbulent blood flow generated mechanical prosthesis risk blood clotting increased generalized hypercoagulability concentrations clotting factors rise increased chance blood clots leads increased risk potentially fatal pulmonary systemic emboli cutting blood flow oxygen critical organs thus patients may continue taking warfarin throughout pregnancy despite risks developing child warfarins ability cause fetal warfarin syndrome utero stems ability limit vitamin k warfarin binds blocks enzyme vitamin k epoxide reductase usually
