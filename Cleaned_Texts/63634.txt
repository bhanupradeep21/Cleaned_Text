mother vinegar biofilm composed form cellulose yeast bacteria sometimes develops fermenting alcoholic liquids process turns alcohol acetic acid help oxygen air acetic acid bacteria aab similar symbiotic culture bacteria yeast scoby mostly known production kombucha develops much lesser extent due lesser availability yeast often longer present winecider stage different population bacteria mother vinegar often added wine cider alcoholic liquids produce vinegar home although bacteria historically also used large scale production hermann boerhaave one first scientists study vinegar early showed importance mother vinegar acetification process increased oxidation surface allowed better vinegar production called mother vegetal substance south african botanist christian hendrik persoon named mother vinegar mycoderma believed fungus attributed vinegar production mycoderma since formed surface wine left open louis pasteur made conclusion vinegar made plant belonged group mycoderma made purely chemical oxidation ethanol named plant mycoderma aceti mycoderma aceti neolatin expression greek μύκης fungus plus δέρμα skin latin aceti martinus willem beijerinck founder modern microbiology identified acetic acid bacteria mother vinegar named bacteria acetobacter aceti toshinobu asai japanese microbiologst discovered new genus bacteria mother vinegar gluconobacter discovery genera species bacteria found compose aab found mother mother vinegar singlecell fungus related yeast forms grayish veil fine solid depending conditions veil forms conditions include nutrients like proteins found wine limited acidity ideal concentrations veil nontoxic composed cellulose aab raw materials manufacturing features determine genus bacteria composes aab pcr fingerprinting revealed acetobacter genus abundant mother vinegar resulting apples komagataeibacter genus dominant mother vinegar resulting grapes mother vinegar apples okinawenis abundant species bacteria grape vinegar mother k europaeus dominant bacterial also many bacterial genera mother vinegar polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis pcrdgge used detect bacterial components genera vinegar groups include acetobacter acidomonas ameyamaea asaia gluconacetobacter gluconobacter granulibacter komagataeibacter kozakia neoasaia saccharibacter swaminathania tanticharoenia bacteria normally gramnegative gramvariable polar flagella also need aerobic environment grow prefer environment ph survive ph nonspore forming bacteria bacteria difficult find spontaneous fermentation competition microbial groups time mother vinegar viable culturable vbnc state genera gluconacetobacter komagataeibacter produce high levels bacterial cellulose mother vinegar composed amount gluconacetobacter acetobacter mother vinegar associated concentration acetic acid vinegar vinegars concentration acetic acid greater contained gluconacetobacter concentration less typically see acetobacter present however industrial scale acetobacter seen acetic acid concentrations lactic acid bacteria also present mother vinegar aid breakdown carbohydrates alcohol fermentation process lactic acid bacteria create lactic acid results ph decrease final vinegar product shanxi aged vinegar species different bacterial genera present mother vinegar species include limosilactobacillus fermentum formerly lactobacillus fermentum weissella confusa lentilactobacillus buchneri aka lactobacillus buchneri lactiplantibacillus plantarum aka lactobacillus plantarum lacticaseibacillus casei formerly lactobacillus casei pediococcus acidilactici p pentosaceus bacteria grampositive long rodshaped elliptical shaped cocci shaped bacteria mother vinegar also composed yeasts ferment sugars wine cider alcoholic liquids ethanol shanxi aged vinegar types yeast found alcoholic fermentation however three main strains found mother vinegar included scerevisae panomala cberkhout scerevisae abundant species fermentation stage fermentation scerevisiae dominates growth due species tolerance mother vinegar used aid production vinegar drawbacks mother vinegar penetrate mass vinegar disrupts vinegar making process mycoderms consume oxygen wine breaking thick layer mother vinegar also destroy odorant compounds vinegar way avoid side effects use surface veil mother vinegar made mass scale system utilizes mother vinegar called orleans french named since many wines sold vinegar brewers orleans port loire france system grows mother vinegar big surface mother fed organic liquids rich phosphates nitrogen mother placed top wine big shallow vats vat covered another vat cover mother acetifies wine mother vinegar also used traditional production balsamic vinegar balsamic vinegar created cooking grape juice create concentrate concentrate poured demijohn left sit throughout winter spring concentrate transferred wooden barrel summer mother vinegar used start vinegar fermentation concentrate mother separated different barrels varying wood types vinegar created course mother vinegar also form storebought vinegar residual sugar leftover yeast bacteria andor alcohol contained vinegar common unpasteurized vinegar since pasteurization might stabilize process completely necessarily appetizing appearance mother vinegar completely harmless surrounding vinegar discarded filtered using coffee filter used start bottle vinegar simply mother vinegar mother kombucha share many similarities different kombucha mother created fermentation tea mother vinegar created fermentation wine cider alcoholic beverages fermentation process tea creates scoby scoby creates bacterial cellulose film like seen mother vinegar bacteria also oxidizes alcohol create acetic acid main bacterial genus involved mother kombucha acetobacter also main genus mother vinegar kombucha mother also bacteria genus gluconobacter found vinegar vinegar kombucha mothers contain yeast ferments sugars ethanol fermentation process aab oxidizes ethanol acetic acid main difference mother vinegar mother kombucha acetic acid tolerance vinegar higher acetic acid concentration kombucha therefore species mother vinegar needs tolerate higher levels acetic due differences compositions mothers mother vinegar used produce kombucha due derived tea bacteria different characteristics condimentrelated article stub
