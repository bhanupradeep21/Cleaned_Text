monocots monocotyledons one two major groups flowering plants angiosperms dicots dicotyledons order reproduce utilize various strategies employing forms asexual reproduction restricting individuals sexually compatible influencing pollinated nearly reproductive strategies evolved dicots independently evolved monocots despite similarities close relatedness monocots dicots distinct traits reproductive biologies monocots reproduce sexually use seeds single cotyledon however great number monocots reproduce asexually clonal propagation breeding systems utilize selfincompatibility much common utilize selfcompatibility majority monocots animal pollinated pollinator monocots mechanisms promote suppress crossfertilization allogamy selffertilization autogamy geitonogamy pollination syndromes monocots quite distinct include flower parts multiples three adaptations pollination water hydrogamy pollination sexual deception reproducing seeds widespread method reproduction monocots dicots however internal seed structure vastly different groups cotyledon embryonic leaf within seed monocots one whereas dicots two evolution one two cotyledons may arisen mya monocots dicots thought furthermore cotyledons dicot seeds contain endosperm acts seed food storage monocot endosperm separated reproduction seeds normally sexual mode reproduction however cases individuals asexually produce fertile seeds without pollination termed apomixis monocots reproduce asexually without need seeds clonal propagation production division vegetative structures develop new individuals genetically identical progenitor vegetative structures also form enlarged tubers function food storage monocots constitute majority plants structures mainly families iridaceae liliaceae amaryllidaceae many different types clonal propagation classified type tissue propagating monocots classified perfect bisexual flowers monoecious separate male female flowers plant dioecious flowers one sex individual polygamous bisexual flowers male andor female flowers plants dioecious option mate different individuals cases possibility individuals pollen may make contact stigma reason plants genetic mechanisms prevent fertilization pollen grains closely related stigma selfincompatibility mechanisms breeding systems occur molecular level biochemical reaction stigma recognizes genetic differences pollen grains depending species individual plants selfpollinate individuals plants crosspollinate intraspecifically individuals species individuals crosspollinate interspecifically individuals different species hybridize orchids known weak barriers mating individuals closely related ie self may result inbreeding depression usually considered advantageous crosspollinate intraspecifically case selfincompatibility utilized least families monocots genetic mechanisms ensure selfincompatibility widespread form selfincompatibility monocots meaning compatibility determined genotype pollen grain two described mechanisms gametophytic selfincompatibility shown occur four families dicots rnase sglycoprotein none found however evidence orchids alternative undescribed mechanism gametophytic homomorphic sporophytic selfincompatibility yet discovered form compatibility determined genotype anther pollen grain created heteromorphic sporophytic selfincompatibility mechanism heterostylous flowers shown occur one family monocots lateacting ovarian selfincompatibility described agavaceae iridaceae grasses mechanism selfincompatibility unique employ two unlinked loci z alleles loci equivalent pollen grain stigma lands pollen grain selfcompatible sc pollination systems less common selfincompatibile crosspollination systems however probability crosspollination low advantageous selfpollinate selfpollination known favored orchids rices caulokaempferia coenobialis pollination systems monocots diverse two thirds monocots evolved zoophilous animal others instead waterpollinated windpollinated cyperaceae juncaceae sparganiaceae typhaceae notably modes evolved facilitate transfer pollen grain onto stigma zoophilous monocots pollinator generalists notable exception monocot pollen grains monocolpate meaning one groove outer surfaces called exines smooth monocots utilize either crosspollination selfpollination strategies dicots advantage either strategy depends ecological factors pollinator abundance competition strategies either promote fertilization self suppress fertilization others resulting selfpollination suppress fertilization self promote fertilization others resulting crosspollination strategies also exist suppress fertilization species reproductive barriers pollination strategies function breeding systems however occur ecological level level floral structure rather molecular level stigma genetic recognition selfpollination prevented physical temporal mechanisms evolved response interactions pollen vectors mechanisms make crosspollination easier accomplish lowering chances selfpollination example dichogamy temporal differentiation ripening sexual organs common monocots protogynous protoandrous flowers herkogamy spatial separation sexual organs also present many selfpollination occur without aid animals animalmediated sexual organs positioned closer spatially temporally inverse strategies dichogamy herkogamy however selfpollination selfinduced flower unique mechanisms evolved caulokaempferia coenobialis zingiberaceae pollen transported via drop oil forms anther slowly slides orchid paphiopedilum parishii anthers liquify touch stigma help gravity rather another orchid holcoglossum amesianum rotates anther circles transfer pollen stigma apomixis asexual reproduction seeds require pollination distributed throughout monocot clade poales asparagales liliales dioscoreales alismatales thus apomixis may evolved basal ancestor since repeatedly become pollination syndromes floral adaptations response pollen vectors production nectar flower structure uniformly distributed within monocots monocot flowers occur parts multiples three usually three stamen three petals three sepals six tepals usually one however stamens twos found cypripedioideae single fertile stamens found philydraceae zingiberaceae gynostemium orchidacaea furthermore flower structures evolved trap insects accomplish pollination found many monocot relation flower arrangement alone plants perfect flowers likely selfpollinate dioecious plants likely crosspollinate zoophily animal pollination method pollination utilizes animals pollen vectors order pollen affix animal bodies tryphine coating usually present zoophilous pollen achieve adhesive pollen visual attractants monocot flowers mainly come coloration tepals however species small green tepals zoophilous organs evolve visually attractive colored bracts araceae cyclanthaceae arecaceae otherwise attraction based scent similar pigments used monocot dicot flower coloration independently many monocots produce scent attract pollinators perhaps many produce zoophilous monocots produce nectar reward nectar alike nectar carpellary septal nectaries common unique monocots nonseptal nectaries often epithelial positioned perigonal nectaries tepals occurring monocots also nectar produced perigonal unicellular hairs trait observed monocots disc nectaries whereas dicots like dicots zoophilous monocots produce nectar instead offer pollen main reward even offer rewards oils bees starchy tissue beetles sleeping holes bees perfume euglossini male bees collect present legs mating deceptive flowers offer actual rewards much widespread monocots dicots common perpetrator orchids orchids commonly provide empty nectar one genus ophrys known ability mimic female bees degree fools male bees pseudocopulating female thereby pollinating flower windpollinated plants produce nectar attractive scents petals adapted pollination animal vectors grasses large windpollinated group stigmas often feathery help catch pollen wind monocots account nearly hydrophilous waterpollinated plants monocots adapted use water vector constitute aquatic depending species pollen either float surface disperse wind water currents towards surfacefloating flowers pollen drift underwater flowers submerged later scenario pollen without exine stigmas species bamboos grow years without flowering flowering simultaneously occur groves across world termed gregarious mast flowering possible trigger flower genetically determined multiple forests develop clones one individual cause trigger still
