selfserving bias cognitive perceptual process distorted need maintain enhance selfesteem tendency perceive oneself overly favorable belief individuals tend ascribe success abilities efforts ascribe failure external individuals reject validity negative feedback focus strengths achievements overlook faults failures take credit groups work give members protecting selfesteem threat injury cognitive perceptual tendencies perpetuate illusions error also serve selfs need example student attributes earning good grade exam intelligence preparation attributes earning poor grade teachers poor teaching ability unfair test questions might exhibiting selfserving bias studies shown similar attributions made various situations interpersonal consumer motivational processes ie selfenhancement selfpresentation cognitive processes ie locus control selfesteem influence selfserving crosscultural ie individualistic collectivistic culture differences special clinical population ie depression considerations within much research selfserving bias used participant selfreports attribution based experimental manipulation task outcomes naturalistic modern research however shifted focus physiological manipulations emotional inducement neural activation attempt better understand biological mechanisms contribute selfserving theory selfserving biases first came attention late early research topic grew people concerns fear emerged hypothesis would prove incorrect much like perceptual defense hypothesis dixon however theory holds strong theory still developed research attribution bias fritz heider found ambiguous situations people made attributions based needs order maintain higher selfesteem viewpoint specific tendency became know selfserving bias miller ross conducted study one earliest assess selfserving bias also attributions successes failures within argued selfserving bias people create rational dependent ones need selfesteem means outcome event consistent persons expectation attribute dispositional internal factors hand outcome event doesnt match persons expectations make situational attributions blaming surroundings instead investigations selfserving bias laboratory differ depending experimental goals basic fundamental aspects participants perform task often intelligence social sensitivity teaching ability therapy participants may asked work alone pairs groups task completion participants given randomized bogus feedback studies employ emotioninduction mechanisms investigate moderating effects selfserving finally participants make attributions given outcomes attributions assessed researchers determine implications selfserving modern testing employs neural imaging techniques supplement fundamental selfserving bias laboratory procedures neural correlates selfserving bias investigated electroencephalography well functional magnetic resonance imaging procedures allow insight brain area activity exhibition selfserving bias well mechanism differentiate brain activity healthy clinical retrospective performance outcomes used investigation selfserving bias example reported company performance followed selfreport outcome selfreport attributions used assess successes failures viewed company employees executives method used numerous outcome variables determine presence absence selfserving bias two types motivation affect selfserving bias selfenhancement selfenhancement aims uphold selfworth attributing successes internally failures externally helps people selfenhancement selfpresentation refers drive convey desired image others make selfserving attributions manage example claim personal responsibility successes failures attempt influence others perceive motivation works conjunction cognitive factors produce personally satisfying selfpreserving attributions locus control one main influences attribution style individuals internal locus control believe personal control situations actions matter external locus control believe outside forces chance luck determine situations actions change individuals external locus control likely exhibit selfserving bias following failure internal locus difference attribution style individuals internal external loci control however marked successful outcomes individuals types attribution style less need defend selfimages success airplane pilots internal locus control likely exhibit selfserving bias regard skill levels studies shown slight discrepancy males females use selfserving bias selfreport surveys investigating partner interactions romantic couples men tended attribute negative interactions partners women evidence men may exhibit selfserving bias women although study look positive interaction attributions older adults shown make internal causal attributions negative differential attribution style different ages indicates selfserving bias may less likely older adults older adults attributed negative outcomes internal factors also rated poorer health negative emotional factors may confound found age effects evidence crosscultural differences tendency exhibit selfserving bias particularly considering individualistic western versus collectivistic nonwestern family group goals important collectivistic cultures contrast individual goals identity focused individualistic societies increases need people within cultures guard boost personal selfesteem differences shown conflicting literature cited similarity causal attributions across individual collective cultures specifically belgium west germany south korea naturalistic observation information comparing united states japanese companies outcome attributions shows meaning psychological function internal versus external attributions similar across cultures difference strategy consensus reached crossculture influences selfserving bias though systematic differences seem present especially western nonwestern cultures example study conducted kudo numuzaki named explicit direct selfserving bias japan reexamination selfserving bias success failure showed participants success condition provided internal attributions participants failure condition even though past research constantly shown japanese people tend show selfserving also another study conducted hugten witteloostuijn named foreign language effect selfserving bias field experiment high school classroom displayed results student participants ages mainly process feedback nonnative english tend show selfserving bias process feedback native dutch investigations selfserving bias distinguish role participants actor task observer someone else performing task relating closely asymmetry actors task exhibit selfserving bias attributions success failure feedback whereas observers make attributions another persons task observers tend objective tendency ascribe internal external attributions peoples outcomes may due fact selfimage actors challenged directly therefore actors feel need protect selfimage feel inclination selfimage others emotions influence feelings selfesteem turn alters need protect ones selfidentity individuals higher selfesteem thought protect selfimage therefore exhibit selfserving bias often individuals lower study participants induced feel emotions guilt revulsion less likely make selfserving attributions success less likely make selfprotecting attributions coleman concluded two emotions guilt revulsion lead drop selfesteem thus reduction use selfserving bias relationship individuals awareness levels perceived probability improvement also influences activation selfserving individuals high selfawareness attribute failure internally perceive high probability improvement however engage selfserving bias attributing failure externally perceive low probability improvement individuals low selfawareness attribute failure externally regardless perceived probability improvement whether selfserving bias exhibited may depend interpersonal closeness relationships social context working pairs complete interdependent outcome tasks relationally close pairs show selfserving bias relationally distant pairs study selfserving bias relational context suggests due idea close relationships place limits individuals self enhancement individual becomes modest close relationship less likely use relationship benefit understanding partners refrain selfserving bias still question partially explained favorable impression close relationships one another similar result shown looking pairs friends strangers pairs performed interdependent outcomes creativity test given bogus pipeline success failure outcome strangers exhibited selfserving bias responsibility attributions friends tended make joint attributions success failure researchers taken evidence boundaries another study conducted implicit explicit evaluation partners exes parents either married separated divorced researched investigate selfserving bias influenced using two implicit association tests one measuring self vs partner measuring self vs ex results showed time men women consider exes partners less suitable parents demonstrates selfserving bias ascribe easily successes internal factors failures towards also another result demonstrated women revealed higher selfserving bias men implicit explicit measures toward exes toward current partners consider exes outgroup partners selfserving bias found several aspects workplace research shows selfserving bias used explain employment hired job attributed personal factors whereas failure obtain job attributed external experimental investigation explanations unemployment asking participants imagine particular job opportunities likelihood getting jobs however show selfserving researchers claim may due actorobserver role differences selfserving bias within workplace victims serious occupational accidents tend attribute accidents external factors whereas coworkers management tend attribute accidents victims interpersonal dynamics selfserving bias previous section implications attributions outcomes workplace investigation group dynamics virtual group members complete decisionmaking task via computermediated communication results showed selfserving bias present negative outcomes greater interpersonal distance group members increased blame negative studies revealed narcissism related enhanced selfratings leadership even controlling big five traits another study showed narcissism related enhanced leadership selfperceptions indeed whereas narcissism significantly positively correlated selfratings leadership significantly negatively related ratings leadership study also revealed narcissism related favorable selfratings workplace deviance contextual performance compared supervisor narcissism broadly reflects strong selfadmiration behavioral tendencies may viewed positively others possible narcissism influences self perceptions differently insight possibility may important given differences perceptions foundation certain types performance management development studies lab field settings shown teachers students hold selfserving biases regard outcomes attributions hold potential conflict teacher student since neither take personal responsibility student may blame teacher teacher holds student accountable however teachers students also reported aware others bias indicated may feasible conflict resolution mechanism computers become integral part everyday life research shown individuals may subconsciously treat interactions computers would treat social finding combined known selfserving bias interpersonal relations indicates consumers use computer buy products take personal credit successful purchases blame computer negative purchase experiences also found however consumers willing attribute successful purchases computer ascribe blame computer failed purchases intimate selfdisclosure computer moon describes revelation personal information makes discloser feel another reason people used bad functionality counterintuitive features bugs sudden crashes contemporary software applications tend complain computer problems instead believe personal responsibility predict possible issues find solutions computer problems unique phenomenon recently observed several humancomputer interaction individuals shown exhibit selfserving bias regard sports outcomes one study collegiate wrestlers division level made selfreported attributions outcomes preseason matches winners likely losers attribute match outcome internal researchers note wrestling oneonone sport clearly defined winners therefore sports nature may show similar results team sports sports ambiguous outcomes may show pattern selfserving another study conducted research focused comparing selfserving attributions made individuals played single sports played teams study gathered statements coded attributional content lone performers tennis golf players team performers baseball football basketball results showed lone performers made selfserving attributions team performers performance outcomes greater effect individual esteem unlike group outcomes must often distributed among participants expand upon selfserving attributions made team sports study conducted coded newspaper accounts baseball football attributional content coding newspaper accounts showed tendency make internal attributions success external attributions failure supports selfserving bias attributions winning teams internal attributions losing teams clinically depressed patients tend show less selfserving bias individuals general study exploring effects mood selfserving bias moods participants manipulated either positive negative negative mood participants less likely attribute successful outcomes self positive mood participants attributing success external suggested negative mood depressed individuals well selffocused attention explains clinically depressed populations less likely exhibit selfserving bias normal selfserving bias defined also kaplan et al individual preferences effects hisher beliefs optimistic way kaplan et al also defines ssb termed selfdefeating phenomenon appears persons give furthermore kaplan et al state specific type selfserving bias wishful thinking typically present unpleasant surprise pops negotiation particularly opponent made preparations carefully another example wellknown phenomenon lawcourt commonly used also lawbased tvseries say according kaplan et als finding selfserving bias playing major role negotiation context emotional effect negotiations seems reflection selfserving bias emotions selfserving bias investigated fmri method normal populations attributions using bias show activation dorsal striatum plays role motivated behavior well dorsal anterior clinically depressed patients appear weaker connections dorsomedial prefrontal cortex limbic areas brain connection may play role selfserving study employing eeg method examining brain activation participants given bogus outcome feedback indicated either success failure told make attributions different nonselfserving responses selfserving responses show increased dorsomedial frontal cortex activity preceding attribution decisions lack brain activity implies selfcontrol controlled dorsomedial frontal cortex prominent
