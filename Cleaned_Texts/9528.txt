tooth eruption process tooth development teeth enter mouth become visible currently believed periodontal ligament plays important role tooth eruption first human teeth appear deciduous primary teeth also known baby milk teeth erupt mouth around months years age process known teething teeth ones mouth person years old creating primary dentition stage time first permanent tooth erupts begins time combination primary permanent teeth known mixed dentition stage lasts last primary tooth lost remaining permanent teeth erupt mouth permanent dentition stage although researchers agree tooth eruption complex process little agreement identity mechanism controls many theories time eventually according growth displacement tooth pushed upward mouth growth tooths root opposite direction continued bone formation theory advocated tooth pushed upward growth bone around tooth addition believed teeth pushed upward vascular pressure anatomic feature called cushioned hammock cushioned hammock theory first proposed harry sicher taught widely theory postulated ligament tooth sicher observed microscope histologic slide responsible eruption later ligament sicher observed determined merely artifact created process preparing widely held current theory several forces might involved eruption periodontal ligament provides main impetus process theorists hypothesize periodontal ligament promotes eruption shrinking crosslinking collagen fibers contraction good evidence experimental animals traction force unlikely involved tooth eruption animals treated lathyrogens interfere collagen crosslink formation showed similar eruption rates control animals provided occlusal forces removed inherent theories outlined idea force generated periodontal ligament beneath unerupted teeth force physically drives teeth bone idea may superseded recent theory new theory proposes firstly areas tension compression generated soft tissues surrounding unerupted teeth distribution bite forces jaws patterns tension compression proposed result patterns bone resorption deposition lift tooth theory based wolffs law long established idea bone changes shape accordance forces significantly recent finite element analysis study analysing distribution force jaw child observed overall compression soft tissues tension soft tissues unerupted bone resorbs compressed forms tension finite element analysis strongly supports new work required however confirm new theory experimentally although tooth eruption occurs different times different people general eruption timeline exists tooth buds baby teeth start develop around weeks pregnancy adult teeth buds start forming around months pregnancy entire tooth start form crown typically humans primary teeth permanent dentition goes three first known primary
