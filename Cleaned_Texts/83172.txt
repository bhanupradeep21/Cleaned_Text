st onge charles volant trip ambitious proposed travel miles north across labrador expedition never done began following ste marguerite river reached labrador plateau required trek across access moisie river eventually reached hamilton river finally ungava bay destination fort although trip without trials especially unsure correct direction destination success overall amassing specimens total specimens collected represented species birds species murie time canada provided skills needed lifetime working wildlife biology pristine relatively untouched conditions arctic due lack humans murie able establish holistic understanding humans impact environment would develop subsequent trips around north america following work canada murie accepted position working us biological survey alaska studying caribou alaska locate largest caribou populations intention crossbreeding reindeer murie also expected collect specimens various animals act fur warden enforcing laws protected animals illegal fur trade murie also encouraged ensure large caribou populations region one practice employed us biological survey time predator poisoning reduced predator populations order increase prey species however murie studied caribou populations opposed although murie first extremely vocal opposition began express remarked theory certain amount preying caribou wolves beneficial herd best animals survive vigor herd maintained mans killing work natural way best animals shot inferior animals left breed think good breeding important game animals domestic stock game however accustomed reverse process killing finest animals removing natural enemies tend keep unfit murie saw hunting humans counter trends produced nature counteracted darwin survival fittest believed true cause reduction elk populations wolves rather human economic drive murie believed caribou greatest menace wolf hunter mans economic development principally raising reindeer murie observed elk along wild species needed ample land survive thus ensure species survival murie argued preservation habitat necessary murie critical agency ways later life became outspoken views besides allowing murie formulate ideas towards conservation time alaska gave additional experience working field resulted recognition realm field time alaska murie hired national elk commission determine cause elk winterkill problem jackson hole wyoming chief field biologist murie concluded human development causing overcrowding elk winter murie one first discover elk historically resided mountains solely plains thus contributing although national elk refuge existed region consisting acres refuge unexpected consequences due supplemental feeding rougher browse elk developing bacterial lesions throat mouth called necrotic stomatitis calf squirreltail grass seeds found refuge contributed irritation lesions close proximity elk allowed bacteria spread observations murie determined protecting elk habitat initially would
