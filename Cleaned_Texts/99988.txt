phacolytic glaucoma pg form glaucoma caused due leaking mature immature cataract inflammatory glaucoma occurs phacolysis condition result leakage protein within lens capsule mature hyper mature cataract involves simple procedure cured referred cataract main symptoms glaucoma include pain eye redness loss sight reduce individuals independence turn reducing quality life individuals ability fulfill societal roles driving reading reduces visual clarity phacolysis tends frequently reported underdeveloped countries lack resources necessary treat condition variety characteristics indicate individual may phacolytic glaucoma within older people lens eye may appear yellow lose transparency becomes cloudy protein begins seep lens permanent damage lens may caused precipitate lens impairs vision another symptom includes fading visual clarity symptom makes eye create image commonly described appear though looking waterfall lens becomes completely opaque individual become blind even though photoreceptor cells completely functional common symptoms include major influencers illness include high exposure sun age rare condition individuals age cataracts left untreated develop mature state hyper mature state may progressively become leaky thereby excreting proteins cataracts caused breakdown proteins allows lens become cloudy gradually turn opaque causing decrease vision leakage proteins high molecular weight obstruction drainage mechanism eye caused variety procedures used physically diagnose phacolytic glaucoma variety types glaucoma may confused phacolysis acute angleclosure glaucoma aacg lensparticle glaucoma neovascular glaucoma phacomorphic glaucoma uveitic glaucoma cause confusion procedures need conducted revamp first type diagnostic procedure referred slit lamp examination phacolytic glaucoma allows specific identification microcystic corneal edema presence macrophages white material dotted patches within inside capsule lens intense flare iridescent hyperrefringent particles specific phacolytic time period symptoms affecting patient obtained experiencing symptoms period longer days may result issues glaucomatous disc damage poorer prognosis additionally previous cataract trauma surgery conducted must accounted accurate diagnosis current symptoms could caused previous ophthalmologic examination another procedure must conducted effectively diagnose phacolytic glaucoma test indicate high levels inflammation due high intraocular pressures within eyes additionally presence calcium oxalate cholesterol crystals degenerating cataract lens indication phacolytic glaucoma identified puncturing cataract specifically used differentiate uveitic glaucoma keratic precipitates present rather calcium phacolysis evident commonly within elderly people result cataracts developed time factors contribute development phacolysis seniors clearly indicated increase intraocular pressure usually occurs anterior flow faces obstruction anterior flow aqueous humor essentially eye requires photosynthetic pigment allows light become chemical energy within seniors pigment time splits oxygen thereby generate procedure involved curing phacolysis includes reduction intraocular pressure iop eye followed cataract extraction surgery medical management commonly used simply control inflammation temporarily reduction intraocular pressure conducted use combination topical systemic ioplowering agents cycloplegics aqueous suppressants hyperosmotic agents antiinflammatory topical steroids also may assist lowering intraocular pressure decreasing previous cataract surgery variety optometrical tests conducted comprehensively analyse individuals eyesight prior surgery refraction also conducted determine much nearsightedness farsightedness andor astigmatism individual may additional specific measurements eye necessary order determine curvature length cornea order choose effective iol need inserted cataract surgery become simple process modernday technology conducted local anaesthetic procedure average time period minutes aim cataract surgery replace lens within eye artificial lens clear vision removing residue could cloud vision cataract extraction surgery involves four major steps includes local anaesthetic clearing eye intraocular lens inserted finally contact lens protect eye dissolves releasing major advancements medical technology cuts manually made lens conduct cataract extraction surgery however improvements technology lasik procedure main procedure used conduct cataract surgeries procedure involves use femtosecond lasers allow precision cuts create corneal flap necessary clear cataract substituted use instead surgical tool generally handheld surgeon conduct incision manually corneal incision anterior capsulotomy lens cataract fragmentation steps alternative within process lasers strike titaniumlike target attached irrigationaspiration said utilisation laser enable better precision accuracy reproducibility corneal incision anterior capsulotomy lens cataract therefore ensuring reduction risks enabling refined visual development phacolysis extraction completing surgery utilisation laser cataract surgery allow precise incision resulting selfsealing process enabling reduction infection surgery therefore result advancements laser cataract surgery provided regarding removal lens surgeons able complete procedure efficient manner thereby ensure improvement outcomes individuals suffering additionally laser cataract procedures used cure phacolysis success rate proving procedures main issue technology process costs like surgical procedures degree risk within cataract removal procedures take place variety complications may occur including several medications need consumed order treat phacolytic glaucoma medicines induced ensure management glaucoma reduce medications consist aqueous suppressants antiinflammatory drugs hyperosmotic agents cycloplegics antiglaucoma medications medical therapy however temporary treatment cataract surgery take use eyepatch certain amount time well contact lens protect eye dissolves releasing antibiotics must incorporated rehabilitation process reduce risk infection eye allow effective healing process additionally patient must consistently visit specialist order ensure successful removal phacolytic glaucoma may need medical therapies treat arising issues eye medical therapy procedures phacolysis consist controlling intraocular pressure may include use topical steroids order decrease inflammation eye mydriatics order prevent formation found cases phacolytic glaucoma post surgery patients exposed many obstacles healing process therefore avoids need medication although mostly encouraged patients take antiglaucoma medication order deter possibility glaucoma inflammation implicating eye one medications include eye drops contain prostaglandin analogs prostaglandin analogs aim lower intraocular pressure thereby avoids inflammation ensure efficient healing process cataract removal carbonic anhydrase inhibitors cai form pills disables production sodium pump aqueous humor thereby decreases inflammation turn lower intraocular pressure major obstacle could affect healing process surgery necessary treat phacolytic glaucoma would infection eye ophthalmologists conducting surgery must aim reduce amount microbes present ocular surface avoid intracocular contamination procedure tasks conducted use intracameral topical intracameral antibiotics usually injections put eye ocular surface rid microbes topical antibiotics come form tablets consumed mouth treat bacterial infection use either left surgeon personal opinion possibility bacterial infection astigmatism involves deficiency optical capacity eye whereby angle light passing eye deviates becomes distorted visuals due light rays avoiding common focus astigmatisms result cornea forming shape curve comparison meridians therefore order reduce minor incisions must taken place cornea previously mentioned forming shape curve flatten turn little extent thereby allowing cornea rounder performing astigmatism order correct removal cataract requirement prescription glasses reading glasses post cataract extraction avoided ensures better vision patients astigmatism rates increase dramatically age group age group since astigmatism affects population people old likely suffer phacolytic glaucoma effective procedure take place cataract surgery used correct phacolytic glaucoma improve quality life sufferers youngest patient found diagnosed phacolytic glaucoma years thereby highlights significant prevalence senior patients moreover phacolytic glaucoma likely seen underdeveloped countries result lack access ophthalmologic care faced phacolytic glaucoma cases ameliorate cataract extracted thereby enhancing vision hand disease less prevalent developed countries australia united states due greater access health care earlier cataract
