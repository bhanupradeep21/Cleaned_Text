antigenic variation antigenic alteration refers mechanism infectious agent protozoan bacterium virus alters proteins carbohydrates surface thus avoids host immune response making one mechanisms antigenic escape related phase variation antigenic variation enables pathogen avoid immune response current host also allows reinfection previously infected hosts immunity reinfection based recognition antigens carried pathogen remembered acquired immune response pathogens dominant antigen altered pathogen evade hosts acquired immune system antigenic variation occur altering variety surface molecules including proteins carbohydrates antigenic variation result gene sitespecific dna recombination sequence result even clonal population pathogens expresses heterogeneous many proteins
