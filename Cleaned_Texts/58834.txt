within e coli factor divides tu ts components presence gtp tuts complex dissociated tu ts reassociate absence research team suggested tuts complex dissociated presence kaziro led research team examining role gtp translocation proteins presence elongation factor g efg gtp nacetyldiphenylalanyltrna shifts site complex ribosome p site researchers found guanylylmethylenediphosphonate nonhydrolyzable form gtp could used study reaction impact complex ii kaziro team found gtp helps facilitate binding efg complex ii translocation additionally proposed gtp hydrolysis involved removal efg translocation kaziro published extensive article outlining role guanosine triphosphate elongation polypeptide chains within kaziro first explains protein complexes involved synthesizing new proteins details process protein synthesis kaziro overviews prominent complementary factors involved protein elongation eftu efts many prokaryotic elongation factors kaziro explains gtp interacts prokaryotic elongation factors promotes conformational changes kaziro broadened research profile began genetic study granulocyte colonystimulating factor gcsf hormonelike glycoprotein assists
