coordinates noa eshkol abraham wachman created eshkolwachman movement notation ewmn recording movement original book presenting system published weidenfeld nicolson ewmn movement notation dance notation user therefore write form human animal movement without limiting oneself particular style classical ballet example gives notator freedom use system wherever movement occurs ewmn offers new original way thinking observing analyzing movement eshkol revolutionary thinker believed movement notation could open lot new doors fields movement involved using ewmn composed five dance suites publication performed without music performed without music audience dancers forced focus movement evoke emotions within set mood choreographed dance asked address viewpoint eshkol used example someone swell chest express strength instead action swelling chest causes feeling strength somewhat parallel jameslange theory emotion eshkol stated analyzing movement might begin understand one movement evokes certain emotion another movement produces entirely different feeling use movement notation also lead discovery new laws composition particular dance styles similar found music types art aesthetic rules implemented following basic concepts establish one general form stand conceptually bodies abstract body similar stick figure image proposed man without qualities limb reduced longitudinal axis imaginary straight line unchanging length limb ew considered part body lies two adjacent joints joint free extremity person walks legs move rest body ie torso arm head carried along movement legs ewmn labels phenomenon law light heavy limbs structure body dealt branching linkage base conceived heaviest segment body heavy limb moves carries adjacent lighter limbs passively along standing upright feet considered base body heaviest limb legs lighter base torso lighter legs etc ewmn written drawn movements written horizontally ruled notation page resembling spreadsheet represents body vertical lines divide page columns denoting units time symbols movements written order left right standard default distribution limb groups shown setup notation page ew flexible allows user divide body many parts necessary adequately define movement notated movements written ewmn set music however music required since ewmn focuses recording movement alone ewmn describes movement using geometrical model allows user observe notate movement objective way free verbal ambiguity emotional attachment notation utilizes spherical system coordinates similar latitude longitude globe since movement single axis constant length free move one fixed end enclosed sphere free end always describe curved path surface sphere every limb body regarded axis constructing sor one direction horizontal plane sphere selected starting position measurements direction labeled zero measuring intervals degrees eight positions obtained fig four vertical planes intersect horizontal circle perpendicular position limb defined identifying coordinates sor movements limbs also defined oriented measured relation sor document transitions static positions system takes consideration type movement amount movement spatial orientation sense clockwise anti clockwise movement three types movement defined rotatory movement limb rotates around axis without changing place space example
