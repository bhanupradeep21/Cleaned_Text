coolidge effect biological phenomenon seen animals whereby males exhibit renewed sexual interest whenever new female introduced even sex prior still available sexual lesser extent effect also seen among females regard coolidge effect attributed increase sexual responsiveness shortening sexual refractory evolutionary benefit phenomenon male fertilize multiple male may reinvigorated repeatedly successful insemination multiple type mating system referred polygyny one male multiple female mates female mates one coolidge effect demonstrated occur humans across cultures behavioral endocrinologist frank beach claims introduced term coolidge effect either attributed neologism old joke calvin coolidge president president mrs coolidge shown separately around experimental government farm mrs coolidge came chicken yard noticed rooster mating frequently asked attendant often happened told dozens times day mrs coolidge said tell president comes upon told president asked hen every time reply oh mr president different hen every time president tell mrs coolidge joke appears book aggression man animals roger n johnson p original experiments rats applied following protocol male rat placed enclosed large box four five female rats immediately began mate female rats repeatedly eventually became females continued nudging licking yet novel female introduced box became alert began mate new phenomenon limited common coolidge effect attributed increase dopamine levels subsequent effect upon animals limbic study conducted fiorino et al male rats used study role mesolimbic dopamine system sexual experiment microdialysis used monitor dopamine efflux nucleus accumbens three stages sexual behaviour included copulation sexual satiety reinitiation sexual behavioural testing coolidge effect consisted several phases including copulation female reintroduction female access female introduction novel female copulation novel phases dopamine metabolites results study found overall significant increase dopamine efflux response first female second copulation first female concentrations dopamine male rats showed significant increase however female presented significant increase dopamine novel female presented initially small increase levels dopamine however continued copulation novel female significant increase dopamine levels results concluded increase mesolimbic dopamine efflux associated appetitive consummatory stages sexual behaviour male data also suggest stimuli associated novel female may increase dopamine transmission rat sexually satiated hence role reinitiation sexual additional studies also provided evidence role nucleus accumbens sexual behaviour study conducted wood et al male rats divided three conditions presented cotton ball laden either saline control group estrous vaginal smear familiar female experimental group estrous vaginal smear novel female experimental experiment role nucleus accumbens characterized recording neuronal activity single cells area results study showed greater proportion neuronal activation initially presented novel estrus stimulus comparison familiar estrus subsequent presentations novel estrus stimulus show increase neuronal observed certain species males allocate sperm differently due coolidge allocation usually according level sperm competition female novelty female reproductive experiment performed external fertilizing fish called rhodeus amarus also known european bitterling used show sperm allocated differently novel partner around also happens malemale important know european bitterling mating system works females depositing eggs gill filaments freshwater mussels long ovipositor males proceed ejecting sperm gills mussel hosting means fertilization development offspring relies quality survival coolidge effect applied system experiment showed mussels site fertilization males prefer however takeaway experiment performed malemale competition rhodeus amarus dominant male allocate sperm novel mussel present subordinate male conserved sperm proper opportunity came better chance similar result found fowls gallus gallus male showed sperm allocation due coolidge experiment found male fowls reduce sperm investment particular females theyve encountered already increase sperm investment instantaneously encountered new wedell et al suggest theory male allocates sperm save sperm novel partners limits mate possibly investing little sperm partners return inseminate eggs therefore making reproduction less could even possibly force females seek copulation ensure successful types evidence sperm allocation would suggest coolidge effect determine much sperm invested females possible sperm allocated sperm evenly distributed multiple overall typically seen allocation changes due malemale competition whether novel partner encountered coolidge effect typically found animals however instances coolidge effect study decorated crickets gryllodes sigillatus showed even though females display coolidge effect males species preference novel females species control copulation test coolidge effect males two dead females one female already previously mated novel measure coolidge effect variables examined amount courtship preferred mate size spermatophore transferred size spermatophore measured weighing mass transferred outcome experiment showed difference latency remating males confined novel females paired previous also difference mass experiment would suggest coolidge effect applicable since males gryllodes sigillatus prefer novel research done spiders also supports possibility absence coolidge effect certain another study focused coolidge effect simultaneously hermaphroditic species confirmed validity coolidge effect freshwater snail lymnaea biomphalaria glabrata another simultaneous hermaphrodite freshwater snail exhibit sexspecific effects partner novelty thus either coolidge effect species difference degrees effect expressed respective though single reason males choose novel partner experiments show major determining factor detecting novel partner olfactory experiment using longevans rats showed odor played major role distinguishing difference novel partner familiar experiment carr et al paired male rat female rat allowed mate male rats tested preference use apparatus two cylinders attached home cage contained familiar female novel female caps end cylinders prevented access females hole allow odors pass males testing phase females removed caps removed allow male explore experiment found males preferred scent novel males access females demonstrate mating preferences odor preference believed reflect promiscuous behavior therefore important male mating earlier experiment also conducted carr et al found unlike male rats female rats preferred odor familiar partner rather odor novel another study also examined olfactory preference also part brain targeted olfactory study male hamsters given lesions either hippocampus perirhinalentorhinal cortex received sham treatment hamsters allowed mate female hamster became satiated subjects presented two anesthetized females one female previously copulated novel hamsters sham hippocampal lesions investigated anogenital region novel females significantly longer period comparison familiar males lesions perirhinalentorhinal cortex show preference either familiar novel female spent similar amount time investigating anogenital region results study revealed perirhinalentorhinal cortex region brain golden hamsters crucial recognition familiar conspecifics certain social conclusion experiment also consistent rats monkeys since damage region brain impaired standard recognition memory would suggest hippocampal region brain crucial social behavior memory rather perirhinalentorhinal effect olfaction also observed invertebrates study conducted tan colleagues role olfaction species recognition examined using flies drosophila melanogaster processed mutated orco gene codes coreceptor important result type mutation renders flies unable discriminate phenotypically familiar ie family andor environment phenotypically novel ie unrelated different environment presented phenotypically familiar phenotypically novel female mutant flies show preference towards either female wildtype flies ie flies without mutated orco gene results experiment suggest orco gene important discriminating mates suggests important role olfactory cues phenotypic coolidge effect states although males typically prefer novel mates every time opportunity present physical limit sex experiment performed rats showed left reproduce sexual satiety motor ejaculatory behavior intromission dislodging seminal plugs possible multiple mates little sperm would produced experiment also concluded males reached satiety nonsatiety males similar amounts intromissions time spent dislodging seminal another study performed rats showed results found data concluded reaching optimal chances impregnating mates happened resting experiments would suggest one major limitations coolidge effect physical boundaries gamete coolidge effect usually demonstrated males displaying renewed excitement novel body research phenomenon continues explore potentiality effect females specifically research examining female rats lent support wherein female rats showed higher incentive motivation unknown males ones copulated study conducted researchers conducted experiment test coolidge effect could observed female experiment assigned female rats one two conditions paced nonpaced paced condition females able control timing copulation nonpaced condition males regulated timing females paced condition placed arena divided two compartments contained holes female could pass female placed one side divided arena male placed opposite side allowed female enter exit males side depending circumstances therefore regulating timing nonpaced condition female male rats placed undivided arena allowed conditions females exposed constant familiar male followed novel results found females showed significant increase proceptive behaviours novel mate present female could regulate repeated mating male also resulted decrease proceptivity thought suggest sexual results suggest coolidge effect may also present female lester gorzalka developed model determine whether coolidge effect also occurs experiment used hamsters instead rats concluded occur lesser degree females evolutionary advantage mating multiple partners less possible presence coolidge effect females could serve optimize females reproductive success prevent mating sterile male mating multiple males may reduce probability females gametes successfully httpsenwikipediaorgwikicoolidgeeffect
