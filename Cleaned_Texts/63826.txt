solar urticaria su rare condition exposure ultraviolet uv radiation sometimes even visible light induces case urticaria hives appear covered uncovered areas classified type physical classification disease types somewhat controversial one classification system distinguished various types su based wavelength radiation causes breakout another classification system based type allergen initiates agent human body responsible reaction radiation known photoallergen yet disease difficult diagnose properly similar dermatological disorders polymorphic light eruption helpful test diagnostic phototest specialized test confirms presence abnormal sunburn reaction recognized treatment disease commonly involves administration antihistamines desensitization treatments extreme cases use immunosuppressive drugs even plasmapheresis may initial discovery disease credited p merklen name suggestion solar urticaria given william waddell duke however research contributed study uncommon disease one hundred cases reported past generally areas affected exposed skin usually protected clothing however also occur areas covered areas constantly subjected suns rays may slightly affected people extreme cases also reactions artificial light sources emit uv wavelength parts body thinly covered also potentially subjected outbreak life su difficult patients subject constant itching pain within minutes initial exposure uv radiation rash appear urticarial reaction begins form pruritus later progressing erythema edema exposed areas skin vast areas body affected loss fluid skin could lead lightheadedness headache nausea extremely rarely patients reported experience increase heart rate cause stroke heart attack due body cavity swelling rare side effects bronchospasm glucose instability issues also large area body suddenly exposed person may subject anaphylactic reaction free exposure rash usually fade away within several hours rare extreme cases take day two normalize depending severity solar urticaria immunoglobulin emediated hypersensitivity introduced primary secondary factors induced exogenous primary su believed type hypersensitivity mild severe reaction antigen including anaphylaxis antigen substance provoking immune response induced uv visible secondary su occur person comes contact chemicals tar pitch dyes people use drugs benoxaprofen patients erythropoietic protoporphyria may also contract secondary items cause photosensitivity exogenous photosensitizers outside body cause greater sensitivity also unorthodox unusual causes solar urticaria susceptible visible light white tshirts may increase chances experiencing outbreak one case doctors found white tshirt absorbed uva radiation sun transformed visible light caused another patient treated antibiotic tetracycline separate dermatological disorder broke hives exposed sun first case implicate tetracycline solar urticaria inducing yet known specific agent body brings allergic reaction radiation patients su injected irradiated autologous serum many developed urticaria within area injection people su injected demonstrate similar symptoms indicates reaction characteristic patients solar urticaria possible photoallergen located binding sites ige found surface mast photoallergen believed begin configuration absorption radiation chromophore molecule radiation transformed resulting formation new solar urticaria difficult diagnose presence confirmed process several forms tests including photopatch tests phototests photoprovocation tests laboratory tests necessary determine exact condition patient photopatch tests patch tests conducted believed patient experiencing certain symptoms due allergy occur contact sunlight procedure patient given low dosage uva radiation another test known phototest useful identifying solar urticaria test one centimeter segments skin subject varying amounts uva uvb radiation order determine specific dosage certain form

classified based wavelength radiative energy causes allergic reaction known harbers classification six types identified type solar urticaria caused uvb ultraviolet b radiation wavelengths ranging nm type ii induced uva ultraviolet radiation wavelengths range nm wavelength range type iii iv spans nm type v caused uvb radiation visible light nm type vi known occur another classification distinguishes two types first hypersensitivity caused reaction photoallergens located people su second caused photoallergens found people su people without subgroup solar urticaria fixed solar urticaria also identified rare less intense form disease wheals swollen areas skin affect certain fixed areas body fixed solar urticaria induced broad spectrum radiative energy wavelengths ranging polymorphous light eruption pmle easiest disease mistake solar urticaria locations lesions similar v neck arms however patients su likely develop lesions face also reaction pmle take greater amount time appear solar urticaria lupus erythematosus mistaken su however lesions lupus erythematosus take longer amount time go away furthermore tested two diseases patients su reaction immediately patients lupus erythematosus delayed reaction patients experienced solar urticarial symptoms young age could mistakenly thought erythropoietic protoporphyria however main symptom disease pain patients found abnormal levels protoporphyrin blood levels normal su patients finally cholinergic urticaria urticaria induced heat occasionally appear solar urticaria heat sun cause person disease histamines proteins associated many allergic reactions uv radiation light comes contact person solar urticaria histamine released mast cells occurs permeability vessels near area histamine release increased allows blood fluid enter vessels cause inflammation antihistamines suppress activity diphenhydramine firstgeneration receptor antagonist medicine combats receptor associated many allergic found potent antihistamine particular disease patients prescribed milligrams four times per day able sustain normal exposure sun without developing reaction patients less potent forms solar urticaria fixed solar urticaria treated medication fexofenadine may also used prophylactically prevent form treatment meant reduce intensity altogether eliminate allergic reactions people gradually increasing exposure form radiation brings reaction case solar urticaria phototherapy photochemotherapy two major desensitization phototherapy used prevention exposure certain form light uv radiation enables patient build tolerance outbreaks reduced type treatment generally conducted however benefits therapy last two three photochemotherapy puva considered superior phototherapy produces longerlasting tolerance radiation initiates outbreak treatment first begins main goal build patients tolerance uva radiation enough outdoors without episode solar urticaria therefore treatments regulated three per week constantly increasing exposure uva radiation patient reached adequate level desensitization treatments reduced twice per patients researchers successfully treated solar urticaria omalizumab trade name xolair commonly used treat idiopathic urticaria omalizumab recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody ige acts binding free ige site ige would bind highaffinity receptor fcÎµri mast cells thereby reducing free ige doctors sometimes prescribe immunosuppressive drugs prednisolone ciclosporin patient intense form solar urticaria however side effects medicines severe reserved extreme extreme cases plasmapheresis considered technique used remove blood plasma fluid red blood cells return cells body removes circulating factor blood may involved causing urticaria still tested always treatment success patients photosensitivity decreased degree undergo puva result relief urticarial outbreaks extended period time major setback treatment side effects severe may include anaphylactoid united states patients photosensitive disorders reported diagnosed solar urticaria internationally number slightly larger solar urticaria may occur races studies monitoring african americans caucasians
