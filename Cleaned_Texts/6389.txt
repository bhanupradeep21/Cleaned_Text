haldane effect property hemoglobin first described john scott haldane within oxygenation blood lungs displaces carbon dioxide hemoglobin increasing removal carbon dioxide consequently oxygenated blood reduced affinity carbon dioxide thus haldane effect describes ability hemoglobin carry increased amounts carbon dioxide deoxygenated state opposed oxygenated state vice versa true high concentration facilitates dissociation oxyhemoglobin though result two distinct processes bohr effect margariagreen effect distinguished haldane effect carbon dioxide travels blood three different ways one ways binding amino groups creating carbamino compounds amino groups available binding nterminals sidechains arginine lysine residues hemoglobin carbon dioxide binds residues carbaminohemoglobin amount carbaminohemoglobin formed inversely proportional amount oxygen attached hemoglobin thus lower oxygen saturation carbaminohemoglobin formed dynamics explain relative difference hemoglobins affinity carbon dioxide depending oxygen levels known haldane histidine residues hemoglobin accept protons act buffers deoxygenated hemoglobin better proton acceptor oxygenated red blood cells enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyzes conversion dissolved carbon dioxide carbonic acid rapidly dissociates bicarbonate free proton le chateliers principle anything stabilizes proton produced cause reaction shift right thus enhanced affinity deoxyhemoglobin protons enhances synthesis bicarbonate accordingly increases capacity deoxygenated blood carbon dioxide majority carbon dioxide blood form bicarbonate small amount actually dissolved carbon dioxide remaining amount carbon dioxide bound hemoglobin addition enhancing removal carbon dioxide oxygenconsuming tissues haldane effect promotes dissociation carbon dioxide hemoglobin presence oxygen oxygenrich capillaries lung property causes displacement carbon dioxide plasma lowoxygen blood enters alveolus vital alveolar gas exchange general equation haldane effect however equation confusing reflects primarily bohr effect significance equation lies realizing oxygenation hb promotes dissociation h hb shifts bicarbonate buffer equilibrium towards formation therefore released patients lung disease lungs may able increase alveolar ventilation face increased amounts dissolved partially explains observation patients emphysema might increase partial pressure arterial dissolved carbon dioxide following administration supplemental oxygen even content stays httpsenwikipediaorgwikihaldaneeffect
