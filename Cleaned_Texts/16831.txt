genotype organism complete set genetic genotype also used refer alleles variants individual carries particular gene genetic number alleles individual specific gene depends number copies chromosome found species also referred ploidy diploid species like humans two full sets chromosomes present meaning individual two alleles given gene alleles genotype referred homozygous alleles different genotype referred heterozygous genotype contributes phenotype observable traits characteristics individual degree genotype affects phenotype depends trait example petal color pea plant exclusively determined genotype petals purple white depending alleles present pea however traits partially influenced genotype traits often called complex traits influenced additional factors environmental epigenetic factors individuals genotype look act way appearance behavior modified environmental growing conditions likewise organisms look alike necessarily genotype term genotype coined danish botanist wilhelm johannsen given gene usually cause observable change organism known phenotype terms genotype phenotype distinct least two reasons simple example illustrate genotype distinct phenotype flower colour pea plants see gregor mendel three available genotypes pp homozygous dominant pp heterozygous pp homozygous recessive three different genotypes first two phenotype purple distinct third white technical example illustrate genotype singlenucleotide polymorphism snp snp occurs corresponding sequences dna different individuals differ one dna base example sequence aagccta changes contains two alleles c snps typically three genotypes denoted generically aa aa aa example three genotypes would cc ct tt types genetic marker microsatellites two alleles thus many different genotypes penetrance proportion individuals showing specified genotype phenotype given set environmental traits determined exclusively genotype typically inherited mendelian pattern laws inheritance described extensively gregor mendel performed experiments pea plants determine traits passed generation studied phenotypes easily observed plant height petal color seed able observe crossed two truebreeding plants distinct phenotypes offspring would phenotype example crossed tall plant short plant resulting plants would tall however selffertilized plants resulted second generation would short concluded traits dominant tall height others recessive like short height though mendel aware time phenotype studied controlled single gene two alleles case plant height one allele caused plants tall caused plants short tall allele present plant would tall even plant heterozygous order plant short homozygous recessive one way illustrated using punnett square punnett square genotypes parents placed outside uppercase letter typically used represent dominant allele lowercase letter used represent recessive allele possible genotypes offspring determined combining parent example right parents heterozygous genotype bb offspring inherit dominant allele parent making homozygous genotype bb offspring inherit dominant allele one parent recessive allele parent making heterozygous genotype bb finally offspring could inherit recessive allele parent making homozygous genotype bb plants bb bb genotypes look since b allele dominant plant bb genotype recessive trait inheritance patterns also applied hereditary diseases conditions humans conditions inherited autosomal dominant pattern meaning individuals condition typically affected parent well classic pedigree autosomal dominant condition shows affected individuals every conditions inherited autosomal recessive pattern affected individuals typically affected parent since parent must copy recessive allele order affected offspring parents referred carriers autosomal conditions sex offspring play role risk affected sexlinked conditions sex offspring affects chances condition humans females inherit two x chromosomes one parent males inherit x chromosome mother chromosome father xlinked dominant conditions distinguished autosomal dominant conditions pedigrees lack transmission fathers sons since affected fathers pass x chromosome xlinked recessive conditions males typically affected commonly hemizygous one x chromosome females presence second x chromosome prevent condition appearing females therefore carriers condition pass trait mendelian patterns inheritance complicated additional factors diseases show incomplete penetrance meaning individuals diseasecausing allele develop signs symptoms penetrance also agedependent meaning signs symptoms disease visible later life example huntington disease autosomal dominant condition individuals affected genotype develop symptoms age another factor complicate mendelian inheritance patterns variable expressivity individuals genotype show different signs symptoms example individuals polydactyly variable number extra many traits inherited mendelian fashion complex patterns inheritance traits neither allele completely dominant heterozygotes often appearance somewhere example cross truebreeding red white mirabilis jalapa results pink codominance refers traits alleles expressed offspring approximately equal classic example abo blood group system humans b alleles expressed present individuals ab genotype b proteins expressed red blood epistasis phenotype one gene affected one often sort masking effect one gene example gene codes hair color dominant allele codes brown hair recessive allele codes blonde hair separate b gene controls hair growth recessive b allele causes baldness individual bb bb genotype produce hair hair color phenotype observed individual bb genotype person bald masks gene entirely polygenic trait one whose phenotype dependent additive effects multiple genes contributions genes typically small add final phenotype large amount variation well studied example number sensory bristles types additive effects also explanation amount variation human eye color genotyping refers method used determine individuals genotype variety techniques used assess genotype genotyping method typically depends information sought many techniques initially require amplification dna sample commonly done using pcr techniques designed investigate specific snps alleles particular gene set genes whether individual carrier particular condition done via variety techniques including allele specific oligonucleotide aso probes dna tools multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification also used look duplications deletions genes gene techniques meant assess large number snps across genome snp type technology commonly used genomewide association studies largescale techniques assess entire genome also available includes karyotyping determine number chromosomes individual chromosomal microarrays assess large duplications deletions detailed information determined using exome sequencing provides specific sequence dna coding region genome whole genome sequencing sequences entire genome including noncoding linear models genotypes encoded different manners let us consider biallelic locus two possible alleles encoded
