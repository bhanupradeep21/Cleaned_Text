glaucoma group eye diseases lead damage optic nerve transmits visual information eye brain glaucoma may cause vision loss left untreated called silent thief sight loss vision usually occurs slowly long period major risk factor glaucoma increased pressure within eye known intraocular pressure associated old age family history glaucoma certain medical conditions word glaucoma comes ancient greek word γλαυκóς glaukós meaning gleaming bluegreen gray different types glaucoma common called openangle glaucoma closedangle inside eye liquid called aqueous humor helps maintain shape provides nutrients aqueous humor normally drains trabecular meshwork openangle glaucoma draining impeded causing liquid accumulate pressure inside eye increase elevated pressure damage optic nerve closedangle glaucoma drainage eye becomes suddenly blocked leading rapid increase intraocular pressure may lead intense eye pain blurred vision nausea closedangle glaucoma emergency requiring immediate treated
