automated pain recognition apr method objectively measuring pain time represents interdisciplinary research area comprises elements medicine psychology psychobiology computer science focus computeraided objective recognition pain implemented basis machine automated pain recognition allows valid reliable detection monitoring pain people unable communicate verbally underlying machine learning processes trained validated advance means unimodal multimodal body signals signals used detect pain may include facial expressions gestures may also psychophysiological paralinguistic nature date focus identifying pain intensity visionary efforts also made recognize quality site temporal course paincitation needed however clinical implementation approach controversial topic field pain research critics automated pain recognition argue pain diagnosis performed subjectively humans pain diagnosis conditions verbal reporting restricted verbally andor cognitively impaired people patients sedated mechanically ventilated based behavioral observations trained however known observation procedures eg zurich observation pain zopa pain assessment advanced dementia scale painad require great deal specialist expertise procedures made difficult perception interpretationrelated misjudgments part observer regard differences design methodology evaluation sample conceptualization phenomenon pain difficult compare quality criteria various tools even trained personnel could theoretically record pain intensity several times day using observation instruments would possible measure every minute second respect goal automated pain recognition use valid robust pain response patterns recorded multimodally temporally dynamic highresolution automated pain intensity recognition systemcitation needed automated pain recognition painrelevant parameters usually recorded using noninvasive sensor technology captures data physical responses person pain achieved camera technology captures facial expressions gestures posture audio sensors record paralinguistic features psychophysiological information muscle tone heart rate collected via biopotential sensors pain recognition requires extraction meaningful characteristics patterns data collected achieved using machine learning techniques able provide assessment pain training learning eg pain mild pain severe paincitation needed although phenomenon pain comprises different components sensory discriminative affective emotional cognitive vegetative automated pain recognition currently relies measurable parameters pain responses divided roughly two main categories physiological responses behavioral responses humans pain almost always initiates autonomic nervous processes reflected measurably various physiological measurements include electrodermal activity eda also skin conductance electromyography emg electrocardiogram ecg blood volume pulse bvp electroencephalogram eeg respiration body regulatory mechanisms sympathetic parasympathetic systems physiological signals mainly recorded using special noninvasive surface electrodes eda emg ecg eeg blood volume pulse sensor bvp respiratory belt respiration thermal sensor body temperature endocrinological immunological parameters also recorded requires measures somewhat invasive eg blood samplingcitation needed behavioral responses pain fulfil two functions protection body eg protective reflexes external communication pain eg cry help responses particularly evident facial expressions gestures paralinguistic features behavioral signals captured comprise facial expression patterns expressive behavior measured aid video signals facial expression recognition based everyday clinical observation pain often manifests patients facial expressions necessarily always case since facial expressions inhibited selfcontrol despite possibility facial expressions may influenced consciously facial expression behavior represents essential source information pain diagnosis thus also source information automatic pain recognition one advantage videobased facial expression recognition contactfree measurement face provided captured video possible every position eg lying face may limited bandages covering face facial expression analysis relies rapid spontaneous temporary changes neuromuscular activity lead visually detectable changes facecitation needed gestures also captured predominantly using noncontact camera technology motor pain responses vary strongly dependent type cause pain range abrupt protective reflexes eg spontaneous retraction extremities doubling agitation pathological restlessness avoidance behavior hesitant cautious movements among things pain leads nonverbal linguistic behavior manifests sounds sighing gasping moaning whining etc paralinguistic features usually recorded using highly sensitive microphones recording preprocessing eg filtering extraction relevant features optional information fusion performed process modalities different signal sources merged generate new precise knowledgecitation needed pain classified using machine learning processes method chosen significant influence recognition rate depends greatly quality granularity underlying data similar field affective following classifiers currently used support vector machine svm goal svm find clearly defined optimal hyperplane greatest minimal distance two classes separated hyperplane acts decision function classifying unknown pattern random forest rf rf based composition random uncorrelated decision trees

commonly classifies k neighbors closest neighbors determined using selected similarity measure eg euclidean distance jaccard coefficient etc artificial neural networks anns anns inspired biological neural networks model organizational principles processes simplified manner class patterns learned adjusting weights individual neuronal connections order classify pain valid manner necessary create representative reliable valid pain databases available machine learner training ideal database would sufficiently large would consist natural experimental highquality pain responses however natural
