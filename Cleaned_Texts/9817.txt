fecundity selection also known fertility selection fitness advantage resulting selection traits increases number offspring ie charles darwin formulated theory fecundity selection explain widespread evolution femalebiased sexual size dimorphism ssd females larger along theories natural selection sexual selection fecundity selection fundamental component modern theory darwinian selection fecundity selection large female size relates ability accommodate offspring higher capacity energy storage invested reproduction darwins theory fecundity selection predicts although sexual selection fecundity selection distinct still may difficult interpret whether sexual dimorphism nature due fecundity selection sexual examples fecundity selection nature include selfincompatibility flowering plants pollen

differential food availability management across latitudes play role offspring parental lack also highlighted opportunities parents collect food due increase daylength towards poles advantage means moderately higher altitudes provide successful conditions produce offspring however extreme daylengths ie poles may work parental survival repetitive food searching would exhaust parent together moreaulack rule hypothesizes fecundity increases increasing evidence supporting doubting claim led consolidation predictions may better explain moreaulacks rule ashmole suggested bird fecundity depends seasonality food differences availability seasons greater towards higher latitudes birds predicted experience low survival winter due limited resources decline population may advantageous

seasons result populations chances multiple reproductive intense fecundity selection depends length breeding season lbs factors may delay lbs start breeding season snow cover delayed food growth turn minimizes chance populations reproduce long breeding seasons towards tropics favor smaller clutches since females able balance energy reserved reproduction risk fecundity selection acts favoring early reproduction higher clutch size species reproduce frequently opposite trend seen populations reproduce less frequently delayed reproduction favored total fecundity per year depends length breeding season lbs also determines number breeding episodes addition total fecundity also depends nest predation describes differential survival variety food limited breeding season long nest predation intense selection tends favor bethedging strategy risk predation spread many smaller clutches means success number offspring depends whether large size strategy suggests fewer larger clutches higher
