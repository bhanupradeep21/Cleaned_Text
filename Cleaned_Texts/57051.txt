dental extraction also referred tooth extraction exodontia exodontics informally tooth pulling removal teeth dental alveolus socket alveolar bone extractions performed wide variety reasons commonly remove teeth become unrestorable tooth decay periodontal disease dental trauma especially associated toothache sometimes impacted wisdom teeth wisdom teeth stuck unable grow normally mouth cause recurrent infections gum pericoronitis may removed conservative treatments failed cleaning antibiotics operculectomy orthodontics teeth crowded healthy teeth may extracted often bicuspids create space rest teeth straightened extractions could categorized nonsurgical simple surgical depending type tooth removed factors comprehensive history taking performed find pain history tooth patients medical history history previous difficult tooth assessed clinically ie checked visually preextraction radiographs always necessary often taken confirm diagnosis hence appropriate treatment radiographs also help visualising shape size roots beneficial planning information aid dentist foreseeing difficulties hence preparing order obtain permission patient extraction tooth dentist explain treatment options available involved dental extraction procedure potential risks procedure benefits process gaining consent documented clinical extracting tooth dentist would deliver local anaesthetic ensure tooth surrounding tissues numb start several techniques achieve numbness tooth including two commonly used local anaesthetics uk lidocaine prior injection topical anaesthetic gel cream lidocaine benzocaine applied gum numb site injection millimetres reduce discomfort felt injection thus help reduce patient extraction multiple instruments used aid ease removal tooth whilst trying minimally traumatise tissues allow quicker healing extraction forceps commonly used remove teeth different shaped forceps available depending type tooth requiring removal side mouth left right upper lower tooth beaks forceps must grip onto root tooth securely pressure applied along long axis tooth towards different movements forceps employed remove teeth generally keeping downwards pressure attempts move tooth towards cheek side buccal opposite direction palatal lingual made loosen tooth single conicalrooted teeth incisors rotatory movements also figure eight movement used extract lower instruments used

periodontal biting piece sterile gauze socket provide firm pressure wound normally sufficient stop bleeding promote blood clot formation base moreover patient must inhibited eating drinking hot food

haemostasis include medicaldental orthodontic aesthetics extractions often categorized simple surgical simple extractions performed teeth visible mouth usually patient local anaesthetic require use instruments elevate andor grasp visible portion tooth typically tooth lifted using elevator using dental forceps specific tooth movements performed eg rocking tooth back forth expanding tooth socket periodontal ligament broken supporting alveolar bone adequately widened tooth removed typically teeth removed forceps slow steady pressure applied controlled force surgical extractions involve removal teeth easily accessed removed via simple extraction example broken gum erupted fully impacted wisdom surgical extractions almost always require incision surgical extraction dentist may elevate soft tissues covering tooth bone may also remove overlying andor surrounding jaw bone drill less commonly instrument called osteotome frequently tooth may split multiple pieces facilitate removal common risks extraction include pain swelling bleeding bruising infection trismus able open wide normal dry socket additional risks associated surgical extraction wisdom teeth particular permanent temporary damage inferior alveolar nerve lingual nerve causing permanent temporary numbness tingling altered sensation lip chin anticoagulants drugs interfere clotting cascade antiplatelets drugs interfere platelet aggregation drugs prescribed certain medical conditionssituations reduce risk thromboembolic event comes increased risk bleeding historically anticoagulant warfarin belonging group drugs called coumarins antiplatelets aspirin clopidogrel prescribed commonly circumstances however whilst drugs still used newer antiplatelet eg ticagrelor anticoagulant eg rivaroxaban apixaban dabigatran drugs used commonly considering dental treatment including dental extractions different guidanceprecautions need followed depending drug prescribed individual patient circumstances scottish dental clinical effectiveness programme sdcep provides excellent guidance individual patient circumstances evaluated prior use antibiotics reduce risks certain postextraction complications evidence use antibiotics andor impacted wisdom tooth extraction reduces risk infections lowers incidence dry socket one third every people treated antibiotic following impacted wisdom tooth removal one infection use antibiotics seem direct effect manifestation fever swelling trismus seven days postextraction cochrane review randomized control doubleblinded experiments reviewed considering biased risk associated studies concluded moderate overall evidence supporting routine use antibiotics practice order reduce risk infection following third molar extraction still reasonable concerns remaining regarding possible adverse effects indiscriminate antibiotic use patients also concerns development antibiotic resistance advises use prophylactic antibiotics inferior alveolar nerve ian branch trigeminal nerve cranial nerve v nerve runs mandible lower jaw supplies sensation lower teeth lip chin lower teeth particular lower wisdom teeth therefore close proximity nerve damage inferior alveolar nerve risk lower wisdom tooth removal surgical procedures means risk temporary permanent numbness altered sensation lip chin side surgery taking place therefore order assess risk inform patient position inferior alveolar nerve relation lower wisdom tooth needs assessed radiographically prior proximity root canal assessed radiographically several factors indicate high risk nerve lingual nerve also damaged temporary permanent surgical procedures mandible particular lower wisdom tooth removal would present temporary permanent numbnessaltered sensationaltered taste side tongue side corresponding side immediately following removal tooth bleeding oozing commonly occurs pressure applied patient biting gauze swab thrombus blood clot forms socket hemostatic response common hemostatic measures include local pressure application gauze use oxidized cellulose gelfoam fibrin sealant dental practitioners usually absorbent gauze hemostatic packing material oxidized cellulose collagen sponge suture kit sometimes minutes continuous pressure required fully arrest bleeding talking moves mandible hence removes pressure applied socket instead keeping constant pressure common reason bleeding might stop likened someone bleeding wound arm instructed apply pressure instead holds wound intermittently every moments coagulopathies clotting disorders eg hemophilia sometimes discovered first time person surgical procedure life rare sometimes blood clot dislodged triggering bleeding formation new blood clot leading dry socket see complications oral surgeons routinely scrape walls socket encourage bleeding belief reduce chance dry socket evidence practice workscitation needed serious post extraction healing complication slow halted healing caused adverse effects

biting onto piece damp gauze least minutes whilst sitting upright important gauze damp soaking avoid disrupting clot formation consequently inducing rebound bleed socket continues bleed recommended repeat process fresh piece damp gauze minutes attempts fail stem bleed advised seek professional advice various factors contribute postextraction local factors systemic factors primary prolonged
