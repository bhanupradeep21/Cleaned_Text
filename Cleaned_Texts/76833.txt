embryo transfer refers step process assisted reproduction embryos placed uterus female intent establish pregnancy technique often used connection vitro fertilization ivf may used humans animals situations goals may vary embryo transfer done day two day three later blastocyst stage first performed factors affect success embryo transfer include endometrial receptivity embryo quality embryo transfer technique embryos either fresh fertilized egg cells menstrual cycle frozen generated preceding cycle undergone embryo cryopreservation thawed prior transfer termed frozen embryo transfer fet outcome using cryopreserved embryos uniformly positive increase birth defects development also fresh versus frozen eggs used intracytoplasmic sperm injection fact pregnancy rates increased following fet perinatal outcomes less affected compared embryo transfer cycle ovarian hyperstimulation endometrium believed optimally prepared implantation following ovarian hyperstimulation therefore frozen embryo transfer avails separate cycle focus optimizing chances successful children born vitrified blastocysts significantly higher birthweight born nonfrozen transferring frozenthawed oocyte chance
