topographical disorientation inability orient oneself ones surroundings sometimes result focal brain disability may result inability make use selective spatial information eg environmental landmarks orient means specific cognitive strategies ability form mental representation environment also known cognitive map may part syndrome known visuospatial dysgnosia topographical disorientation inability find ones way environment due cognitive topographical disorientation studied decades using case studies patients selectively lost ability find way within largescale locomotor environments several dozen case reports topographical disorientation presented last century studying people aid understanding complex multicomponent behavior navigation topographical disorientation may lifelong deficit may result stroke occur part progressive illness frequently comorbid disorder hemispatial neglect achromatopsia prosopagnosia alzheimers diseasecitation needed developmental topographical disorientation dtd refers inability orient childhood despite absence apparent brain damage neurological condition general cognitive defects individuals affected dtd unable generate mental representation environment ie cognitive map therefore unable make use orienting process usually people go orienting confused healthy individuals poor sense direction individuals affected dtd get lost familiar surroundings house neighborhood sample dtd study italians aged years exclude people cognitive decline prevalent males females although general males use complex navigational strategies sense direction closely related gender navigational strategies adopted town egocentric disorientation marked inability represent location objects respect self usually due lesions posterior parietal lobe patients experience difficulty recognizing naming people objects unable accurately reach visual objects unable state relationship objects oneself left right nearer case study presented stark colleagues patient named gw described inability accurately reach visual targets despite normal vision difficulty recognizing naming objects presented unable point locations targets defined visual proprioceptive audio input loss egocentric spatial representation system left unable position space indicative disability often turned wrong direction greeted someone heading disorientation marked inability represent direction orientation respect external environment usually due lesions posterior cingulate patients show signs visuospatial agnosia patients able determine location using landmarks unable determine direction proceed landmarks order reach destination also impaired map drawing tasks unable describe routes familiar takahashi colleagues presented three cases focal brain damage right retrosplenial region cerebral hemorrhage caused loss sense direction three patients showed normal visual perception able identify familiar buildings landscapes able determine remember locations objects could seen standing unable recall direction selective familiar landmarks symptoms topographical disorientation disappeared three patients two anterograde disorientation marked inability orient new environments usually due lesions parahippocampus patients able navigate draw maps environments learned least months teng colleagues tested profoundly amnesic patient complete bilateral damage hippocampus extensive damage adjacent structures medial temporal lobe patient able recall spatial layout hometown moved away years ago became amnesic patient knowledge current neighborhood moved injury finding indicates medial temporal lobe needed retrieval spatial maps learned prior injury hippocampus surrounding structures essential formation longterm declarative memories including spatial landmark agnosia also known topographical agnosia topographagnosia marked inability recognize salient environmental stimuli landmarks usually due lesions lingual gyrus patients able draw detailed maps visualize places familiar illness distinguish classes buildings house skyscraper unable identify specific buildings house famous landmarks patients navigate using strictly spatial information specific details landmarks house number door c pallis described patient ah presented color face landmark agnosia result cerebral topographical disorientation usually diagnosed use comprehensive battery neuropsychological tests combined variety orientation tasks performed participants virtual real surroundings performance certain tests identify underlying neurological disorders verify disorientation selective impairment brain imaging used determine regions brain damage navigational skills assessed tests pertaining memory visualperceptual abilities object recognition mental rotation imagery abilities spatial abilities direct testing navigation involves asking patient describe route read map draw map follow route point treatment topographical disorientation achieved case case basis prognosis largely dependent organic cause neuropsychological assessment followed assessment unaffected cognitive abilities employed therapy treatment recovering navigational skills requires strengthening unaffected navigational strategies bypass defective onescitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikitopographicaldisorientation
