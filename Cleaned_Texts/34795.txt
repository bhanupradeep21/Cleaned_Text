competition interaction organisms species require resource limited supply food water competition lowers fitness organisms involved since presence one organisms always reduces amount resource available study community ecology competition within members species important biological interaction competition one many interacting biotic abiotic factors affect community structure species diversity population dynamics shifts population three major mechanisms competition interference exploitation apparent competition order direct least direct interference exploitation competition classed real forms competition apparent competition organisms share resource instead share competition among members species known intraspecific competition competition individuals different species known interspecific competition according competitive exclusion principle species less suited compete resources must either adapt die although competitive exclusion rarely found natural according evolutionary theory competition within species resources important natural selection recently however researchers suggested evolutionary biodiversity vertebrates driven competition organisms animals adapting colonize empty livable space termed room roam interference competition also called contest competition organisms interact directly fighting scarce resources example large aphids defend feeding sites cottonwood leaves ejecting smaller aphids better sites malemale competition red deer rut example interference competition occurs within species interference competition occurs directly individuals via aggression individuals interfere foraging survival reproduction others directly preventing physical establishment portion habitat example seen ant novomessor cockerelli red harvester ants former interferes ability latter forage plugging entrances colonies small male bowerbirds create elaborate structures called bowers attract potential mates may reduce fitness neighbors directly stealing decorations animals interference competition strategy mainly adopted larger stronger organisms within habitat populations high interference competition adultdriven generation first growth juveniles stunted larger adult competitors however juveniles reach adulthood experience secondary growth plants hand primarily engage interference competition neighbors allelopathy production interference competition seen strategy clear cost injury death benefit obtaining resources would gone order cope strong interference competition organisms often either engage exploitation competition example depending season larger ungulate red deer males competitively dominant due interference competition however fawns dealt temporal resource partitioning foraging food adult males exploitation competition scramble competition occurs indirectly organisms use common limiting resource shared food item instead fighting exhibiting aggressive behavior order win resources exploitative competition occurs resource use one organism depletes total amount available organisms organisms might never interact directly compete responding changes resource levels obvious examples phenomenon include diurnal species nocturnal species nevertheless share resources plant competes neighboring plants light nutrients space root form competition typically rewards organisms claim resource first exploitation competition often sizedependent smaller organisms favored since smaller organisms typically higher foraging since smaller organisms advantage exploitative competition important ecosystem mechanism competition might lead juveniledriven generation cycle individual juveniles succeed grow fast mature outcompeted smaller plants exploitative competition occur ground aboveground plants reduce fitness neighbors vying sunlight plants consume nitrogen absorbing roots making nitrogen unavailable nearby plants plants produce many roots typically reduce soil nitrogen low levels eventually killing neighboring plants exploitative competition also shown occur within species intraspecific different species interspecific furthermore many competitive interactions organisms combination exploitative interference competition meaning two mechanisms far mutually exclusive example recent study found native thrip species frankliniella intonsa competitively dominant invasive thrip species frankliniella occidentalis exhibited greater time feeding exploitative competition also greater time guarding resources interference plants may also exhibit forms competition scrambling space root growth also directly inhibiting plants development allelopathy apparent competition occurs two otherwise unrelated prey species indirectly compete survival shared form competition typically manifests new equilibrium abundances prey species example suppose two species species species b preyed upon foodlimited predator species c scientists observe increase abundance species decline abundance species b apparent competition model relationship found mediated predator c population explosion species increases abundance predator species c due greater total food source since predators species b would hunted higher rates thus success species detriment species b competed resources increased numbers indirect effects predator population onepredatortwoprey model explored ecologists early term apparent competition first coined university florida ecologist robert holt holt found field ecologists time erroneously attributing negative interactions among prey species niche partitioning competitive exclusion ignoring role foodlimited apparent competition help shape species realized niche area resources species actually persist due interspecific interactions effect realized niches could incredibly strong especially absence traditional interference exploitative competition realworld example studied late introduction snowshoe hares lepus americanus newfoundland reduced habitat range native arctic hares lepus arcticus ecologists hypothesized due overlap niche ecologists argued plausible mechanism snowshoe hare populations led explosion foodlimited lynx populations shared predator prey species since arctic hare relatively weaker defense tactic snowshoe hare excluded woodland areas basis differential predation however apparent competition exploitation competition might help explain situation support impact competition breadth realized niche respect diet becoming common variety systems based upon isotopic spatial data including small apparent competition symmetric symmetric apparent competition negatively impacts species equally inferred species persist however asymmetric apparent competition occurs one species affected less extreme scenario asymmetric apparent competition one species affected increase predator seen form amensalism human impacts endangered prey species characterized conservation scientists extreme form asymmetric apparent competition often introducing predator species ecosystems resource subsidies example fully asymmetric apparent competition often occurs near urban centers subsidies form human garbage waste early common raven corvus corax population mojave desert increased due influx human garbage leading indirect negative effect juvenile desert tortoises gopherus apparent competition also viewed human body human immune system acts generalist predator high abundance certain bacteria may induce immune response damaging pathogens body another example two populations bacteria support predatory bacteriophage situations one resistant infection shared predator replace apparent competition also suggested exploitable phenomenon cancer treatments highly specialized viruses developed target malignant cancer cells often go locally extinct prior eradicating cancer however virus developed targets healthy unhealthy host cells degree large number healthy cells would support predatory virus long enough eliminate malignant competition either complete symmetric individuals receive amount resources irrespective size perfectly size symmetric individuals exploit amount resource per unit biomass absolutely sizeasymmetric largest individuals exploit available resource among plants size asymmetry contextdependent competition asymmetric symmetric depending limiting resource forest stands belowground competition nutrients

stands example sizeasymmetric competition light stronger predictor growth compared competition soil competition occur individuals species called intraspecific competition different species called interspecific competition studies show intraspecific competition regulate population dynamics changes population size time occurs individuals become crowded population grows since individuals within population require resources crowding causes resources become limited individuals typically small juveniles eventually acquire enough resources die reproduce reduces population size slows population growthcitation needed species also interact species require resources consequently interspecific competition alter sizes many species populations time experiments demonstrate species compete limited resource one species eventually drives populations species extinct experiments suggest competing species coexist live together area best competitor exclude competing speciescitation needed intraspecific competition occurs members species compete resources simple example stand equallyspaced plants age higher density plants plants present per unit ground area stronger competition resources light water nutrients interspecific competition may occur individuals two separate species share limiting resource area resource support populations lowered fecundity growth survival may result least one species interspecific competition potential alter populations communities evolution interacting species example among animals could case cheetahs lions since species feed similar prey negatively impacted presence less food however still persist together despite prediction competition one displace fact lions sometimes steal prey items killed cheetahs potential competitors also kill socalled intraguild predation example southern california coyotes often kill eat gray foxes bobcats three carnivores sharing stable prey small example among protozoa involves paramecium aurelia paramecium caudatum russian ecologist georgy gause studied competition two species paramecium occurred result coexistence studies gause proposed competitive exclusion principle observing competition

requirements survival reproduction requirements include resources like food proper habitat conditions like temperature ph gause reasoned two species identical niches required identical resources habitats would attempt live exactly area would compete exactly resources happened species best competitor would always exclude competitors area therefore species must least slightly different niches order competition cause species evolve differences traits occurs individuals species traits similar competing species always experience strong interspecific competition individuals less reproduction survival individuals traits differ competitors consequently contribute many offspring future generations example darwins finches found alone together galapagos islands species populations actually
