osteodontornis extinct seabird genus contains single named species osteodontornis orri orrs bonytoothed bird literal translation scientific name described quite exactly one century first species pelagornithidae pelagornis miocaenus orri named naturalist ellison orr bonytoothed pseudotooth birds initially believed related albatrosses procellariiformes actually seem rather close relatives either pelicans storks waterfowl placed order odontopterygiformes account uncertainty also internal taxonomy wellresolved earlierdescribed pseudotooth bird cyphornis magnus vancouver island canada believed eocene age nowadays assumed lived twenty million years ago early miocene long clarendonian middlelate miocene orri may osteodontornis junior synonym wingspan metres ft height metres ft ground osteodontornis orri similar giant pseudotooth secondlargest flying birds known surpassed teratorn argentavis magnificens head neck billtip measured centimetres ft eyesockets centimetres wide humerus though long humans centimetres wide shoulder end skulls quadrate bone measured almost millimetres widest nearly millimetres like relatives orri stout extremely lightboned body feet presumably webbed aquatic relatives long probably narrow wings resembling albatross beak made threequarters heads length bony toothlike serrations hollow maybe filled cancellous bone beak heavy creature probably held shoulders flight like modern pelicans arrangement bony serrations characteristic genus one small tooth flanked small points even smaller teeth placed pair large ones however tooth pattern pseudotooth birds changed along length beak considered reliable way distinguish general lifestyle probably similar albatrosses tropicbirds frigatebirds today long slender wings adapted soaring vast distances open seas due size bird presumed excellently adapted dynamic soarer probably built nest high plateaus similar places could easily take flight simply walking wind wings spread seabird apparently lived mainly squid softbodied prey teeth less sawlike horny serrations beak fisheating sawbilled ducks merginae pointing straight downwards instead fossils often abraded broken downwardpointing teeth ideal digging holding slippery softskinned pelagic animals cephalopods probably snatched water flight swimming lightly built orri probably good diver may found impossible dive osteodontornis one pseudotooth
