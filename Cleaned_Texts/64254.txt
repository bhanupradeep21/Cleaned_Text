longtermism ethical view positively influencing longterm future key moral priority important concept effective altruism serves primary motivation efforts claim reduce existential risks key argument longtermism summarized follows future people matter morally much people alive today may well people alive future present past positively affect future peoples three ideas taken together suggest advocating longtermism responsibility living ensure future generations get survive philosopher william macaskill defines longtermism book owe future view positively influencing longterm future key moral priority distinguishes strong longtermism view positively influencing longterm future key moral priority book precipice existential risk future humanity philosopher toby ord describes longtermism follows longtermism especially concerned impacts actions upon longterm future takes seriously fact generation one page much longer story important role may fail story working safeguard humanitys potential one avenue lasting impact may others addition ord notes longtermism animated moral reorientation toward vast future existential risks threaten generally infeasible use traditional research techniques randomized controlled trials analyze existential risks researchers nick bostrom used methods expert opinion elicitation estimate ord offered probability estimates number existential risks term longtermism coined around oxford philosophers william macaskill toby ord view draws inspiration work nick bostrom nick beckstead coinage relatively new aspects longtermism thought centuries oral constitution iroquois confederacy gayanashagowa encourages decisionmaking always view present also coming generations interpreted mean decisions made benefit seventh generation ideas reemerged contemporary thought thinkers derek parfit book reasons persons jonathan schell book fate earth longtermist ideas given rise community individuals organizations working protect interests future organizations working longtermist topics include cambridge universitys centre study existential oxford universitys future humanity global priorities institute open future life forethought longview researchers studying longtermism believe improve longterm future two ways averting permanent catastrophes thereby ensuring civilisation survival changing civilisation trajectory make better lasts broadly ensuring survival increases quantity future life trajectory changes increase existential risk risk threatens destruction humanity longterm including risks cause human extinction permanent societal collapse examples risks include nuclear war natural engineered pandemics climate change civilizational collapse stable global totalitarianism emerging technologies like artificial intelligence reducing risks may significantly improve future long timescales increasing number quality future consequently advocates longtermism argue humanity crucial moment history choices made century may shape entire proponents longtermism pointed humanity spends less gross world product annually longtermist causes ie activities explicitly meant positively influence longterm future less amount spent annually ice cream us leading toby ord argue humanity start spending protecting future ice cream decide go existential risks extreme examples researchers call trajectory however might ways positively influence future unfold economist tyler cowen argues increasing rate economic growth top moral priority make future generations researchers think improving institutions like national governments international governance bodies could bring positive trajectory another way bring trajectory change changing societal william macaskill argues humanity expect positive value changes come example historians believe abolition slavery morally economically christopher leslie brown instead argues book moral capital moral revolution made slavery unacceptable time otherwise still hugely macaskill argues abolition may turning point entirety human history practice unlikely reason bringing positive value changes society may one way present generation positively influence longrun future longtermists argue live pivotal moment human history derek parfit wrote live hinge william macaskill states world longrun fate depends part choices make since society yet settled stable state able influence stable state end human history clear positively influence longrun however two relatively recent developments may changed developments technology nuclear weapons first time given humanity power annihilate would impact longterm future preventing existence flourishing future time progress made physical social sciences given humanity ability accurately predict least longterm effects actions taken macaskill also notes present time highly unusual live era involves extraordinary amount relative past rates economic technological progress slow future since current growth rates continue long hitting physical longtermism defended appealing various moral utilitarianism may motivate longtermism given importance places pursuing greatest good greatest number future generations expected vast majority people ever consequentialist moral utilitarianism one generally sympathetic longtermism since whatever theory considers morally valuable likely going much future however nonconsequentialist moral frameworks may also inspire longtermism instance toby ord considers responsibility present generation towards future generations grounded hard work sacrifices made past arrow time makes much easier help people come people come best way understanding partnership generations may asymmetrical duties flowing forwards forwards view duties future generations may thus grounded work ancestors us future generations book owe future william macaskill discusses individuals shape course history introduces threepart framework thinking effects future states longterm value outcome may bring depends significance persistence explains significance average value added bringing certain state affairs persistence means long state affairs lasts brought contingency refers extent state affairs depends individual moreover macaskill acknowledges pervasive uncertainty moral empirical surrounds longtermism offers four lessons help guide attempts improve longterm future taking robustly good actions building options learning avoiding causing population ethics plays important part longtermist thinking many advocates longtermism accept total view population ethics bringing happy people existence good things accepting view makes case longtermism particularly strong fact could huge numbers future people means improving lives crucially ensuring lives happen enormous longtermism often discussed relation interests future generations humans however proponents longtermism also put high moral value interests nonhuman perspective advocating animal welfare may extremely important longtermist cause area moral norm caring suffering nonhuman life might persist long time became longtermism implies use relatively small social discount rate considering moral value far future

longtermist worldview could worsen environmental crisis justify atrocities name attaining astronomical amounts future value anthropologist vincent ialenti argued avoiding require societies adopt textured multifaceted multidimensional longtermism defies insular information silos disciplinary echo advocates longtermism reply kinds actions good longterm future often also good example pandemic preparedness preparing worst case could threaten survival also help improve public health present example funding research innovation antivirals vaccines personal protective equipment well lobbying governments prepare pandemics may help prevent smaller scale health threats people objection longtermism relies accepting low probability bets extremely big payoffs rather certain bets lower payoffs
