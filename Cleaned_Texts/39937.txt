bubble fusion nontechnical name nuclear fusion reaction hypothesized occur inside extraordinarily large collapsing gas bubbles created liquid acoustic cavitation technical name term coined release report rusi taleyarkhan collaborators claimed observed evidence sonofusion claim quickly surrounded controversy including allegations ranging experimental error academic fraud subsequent publications claiming independent verification sonofusion also highly controversial eventually investigation purdue university found taleyarkhan engaged falsification independent verification included student author paper participated research subsequently stripped professorship one funders office naval research reviewed report purdue barred federal funding us patent filed hugh flynn appears earliest documented reference sonofusiontype reaction march issue peerreviewed journal science rusi p taleyarkhan colleagues oak ridge national laboratory ornl reported acoustic cavitation experiments conducted deuterated acetone showed measurements tritium neutron output consistent occurrence fusion neutron emission also reported coincident sonoluminescence pulse key indicator source fusion caused heat pressure inside collapsing results startling oak ridge national laboratory asked two independent researchers shapira j saltmarsh repeat experiment using sophisticated neutron detection equipment reported neutron release consistent random rebuttal taleyarkhan authors original report argued shapira saltmarsh report failed account significant differences experimental setup including inch shielding neutron detector sonoluminescing acetone according taleyarkhan et al properly considering differences results consistent early experimental work still progress aaron galonsky michigan state university letter journal expressed doubts claim made taleyarkhan team galonskys opinion observed neutrons high energy deuteriumdeuterium dd fusion reaction response published page taleyarkhan team provided detailed counterarguments concluded energy reasonably close expected fusion reaction february documentary series horizon commissioned two leading sonoluminescence researchers seth kenneth suslick reproduce taleyarkhans work using similar acoustic parameters deuterated acetone similar bubble nucleation much sophisticated neutron detection device researchers could find evidence fusion new reports bubble fusion published taleyarkhan group claiming results previous experiments replicated stringent experimental results differed original results fusion claimed occur longer times previously reported original report claimed neutron emission initial bubble collapse following bubble nucleation whereas report claimed neutron emission many acoustic cycles later july two taleyarkhans students purdue university published evidence confirming previous result used acoustic chamber deuterated acetone fluid similar bubble nucleation system report neutronsonoluminescence coincidence article nature raised issues validity research complaints purdue colleagues see full analysis elsewhere charges misconduct raised purdue university opened investigation concluded taleyarkhans name appeared author list deep involvement many steps research added one author really participated paper overcome criticism one reviewer part attempt effort falsify scientific record assertion independent confirmation investigation address validity experimental january paper published journal physical review letters taleyarkhan collaboration researchers rensselaer polytechnic institute reported statistically significant evidence november midst accusations concerning taleyarkhans research standards two different scientists visited metastable fluids research lab purdue university measure neutrons using taleyarkhans equipment dr edward r forringer undergraduates david robbins jonathan martin letourneau university presented two papers american nuclear society winter meeting reported replication neutron emission experimental setup similar previous experiments used mixture deuterated acetone deuterated benzene tetrachloroethylene uranyl nitrate notably however operated without external neutron source used two types neutron detectors claimed liquid scintillation detector measured neutron levels standard deviations background level plastic detectors measured levels standard deviations background experiment performed nondeuterated control liquid measurements within one standard deviation background indicating neutron production occurred cavitation deuterated william bugg emeritus physics professor university tennessee also traveled taleyarkhans lab repeat experiment equipment also reported neutron emission using plastic neutron taleyarkhan claimed visits counted independent replications experts forringer later recognized expert bugg later said taleyarkhan performed experiments march nature published special report called question validity results purdue report quotes brian naranjo university california los angeles effect neutron energy spectrum reported paper taleyarkhan et al statistically inconsistent neutrons produced proposed fusion reaction instead highly consistent neutrons produced radioactive decay californium isotope commonly used laboratory neutron response taleyarkhan et al published physical review letters attempts refute naranjos hypothesis cause neutrons tsoukalas head school nuclear engineering purdue several colleagues purdue convinced taleyarkhan move purdue attempt joint replication nature report detail several troubling issues trying collaborate taleyarkhan reported positive results certain set raw data colleagues also examined set contained negative results never showed colleagues raw data corresponding positive results despite several requests moved equipment shared laboratory laboratory thus impeding review colleagues didnt give advance warning explanation move taleyarkhan convinced colleagues shouldnt publish paper negative results taleyarkhan insisted universitys press release present experiment peerreviewed independent coauthors working laboratory supervision peers faculty allowed review data summary taleyarkhans colleagues purdue said placed obstacles peer review experiments serious doubts validity nature also revealed process anonymous peerreview followed journal

oak ridge nature reported patent rejected us patent office examiner called experiment variation discredited cold fusion found reputable evidence record support allegations claims invention capable operating indicated found enough detail others replicate invention field fusion suffered many flawed claims thus examiner asked additional proof radiation generated fusion sources appeal filed department energy dropped claim december doubts among purdue universitys nuclear engineering faculty whether positive results reported sonofusion experiments conducted truthful prompted university initiate review research conducted purdues office vice president research march article entitled evidence bubble fusion called question nature interviewed several taleyarkhans colleagues suspected something february purdue university administration determined evidence support allegations research misconduct investigation allegations warranted report also stated vigorous open debate scientific
