eczemathrombocytopeniaimmunodeficiency syndrome keeping aldrichs original description wasrelated disorders xlinked thrombocytopenia xlt xlinked congenital neutropenia xln may present similar less severe symptoms caused mutations gene occurs often males due xlinked recessive pattern inheritance affecting males per first signs usually petechiae bruising resulting low platelet count ie thrombocytopenia spontaneous nose bleeds bloody diarrhea also common eczema typically develops within first month life recurrent bacterial infections typically develop three months age majority children develop least one autoimmune disorder cancers mainly lymphoma leukemia develop third immunoglobulin igm levels reduced iga ige elevated igg levels normal reduced addition thrombocytopenia

bloodforming tissues cases severe disease score widely available curative treatment currently available hematopoietic stem cell transplant hct procedure stem cells harvested umbilical cord blood bone

infertilitycitation needed bleeding complications otherwise treatment focused managing symptoms preventing complications greatest mortality risk age bleeding aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may interfere already compromised platelet function generally circumcision well elective surgeries generally deferred males thrombocytopenia hct possible protective helmets help protect children lifethreatening intracranial hemorrhage brain bleed could result head injuries patients may require platelet transfusions extreme bloodloss surgery low platelets splenectomy removal spleen may also however splenectomy generally considered palliative universally recommended increase risk lifethreatening postsplenectomy patients require lifelong antibiotic prophyllaxis prevent infections study eltrombopag thrombopoietic agent used increase platelets immune thrombocytopenic purpura itp concluded although increased platelet numbers failed increase platelet activation since proposed eltrombopag may used bridge hct patients severe thrombocytopenia normalize platelet numbers without transfusions decrease bleeding anemia bleeding may require iron supplementation blood transfusion regular surveillance blood counts recommended infections autoimmune disease patients frequent infections intravenous immunoglobulins ivig subcutaneous immunoglobulins regularly scheduled boost immune system adequacy ivig replacement assessed via periodic lab draws patients immune system compromise may benefit antibiotic prophylaxis example taking trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole prevent pneumocystis
