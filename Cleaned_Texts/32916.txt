eurhinosaurus greek wellnosed lizard eu meaning well good rhino meaning nose sauros meaning lizard extinct genus ichthyosaur early jurassic toarcian ranging million years fossils aquatic reptile found western europe england southern northern germanycitation needed beneluxcitation needed france used live deep open sea eurhinosaurus large genus ichthyosaurs adult individual could reach metres ft eurhinosaurus followed regular body morphology fishlike fusiform body including well developed dorsal fin hypocercal caudal paired pectoral pelvic fins remarkably large like ichthyosaurs eurhinosaurus gills used lungs eurhinosaurus one distinct feature different ichthyosaurs upper jaw twice long lower jaw covered downwardspointing name ichthyosaurus longirostris first published mantell guide paleontological galleries old british museum one ichthyosaurian specimens displayed ichthyosaurus specimen exceedingly slender elongated muzzle skull crushed characteristic preserved specific name

paper describing miocene cetacean eurhinodelphis cocheteuxi abel noted certain whether cetaceans mandible extended tip snout whether abbreviated like case ichthyosaurus longirostris considered weak attenuated mandible distinguishing features ichthyosaurus longirostris decided erect separate genus names type species monotype eurhinosaurus second species e quenstedti described germany original
