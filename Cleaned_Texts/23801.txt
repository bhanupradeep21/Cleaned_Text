analgesic nephropathy injury kidneys caused analgesic medications aspirin bucetin phenacetin paracetamol term usually refers damage induced excessive use combinations medications especially combinations include phenacetin may also used describe kidney injury single analgesic medication specific kidney injuries induced analgesics renal papillary necrosis chronic interstitial nephritis appear result decreased blood flow kidney rapid consumption antioxidants subsequent oxidative damage kidney kidney damage may lead progressive chronic kidney failure abnormal urinalysis results high blood pressure anemia small proportion individuals analgesic nephropathy may develop endstage kidney disease analgesic nephropathy common cause kidney injury endstage kidney disease parts europe australia united states areas incidence declined sharply since use phenacetin fell needed common findings people analgesic nephropathy include headache anemia high blood pressure hypertension white blood cells urine leucocyturia individuals analgesic nephropathy may also protein urine complications analgesic nephropathy include endstage kidney risk factors poor prognosis include recurrent urinary tract infection persistently elevated blood analgesic nephropathy also appears increase risk developing cancers urinary scarring small blood vessels called capillary sclerosis initial lesion analgesic found renal pelvis ureter capillaries supplying nephrons capillary sclerosis thought lead renal papillary necrosis turn chronic interstitial phenacetin analgesics lead damage incompletely understood currently thought kidney toxicities nsaids antipyretics phenacetin paracetamol may combine give rise analgesic nephropathy committee investigators reported insufficient evidence suggest nonphenacetin analgesics associated analgesic proper kidney function depends upon adequate blood flow kidney kidney blood flow complex tightly regulated process relies number hormones small molecules prostaglandins normal circumstances prostaglandin produced kidney necessary support adequate blood flow kidney like prostaglandins synthesis depends upon cyclooxygenasescitation needed aspirin nsaids inhibitors cyclooxygenases kidney inhibition results decreased concentration causing reduction blood flow blood flow kidney first reaches renal cortex outside renal medulla inside deeper structures kidney sensitive decreased blood flow thus innermost structures kidney known renal papillae especially dependent prostaglandin synthesis maintain adequate blood flow inhibition cyclooxygenases therefore rather selectively damages renal papillae increasing risk renal papillary nsaids caused adverse effects renal function healthy dogs subjected healthy kidneys contain enough physiologic reserve compensate nsaidinduced decrease blood flow however subjected additional injury phenacetin paracetamol may progress analgesic nephropathycitation needed unclear phenacetin induces injury bach hardy proposed phenacetins metabolites lead lipid peroxidation damages cells paracetamol major metabolite phenacetin may contribute kidney injury specific mechanism cells kidney cyclooxygenases

sensitive oxidative damagecitation needed diagnosis traditionally based clinical findings combination excessive analgesic use suspected analgesic nephropathy confirmed relative accuracy using computed tomography ct imaging without one trial demonstrated appearance papillary calcifications ct imaging sensitive specific diagnosis analgesic treatment analgesic nephropathy begins discontinuation analgesics often halts progression disease may even result normalization kidney stage chronic kidney disease patients renal replacement therapy may become necessarycitation needed analgesics class medications widely used treatment pain include aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs well antipyretics paracetamol known acetaminophen united states phenacetin introduced late century phenacetin common component mixed analgesics parts europe australia united analgesics contained aspirin nsaids combined phenacetin paracetamol salicylamide caffeine sp√ºhler zollinger reported association kidney injury chronic use noted chronic users phenacetin increased risk developing specific kidney injuries namely renal papillary necrosis chronic interstitial nephritis condition dubbed analgesic nephropathy attributed phenacetin although absolute causative role demonstrated reports increased risk kidney injury prolonged excessive phenacetin use however phenacetin banned several countries use phenacetin declined prevalence analgesic nephropathy cause endstage kidney disease data switzerland example demonstrated decline prevalence analgesic nephropathy among people endstage kidney disease autopsy study performed switzerland suggested prevalence analgesic nephropathy general population likewise decreased prevalence data demonstrate analgesic nephropathy eliminated regions regions condition persists notably belgium prevalence analgesic nephropathy among people dialysis michielsen de schepper suggest analgesic nephropathy persists among people belgium dialysis due nonphenacetin analgesics belgium accepts higher proportion elderly people dialysis according authors greater proportion analgesic nephropathy greater percentage people belgium dialysis exposed longterm use term analgesic nephropathy usually refers damage induced excessive use combinations medications specifically combinations include phenacetin reason also called analgesic abuse nephropathy murray prefers
