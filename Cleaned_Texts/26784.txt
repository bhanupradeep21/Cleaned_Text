insect beetle indoaustralian origin less able survive outdoors closely related species tribolium confusum consequence southern distribution though species worldwide heated environments adult longlived sometimes living three years although previously regarded relatively sedentary insect shown molecular ecological research disperse considerable distances female red flour beetles exhibit polyandrous mating behavior within single copulation period female mate multiple males one male may low sperm count depleted supply prior matings mating several increases females likelihood obtaining adequate amount although multiple mating events may also increase likelihood finding genetically compatible sperm genetic compatibility always major factor driving polyandrous increased embryo viability due increased genetic compatibility significantly increase number adult beetles time indicates play significant role fitness overall however increased genetic compatibility could increase genetic diversity population advantageous situations rapid environmental availability resources population size greatly affect many matings individual participates increased population size within given area fixed resources limit many offspring result heavy competition males females last mate carries advantage ejaculate one mating removed subsequent resources limited increased cannibalism among competing males ultimately decrease fitness population whole decreases offspring production red flour beetles males ability attract females via pheromones genetically based higher attractiveness however correlate higher fitness offspring genes attractive pheromones reliable indicator male also genes improve offspring females different populations red flour beetles highly polyandrous others avoid multiple mates may indicate overall advantage disadvantage likewise varies across mate choice strategies vary among female beetles moreover capable cryptic choice use multiple sperm receptacles store sperm different males allowing later choice mate choice also varies among male beetles though generally prefer mature virgin females identified absence scent secretions left previous mates female beetle one mate sperm count sufficient male high chance siring offspring males greater ability identify preferred mates males strongly scented secretions better deter subsequent experimental populations red flour beetles subjected strong sexual selection multiple years became resilient extinction furthermore subjected inbreeding maintained fitness contrast lineages derived form populations experienced either weak sexual selection exhibited rapid fitness decline inbreeding populations became extinct within generations results indicated sexual selection reduces mutational load improves population polygamy red flour beetles behavior common males females species polyandry thus polygamy female members population discussed section hand polygyny refers polygamy practiced males population red flour beetles females engage polygamous behavior produce offspring less polygamous polygamy mostly seen populations lack genetic diversity polygamy less genetically diverse populations means avoiding fertilization beetles closely related since may genetically partners male female higher chances least one matings unrelated partner greater genetic diversity offspring way genetic incompatibility reduced diversity increased population reason females copulate males genetic diversity low order attain fertilization success also increase fitness subsequent offspring studies however noted fertilization still occur related beetles mate nonetheless worth noting significantly lower number offspring produced inbred beetles mate matings outbred partners successful fertilization observed small portion research related beetles led biologists claim may inbreeding depression red flour even though successful fertilization observed lower number total offspring produced argued type inbreeding depression since lowers reproduction fitness mating red flour beetles known engage polygamous behavior male flour beetles known recognize relatives females capability lack ability recognize relatives led females mate male within female red flour beetles also known store sperm mating sperm stored first mating leads less sperm stored subsequent matings however amount stored sperm stop last male mate fertilizing due fact mating males remove previously stored sperm thus giving sperm advantage fertilize egg red flour beetles males known engage polygamous behavior research largely shows male red flour beetles engage polygamous behavior avoid inbreeding depression especially competition males higher fertilization success outbred males compete inbred males fertilize polygamous beetles male last fertilizes female ends higher fertilization success polygamy thus seen evolutionary result males compete last fertilize females egg contribute next generation sperm precedence thus means evolutionary competition males try achieve greater reproductive red flour beetle played important role model organism serving model development functional genomics compared drosophila red flour beetle
