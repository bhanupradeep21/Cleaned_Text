throwing physical action consists mechanically accelerating projectile releasing ballistic trajectory usually aim impacting distant target action typically refers handthrowing animals prehensile forelimbs case projectile grasped hand proximal limb segments move compounded kinematic chains impart mechanical advantaged swinging motion animals definition throwing somewhat unclear actions spitting spraying may may included primates proliferative throwers animal kingdom typically throw feces form agonistic behavior primates humans far capable throwers throw large variety projectiles much greater complexity efficacy accuracy throughout human evolution humans especially homo sapiens used handthrown projectiles hunting warfare first rockthrowing refined weaponthrowing eg spear axe dart modern day payloadcarrying devices hand grenades flashbangs tear gas canisters overcome biophysical limitations throwing hand humans also designed tools improve efficiency throwing techniques atlatl amentum sling various models catapults notable examples throwing mechanisms advent bow arrow later gunpowderbased firearms human innovation throwing tools ranged weapons essentially halted throwing either hand tools persisted recreational purposes thrower tools fishing clay pigeon shooting form exercise throwing thus still performed many sports games particularly ball games throwing sports especially track field action main determiner outcome throwing dates back million years homo development offensive throwing projectiles mostly development human lineage although aimed throwing sticks rocks male chimpanzees agonistic displays observed first described jane goodall accumulative throwing targeted throwing rocks specific target leading gradual accumulation stone pile also described wooden darts used hunting least middle paleolithic homo heidelbergensis spearthrower development upper paleolithic certainly use solutrean c years ago human athletes achieve throwing speeds close kmh mph far excess maximal speed attainable chimpanzees kmh ability reflects ability human shoulder muscles tendons store elasticity needed propel types throws include overhand throws underhand throws using hands overhand throws thrown predominantly shoulder underhand throws overhand throws usually significantly faster ball speeds miles per hour kmh recorded thrown objects often intentionally spun stability aerodynamic effects notion throwing typically refers action performed without mechanical assistance mechanical assistance long doesnt involve release chemical electric energy doesnt fundamentally change nature action thus considered throwing throwing mechanisms discussed section overhand throwing motion complex motor skill involves entire body series linked movements starting legs progressing pelvis trunk culminating ballistic motion arm propels projectile forward used almost exclusively athletic events throwing motion broken three basic steps cocking accelerating releasing desired qualities action produce fast accurate throw qualities affected physical attributes thrower like height strength flexibility however mainly throwing motion mechanics throwers ability coordinate determines quality throw determining desired qualities throwing motion difficult assess due extremely short amount time takes professionals perform motion throwing mechanisms along projectiles rank amongst oldest technological artefacts archaeological records vary greatly size complexity handheld extremely simple sling heavy complex catapults two types devices common handthrowing fact requirements projectiles size weight sense differ specialized throwing techniques developed archery projectiles strong requirements shape throwing used propelling weapons stones spears enemies predators prey track field contains four major throwing events discus throw hammer throw javelin throw shot put weight throw fifth common field throwing event club throw unique disability athletics throwing performed nonagonistic way target cooperating agent perform somewhat opposite action called catch humans likely animals capable throwing intent almost exclusively intraspecific behavior whose goal exchange artifacts without shorten distance participants seemingly unique exception intraspecificity humans play game called fetch domestic dog although situation dog always catches never throwscitation needed use common common metaphor figuratively sending something someone eg throw bone common use behavior disposal employed term typically throwing away commonly used figuratively research mythbusters found men women throw almost equally well nondominant hand suggesting sexual differences probably due differences throwing rare among nonprimates provided definition relaxed entail instance spitting several examples found amongst various taxa camelids cobras archerfish elephants observed throwing rocks logs using trunk grab flick items although lack accuracy primates achieve commonly used warning aggressors one willing consider dropping special case throwing one include birds notably vultures species known drop stones order break shells hard food sources ground orcas often observed throwing seals air usually hitting caudal fin behavior speculated purely recreational media related throwing wikimedia commons httpsenwikipediaorgwikithrowing
