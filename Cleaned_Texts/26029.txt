acute pericarditis type pericarditis inflammation sac surrounding heart pericardium usually lasting less weekscitation needed common condition affecting pericardium chest pain one common symptoms acute pericarditis usually sudden onset occurring anterior chest often sharp quality worsens breathing coughing due inflammation pleural surface time pain may reduced sitting leaning forward worsened lying also may radiate back one trapezius ridges however pain also dull steady resembling chest pain acute myocardial infarction chest pain causes must also ruled gerd pulmonary embolism muscular pain etc pericardial friction rub specific sign acute pericarditis meaning presence sign invariably indicates presence disease however absence sign rule disease rub best heard diaphragm stethoscope left sternal border arising squeaky scratching sound resembling sound leather rubbing sound distinguished sound murmur similar sounds like swish sound scratching sound pericardial rub said generated friction generated two inflamed layers pericardium however even large pericardial effusion necessarily present rub rub best heard maximal movement heart within pericardial sac namely atrial systole ventricular systole filling phase early ventricular diastole fever may present since inflammatory process several causes acute developed nations cause cases acute pericarditis unknown viral cause suspected majority acute pericarditis cases various causes including connective tissue diseases eg systemic lupus erythematosus cancer involve inflammatory reaction pericardium following trauma heart heart attack dresslers familial mediterranean fever tnf receptor associated periodic syndrome rare inherited autoimmune diseases capable causing recurring episodes acute clinical presentation diseases pericardium may vary acute pericarditis formally diagnosed two following criteria must present chest pain consistent diagnosis acute pericarditis sharp chest pain worsened breathing cough pericardial friction rub pericardial effusion changes electrocardiogram ecg consistent acute complete blood count may show elevated white count serum creactive protein may elevated acute pericarditis associated modest increase serum creatine kinase mb cardiac troponin also markers injury muscular layer heart therefore imperative also rule acute myocardial infarction face biomarkers elevation substances may occur inflammation hearts muscular layer addition acute also st elevation ekg see common patients ctni coronary angiography patients indicate normal vascular perfusion troponin levels increase people electrocardiogram ecg changes acute pericarditis mainly indicates inflammation epicardium layer directly surrounding heart since fibrous pericardium electrically inert example uremia inflammation epicardium fibrin deposition therefore ekg uremic pericarditis normal typical ekg changes acute pericarditis two common clinical conditions ecg findings may mimic pericarditis acute myocardial infarction ami generalized early opposed pericarditis ami usually causes localized convex stelevation usually associated reciprocal stdepression may also frequently accompanied qwaves twave inversions st still elevated unlike pericarditis arrhythmias conduction ami prdepressions rarely present early repolarization usually occurs young males age years ecg changes characterized terminal rs slurring temporal stability stdeviations jheight tamplitude ratio opposed pericarditis terminal rs slurring uncommon jheight tamplitude ratio rarely ecg changes hypothermia may mimic pericarditis however differentiation helpful detailed history presence osborne wave another important diagnostic electrocardiographic sign acute pericarditis spodick signifies prdepressions usual always association downsloping tp segment patients acute pericarditis present patients affected acute pericarditis sign often best visualized lead ii lateral precordial leads addition spodicks sign may also serve important distinguishing electrocardiographic tool acute pericarditis acute coronary syndrome presence classical spodicks sign often giveaway diagnosiscitation needed rarely electrical alternans may seen depending size effusioncitation needed chest xray usually normal acute pericarditis reveal presence enlarged heart pericardial effusion present greater ml volume conversely patients unexplained new onset cardiomegaly always worked acute pericarditiscitation needed echocardiogram typically normal acute pericarditis reveal pericardial effusion presence supports diagnosis although absence exclude diagnosiscitation needed patients uncomplicated acute pericarditis generally treated followed outpatient clinic however high risk factors developing complications see need admitted inpatient service likely icu setting high risk patients include pericardiocentesis procedure whereby fluid pericardial effusion removed needle performed following nsaids viral idiopathic pericarditis patients underlying causes viral specific etiology treated idiopathic viral pericarditis nsaid mainstay treatment goal therapy reduce pain inflammation course disease may affected preferred nsaid ibuprofen rare side effects better effect coronary flow larger dose depending severity dosing mg every hours days weeks needed alternative protocol aspirin mg every dose tapering nsaids may needed pericarditis following acute myocardial infarction nsaids aspirin avoided since impair scar formation nsaid use gi protection engaged failure respond nsaids within one week indicated persistence fever worsening condition new pericardial effusion continuing chest pain likely indicates cause viral idiopathic processcitation needed colchicine essential treat recurrent pericarditis supported routine use acute pericarditis recent prospective colchicine given mg twice day mg daily patients kg months following acute attack considered patients acute pericarditis preferably combination shortcourse patients first episode acute idiopathic viral pericarditis treated nsaid plus colchicine mg first day followed daily twice daily three avoided used caution patients severe chronic kidney disease hepatobiliary dysfunction blood dyscrasias gastrointestinal motility corticosteroids usually used cases clearly refractory nsaids colchicine specific cause found systemic corticosteroids usually reserved autoimmune one feared complications acute pericarditis cardiac tamponade cardiac tamponade accumulation enough fluid pericardial space pericardial effusion cause serious obstruction inflow blood heart signs cardiac tamponade include distended neck veins muffled heart sounds listening stethoscope low blood pressure together known becks condition fatal immediately treated another longer term complication pericarditis recurs longer period time normally months progression constrictive pericarditis recent studies shown uncommon definitive treatment constrictive pericarditis pericardial stripping surgical
