jaundice also known icterus yellowish greenish pigmentation skin sclera due high bilirubin jaundice adults typically sign indicating presence underlying diseases involving abnormal heme metabolism liver dysfunction biliarytract prevalence jaundice adults rare jaundice babies common estimated affected first week commonly associated symptoms jaundice pale feces dark normal levels bilirubin blood

gallbladder ursodeoxycholic acid opioid antagonists word jaundice french jaunisse meaning yellow common signs jaundice adults yellowish discoloration white area eye sclera scleral icterus presence indicating serum bilirubin least common signs include dark urine bilirubinuria pale acholia fatty stool bilirubin skin irritant jaundice commonly associated severe eye conjunctiva particularly high affinity bilirubin deposition due high elastin content slight increases serum bilirubin therefore detected early observing yellowing sclerae traditionally referred scleral icterus term actually misnomer bilirubin deposition technically occurs conjunctival membranes overlying avascular sclera thus proper term yellowing white eyes conjunctival much less common sign jaundice specifically childhood yellowish greenish teeth developing children hyperbilirubinemia may cause yellow green discoloration teeth due bilirubin deposition process tooth may occur children hyperbilirubinemia tooth

indicating presence underlying diseases involving abnormal bilirubin metabolism liver dysfunction biliarytract obstruction general jaundice present blood levels bilirubin exceed jaundice classified three categories depending part physiological mechanism pathology affects three categories prehepatic jaundice commonly caused pathological increased rate red blood cell erythrocyte hemolysis increased breakdown erythrocytes increased unconjugated serum bilirubin increased deposition unconjugated bilirubin mucosal diseases may cause jaundice due increased erythrocyte hepatic jaundice caused abnormal liver metabolism major causes hepatic jaundice significant damage hepatocytes due infectious drugmedicationinduced autoimmune etiology less commonly due inheritable genetic following partial list hepatic causes posthepatic jaundice obstructive jaundice caused blockage bile ducts transport bile containing conjugated bilirubin liver list conditions cause posthepatic jaundice jaundice typically caused underlying pathological process occurs point along normal physiological pathway heme metabolism deeper understanding anatomical flow normal heme metabolism essential appreciate importance prehepatic hepatic posthepatic categories thus anatomical approach heme metabolism precedes discussion pathophysiology jaundicecitation needed red blood cells complete lifespan

pigment called bilirubin cytosolic enzyme biliverdin reductase bilirubin unconjugated free indirect bilirubin around mg bilirubin per kg blood produced majority bilirubin comes breakdown heme expired red blood cells process described roughly comes heme sources however including ineffective erythropoiesis breakdown hemecontaining proteins muscle myoglobin unconjugated bilirubin travels liver

bilirubin diglucuronide conjugated bilirubin bilirubin conjugated liver watersoluble excreted gallbladdercitation needed bilirubin enters intestinal tract via bile intestinal tract bilirubin converted urobilinogen symbiotic intestinal bacteria urobilinogen converted stercobilinogen oxidized stercobilin stercobilin excreted via feces giving stool characteristic brown small portion urobilinogen reabsorbed back gastrointestinal cells reabsorbed urobilinogen undergoes hepatobiliary recirculation smaller portion reabsorbed urobilinogen filtered kidneys urine urobilinogen converted urobilin gives urine characteristic yellow one way understand jaundice pathophysiology organize disorders cause increased bilirubin production abnormal heme metabolism decreased bilirubin excretion abnormal heme excretioncitation needed prehepatic jaundice results pathological increase bilirubin production increased rate erythrocyte hemolysis causes increased bilirubin production leading increased deposition bilirubin mucosal tissues appearance yellow huecitation needed hepatic jaundice hepatocellular jaundice due significant disruption liver function leading hepatic cell death necrosis impaired bilirubin transport across hepatocytes bilirubin transport across hepatocytes may impaired point hepatocellular uptake unconjugated bilirubin hepatocellular transport conjugated bilirubin gallbladder addition subsequent cellular edema due inflammation causes mechanical obstruction intrahepatic biliary tract commonly interferences three major steps bilirubin metabolism uptake conjugation excretion usually occur hepatocellular jaundice thus abnormal rise unconjugated conjugated bilirubin formerly called cholemia present excretion ratelimiting step usually impaired greatest extent conjugated hyperbilirubinemia unconjugated bilirubin still enters liver cells becomes conjugated usual way conjugated bilirubin returned blood probably rupture congested bile canaliculi direct emptying bile lymph exiting liver thus bilirubin plasma becomes conjugated type rather unconjugated type conjugated bilirubin go intestine become urobilinogen gives urine dark needed posthepatic jaundice also called obstructive jaundice due blockage bile excretion biliary tract leads increased conjugated bilirubin bile salts complete obstruction bile duct conjugated bilirubin access intestinal tract disrupting bilirubin conversion urobilinogen therefore stercobilin urobilin produced obstructive jaundice excess conjugated bilirubin filtered urine without urobilinogen conjugated bilirubin urine bilirubinuria gives urine abnormally dark brown color thus presence pale stool stercobilin absent feces dark urine conjugated bilirubin present urine suggests obstructive cause jaundice associated signs also positive many hepatic jaundice conditions reliable clinical feature distinguish obstructive versus hepatocellular jaundice people presenting jaundice various predictable patterns liver panel abnormalities though significant variation exist typical liver panel includes blood levels enzymes found primarily liver aminotransferases alt ast alkaline phosphatase alp bilirubin causes jaundice protein levels specifically total protein albumin primary lab tests liver function include gamma glutamyl transpeptidase ggt prothrombin time single test differentiate various classifications jaundice combination liver function tests physical examination findings essential arrive bone heart disorders lead increase alp aminotransferases first step differentiating liver problems compare levels ggt elevated liverspecific conditions second step distinguishing biliary cholestatic liver causes jaundice altered laboratory results alp ggt levels typically rise one pattern aspartate aminotransferase ast alanine aminotransferase alt rise separate pattern alp iul ggt iul levels rise proportionately high ast iul alt iul levels indicates cholestatic problem ast alt rise significantly higher alp ggt rise though indicates liver problem finally distinguishing liver causes jaundice comparing levels ast alt prove useful ast levels typically higher alt remains case liver disorders except hepatitis viral hepatotoxic alcoholic liver damage may fairly normal alt levels ast times higher alt alt higher ast however indicative hepatitis levels alt ast well correlated
