common frog grass frog rana temporaria also known european common frog european common brown frog european grass frog european holarctic true frog european pond frog european brown frog semiaquatic amphibian family ranidae found throughout much europe far north scandinavia far east urals except iberian peninsula southern italy southern balkans farthest west found ireland also found asia eastward japan nominative common subspecies rana temporaria temporaria largely terrestrial frog native europe distributed throughout northern europe found ireland isle lewis far east common frogs metamorphose three distinct developmental life stages aquatic larva terrestrial juvenile adult corpulent bodies rounded snout webbed feet long hind legs adapted swimming water hopping land common frogs often confused common toad bufo bufo frogs easily distinguished longer legs hop moist skin whereas toads crawl dry warty skin spawn two species also differs frog spawn laid clumps toad spawn laid long

common frogs generally lack middorsal band one comparatively many countries moor frogs light dorsal band easily distinguishes common frogs underbelly white yellow occasionally orange females speckled brown eyes brown transparent horizontal pupils transparent inner eyelids protect eyes underwater well mask covers eyes although common frog long hind legs compared common toad shorter agile frog shares range longer hind legs fainter colouration agile frog main features distinguish two species males distinguishable females smaller hard swellings known nuptial pads first digits forelegs used

long riparian normally active much year hibernating coldest northern extremities range may trapped ice nine months year recent studies shown conditions may relatively active temperatures close british isles common frogs typically hibernate late october january reemerge early february conditions favorable migrate bodies water garden ponds conditions harsher alps emerge late early june common frogs hibernate running waters muddy burrows layers decaying leaves mud bottom ponds lakes primarily current oxygen uptake skin suffices sustain needs cold motionless frogs common frogs found throughout much europe far north northern scandinavia inside arctic circle far east urals except iberia southern italy southern balkans areas common frog introduced include isle lewis shetland orkney faroe islands also found asia eastward common frog long thought entirely introduced species however genetic analyses suggest particular populations south west ireland indeed indigenous authors propose irish frog population mixed group includes native frogs survived last glacial period ice free refugia natural postglacial colonizers recent artificial introductions western common frog widely distributed species common throughout europe northwest asia peripheral subpopulations common frogs significantly less number well less genetically variable steep genetic decline approaching periphery common frogs distribution additionally genetic differentiation common frog subpopulations tends decrease relation increasing colder climates create strong selective pressure favoring common frog populations able behaviorally thermoregulate high many diseases affecting common frogs one deadly ranavirus responsible causing declines amphibian populations across world two main deadly symptoms caused ranavirus towards common frogs skin ulcerations mortality rates associated disease high events observed deaths caused ranavirus occur stages common frog development concentrated mostly summer months overall common frog populations affected ranavirus experience consistent substantial declines population size due widespread nature rana temporaria common frogs make homes urban rural environments however many populations living urban environments subject detrimental effects urbanization construction roads buildings absolute barriers migration stymied gene flow drift urban populations common frogs leading lower levels genetic diversity urban common frog populations compared rural urban common frog populations also experience higher levels mortality developmental abnormality indicative forced however common frog listed species least concern iucn red list threatened metamorphosis tadpoles fore legs developed frog feed short time recently metamorphosed juvenile frog mostly feed small insects like collembola hexapods acarina mites ticks small fly larvae rana temporaria tadpoles however mostly feed algae decomposed hind legs develop become common frog takes place unspecialized opportunistic feeder wherever located words common frogs consume whatever prey available easy usually means common frog feeds remaining idle waiting suitable prey enters frogs domain capture corollary also means common frogs diet changes depending season associated prey become abundant summer common frogs diet mostly consists adult crane flies larvae butterflies moths slightly lesser extent common frogs feed woodlice arachnids beetles slugs snails addition common frogs typically feed bigger prey become larger therefore newly developed common frogs limited smaller insect prey whereas larger frogs able consume wide range insects common frogs hide damp places water day night begin searching food spring frogs pituitary gland stimulated changes external factors rainfall day length temperature produce hormones turn stimulate production sex cells eggs females sperm male males nuptial pad also swells becomes heavily common frogs breed shallow still fresh water ponds spawning commencing sometime march late june generally april main part like close cousin moor frog r arvalis r temporaria exhibit territoriality leads lack physical fighting among males breeding season male common frogs undergo period days less days display rapid frenzied breeding purpose male quickly find mate many female frogs possible higher rates mating success males typically longer thumbs single allows better grip females around three years born common frog return original site birth release mating call males first arrive pond await females enter period prefemale competition pond significantly male dominant large amount intrasexual competition taking shallow portion pond suitable egg laying predominantly occupied larger males however females arrive territoriality quickly dissipates malefemale amplexed pairs free migrate wherever pond additionally engaged amplexus rare single males attempt displace take paired also important note effect size male common frogs mating strategies smaller frogs prespawning period get displaced shallow areas pond therefore circumvent issue searching females land areas pond first meanwhile larger frogs occupy spawning site encounter amplexed pairs therefore rely ability displace amplexed males secure however frequency takeovers consistent female common frog clutch sizes range hundred eggs many eggs form large aggregates serve thermoregulate well protect developing embryo potential predators bunching eggs together raises temperature embryo compared surrounding water important rate tadpole development faster higher additionally eggs typically laid shallower regions pond prevent hypoxiainduced fatality normally takes weeks eggs hatch afterwards common frog larvae group schools help feed algae larger plants well avoid june july tadpoles metamorphosized remaining time winter used feed grow largest frogs survive winter places large emphasis rapid development fact common frogs rate development correlates temperature lower temperature regions common frogs hatch earlier metamorphosize sooner common frogs living warmer climate sexual maturity occurs three years common frogs typically live six eight presence predator common frogs early development

reproduction muscle ability respiration common frogs mid high elevations developed unique set strategies survive cold climates fact due common frogs ability thermoregulate effectively species able become pervasive across multitude environments climates living far north arctic circle scandinavia north amphibian contrary lithobates sylvaticus wood frogs common frogs ability freeze protect increasing levels blood glucose serve result common frogs must rely behavioral thermoregulation seeking warm microhabitats soil rocks wintertime additionally common frogs commonly hibernate throughout winter season groups provide bodily similar anuran species bufo americanus rana sylvatica rana temporaria able naturally discriminate others kind postembryonic interaction conspecifics necessary
