marginal value theorem mvt optimality model usually describes behavior optimally foraging individual system resources often food located discrete patches separated areas resources due resourcefree space animals must spend time traveling patches mvt also applied situations organisms face diminishing returns mvt first proposed eric charnov original formulation predator leave patch presently marginal capture rate patch drops average capture rate animals must forage food order meet energetic needs energetically costly assumed evolution natural selection results animals utilizing economic efficient strategy balance energy gain consumption marginal value theorem optimality model describes strategy maximizes gain per unit time systems resources thus rate returns decrease model weighs benefits costs used predict giving time giving density giving time gut interval time animal last feeds leaves patch giving density gud food density within patch animal choose move food patches animal foraging system food sources patchily distributed mvt used predict much time individual spend searching particular patch moving new one general individuals stay longer patches farther apart current patches poor resources situations increase ratio travel cost foraging benefit animals forage patchy systems balance resource intake traveling time foraging time resource intake within patch diminishes time shown solid curve graph right curve follows pattern resource intake initially fast slows resource depleted traveling time shown distance leftmost vertical dotted line yaxis optimal foraging time modeled connecting point xaxis tangentially resource intake curve maximizes ratio resource intake time spent foraging traveling extremes loading curve animals spend much time traveling small payoff search long given patch ineffective load mvt identifies best possible intermediate extremes common illustration mvt apple picking humans one first arrives new apple tree number apples picked per minute high rapidly decreases lowesthanging fruits depleted strategies apples picked tree tree exhausted suboptimal result respectively time lost travelling among trees picking hard find last apples tree optimal time spent picking apples tree thus compromise two strategies quantitatively found using mvt great tits species bird found throughout europe northern africa asia known forage patchy environments research shown behavior modeled optimal foraging models including mvt study ra birds deprived food allowed forage patches two different environments environments differed distance patches predicted cases birds spent time one area patches farther away yielded benefits regardless environment similar experiment naefdaenzer great tits shown foraging efficiency better random foraging would yield great tits specifically spending time resourcerich areas predicted mvt data supports use mvt predicting foraging behavior great tits experimental evidence shown screaming hairy armadillos guinea pigs qualitatively follow mvt researchers ran several parallel experiments one animal consistent patch quality one guinea pigs varying patch quality qualitative foraging trend shown follow mvt case quantitative analysis indicated patch exploited expected mvt used model foraging plants well animals plants shown preferentially place roots foraging organs areas higher resource concentration recall mvt predicts animals forage longer patches higher resource quality plants increase root biomass layersareas soil rich nutrients resources decrease root growth areas poorquality soil thus plants grow roots patches soil according wealth resources manner consistent additionally plant roots grow quickly lowquality patches soil highquality patches soil foraging animals predicted spend less time lowquality areas highquality areas mvt applied situations foraging animals experience diminished returns consider example mating copulation duration yellow dung fly dung fly mating system males gather fresh cow droppings wait females arrive smaller groups lay eggs males must compete chance mate arriving one male kick another male female take mating female midcopulation instance second male fertilizes thus male mated female guards males opportunity mate displace sperm lays eggs female lays eggs male must take time search another female able copulate question long dung fly spend copulating female one hand longer male dung fly copulates eggs fertilize however benefits extra copulation time diminish quickly male loses chance find another female long copulations mvt predicts optimal copulation time long enough fertilize eggs time rewards much smaller worth missing another predicted value copulation time minutes close average observed value minutes dung flies observed values copulation time time searching another mate vary body weight heavier males shorter search times shorter copulation times shorter search times likely due increased cost travel increased body weight shorter copulation times probably reflect easier heavier males successfully take females midcopulation additionally researchers taken account patch quality ie quality females arriving various cowpats research also shows males copulate longer larger females hold eggs larger reproductive tract dimensions thus males change copulation time maximize fitness response selection imposed female morphology even variations male dung flies exhibit closetooptimal copulation time relative body size predicted many studies examples presented shown good qualitative support predictions generated marginal value theorem however quantitative studies predictions mvt successful observed values substantially deviating predictions one proposed explanation deviations difficult objectively measure payoff rates example animal unpredictable environment may need spend extra time sampling making hard researchers determine foraging beyond imprecision researchers propose something fundamental missing model namely animals probably foraging whether dealing predation risks searching mating natural selection force influencing evolution species sexual selection example may alter foraging behaviors making less consistent mvt researchers point marginal value theorem starting point complexity nuances must incorporated models tests foraging patchuse one type model used place mvt predicting foraging
