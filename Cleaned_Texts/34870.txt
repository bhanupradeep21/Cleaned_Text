postorbitofrontal would extend dorsally throughout orbit unlike contemporary moanasaurus kaikaifilu bears preorbital constriction despite fact mandible poorly preserved estimates suggest teeth present dentary bones preserved teeth interpreted replacement teeth growing functional tooth unlike tylosaurines heterodont dentition seen kaikaifilu fully developed teeth although different various points
