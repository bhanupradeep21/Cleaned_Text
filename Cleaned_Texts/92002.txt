postmenopausal confusion also commonly referred postmenopausal brain fog group symptoms menopause women report problems cognition higher frequency postmenopause multiple studies cognitive performance following menopause reported noticeable declines greater common issues presented included impairments reaction time attention difficulty recalling numbers words forgetting reasons involvement certain behaviors association subjective cognitive complaints objective measures performance show significant impact healthrelated quality life postmenopausal treatment primarily involves symptom management nonpharmacological treatment strategies includes involvement physical activity following medically supervised diets especially contain phytoestrogens pharmacological interventions treating postmenopausal confusion currently researched hormone replacement therapy hrt currently indicated treatment postmenopausal confusion due use hrt approved indications identified significant negative

cognitive symptoms associated menopausal transition including swan indicated approximately midlife women report problems memory menopause transition yet studies measured cognitive performance transition although many relationships hormone levels postmenopause cognitive function previously favored hrt therapies estrogen therapies shown ineffective specifically treating postmenopausal use hormone replacement therapies considered detrimental cognition postmenopausal women shown negative effect used properly approved conclusive studies support pharmacological agents several potential

plaques aggregates misfolded deleterious proteins many postmenopausal women report insomnia studies shown associations poor sleep quality cognitive decline postmenopausal women insufficient sleep difficulty falling staying asleep reported decreased cognitive performance including verbal memory attention general evidence linking depression cognitive decline postmenopausal women research suggests increased cortisol levels depressive episodes may affect hippocampus area brain responsible episodic memory studies also shown correlation depression decreased cognitive performance including processing speed verbal memory working memory postmenopausal studies indicating correlation frequency hot flashes postmenopausal women deficit verbal memory performance suggested faster blood flow brain higher cortisol levels hot flashes may cause changes brain affect information processing systematic review metaanalysis identified surgical menopause especially performed age substantial risk

tavr found increase risk cognitive decline females found increase incidence brain mechanism postmenopausal confusion poorly understood due simultaneous agingrelated physiological changes well differential diagnoses presenting similar research remains ongoing pharmacological nonpharmacological considerations improving symptoms postmenopausal confusion currently pharmacological agents indicated treat postmenopausal confusion research remains ongoing nonpharmacological strategies manage postmenopausal confusion symptoms utilized focus diet exercise hormone therapy also known estrogen therapy previously common treatment postmenopausal confusion however recent research indicates hormone therapy effective treatment postmenopausal cognitive cochrane review trials concluded body evidence suggests hormone replacement therapy unable prevent cognitive decline maintain cognitive function healthy postmenopausal women given short long period conversely studies also suggested use hormone replacement therapy unlikely negative cognitive effects used approved previous research suggested increases blood flow hippocampus temporal lobe occurred hormone therapy improving postmenopausal confusion recent research longer supports inconclusive true effects estrogen hippocampal volume studies show results differing improved cognition maintained hippocampal volume hormone therapy administered menopause results showing obvious beneficial research focusing adiponectin adpn yielded positive results development possible treatments postmenopausal confusion study shown association higher levels adpn increased cognitive performance postmenopausal women however adpn receptor agonist yet ongoing research regarding efficacy psychostimulant drugs lisdexamphetamine vyvanse atomoxetine strattera treating postmenopausal menopausal individuals play important role maintaining cognitive health one way achieve promotion healthy nutrition particular mediterranean diet defined low saturated fat high vegetable oils showed improvement aspects cognitive function diet consists low intake sweets eggs moderate intakes meat fish dairy products red wine high intake leafy green vegetables pulseslegumes nuts fruits cereal cold pressed extra virgin olive analysis concluded mediterranean diet supplemented olive oil resulted better cognition memory compared mediterranean diet plus mixed nuts soy isoflavones sif type phytoestrogen found soybeans fruits nuts shown improve cognitive outcomes recent postmenopausal women less years suggests initiation sif may critical margin opportunity used younger age postmenopausal women addition improved cognitive functions visual memory evidence harm sif supplementation revealed dose ranges tested multiple analysis multiple randomized controlled trials brought attention black cohosh red clover contain phytoestrogen potential efficacious treatment menopausal symptoms black cohosh reveal evidence risk harm lack good evidence firmly conclude overall results suggested neither botanical treatments provided cognitive resveratrol another bioactive compound derived plants also shown improve cognitive performance postmenopausal women ongoing trials studying cognitive benefits resveratrol early versus late postmenopausal chronic ginkgo biloba supplementation shown improve mental flexibility older cognitively impaired postmenopausal women however combined ginkgo biloba ginger supplementation effect memory cognitive performance postmenopausal dehydroepiandrosterone dhea supplementation may improve cognition women postmenopausal confusion benefit without cognitive longterm studies required study efficacy dhea role cognition postmenopausal regular physical exercise may prevent symptoms postmenopausal
