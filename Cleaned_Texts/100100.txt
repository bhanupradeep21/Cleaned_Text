vermilacinia genus lichenized fungi family yellowgreen fruticose type lichen species grow rocks trees soil within fog zone along pacific coast north america south genus name refers thallus divided narrow wormlike vermis branches laciniathe latter part name lacinia generally applied descriptions taxonomic keys exemplified key sonoran desert species species vermilacinia classified two subgenera subgenus cylindricaria subgenus vermilacinia subgenus cylindricaria includes species type vermilacinia corrugata spjut grow mostly shrubs distinguished thin membranous pliable cortex outer skinlike layer composed gelatinized hyphal cells expands thallus imbibes moisture usually fog shrinks upon drying fog dissipates subgenus vermilacinia includes species type genus vermilacinia combeoides nyl spjut hale grow rocks saxicolous soil terricolous distinguished relatively thick crusty cortex like dry pie crust overlying medulla rigid lattice firmer cortex subgenus vermilacinia undoubtedly adds support thallus allows branches grow upright substrate niebla ramalina related genera distinguished hyphae forming multiple longitudinal gelatinized cords chondroid stands within medulla many species ramalina form network interconnected lower cortex medulla contrast uniform lattice single central cord vermilacinia also niebla vermilacinia included ramalina distinguished pale pycnidia presence
