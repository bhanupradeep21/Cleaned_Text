widely used human factors ergonomics field rohmerts law states maximum force ones muscles exert decreases exponentially time one begins continuously exerting force commonly used calculate maximum holding time particular task maximum force decays exponentially due amount energy form oxygen atp body able supply muscles circulatory systems keeps muscles flooded nutrients times muscles supply fuelready burn given moment task requiring maximum force burns large amount nutrients onset task circulatory system unable replenish nutrients rate fast enough maintain maximum force long result maximum force muscle capable producing limited bottleneck nutrient availability decreases exponentially imagine theoretical arm wrestling match two perfectly matched opponents exactly strong begin match exerting maximum force others hands soon arms get fatigued actual force exerted others hands drops quickly still exerting much force muscles burning energy faster replenished maximum force decreasing exponentially eventually arms completely fatigued basically holding hands applying little force muscles muster wondering give rohmerts law suggests example static gripping loads load required squeezeoperated rohmerts law applies maximum force inverse true well less force one asked exert longer one able exert force muscles become fatigued one asked exert zero force theoretically hold position indefinitely rohmerts law true across humans everyone different initial maximum force apply maximum force decrease according exponential curve everyone else muscle article stub help wikipedia expanding
