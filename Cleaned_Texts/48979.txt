humans primary forest well forests recovering human logging efforts secondary primary distinction rednecked graynecked night monkeys spatial distribution graynecked night monkeys aotus lemurinus group found north amazon river rednecked group aotus azare group localized south amazon rednecked night monkeys found throughout various regions amazon rainforest south america variation occurring four species nancy mas night monkey occurs flooded unflooded tropical rainforest regions peru preferring moist swamp mountainous species observed nesting regions recently introduced colombia likely result postresearch release blackheaded night monkey also found mainly peruvian amazon central upper amazon however range extends throughout brazil base andes mountain night monkeys like blackheaded night monkey generally inhabit cloud forests areas consistent presence low clouds high mist moisture content allows lush rich vegetation grow year round providing excellent food lodging sources peruvian night monkey like nancy mas night monkey endemic peruvian andes however found higher elevation approximately metres ft sea level therefore exploits different niches distribution azare extends towards atlantic ocean spanning argentina bolivia drier south western regions however unlike rednecked night monkey species endemic brazil daylight hours night monkeys rest shaded tree areas species observed exploiting four different types tree nests monkeys rest holes formed trunks trees concave sections branches surrounded creepers epiphytes dense areas epiphyte climber vine growth areas dense sleeping sites provide protection environmental stressors heavy rain sunlight heat sleeping sites therefore carefully chosen based upon tree age density trees availability space group ability site provide protection ease access site availability site respect daily night monkeys arboreal species nests observed higher strata rainforest ecosystem rather higher density nests recorded lowmid vegetation night monkeys represent territorial species territories defended conspecifics use threatening agonistic ranges night monkey species often overlap result interspecific aggressions vocalizing chasing may last night monkeys primarily frugivorous fruit eating species fruits easily distinguished use olfactory leaf insect consumption also observed cathemeral night monkey species study conducted wolovich et al indicated juveniles females much better catching crawling flying insects adult general technique used night monkeys insect capturing use palm hand flatten prey insect tree branch proceed consume winter months food sources reduced night monkeys also observed foraging flowers tabebuia heptaphylla however represent primary food night monkeys mating occurs infrequently however females fertile yearround reproductive cycles range gestation period night monkey approximately days varies species species birthing season extends september march speciesdependent one offspring produced per year however studies conducted captivity twins night monkeys reach puberty relatively young age months species attain full sexual maturity age years age azare represents exception reaching sexual maturity age name night monkey comes fact species active night fact truly nocturnal monkeys exception subspecies azaras night monkey aotus azarae azarae night monkeys make notably wide variety vocal sounds eight categories distinct calls gruff grunts resonant grunts sneeze grunts screams low trills moans gulps hoots frequency range unusual among new world monkeys monochromats colour vision presumably advantage given nocturnal habits better spatial resolution low light levels primates contributes ability capture insects move night monkeys live family groups consisting mated pair immature offspring family groups defend territories vocal calls scent marking night monkey socially monogamous night monkeys form pair bonds one infant born year male primary caregiver mother carries infant first week life believed developed increases survival infant reduces metabolic costs female adults occasionally evicted group samesex individuals either kin family aotidae family nocturnal species within suborder anthropoidea order primates divided prosimians many nocturnal anthropoids possess nocturnal species therefore highly likely ancestors family aotidae exhibit nocturnality rather diurnal presence nocturnal behavior aotidae therefore exemplifies derived trait evolutionary adaptation conferred greater fitness advantages onto night night monkey share similarities nocturnal prosimians including low basal metabolic rate small body size good ability detect visual cues low light responses olfactory stimulus intermediate prosimians diurnal primate species however ability use auditory cues remains similar diurnal primate species nocturnal primate provides evidence support hypothesis nocturnality derived trait family aotidae ancestor aotidae likely diurnal selective environmental pressures must exerted members family subsequently resulted alteration circadian rhythm adapt fill empty active night rather day time gave aotus access better food sources provided protection predators reduced interspecific competition provided escape harsh environmental conditions begin resting day allows decreased interaction diurnal predators members family aotidae apply predation avoidance theory choosing strategic covered nests sites primates carefully choose areas sufficient foliage vines provide cover sun camouflage predators simultaneously allow visibility ground predators permit effective routes escape predator approach activity night also permits night monkeys avoid aggressive interactions species competing food territorial disputes active species inactive night monkeys also benefit nocturnal life style activity night provides degree protection heat day thermoregulation difficulties although night monkey like primates endothermic meaning able produce heat night monkeys undergo behavioural thermoregulation order minimize energy hottest points day night monkeys resting therefore expending less energy form heat carefully construct nests night monkeys also benefit shade provided forest canopy enables cool bodies act displacing shady additionally finding food energetically costly completing process day time usually involves usage energy form calories lipid reserves cool body foraging night cooler less competition supports optimal foraging theory maximize energy input minimizing energy protection predators interspecific interactions harsh environment propose ultimate causes nocturnal behavior increase species fitness proximate causes nocturnality linked environmental effects circadian diurnal species stimulated appearance sun nocturnal species activity highly impacted degree moon light available presence new moon correlated inhibition activity night monkeys exhibit lower levels activity decreasing levels moon therefore lunar cycle significant influence foraging nocturnal behaviors night monkey night monkeys socially form bond mate one partner live small groups consisting pair reproductive adults one infant one two species exhibit mate guarding practice male individual protect female bonded prevent conspecifics attempting mate mate guarding likely evolved means reducing energy expenditure mating night monkey territories generally edge overlap large number individuals coexisting one area may make difficult male defend many females due high levels interspecific competition night monkeys form bonded pairs energy expenditure protecting mate pair bonding may also exhibited result food distribution forest pockets food dense patchy scarce females need energy stores support reproduction generally distributed areas sufficient food males therefore also distribute within proximity females form food distribution lends social monogamy finding females may become difficult males constantly search females may widely distributed depending food availability however explain social monogamy explain high degree paternal care exhibited primates birth infant males primary carrier infant carrying offspring addition aiding child care males support females lactation sharing foraged food lactating generally food sharing observed nature search food requires great degree energy expenditure case night monkey males food sharing confers offspring survival advantages lactating females may weak forage may lose ability nurse child food sharing therefore ensures offspring well act food sharing observed among species high degree fidelity paternity giving valuable food sources would confer evolutionary advance unless increased individuals fitness case paternal care ensures success offspring therefore increases fathers recent studies proposed night monkeys rely olfaction olfactory cues foraging communication significantly diurnal primate trend reflected species physiology members aotidae possess larger scent perception organs diurnal counterparts olfactory bulb accessory olfactory bulb volume lateral olfactory tract larger aotus new world monkey therefore likely increased olfaction capacities improved fitness nocturnal primate species produced offspring passed survival enhancing benefits increased olfaction night monkeys twofold increased ability use scent cues facilitated night time foraging also important factor mate selection sexual substantial portion night monkeys activities occurring dark hours night much lower reliance visual tactile cues foraging night members family aotidae smell fruits leaves ingesting determine quality safety food source highly frugivorous perceive colour well smell becomes primary determinant ripeness fruits therefore important component optimal foraging methods upon finding rich food source night monkeys observed scent marking food source route sleeping site food source well scent therefore used effective method navigation reduce energy expenditure subsequent foraging night monkeys possess several scent glands covered greasy hair patches secrete pheromones transferred onto vegetation conspecifics scent glands often located subcaudal also occur near muzzle process scent marking accomplished rubbing hairs covering scent glands onto desired marked item olfactory cues also significant importance process mating mate guarding male night monkeys rub subcaudal glands onto female partner process called partner marking order relay signal coexisting males female available night monkeys also send chemical signals urine communicate reproductive receptivity many cases male night monkeys observed drinking urine female mate proposed pheromones urine indicate reproductive state female indicate especially important night monkeys rely visual cues presence tumescence determine female reproductive therefore olfactory communication night monkeys result sexual selection sexually dimorphic trait conferring increased reproductive success trait demonstrates sexual dimorphism males larger subcaudal scent glands compared female counterparts sex differences recorded glandular secretions preference scents particular type indicate reproductive receptivity increases species fitness facilitating production according iucn international union conservation nature peruvian night monkey classified endangered species four species vulnerable four
