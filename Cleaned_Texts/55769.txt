animal model short animal disease model living nonhuman often geneticengineered animal used research investigation human disease purpose better understanding disease process without risk harming human although biological activity animal model ensure effect humans many drugs treatments cures human diseases developed part guidance animal animal models representing specific taxonomic groups research study developmental processes also referred model three main types animal models homologous isomorphic predictive homologous animals causes symptoms treatment options would humans disease isomorphic animals share symptoms treatments predictive models similar particular human disease couple aspects however useful isolating making predictions mechanisms set disease although scientific study animals predates charles darwin several hundred years primary justification use animals research based evolutionary principle organisms share degree relatedness genetic similarity due common ancestry study taxonomic human relatives provide great deal information mechanism disease within human body useful medicinecitation needed various phylogenetic trees vertebrates constructed using comparative proteomics genetics genomics well geochemical fossil estimations tell us humans chimpanzees last shared common ancestor million years ago mya closest relatives chimpanzees lot potential tell us mechanisms disease genes may responsible human intelligence however chimpanzees rarely used research protected highly invasive procedures common animal model rodent phylogenic trees estimate humans rodents last shared common ancestor despite distant split humans rodents far similarities differences due relative stability large portions genome making use vertebrate animals particularly productivecitation needed recently genomic data added techniques make close comparisons species determine relatedness humans share genome much genome conserved across species relatively impressive differences humans mice accounted approximately six thousand genes total scientists able take advantage similarities generating experimental predictive models human diseasecitation needed animal models serving research may existing inbred induced disease injury similar human condition test conditions often termed animal models disease use animal models allows researchers investigate disease states ways would inaccessible human patient performing procedures nonhuman animal imply level harm would considered ethical inflict human noted introduction animal models classified homologous isomorphic predictive animal models also broadly classified four categories experimental spontaneous negative experimental models common refer models disease resemble human conditions phenotype response treatment induced artificially laboratory examples include spontaneous models refer diseases analogous human conditions occur naturally animal studied models rare informative negative models essentially refer control animals useful validating experimental result orphan models refer diseases human analog occur exclusively species studied increase knowledge genomes nonhuman primates mammals genetically close humans allowing production genetically engineered animal tissues organs even animal species express human diseases providing robust model human diseases animal model best models disease similar etiology mechanism cause phenotype signs symptoms human equivalent however complex human diseases often better understood simplified system individual parts disease process isolated examined instance behavioral analogues anxiety pain laboratory animals used screen test new drugs treatment conditions humans study found animal models concorded coincided true positives false negatives human toxicity cases nonrodents alone rodents davidson et al suggested selection animal model research based nine considerations include appropriateness analog transferability information genetic uniformity organisms applicable background knowledge biological properties cost availability generalizability results ease adaptability experimental manipulation ecological consequences ethical animal models observed sciences psychology sociology often termed animal models behavior difficult build animal model perfectly reproduces symptoms depression patients animals lack selfconsciousness selfreflection considerationcitation needed moreover hallmarks disorder depressed mood low selfesteem suicidality hardly accessible nonhumanscitation needed however depression mental disorders consists endophenotypes reproduced independently evaluated animals ideal animal model offers opportunity understand molecular genetic epigenetic factors may lead depression using animal models underlying molecular alterations causal relationship genetic environmental alterations depression examined would afford better insight pathology depression addition animal models depression indispensable identifying novel therapies depressioncitation needed many animal models serving test subjects biomedical research rats mice may selectively sedentary obese glucose intolerant may confound use model human metabolic processes diseases affected dietary energy intake animal models psychiatric illness give rise concerns qualitative assessments behavior often subjective would lead investigator observe want observe subjects render conclusions line expectations also imprecise diagnostic criteria psychiatric illnesses inevitably lead problems modeling condition eg since person major depressive disorder may experience weight loss weight gain insomnia hypersomnia certainty say rat insomnia weight loss depressed furthermore complex nature psychiatric conditions makes difficultimpossible translate human behaviors deficits eg language deficit plays major role autistic spectrum disorders since rodents language possible develop languageimpaired autistic mousecitation needed debate ethical use animals research dates least far back british parliament enacted first law animal protection preventing cruelty cattle see text followed cruelty animals act criminalized

possible order minimize suffering animal subjectcitation needed significant advances made care treatment animals everevolving debate animal rights protection groups aspca peta buav continue advocate best laboratory conditions experimental protocols possible animals research pressure groups also led novel modes experimentation involve sacrifice live animalscitation needed one aspect debate however continues difficult resolve classification animals according hierarchy protects species others next humans primates protected species experimentation rationale evolutionary philosophical underpinnings chimpanzees nonhuman primates demonstrate intelligence social structure life experiences cognitively complex lower species conversely kind moralizing complexity interaction thought could considered specieisism ultimately argument likely resolved however people comfortable idea experimentation involves worms flies mice dogs monkeyscitation needed ethical concerns well cost maintenance relative inefficiency animal research encouraged development alternative methods study disease cell culture vitro studies provide alternative preserves physiology living cell require sacrifice animal
