antigen presentation part adaptive immune system different copy genes able bind present different set potential peptides tlymphocytes genes highly polymorphic throughout populations similar smaller closely related populations breeding genetically distant individuals decreases chance inheriting two alleles similar allowing diverse range peptides presented therefore gives decreased chance particular pathogen recognised means antigenic proteins pathogen likely recognised giving greater range tcell activation greater response also means immunity acquired pathogen greater range antigens meaning pathogen must mutate immunity lost thus hybrids less likely succumb pathogenic disease capable fighting infection may cause though autoimmune diseasescitation needed crosses inbreds different
