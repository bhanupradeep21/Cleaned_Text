scotoma area partial alteration field vision consisting partially diminished entirely degenerated visual acuity surrounded field normal relatively wellpreserved vision every normal mammalian eye scotoma field vision usually termed blind spot location photoreceptor cells retinal ganglion cell axons compose optic nerve exit retina location called optic disc direct conscious awareness visual scotomas simply regions reduced information within visual field rather recognizing incomplete image patients scotomas report things disappear presence blind spot scotoma demonstrated subjectively covering one eye carefully holding fixation open eye placing object ones thumb lateral horizontal visual field degrees fixation see blind spot article size monocular scotoma degrees visual angle scotoma symptom damage part visual system retinal damage exposure highpowered lasers macular degeneration brain damage term scotoma also used metaphorically several fields common theme figurative senses gap visual function minds perception cognition world view term greek σκότοςskótos darkness symptomproducing pathological scotomata may due wide range disease processes affecting part visual system including retina particular sensitive portion macula optic nerve even visual pathological scotoma may involve part visual field may shape size scotoma may include enlarge normal blind spot even small scotoma happens affect central macular vision produce severe visual disability whereas large scotoma peripheral part visual field may go unnoticed bearer normal reduced optical resolution peripheral visual field common causes scotomas include demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis retrobulbar neuritis damage nerve fiber layer retina seen cotton wool due hypertension toxic substances methyl alcohol ethambutol quinine nutritional deficiencies vascular blockages either retina optic nerve stroke brain injury macular degeneration often associated aging scintillating scotoma common visual aura less common important sometimes reversible curable surgery scotomata due tumors arising pituitary gland may compress optic nerve interfere blood supply rarely scotomata bilateral one important variety bilateral scotoma may occur pituitary tumour begins compress optic chiasm distinct single optic nerve produces bitemporal paracentral scotoma later tumor enlarges scotomas extend
