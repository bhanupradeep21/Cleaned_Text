pneumococcal types serological typing frederick griffiths studies bacteriologists believed types fixed unchangeable one generation griffiths experiment reported identified transforming principle pneumococcal bacteria could transform one type another griffith british medical officer spent years applying serological typing cases pneumonia frequently fatal disease early century found multiple

base adenine undetected protein contamination hotchkisss experimental findings experiment quickly confirmed extended hereditary characteristics besides polysaccharide capsules however considerable reluctance accept conclusion dna genetic material according phoebus levenes influential tetranucleotide hypothesis dna consisted repeating units four nucleotide bases little biological specificity dna therefore thought structural component chromosomes whereas genes thought likely made protein component line thinking reinforced crystallization tobacco mosaic virus wendell parallels among viruses
