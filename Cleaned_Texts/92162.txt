separate streams different locations heart reported occur coandă human physiology atria facilitate circulation primarily allowing uninterrupted venous flow heart ventricular partially empty distensible atria prevent interruption venous flow heart would occur ventricular systole veins ended inlet valves heart normal physiologic states output heart pulsatile venous inflow heart continuous nonpulsatile without functioning atria venous flow becomes pulsatile overall circulation rate decreases atria four essential characteristics cause promote continuous venous flow atrial inlet valves interrupt blood flow atrial systole atrial systole contractions incomplete thus contract extent would block flow veins atria ventricles atrial systole blood empties atria ventricles blood continues flow uninterrupted veins right atria ventricles atrial contractions must gentle enough force contraction exert significant back pressure would impede venous flow let go atria must timed relax start ventricular contraction able accept venous flow without preventing inertia interrupted venous flow would otherwise occur ventricular systole atria allow approximately cardiac output would otherwise occur fact atrial contraction amount succeeding ventricular ejection led misplaced emphasis role pumping ventricles socalled atrial kick whereas key benefit atria preventing circulatory inertia allowing uninterrupted venous flow also importance maintaining blood flow presence atrial volume receptors lowpressure baroreceptors atria send signals hypothalamus drop atrial pressure indicates drop blood volume detected triggers release adult atrial septal defect results flow blood reverse direction left atrium right reduces cardiac output potentially causing cardiac failure severe untreated
