demetonsmethyl organic compound molecular formula used organothiophosphate acaricide organothiophosphate insecticide flammable prolonged storage demetonsmethyl becomes toxic due formation sulfonium derivative greater affinity human form acetylcholinesterase enzyme may present hazard agricultural demetonsmethyl first described schrader widely adopted pesticide lower toxicity humans previously used beginning days mostly used together demetonomethyl os ratio onward pure demetonsmethyl high toxicity severe toxic effects humans demetonsmethyl classified highly toxic substance world health organization banned agricultural use demetonsmethyl compound closely related vx terms structure structure demetonsmethyl molecular weight appears colourless slightly yellow coloured oily liquid garlic like density makes slightly heavier water melting points boiling points although compound decomposes reaching boiling point relatively low mmhg means demetonsmethyl vaporize slowly mostly stay liquid demetonsmethyl less stable predecessor demeton used instead lower toxicity humans demetonsmethyl hydrolyzed quickly alkaline demetonsmethyl readily soluble water organic compounds three ways synthesizing demetonsmethyl made reaction thiodiglycol dimethyl sulfur dimethyl thiophosphate attacks one oxygens thiodiglycol one oxygens dimethyl thiophosphate turn forms double bond phosphate losing hydrogen forms water hydroxyl side thiodiglycol second synthesis route alkylation dimethyl dithiophosphoric acid third way reaction similar thiodiglycol minus one hydroxyl groups oodimethyl phosphochlorothioate happens alcohol chlorination hydrolysis dehydrochlorination demetonsmethyl still available solution however use banned countries severe toxicity demetonsmethyl inhibits cholinesterase takes care breakdown acetylcholine ache presence demetonsmethyl accumulation ache occurs result impeded lead impaired muscle function even suffocation resulting animal experiments show almost demetonsmethyl derivatives excreted urine demetonsmethyl converted demetonsmethyl sulfoxide oxygen group added sulfur side chain sulfoxide metabolised adding another oxygen group creating demetonsmethyl sulfone another pathway metabolise demetonsmethyl demethylate oxygen groups demeton demethylated form occur sulfoxide sulfone form lastly deesterification omethylphosphoric ester group occur followed methylation sulfoxidation lead formation methyl sulfinyl ethane methyl sulfonyl demetonsmethyl organic phosphorus compound used effective insecticide acaricide agriculture mainly plantsucking arthropod applied control aphids mites whiteflies fruit vegetables potatoes beet demetonsmethyl absorbed distributed within plant allowing concentrations reach high enough levels kill insects feed plant sucking juices agriculture methyl demeton used mixture oisomer sisomer approximate ratio however sisomer found toxic insects purified sisomer form introduced availability rose
