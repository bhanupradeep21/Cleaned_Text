neurocircuitry underlies executive function processes emotional motivational processes known distinct brain however brain regions show overlap function two cognitive systems brain regions exist systems interesting mainly studies one system affects examples crossmodal functions emotional regulation strategies emotional emotional effect mood cognitive effect emotional stimulation cognitive variety methods used examine relationship executive function emotion including behavioural studies functional brain activity neuroanatomy prominent results listed large body research looked effects positive negative mood manipulations performance tasks executive function cases positive mood inductions impair executive function whereas negative mood little effect overall best supported explanation observed effects mood affects processing style positive mood facilitating heuristic methods solving problems negative mood facilitating algorithmic methods research area incomplete negative mood inductions less thoroughly word span tasks positive mood caused greater deficits complex tasks compared simpler tasks negative mood effect tower london planning task positive mood caused poorer planning performance compared neutral mood researchers cases suggested lack effect could explained insufficient mood manipulation word fluency tasks one study shown positive mood results better fluency negative mood another shown negative mood results higher word production third study find effect either mood manipulation however evidence positive mood result increased performance tasks requiring creative thinking evidence negative mood creative thinking stroop task near significant trend found stroop costs positive mood conditions two tasks switching found positive mood results impaired switching compared neutral condition little evidence found effect negative taken together positive mood impairs tasks working memory planning word production inhibition switching facilitates word fluency negative mood impairs fluency facilitates planning tasks word production shown effect tasks working memory creativity inhibition switching results incomplete would consistent
