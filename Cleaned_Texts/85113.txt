challenge cholesteatoma surgery permanently remove cholesteatoma whilst retaining reconstructing normal functions structures housed within temporal bone general objective cholesteatoma surgery two parts directed underlying pathology directed towards maintaining normal functions temporal bone aims conflicting makes cholesteatoma surgery extremely challenging sometimes situation results clash surgical aims need fully remove progressive disease like cholesteatoma surgeons first priority preservation hearing secondary primary aim disease removed easily increased risk residual disease ossicles may preserved disease difficult remove increased risk residual disease removal involved ossicles order fully clear cholesteatoma generally regarded necessary reasonable words aims cholesteatoma treatment form hierarchy paramount objective complete removal cholesteatoma remaining objectives hearing preservation subordinate need complete removal cholesteatoma hierarchy aims led development wide range strategies treatment cholesteatoma variation technique cholesteatoma surgery results surgeons judgment whether retain remove certain structures housed within temporal bone order facilitate removal cholesteatoma typically involves form mastoidectomy may may involve removing posterior ear canal wall ossicles removal canal wall facilitates complete clearance cholesteatoma temporal bone three ways thus removal canal wall provides one effective strategies achieving primary aim cholesteatoma surgery complete removal cholesteatoma however tradeoff since functional impact canal wall removal also important removal ear canal wall results formation mastoid cavity removal canal wall simplest effective procedure facilitating removal cholesteatoma may bestow lasting infirmity due loss ear function upon patient treated way following strategies employed mitigate effects canal wall removal clearly preservation restoration ear function time total removal cholesteatoma requires high level surgical expertise traditionally ear surgery performed using surgical microscope direct line view dictated approach necessitates using mastoid access port middle ear long recognized failure cholesteatoma surgery occurs view spaces tympanic cavity like sinus tympani facial recess view using traditional microscopic recently endoscope increasingly utilized surgical management cholesteatoma one two ways multiple advantages use endoscope cholesteatoma surgery important patient attend periodic followup checks even careful microscopic surgical removal cholesteatomas may recur recurrence may arise many years even decades treatment residual cholesteatoma may develop initial surgery failed completely remove original residual cholesteatomas typically become evident within first years initial surgery recurrent cholesteatoma new cholesteatoma develops underlying causes initial cholesteatoma still present causes include example poor eustachian tube function results
