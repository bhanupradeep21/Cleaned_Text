model linear transmission model communication also referred model smcr model berlos model first published david berlo book process communication contains detailed discussion four main components communication source message channel receiver source receiver usually distinct persons also groups cases entity acts source receiver berlo discusses verbal nonverbal communication sees forms communication attempts source influence behavior receiver source tries achieve formulating communicative intention encoding form message message sent receiver using channel decoded understand react efficiency fidelity communication defined degree reaction receiver matches purpose motivating source four main components several key attributes source receiver share four attributes communication skills attitudes knowledge socialcultural system communication skills determine good communicators encoding decoding messages attitudes affect whether like dislike topic knowledge includes well understand topic socialcultural system encompasses social cultural background attributes message code content treatment well elements structure code sign system like language content information expressed message treatment consists sources choices level code content formulating message attributes analyzed based elements uses based combined form structure remaining main component channel medium process message transmitted berlo discusses primarily terms five senses used decode messages seeing hearing touching smelling tasting depending message channels useful others often advantageous use several channels simultaneously smcr model applied various fields mass communication communication workplace psychology also influenced many subsequent communication theorists criticized oversimplifying communication example linear transmission model include discussion feedback loops found many later models another common objection smcr model fails take noise barriers communication seriously simply assumes communication attempts successful david berlo published smcr model communication book process theorists also refer exact formulation usually attributed models similar components already proposed earlier model schramms model reason term smcr model sometimes used refer models according berlo communication based things source receiver understands communication wide sense includes nonverbal communication like body language use color advertisements besides verbal communication spoken written form widest sense anything people attach meanings may used berlo sees communication dynamic process consist fixed sequence events clearly defined beginning middle end acknowledges structure language makes necessary describe communication linear berlo holds goal forms communication influence behavior regard rejects idea goals like informing receiver entertaining equally important argues distinctions exclusive means even attempts inform case regular education entertain case entertainment programs television attempts influence behavior audience berlo gives biological argument position holding basic purpose alter relationship organism berlo communication one way achieve relation people part environment communicate reason understanding communication involves understanding sources goal ie reaction intend provoke audience however source may always conscious reasons communicating example writer may believe purpose write technical report rather influence behavior reader likewise teacher may think purpose cover syllabus rather affect behavior students similar purpose many ingrained habits communicational otherwise affect environment even though agent often aware performing berlo acknowledges cases understands forms misperception usually source specific person mind wish affect intrapersonal communication special case source receiver cases source tries influence like poet writes poetry secret order emotionally affect however common goal influence others intended effect immediate delayed artist trying entertain audience intends immediate effect employer giving instructions rest week intends delayed effect employees behavior messages also produce unintended outcomes intended receiver react source anticipated message reaches unintended berlos model influenced earlier models like model schramms influences include models developed theodore newcomb bruce westley malcolm maclean model published one earliest influential models communication explains communication terms five basic components source transmitter channel receiver destination source produces message send message translated signal transmitter transmit signal channel required stage noise may interfere signal distort signal reaches receiver translated back message made available destination making landline phone call person calling source telephone transmitter wire channel person receiving phone call destination telephone berlo made slight adjustments many basic components model include schramms model communication another significant influence berlos model first published wilbur schramm schramm communication starts idea mind source idea encoded message sent receiver receiver decode interpret message reproduce original concept fields experience plays central role regard influential berlo field experience person mental frame reference includes past life experiences well attitudes values beliefs communication possible message located within fields experience message outside receivers field experience reconstruct senders idea happen big cultural similar ideas expressed smcr model discussion attitudes knowledge socialcultural system participants shape smcr model usually described linear transmission model main focus identify basic parts communication show characteristics shape communicative process regard berlo understands model model ingredients identifies four basic components source message channel source party wants communicate idea encode idea form message message contains information transmitted channel means used send message receiver audience message intended decode understand despite emphasis four basic components berlo initially identifies total six components two additional components encoder encoder responsible translating idea message decoder responsible translating message back berlo holds six components necessary account communication general sense however model simplified four components regular persontoperson communication case source encoder grouped together one entity like decoder receiver regard berlo speaks sourceencoder decoderreceiver treating additional components separately especially relevant technical forms communication example case telephone conversation message transmitted electrical signal telephone devices act encoder four main components characterized parts influence communicative berlos main interest discussing study conditions fidelity communication berlo every communication motivated goal source intends achieve fidelity means source gets want fidelity also called effectiveness opposite source receiver usually individual persons employee reporting progress employer groups people also take roles two nations enter trade communication usually happens distinct entities intrapersonal communication exception person acts source berlo discusses several aspects sender receiver affect communication organizes four categories communication skills attitudes knowledge socialcultural theorists identify five features talking social system culture two separate characteristics apply source receiver play different roles communication takes place meaning attached message depends generally speaking factors source receiver match likely communication berlo communication skill wide term includes encoding skills decoding skills thinking skills skills important communication succeed differ communicator communicator also situation verbal communication berlo discusses encoding skills writing speaking well decoding skills reading listening also many nonverbal communication skills like encoding skills drawing berlo sees thought reasoning additional communication skill relevant encoding communication skills required successful communication different source receiver source includes ability express oneself encode message accessible communication starts specific purpose encoding skills necessary express purpose form message good encoding skills ensure purpose expressed clearly makes decoding receiver much relevant communication skills receiver include able decode message correctly listening reading skills receivers communication skills limited may able understand expressions used source thus follow train attitude positive negative stance communicators take toward topic communication relevant berlo defines attitude predisposition tendency desire either approach avoid discusses three types attitudes attitude communicators toward subject matter various aspects someones personality belong attitude toward oneself like selfconfidence communication tends successful source positive attitude toward attitude source toward receiver concerns whether source likes dislikes receiver includes aspects past relation attitudes central factor fidelity communication negative attitudes toward make communication adversarial would otherwise example source like receiver may formulate request rude manner receiver like source may reject otherwise reasonable proposal attitude toward subject matter concerns communicators think topic example salesperson convinced product high quality positive attitude toward product attitude significant impact success salesperson talking product prospective factor communication knowledge understanding familiarity communicators subject matter know without knowledge one communicate communication ineffective communicators understanding severely source knowledge audience matters making message interesting understandable source knows much receiver always danger encoding message overly technical vocabulary result understandable poorly informed receiver since may unable decode message example good teacher one needs indepth knowledge subject time able explain someone little another aspect knowledge communication taking place situation might influence berlo uses term socialcultural system talk agents position society culture contrasts factors communication skills attitudes knowledge since mental factor depends person also wider relations includes background beliefs values common culture ideas kinds behavior unacceptable within culture aspects also determined persons position within society like social class groups belong specific socialcultural system affects purpose one communicates receiver channel one chooses kind content one transmits words one selects express content factors influence communicators behave guidelines follow discussed contents encoded decoded example difference one talks superiors peers communication styles people distinct socialcultural backgrounds differ lot example americans indonesians japanese germans may differ content talk express cases big social cultural differences source receiver effective communication often severely berlo understands message physical product source like speech written letter painting holds message three main factors code content treatment factors analyzed two perspectives based elements use based structure elements connected elements message signs symbols used newspaper article elements letters words contains structure message concerns way elements arranged many interpreters talk five main features counting elements structure separate berlo distinguishes message meaning communication transmission messages meaning hand personal participant relevant stages en decoding meaning associate message depends various factors including past life experiences communication skills knowledge culture reason may associate different meanings message example source might think meaning message utmost importance receiver may dismiss trivial one subelements message communication theory code sign system express information system rules convert information one form berlo defines code group symbols structured way meaningful person code consists two parts set elements vocabulary set rules combining example languages like english mandarin chinese swahili codes within language possible distinguish specialized codes like technical vocabulary used physicists neurologists also nonlinguistic codes like ones involved music dance visual art every message expressed form code choice appropriate code central ensuring receiver understand message intended effect spoken language basic elements sounds grouped together form phonemes morphemes written english basic elements letters like letters f h letters combined form group structure groups correspond words like fish others like hsif words formed arranging letters right content message selected source express communicative purpose elements content single assertions contents structure assertions arranged ie order presented content information expressed message code way expressed content often expressed different forms example translating one code another source responsible selecting appropriate content communicate audience depends communicative purpose source content useful source presented many choices formulating message concern elements structure code content include choosing code use information express express treatment corresponds source decides cases reflects style source communicator affects whether chosen content code appropriate situation receiver channel example part job newspaper editor determine treatment article deciding express ideas arrange sentences make sure easily understandable intended audience case cinema movie director similar task deciding translate screenplay berlo term channel wide meaning refers vehicle idea carrier vehicle also includes processes transfer idea vehicle back idea berlo explains channel analogy getting one shore river boat vehicle water vehicle carrier additionally docks needed sides enter leave boat case oral communication docks mechanisms speaking hearing soundwave vehicle corresponding boat air vehicle carrier corresponding water berlo identifies term channel components puts main emphasis vehicle vehicle takes form discussion sensory processes involved communication correspond five senses used decode messages seeing hearing touching smelling transmission restricted one channel may use several channels simultaneously example speaker may use hands give visual clues audience tends increase effectiveness communication promoting receivers understanding choice right channel affects successful communication example classroom teacher decide contents present orally talking ones present visually books choice also depends receiver whose decoding skills may better channels smcr model influenced development later models often form extensions marshall mcluhan extended smcr model including interpretation one steps gerhard maletzke applied smcr model mass communication book psychology mass communication sees communication form persuasion discusses factors influencing behavior communicators outcome communication like image source receiver another application focuses human behavior intrapersonal communication context organizations management used example analyze employee behavior identify resolve human resource similar application uses smcr model analyze humorous messages bette ann stead applies berlos model content theories motivation like ones abraham maslow frederick herzberg according maslows hierarchy needs lower higher needs source motivation frederick herzberg contrasts intrinsic extrinsic motivation intrinsic motivation activity desired enjoyable extrinsic motivation hand aims external communication fail source address needs receiver right level example employer may try motivate employees encoding message terms lowerlevel needs attempt may fail employees decode message higherlevel needs similar form miscommunication happen source encodes message terms intrinsic motivation receiver decodes terms extrinsic various criticisms smcr model formulated many focus idea simple effective purposes complex enough account forms berlo also acknowledged problem retrospect argued smcr model intended comprehensive model communication may better understood audiovisual tool recall main elements lot criticism smcr model focuses description communication oneway flow information starts source ends receiver regard model lacks feedback may sufficient types communication many situations communication dynamic process messages going back forth participants berlo mitigates criticism claiming simplified presentation implying linear nature used mainly convenience time holds real communication linear process consisting fixed sequence another common objection berlo assumes effective communication take place regard simply presupposed source receiver sufficiently similar level communication skills attitudes knowledge socialcultural system communication means smcr model fails properly address effects noise barriers may inhibit transmission message distort along hal taylor criticizes berlos model holding put enough emphasis purposive nature human communication criticism based idea source usually intends achieve purpose engaging communication like persuading audience getting perform certain action berlo acknowledges role purpose guiding communication model include separate component corresponding
