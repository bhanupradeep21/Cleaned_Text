biological bet hedging occurs organisms suffer decreased fitness typical conditions exchange increased fitness stressful conditions biological bet hedging originally proposed explain observation seed bank reservoir ungerminated seeds example annual plants fitness maximized year seeds germinate however drought occurs kills germinated plants ungerminated seeds plants seeds remaining seed bank fitness advantage therefore advantageous plants hedge bets case drought producing seeds germinate immediately seeds lie dormant examples biological bet hedging include female multiple foraging behavior bumble nutrient storage bacterial persistence presence three categories strategies bethedging conservative bethedging diversified bethedging adaptive coin flipping conservative bet hedging individuals lower expected fitness exchange lower variance fitness idea strategy organism always play safe using successful lowrisk strategy regardless environmental example would organism producing clutches constant egg size may optimal environmental condition result lowest overall contrast conservative bet hedging diversified bet hedging occurs individuals lower expected fitness given year also increasing variance survival offspring strategy uses idea putting eggs individuals implementing strategy actually invest several different strategies resulting low variation longterm success could demonstrated clutch eggs different sizes optimal one potential environment offspring means offspring specialized another environment less likely survive adulthood also protects possibility offspring surviving next individual using type bet hedging chooses strategy use based prediction environment like organisms using form bet hedging make predictions select strategies annually example organism may produce clutches different egg sizes year year increasing variation offspring success unlike conservative diversified bet hedging strategies adaptive coin flipping isnt concerned minimizing variation fitness years determine bet hedging allele favored longterm fitness allele must compared particularly highly variable environments bet hedging likely evolve longterm fitness best measured using geometric multiplicative instead additive like arithmetic mean geometric mean highly sensitive small values even rare occurrences zero fitness genotype result expected geometric mean zero makes appropriate circumstances single genotype may variable fitness depending environmental circumstances bet hedging understood mode response environmental adaptations allow organisms survive fluctuating environmental conditions provide evolutionary advantage bet hedging trait may optimal one environment outweighed benefits higher fitness across variety environments therefore bet hedging alleles tend favored variable environments order bet hedging allele spread must persist typical environment genetic drift long enough alternative environments bet hedger advantage genotypes adapted previous environment occur many subsequent environmental alternations selection may sweep allele common example used describing bet hedging comparing arithmetic geometric fitness specialist bet hedging table shows relative fitness four phenotypes good bad years respective means good years occur time bad years time specialist specialist bet hedger bet hedger good year specialist highest fitness good year poorly bad year reverse true bad year specialist conservative bet hedger equally well years diversified bet hedger example uses two specialist strategies time perform better conservative bet hedger good years worse bad year example fitness approximately equal within specialist bet hedger strategies bet hedgers significantly higher fitness specialists good year specialist highest arithmetic mean bet hedging strategies still preferred due higher geometric mean also important realize fitness strategy dependent large number factors ratio good bad years relative fitness good bad years small changes strategies environment large impact optimal example diversified bet hedger outweighs conservative bet hedger uses good year specialist strategy often contrast relative fitness good year specialist bad year becomes optimal strategy experiments bet hedging using prokaryotic model organisms provide simplified views evolution bet hedging bet hedging involves stochastic switching
