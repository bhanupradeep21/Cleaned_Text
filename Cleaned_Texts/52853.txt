multiple endocrine neoplasia type one group disorders multiple endocrine neoplasias affect endocrine system development neoplastic lesions pituitary parathyroid gland individuals suffering disorder prone developing multiple endocrine nonendocrine first described paul wermer hyperparathyroidism present patients asymptomatic hypercalcemia common manifestation patients evidence nephrolithiasis nephrocalcinosis contrast sporadic cases hyperparathyroidism diffuse hyperplasia multiple adenomas common solitary adenomas pancreatic islet cell tumors today major cause death persons tumors occur persons usually multicentric multiple adenomas diffuse islet cell hyperplasia commonly occurs tumors malignant local distant islet cell tumors originate βcell secrete insulin insulinoma cause fasting hypoglycemia βcell tumors common patients years age islet cell tumors secrete pancreatic polypeptide clinical significance unknown gastrin secreted many tumors increased gastrin secretion men also often originates duodenum increased gastrin secretion increases gastric acid may inactivate pancreatic lipase leading diarrhea steatorrhea increased gastrin secretion also leads peptic ulcers men patients usually ulcers multiple atypical location often bleed perforate become obstructed peptic ulcer disease may intractable complicated among patients presenting zollingerellison syndrome men severe secretory diarrhea develop cause fluid electrolyte depletion tumors complex referred watery diarrhea hypokalemia achlorhydria syndrome vipoma ascribed vasoactive intestinal polypeptide although intestinal hormones secretagogues including prostaglandins may contribute hypersecretion glucagon somatostatin chromogranin calcitonin ectopic secretion acth resulting cushings syndrome hypersecretion hormone causing acromegaly sometimes occur tumors rare men needednonfunctioning pancreatic tumors also occur patients men may common type pancreatoduodenal tumor men size nonfunctioning tumor correlates risk metastasis death pituitary tumors occur men patients prolactinomas pituitary tumors secrete growth hormone growth hormone prolactin excess prolactin may cause galactorrhea excess growth hormone causes acromegaly clinically indistinguishable sporadically occurring acromegaly tumors secrete acth producing cushings disease remainder nonfunctional local tumor expansion may cause visual disturbance headache hypopituitarism pituitary tumors men patients appear larger behave aggressively sporadic pituitary tumors adenomas adrenal glands occurs occasionally men patients hormone secretion rarely altered result significance abnormalities uncertain carcinoid tumors particularly derived embryologic foregut lungs thymus occur isolated cases multiple subcutaneous visceral lipomas angiofibromas collagenomas may also occur people multiple endocrine neoplasia type born one mutated copy gene lifetime copy gene mutated small number cells genetic changes result functional copies
