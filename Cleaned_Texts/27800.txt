reality mining collection analysis machinesensed environmental data pertaining human social behavior goal identifying predictable patterns behavior mit technology review called one technologies likely change way reality mining studies human interactions based usage wireless devices mobile phones gps systems providing accurate picture people go communicate rather subjective sources persons account reality mining one aspect digital footprint reality mining using big data conduct research analyze people interact technology everyday build systems allow positive change individual global community reality mining also deals data exhaust individuals use mobile phones tablets laptops cameras device connected internet variety purposes therefore creating variety data gps locations frequently asked questions google mobile phones carry much data individual phones suggest restaurants based searches visited places book preference even guess ends sentences type simple application reality mining listening voices understanding speech patterns diagnose medical problems simple flu even early onset parkinsons powerful phones also allow calendar customization event tracking display behaviors within individuals deemed important enough track social websites also allow researchers view snapshots persons life following status updates facebook tweets twitter even specific recent app called snapchat allows users post videos pictures even live streams exactly theyre theyre strong indicators behaviors interactions world mit conducted reality mining project gave mit students nokia tracked variety ways researchers cell tower id cheap unobtrusive way measure location status phone charging idle use phones applications games web surfing etc found collecting kind data could predict high accuracy behaviors students example one students woke saturday morning researches could predict going day using eigenbehaviors new way understanding data opened doors new research possibly even larger survey research detailed accurate statistics hundreds websites offering software mobile phones track everything phone useful worried parents people want increase personal productivity data uploaded server accessed time although already lot data collected personal devices make part persons life reality miners also use biometric devices measure physical health activity many devices like fitbit nike polar garmin gps watches even app called sleep cycle iphone android users measures sleep quality includes amount sleep even optimal alarms settings using data reality miners may able measure ones actual health processes allow us function dysfunction heart attacks generally dont longitudinal indicators using data even person engages lifelogging create date useful medical field track lifestyles undergo heart attacks create preventative guidelines several ways start lifelogging instance google device called google glass headsupdisplay hud microphone processor camera ways log information specific directories way researchers started observe record behaviors large groups using rfid badges data also recorded work places using knowledge management systems try improve worker productivity efficiency although shortcoming inability converge social technological cultures work place therefore providing incomplete behavioral data another way measure larger groups people community conference attendance data allows researchers know participants ethnic demographics actual number people attending event conferences use smartbadges functions standard rfid badges companies like microsoft ibm used record number people interact conference allow people answer survey questions smartbadges also record vocal interactions attendees certain booths even alert booth workers certain profiles enter within certain range booth smartbadges obvious advantages gathering data reality miners company called ntag acquired alliance technology used ntag technology allows users even notified talk able exchange business cards electronically another type data reality miners looking climate environmental information collect data neighborhoods employing airquality sensors records carbon dioxide nitrogen oxides well general climate information like could help policy makers decide whether act see progress another way collect data surrounding project noah project noah effort collect data types plant species geotagging pictures plants fungi people upload allowing users see kind ecosystems users live helps schools students want collect data projects also birdwatchers know kind birds area general terms section city defined people one way data collected city scale collecting data traffic traffic signals speed cameras data also collected police reports road scanners well gps mobile applications using kind traffic data cities create routes would best allow efficient movement flow traffic company called inrix started compiling data traffic buys data bridge operators transportation systems uses data predict traffic routes time congestion another way traffic monitored bluetooth technology technology inrix consider university maryland completed project demonstrated two bluetooth sensors permanently placed two miles apart could accurately detect traffic combined created make routesuggestion algorithms help people get places efficient matter additionally route update real time using type sensors information notable startup subsidiary google waze also collected data users anonymously reported accidents game inapp currencies rewards crime city scale first way collect view data historical research previous reports within area complex algorithms automatically place officers places high crime rates actual crime committed since memphis police department using program called blue crush criminal reduction utilization statistical history uses police reports uses heat maps distinguish high low areas crime program updates weekly allows police department change tactics accordingly using kind data allow police departments interact society much meaningful way also allowing preventative work done rather rehabilitative work national scale government play much larger role census data far easiest acquire many nations make census findings public via websites data downloaded visualized analysis addition world bank conducts international surveys compiles census data participating sort onestop shop information member countries data publicly accessible downloaded independently sorted analyzed importantly world bank offers open api allows programmers integrate various data software applications using world bank data google integrated simple visualization tool search results search query population botswana pull number dated world bank source graph showing population change another way collect data call data record call detail record log phone calls texts information time location caller sender recipient cdrs allow phone companies view human mobility trends major data companies like google facebook twitter also allow researchers track cultural trends even whenwhere allocation resources time natural disasters biggest worry world spread disease one reality minings best applications globalization ability travel unprecedented compared previous histories united nations created agenda called millennium development goals mdg eight goals aim improve world collect population data first step allowing policy making disease control nations must first collect data air travel billions people travel air year sea travel air travel carries people year sea shipments primary reason collecting data shipments shipments often carry pests carry diseases foodborne illnesses sometimes invasive species plant animal idea managing collecting seems monumental world bank already started helps statistical software like maps stands marrakech action plan statistics maps aims complete six objectives include three people traveling flights source data international air transportation association iata collecting data global air traffic monthly basis since data allowed researchers professionals view ability disease spread certain location earth ships carry global trade automatic identification system implemented record comings goings sea traffic httpsenwikipediaorgwikirealitymining
