evolutionary biology evolutionary arms race ongoing struggle competing sets coevolving genes phenotypic behavioral traits develop escalating adaptations counteradaptations resembling geopolitical

largershelled example excellent example asymmetrical arms race prey evolving physical trait predators adapting much different way floodplain death adders eat three types frogs one nontoxic one producing mucus taken predator highly toxic frogs however snakes also found wait consume toxic prey potency decreases specific case asymmetry enabled snakes overcome chemical defenses toxic frogs results study showed snake became accustomed differences frogs hold release timing always holding nontoxic always releasing highly toxic frogs frogs discharge mucus somewhere snakes would also spend generously time gaped release highly toxic frogs short gaped time release frogs discharge mucus therefore snakes much higher advantage able cope different frogs defensive mechanisms frogs could eventually increase potency toxic knowing snakes would adapt change well snakes venom initial coevolution still highly asymmetrical advantage predators species subject arms race previously may severe
