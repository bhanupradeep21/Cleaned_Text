unichiral context stereochemistry refers compound sample substance composed primarily single words unichiral indicates configurationally homogeneous substance ie made chiral molecules one configuration term relevant discussions preparation usage analysis chiral molecules chiral fundamental concept stereochemistry refers property molecule makes nonsuperimposable mirror image term describes molecules threedimensional structure specify stereochemical composition whether racemic consists single enantiomer also growing concern misuse term homochiral articles express enantiomerically pure drugs context new term unichiral introduced joseph gal term homochiral originates greek words homo meaning cheir meaning hand lord kelvin coined term homochiral late century refer molecules substituents within molecule possess chirality insight early history homochiral heterochiral term used describe relationship molecules different chirality term began used describe compounds samples composed entirely single example two molecules lalanine exhibit homochiral relation similarly two molecules dalanine exhibit homochirality whereas lalanine dalanine display heterochirality furthermore necessary molecules identical instance lserine sserine lcysteine rcysteine homochiral despite conflicting cahningoldprelog signs homochiral heterochiral valuable terms categorizing groups molecules exhibit similarity differ enantiomeric properties term homochiral sparked significant controversy intense issue lies word employed two distinct manners thereby rendering comprehension challenging simultaneous utilization molecular macroscopic perspectives resulted ambiguity also detrimental theoretical educational standpoint within realm stereochemistry underscoring importance employing precise language scientific communication hence unquestionable broad application term homochiral ceased used exclusively refer original definition stereochemical debate surrounding stereochemistrys teaching negatively impacted ongoing controversy certain textbooks dismiss concept macroscopic whereas others endorse defining samples containing one enantiomer called enantiomerically pure homochiral inconsistency educational materials leads frustration among stereochemistry educators noted unpublished observations j gal disagreement fundamental concepts homochirality highlights challenges standardizing teaching stereochemistry many alternative terms previously used proposed replacements macroscopic homochiral prospective terms used literature may categorized three broad groups namely enantiomeric enrichment enantiomeric purity additional terms summarized presented following tables note overall evident aforementioned terms signify variable andor unspecified enantiomeric enrichment unsuitable specified purpose new term nevertheless certain terms essential explicitly indicate sample high concentration enantiomers enantiomeric excess less enantioenriched highly suitable role although terms nonracemic may also deemed acceptable note summarize terms explicitly indicate complete enantiomeric purity including word pure appropriate substituting term homochiral one possible reason popularity macroscopic homochiral lack explicit emphasis complete enantiomeric purity note key concept term chiral specifically pertains molecular chirality recommended employed denote macroscopic enantiomeric homogeneity ongoing challenge field stereochemistry finding suitable term replace homochiral describing samples singleenantiomeric content term homochiral widely used considered inadequate certain macroscopic applications despite numerous alternatives proposed literature homoenantiomeric enantiomerically pure enantiopure optically pure optically active scalemic holemic none yet universally accepted comprehensive replacement terms carries specific connotations limitations making useful certain contexts general substitutes macroscopic dilemma highlights complexity evolving nature terminology stereochemistry precise universally applicable language crucial clear communication understanding scientific community term unichiral proposed new addition lexicon stereochemistry addressing inadequacies existing terms describing substances composed predominantly one enantiomer term derived latin unus meaning one describes compounds samples substances chiral molecules essentially singleenantiomeric composition definition contextually dependent varying compounds preparation use relevant discussion instance unichiral specify stereochemical composition chiral drug homogenous composed single enantiomer need term like unichiral arises limitations current terminology homoenantiomeric enantiomerically pure optically pure others despite usefulness adequately replace term macroscopic homochiral unichiral effectively fulfills scientific need term encapsulates concept enantiomeric homogeneity without necessarily implying absolute enantiomeric purity design practical simple universally comprehensible within context stereochemistry unichiral differs fundamentally enantiopure latter experimental nature unichiral conceptual focusing singleenantiomeric character samples distinction helps clarify traditional meaning homochiral pertaining molecules groups chirality sense positions unichiral descriptor singleenantiomeric characteristics consequently unichiral could replace several terms like nonracemic enantiopure etc fail convey intended meaning otherwise unsuitable broader context stereochemical nomenclature unichiral contributes organized systematic approach joins set adjectives derived chiral includes chiral inherent molecular chirality homochiral heterochiral molecular stereochemical relationships unichiral macroscopic singleenantiomeric character coherent terminology framework facilitates clearer communication understanding various chirality aspects letter editor journal chromatography j gal university colorado school medicine proposed macroscopic usage term homochiral discontinued author highlights significance using precise consistent terminology scientific literature suggests term unichiral suitable alternative macroscopic homochirality use term unichiral describe samples single enantiomeric content crucial advancement clarifying ambiguity associated
