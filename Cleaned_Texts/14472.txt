immunomodulation job maintaining homeostasis immune system infection humans loss perforin function leads syndrome called familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome lead death cells macrophages multiply fight pathogen resulting harmful levels proinflammatory cytokines overactivation lead inflammation vital organs anemia via overactivated macrophages phagocytosing blood cells potentially fatal trapanis paper talks granzymes may functions addition ability fight infection granzyme contains certain chemicals allow cause proliferation b cells reduce chance cancer growth

process whereby precancerous malignant cells recognized immune system damaged consequently targeted elimination tumor progress requires conditions within body surrounding area growthpromoting almost people suitable immune cells fight tumors body studies shown immune system even ability prevent precancerous cells growing arbitrate regression established tumors dangerous thing cancer cells ability inhibit function immune system although tumor may beginning stage weak may giving chemicals inhibit function immune system allowing grow become harmful tests shown mice without granzymes perforins
