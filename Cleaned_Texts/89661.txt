animal vaccination immunisation domestic livestock wild practice connected veterinary first animal vaccine invented chicken cholera louis production vaccines encounter issues relation economic difficulties individuals government regulation animal vaccinations less compared regulations human vaccines categorised conventional next generation animal vaccines found cost effective sustainable methods controlling infectious veterinary veterinary vaccine industry valued billion predicted reach billion animals receiver source vaccines laboratory testing first animal vaccine created chicken cholera louis pasteur also invented anthrax vaccine sheep cattle rabies vaccine monkeys rabbits used grow attenuate rabies starting dried spinal cord material infected rabbits given dogs inoculate infected nerve tissue dried weaken subsequently vaccine given boy infected rabies disease joseph meister survived one french national academy medicine world saw feat breakthrough thus many scientists started collaborate pasteurs indirect view animal vaccinations seen smallpox vaccine given humans animal based smallpox deadly disease known rash high death rate edward jenner tested theory human already infected cowpox would protected smallpox proved true thus started pathway eradication world health organisations eradication effort least people vaccinated every subsequently case finding ring vaccination used resulting smallpox becoming first eradication disease vaccination main issues relation vaccination animals access vaccines costeffective measure preventing disease livestock populations although logistics distributing vaccines marginalised populations still smallholder farmers shfs livestock marginalised populations mps die result disease reach full potential transmit root issue could prevented controlled increasing accessibility animal livestock necessary estimated million poor farmers developing animals provide food income financial reserve diseases characterised diseases cause economic losses governmentcontrolled diseases neglected diseases link economic losses category entails necessary vaccines developing countries normally produced private sector make little profit companies require community support continue producing whereas governmentcontrolled diseases controlled government policy main issue vaccine expensive therefore becomes less available poor furthermore animal diseases neglected mainly affect poor communities thus profitable producers target largest markets first ensure return investment example reason dog transmitted rabies taking time eradicate affects developing world thus able produced large profitable issues include limited economic barriers political barriers technical scientific barriers regulatory barriers field use barriers social perception possible solutions terms issues sector animal vaccinations include innovations scientific regulatory fields suggested regulations converged regions animal vaccines standardised rna dna backbone found needs better mutual understanding regulators academia solutions include free rabies vaccine programs subsidies needed form partnerships across regions mainly terms vaccine banks decrease government taxes providing positive incentives disease recording building partnerships global local manufacturers production vaccines animals humans always linked relationship coined one health least human pathogens originate animals two main examples link rabies smallpox vaccines many cases vaccinating animals important animals health also human health prosperity term zoonotic disease defines disease transferred animals current prominent example zoonotic disease spread animal humans animals saliva bites domestic wild animals catch rabies disease humans die disease year cases occurring dog less documented cases rabies survival without treatment majority cases deaths occur africa asia result limited vaccine rabies administered prior post infected result long incubation period proactive approach vaccinating stray dogs helps prevent disease source seen costeffective prevention rabies bangladesh mass dog vaccination campaign resulted decrease rabies related world health organisation created campaign zero reduce number humans die dog related rabies zero last decade infectious diseases humans animal thus notion coined one health created human animal health seen equally important example one health vaccine distributed humans animals currently going clinical trials rift valley fever associate professor warimwe university oxford states approach accelerates design development vaccine also saves time development animal vaccines less regulatory requirements human vaccines resulted less time money involved creation production animal vaccines human vaccine development process generally takes years whereas animal vaccine process takes average years albeit ability prioritise potential vaccine targets use studies test safety less animal vaccine production compared human pets grown fast rate time owners concerned companion animals contrast farmed animal vaccines generally produced zoonotic disease significant effect international trade rather producing sole reason caring animal pets farmed animals vaccinated human safety economic means clearly links pharmacovigilance monitoring effects licensed drugs largest database veterinary medicines directorate vmd uk although vast majority reported terms companion animals standard metric quantifying global burden animal diseases standard method determining cost effectiveness certain animal vaccine costeffectiveness thresholds general thus difficult prioritise animal vaccine development result less regulation vaccines found contain impurities example rabies vaccine containing significant amount bovine serum albumin bsa cause severe allergic reactions lead death main conventional vaccines liveattenuated liveattenuated vaccines use weakened form virus bacteria causes disease form inoculation closest actual infection thus seen stronger effect types conventional albeit safety issues related liveattenuated vaccines potential unintended outcomes another target species takes vaccine instances type vaccine creates false positives animals tested therefore rids country disease free status seen foot mouth disease furthermore inactivated vaccines consist bacterians one bacterial species killed viral strains inactivation occurs chemical physical treatment either denatures protein damages nucleic acid type vaccine stable less expensive liveattenuated vaccines although provide effective longterm protection pathogen genomic analysis pathogens furthered understanding mechanisms pathogens resulted discovery antigens development recombinant veterinary vaccines currently pathogens genome sequenced genes cause disease identified genes interest cloned recombinant constructed one three types vaccines produced dna vaccines subunit vaccines vectored vaccines dna vaccines induce antigen production host plasmid contains viral bacterial parasite gene animals immune system recognises expressed protein foreign lead cellular humeral response dna vaccines overcomes safety concerns liveattenuated vaccines furthermore subunit vaccines short specific pathogens replicate even though vaccine termed safe replicate thus studies shown issues relation yield vectored vaccines another next generation vaccine type vaccine uses vector deliver either one multiple proteins immune system animal currently research undergone plant vaccines come category vector vaccines domestic chickens
