insect migration seasonal movement insects particularly species dragonflies beetles butterflies moths distance vary species cases movements involve large numbers individuals cases individuals migrate one direction may return next generation may instead migrate opposite direction significant difference bird migration insects move extent range movement vary within centimeters sucking insects wingless aphids thousands kilometers case insects locusts butterflies dragonflies definition migration therefore particularly difficult context insects behaviororiented definition proposed migratory behavior persistent straightenedout movement affected animals locomotory exertions active embarkation vehicle depends upon temporary inhibition stationkeeping responses promotes eventual disinhibition recurrence definition disqualifies movements made search resources terminated upon finding resource migration involves longer distance movement movements affected availability resource items cases longdistance insect migration concern winged many migrating butterflies fly low altitudes airspeeds region typically lower flight speed insect allowing travel wind need boundarylayer migrants include
