human genetic enhancement human genetic engineering refers human enhancement means genetic modification could done order cure diseases gene therapy prevent possibility getting particular similarly vaccines improve athlete performance sporting events gene doping change physical appearance metabolism even improve physical capabilities mental faculties memory intelligence genetic enhancements may may done way change heritable raised concerns within scientific genetic modification order cure genetic diseases referred gene therapy many gene therapies available made phases clinical research approved fda december clinical trials conducted half phase spark therapeutics luxturna mutationinduced blindness novartis kymriah chimeric antigen receptor cell therapy fdas first approved gene therapies enter market since time drugs novartis zolgensma alnylams patisiran also received fda approval addition companies gene therapy drugs approaches utilize adenoassociated viruses aavs lentiviruses performing gene insertions vivo ex vivo respectively aso sirna approaches conducted alnylam ionis pharmaceuticals require nonviral delivery systems utilize alternative mechanisms trafficking liver cells way galnac transporters genetic engineering topic moral debate among bioethicists genetic testing genetic engineering stem cell research often discussed together due interrelated moral arguments surrounding topics distinction repairing genes enhancing genes central idea many moral debates surrounding genetic enhancement argue repairing genes morally permissible genetic enhancement due potential lead social injustice discriminatory eugenics moral questions related genetic testing often related duty warn family members inherited disorder discovered physicians navigate patient autonomy confidentiality regard genetic testing ethics genetic discrimination moral permissibility using genetic testing avoid causing seriously disabled persons exist selective ethical issues related gene therapy human genetic enhancement concern medical risks benefits therapy duty use procedures prevent suffering reproductive freedom genetic choices morality practicing positive genetics includes attempts improve normal people immunocompromised bodies hence much less capable fending defeating diseases ie influenza cases due genetic flawsclarification needed even genetic diseases scid gene therapies already developed developed correct genetic flawsdiseases hereby making people less susceptible catching additional diseases ie influenza november lulu nana using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat gene editing technique disabled gene called embryos aiming close protein doorway allows hiv enter cell make subjects immune hiv virus athletes might adopt gene therapy technologies improve gene doping known occur multiple gene therapies may effects kayser et al argue gene doping could level playing field athletes receive equal access critics claim therapeutic intervention nontherapeuticenhancement purposes compromises ethical foundations medicine hypothetical gene therapies could include changes physical appearance metabolism mental faculties memory intelligence wellbeing increasing resistance depression relieving chronic pain congenital disorders affecting muscoskeletal system may affect physical appearance cases may also cause physical discomfort modifying genes causing congenital diseases diagnosed mutations gene known cause diseases may prevent also changes mystatin may alter appearance behavior may also modified genetic
