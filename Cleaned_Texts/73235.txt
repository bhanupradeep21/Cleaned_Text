cholecystectomy surgical removal gallbladder cholecystectomy common treatment symptomatic gallstones gallbladder cholecystectomy eighth common operating room procedure performed hospitals united cholecystectomy performed either laparoscopically via open surgical needed surgery usually successful relieving symptoms percent people may continue experience similar symptoms cholecystectomy condition called postcholecystectomy complications cholecystectomy include bile duct injury wound infection bleeding retained gallstones abscess formation stenosis narrowing bile pain complications caused gallstones common reasons removal gallbladder also removed order treat biliary dyskinesia gallbladder gallstones common people gallstones asymptomatic need surgery stones noticed incidentally imaging tests abdomen ultrasound ct done million people us gallstones eventually require cholecystectomy relieve symptoms pain treat biliary colic pain caused gallstones occurs gallstone temporarily blocks bile duct drains typically pain biliary colic felt right upper part abdomen moderate severe goes away hours stone biliary colic usually occurs meals gallbladder contracts push bile digestive tract first attack biliary colic people repeat attack next repeated attacks biliary colic common reason removing gallbladder lead cholecystectomies us cholecystitis inflammation gallbladder caused interruption normal flow bile another reason common complication gallstones acute cholecystitis caused gallstones blocking drainage blockage incomplete stone passes quickly person experiences biliary colic gallbladder completely blocked remains prolonged period person develops acute pain cholecystitis similar biliary colic lasts longer six hours occurs together signs infection fever chills elevated white blood cell people cholecystitis also usually positive murphy sign physical exam meaning doctor asks patient take deep breath pushes upper right side abdomen patient stops inhalation due pain pressure inflamed five ten percent acute cholecystitis occurs people without gallstones reason called acalculous cholecystitis usually develops people abnormal bile drainage secondary serious illness people multiorgan failure serious trauma recent major surgery following long stay intensive care people repeat episodes acute cholecystitis develop chronic cholecystitis changes normal anatomy
