children include permanently affecting ability ever achieve proficiency language deaf children learn language later life likely process signed languages linguistic input visual input contrasting children exposed birth process signed language region brain hearing people process spoken additionally studies show notable decrease sign language grammar skills deaf adults exposed sign age compared exposed birth even greater decrease exposed age cases poor nearcoincidence levels conflicting evidence whether sign language exposure interferes development spoken language analysis suggested early sign language exposure may hinder later spoken language clinical research children use cochlear implants found without exposure sign language almost twice likely achieve ageappropriate spoken language compared children exposed visual communication either case however exposure fluent language models effective mitigating risk language deprivation critical period learning hypothesis states person must exposed language within certain time period acquire language effectively certain time period ranges early childhood end evidence shown learning language critical period provide nativelike abilities morphology phonology late learners miss critical period still obtain basic syntactic abilities along good use vocabulary achieve nativelike abilities comes besides critical period another period learning called sensitive period sensitive period described specific time period learning still possible even critical period several sensitive periods evidence demonstrated affect language
