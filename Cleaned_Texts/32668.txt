spondylosis degeneration vertebral column cause narrow sense refers spinal osteoarthritis agerelated degeneration spinal column common cause spondylosis degenerative process osteoarthritis chiefly affects vertebral bodies neural foramina facet joints facet syndrome severe may cause pressure spinal cord nerve roots subsequent sensory motor disturbances pain paresthesia imbalance muscle weakness limbs space two adjacent vertebrae narrows compression nerve root emerging spinal cord may result radiculopathy sensory motor disturbances severe pain neck shoulder arm back leg accompanied muscle weakness less commonly direct pressure spinal cord typically cervical spine may result myelopathy characterized global weakness gait dysfunction loss balance loss bowel bladder control patient may experience shocks paresthesia hands legs nerve compression lack blood flow vertebrae neck involved labelled cervical spondylosis lower back spondylosis labeled lumbar spondylosis term ancient greek σπόνδυλος spóndylos vertebra plural vertebrae backbone cervical spondylosis patient may presented dull neck pain neck stiffness initial stages disease disease progresses symptoms related radiculopathy due compression exiting spinal nerve narrowed intervertebral foramen myelopathy due compression spinal cord reduced range motion neck frequent objective finding physical cervical radiculopathy would numbness tingling burning pain skin area supplied spinal nerve shooting pain along course spinal nerve weakness absent tendon reflex muscle supplied symptom provoked neck extension therefore spurlings test take advantage phenomenon performed extending laterally flexing patients head placing downward pressure narrow intervertebral neck shoulder pain ipsilateral side ie side head flexed indicates positive result test positive test result necessarily positive result spondylosis additional testing cervical myelopathy almost always involves upper lower limbs person may experience difficult gait limb stiffness early stages iliopsoas muscle first group muscles affected lower limb weaknesses without upper limb involvement raise suspicion thoracic cord finger escape sign performed detect weakness fingers persons forearm pronated fingers extended person myelopathy slow abduction flexion fingers ulnar side degree loss sensation maybe different upper lhermitte sign performed asking

vertebral canal degenerative process spondylosis disc bulging osteophyte formation hypertrophy superior articular process contributes narrowing spinal canal intervertebral foramen leading compression spinal nerves results radiculopathyrelated narrowing lumbar spinal canal causes clinical condition known neurogenic claudication characterised symptoms lower back pain leg pain leg numbness leg weakness worsens standing walking improves sitting lying rare severe complication disease vertebrobasilar result vertebral artery becoming occluded passes transverse foramen spinal joints become stiff cervical spondylosis thus chondrocytes maintain disc become deprived nutrition die secondary osteophytes may cause stenosis spinal nerves manifesting radiculopathy congenital cervical spine stenosis commonly occurs due short pedicles form vertebral arch spinal canal diameter divided vertebral body diameter less anteroposterior diameter spinal canal less distance pedicles less imaging cervical spine stenosis diagnosed symptoms correlate well spinal canal patients may symptoms even severe cervical spine spondylosis caused years constant abnormal pressure caused joint subluxation stress induced sports acute andor repetitive trauma poor posture placed vertebrae discs abnormal stress causes body form new bone order compensate new weight distribution abnormal weight bearing bone displacement cause spondylosis occur poor postures loss normal spinal curves lead spondylosis well spondylosis affect person age however older people degeneration intervertebral disc facet joints capsules ligamentum flavum also cause spinal canal neck pain without positive neurological findings usually require xray cervical spine chronic neck pain cervical spine xray may indicated various ways cervical spine xrays anteroposterior ap view lateral view swimmers view oblique view cervical xrays may show osteophytes decreased intervertebral disc height narrowing spinal canal abnormal alignment kyphosis cervical spine flexion extension view cervical spine helpful look spondylolisthesis slippage one vertebra mri ct scans helpful diagnosis generally definitive must considered together physical examinations ct scan helpful see small bony elements spine facet joint determine whether osteoporosis spine however interverterbral foramen ligaments well visualised ct therefore contrast injected spinal canal via lumbar puncture imaged using ct scan known ct myelography ct myelography useful person contraindicated mri scan due presence pacemaker infusion pump mri investigation choice investigate radiculopathy myelopathy mri show intervertebral foramen spinal canal ligaments degree disc degeneration herniation alignment spine changes spinal cord many treatments cervical spondylosis subjected rigorous controlled surgery advocated cervical radiculopathy patients intractable pain progressive symptoms weakness fails improve conservative therapy surgical indications cervical spondylosis myelopathy csm remain somewhat controversial clinicians recommend operative therapy conservative therapy moderatetosevere physical therapy may effective restoring range motion flexibility core strengthening decompressive therapies ie manual mobilization mechanical traction may also help alleviate pain however physical therapy osteopathy cure degeneration people view strong compliance postural modification necessary realize maximum benefit decompression adjustments flexibility rehabilitation current surgical procedures used treat spondylosis aim alleviate signs symptoms disease decreasing pressure spinal canal decompression surgery andor controlling spine movement fusion surgery evidence limited support aspects cervical myelopathy spine still retains neutral lordotic
