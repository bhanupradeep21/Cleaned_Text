lysosomal biology pathophysiology traditional lysosomal storage disorders role lysosome prevalent diseases including diabetes mellitus polycystic kidney disease particular emphasis development drug therapeutics disorders glycosphingolipid metabolism work resulted several patents including amino ceramidelike compounds therapeutic methods pyridine inhibitors glucosylceramide synthase therapeutic methods using early collaboration norman radin focused substrate reduction alternative enzyme replacement therapy treatment lysosomal disorders gaucher disease suggested substrate reduction posits inhibition metabolites accumulate lysosome due loss activity specific hydrolase treated reversible inhibitors specific anabolic enzymes following early collaboration radin shayman group went develop inhibitors glucosylceramide synthase followed proof concept studies models gaucher fabry disease experimentally established viability substrate reduction although concept initially met skepticism academic pharmaceutical communities compounds eventually licensed genzyme corporation clinical development eliglustat tartrate approved food drug administration european medicines association eliglustat tartrate first orally bioavailable agent approved first standalone substrate reduction therapy gaucher disease type shaymans work developing first class glycosphingolipid synthesis inhibitor led consideration whether common disorders might amenable targeting glucosylceramide based fundamental studies group others demonstrating role glucosylceramide metabolism conditions associated aerobic including polycystic kidney disease glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors focus preclinical clinical studies evaluating potential extended use applications eliglustat related collaboration scott larsen shaymans work also directed toward identification brainpenetrant glycolipid synthesis inhibitors treatment gaucher disease types gangliosidoses including taysachs sandhoff disease using computational analysis comparing eliglustat known cns penetrant compounds novel glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors designed around eliglustat pharmacophore demonstrating lower glucosylceramide ganglioside levels within shayman group worked elucidation mechanisms underlying vasculopathy fabry disease initial work led identification three inducible models vascular disease alphagalactosidase knockout models included oxidantinduced arterial thrombosis accelerated atherogenesis impaired arterial relaxation decreased nitric oxide endothelial nitric oxide synthase
