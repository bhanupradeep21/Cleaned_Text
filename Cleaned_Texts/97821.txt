drumming also called bleating winnowing sound produced snipe part courtship display sound produced mechanically rather vocally vibration outer tail feathers flying downwards swooping motion drumming display usually crepuscular though also heard point throughout breeding season well sporadically migration drumming commonly heard within context mating display also displayed means distraction
