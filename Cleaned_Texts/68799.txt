gnotobiosis greek roots gnostos known bios life refers engineered state organism forms life ie microorganisms including microbiota term gnotobiotic organism gnotobiote refer model organism colonized specific community known microorganisms isobiotic defined flora animal contains microorganisms germfree often experimental study gnotobiosis generation various types gnotobiotic model organisms tools studying interactions host organisms microorganisms referred concept field gnotobiology born debate louis pasteur marceli nencki late century pasteur argued animal life needed bacteria succeed nencki argued animals would healthier without wasnt association gnotobiotics early attempts gnotobiology limited inadequate equipment nutritional knowledge however advancements nutritional sciences animal anatomy physiology immunology allowed improvement gnotobiotic guinea pigs first germfree animal model described george nuttall hans thierfelder establishing techniques still used today early methods maintaining sterile environments involved sterile glass jars gloveboxes developed conversation surrounding uniformity methods field symposium micrurgical germfree methods university notre many early accomplishments gnotobiology came notre dame university university lund nagoya laboratories bacteriology university notre dame known lobund founded john j cavanaugh cited making notable achievements field gnotobiotic direction james reyniers early work lobund focused obtaining gnotobiotes sterilizing animals maintaining animals using highpressure steam sterilized steel isolators however later work institute shifted focus field towards establishing colonies animals born first germfree rat colony generated maintained using steam sterilized isolator swedish scientist bengt flexible film isolators using peracetic acid vapor sterilization began developed refined sterilization techniques manufacturing changes lobund significantly reduced size cost isolators making gnotobiotic research universally numerous advances gnotobiotic research technologies main challenges facing gnotobiotic research today cost space efficiency operational procedure costs maintaining gnotobiotic mice cages greater times cost maintaining nongnotobiotic mice creating challenge establishing maintaining facilities using typical funding sources federal grants institutions like early focus field gnotobiology proving organism could live absence microorganisms ultimately resulted development gnotobiotic organisms tool germfree models used study effects absence bacteria host organism metabolism physiology later evolved intentionally infecting germfree organisms specific microorganisms investigate functions questions relating biomedical early gnotobiotes used study role microorganisms host nutrition acquisition immune response however limited animals reared gnotobiotic colony often poorly developed immune systems lower cardiac output thin intestinal walls make highly susceptible infectious early gnotobiotic research decreased within century gnotobiotic model systems become important tool investigating interactions host organisms commensal microbiota allow researchers investigate specific microbes highly controlled host historically mouse models used investigate impacts microbiota composition microorganisms present host immune system nervous system metabolism physiology however increasing interest field led incorporation model organisms address larger variety questions relating gnotobiotic animal gnotobiote animal microorganisms interacting known gnotobiotic animals typically born aseptic conditions may include removal mother caesarean section followed immediate transfer newborn isolator incoming air food water gnotobiotes usually raised sterile laboratory environment intentionally exposed microorganisms interest mice rats common gnotobiotic animals used research examples important gnotobiotes include caenorhabditis elegans c elegans drosophila melanogaster melanogaster zebrafish gnotobiotes used controlled environment study host anatomy physiology specific symbiotic interactions host specific microorganisms impacts chemicals host rodents primarily mice rats common mammalian model systems used studying gnotobiosis widely used study human health relating gut interactions microorganisms host however recently rise using gnotobiotic mice study interactions different microorganisms microbemicrobe interactions humanized gnotobiotic mice gnotobiotic mice introduced human intestinal microorganisms fecal microbiota transplant human feces used context studying gut microbiota relationship host cancers immune system advantages gnotobiotic mice rat systems include uniformity organism historical prevalence established systemspecific methods well ability obtain reliable gnotobiotic mice rats gnotobiotic fish used model organism human however increased interest aquaculture sustainable food production led increasing prevalence gnotobiotic studies focused maximizing production maintaining healthy captive majority research still conducted species fish zebra advantages gnotobiotic fish systems include high numbers offspring per reproduction event coupled fast generation times eggs gnotobiotic plants plants either grown without microorganisms present aseptic axenic sterile grown presence one monoxenic one polyxenic known obtain gnotobiotic plants researchers sterilize seeds using chemical agents eg ethanol sodium hypochlorite bleach hydrogen peroxide surface wide variety plants used generate gnotobiotic systems arabidopsis thaliana peanuts oats corn many similar animals gnotobiotic plant systems used study integral components host physiology eg nitrogen well pathogenic symbiotic interactions plants
