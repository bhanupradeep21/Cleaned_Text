farkas also recommends lower jaw protruded upper lower teeth aligned farkas published second contradicted earlier writing subjects farkas showed subjects directed air downward varying degrees one subject directed air upward direction various degrees lower jaw position seen photographs shows variation earlier text well supports written trombonist brass pedagogue donald reinhardt reinhardt described labeled different embouchure patterns according characteristics mouthpiece placement general direction air stream travels past lips according later text players place mouthpiece higher lips upper lip inside mouthpiece direct air downwards varying degrees playing performers place mouthpiece lower lower lip inside mouthpiece direct air varying degrees upward manner order performer successful air stream direction mouthpiece placement need personalized based individual anatomical differences lloyd leno confirmed existence upstream downstream controversial reinhardts description recommendations regarding phenomenon termed pivot according reinhardt successful brass embouchure depends motion wherein performer moves mouthpiece lips single unit along teeth upward downward direction performer ascends pitch either move lips mouthpiece together slightly towards nose pull together slightly towards chin use opposite motion descend pitch whether player uses one general pivot direction degree motion performed depends performers anatomical features stage development placement mouthpiece upon lips doesnt change rather relationship rim lips teeth angle instrument may change motion follows shape teeth placement jaw contrary many brass performers teachers believe angle instrument actually constitute motion reinhardt advised pivot later research supports reinhardts claim motion exists might advisable brass performers adopt john describes mouthpiece pressure towards lips vertical forces shear pressure horizontal forces functioned three test groups student trombonists professional trombonists professional symphonic trombonists froelich noted symphonic trombonists used least amount direct shear forces recommends model followed research notes virtually brass performers rely upon upward downward embouchure authors pedagogues remain skeptical necessity motion scientific evidence supporting view sufficiently developed time noted brass pedagogues prefer instruct use embouchure less analytical point view arnold jacobs tubist wellregarded brass teacher believed best student focus use air musical expression allow embouchure develop naturally instructors

lips embouchure method advocated minority brass pedagogues jerome callet yet sufficiently researched support claims system effective approach brass performers advocates callets approach believe method recommended taught great brass instructors early century two french trumpet technique books authored jeanbaptiste arban saintjacome translated english use american players according due misunderstanding arising differences pronunciation french english commonly used brass embouchure europe incorrectly interpretedcitation needed callet attributes difference embouchure technique reason great players past able play level technical virtuosity although increased difficulty contemporary compositions brass seem indicate level brass technique achieved todays performers equals even exceeds performers late early centuries callets method brass embouchure consists tongue remaining forward teeth times corners mouth always remain relaxed small amount air used top bottom lips curl inward grip forward tongue tongue force teeth subsequently throat wide open supposedly resulting bigger open sound forward tongue resists pressure mouthpiece controls flow air lower higher notes protects lips teeth damage injury mouthpiece pressure importance tongue method many refer tonguecontrolled embouchure technique facilitates use smaller mouthpiece larger bore instruments results improved intonation stronger harmonically related partials across players range variety transverse flute embouchures employed professional flutists though natural form perfectly symmetrical corners mouth relaxed ie
