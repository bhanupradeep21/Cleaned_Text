evolutionary taxonomy evolutionary systematics darwinian classification branch biological classification seeks classify organisms using combination phylogenetic relationship shared descent progenitordescendant relationship serial descent degree evolutionary change type taxonomy may consider whole taxa rather single species groups species inferred giving rise new concept found wellknown form modern evolutionary synthesis early evolutionary taxonomy differs strict predarwinian linnaean taxonomy producing orderly lists builds evolutionary trees phylogenetic nomenclature taxon must consist single ancestral node descendants evolutionary taxonomy allows groups excluded parent taxa eg dinosaurs considered include birds given rise thus permitting paraphyletic evolutionary taxonomy
