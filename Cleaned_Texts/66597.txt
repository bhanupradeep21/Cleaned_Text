darwin matters case intelligent design book michael shermer author publisher historian science shermer examines theory evolution arguments presented demonstrates theory robust based convergence evidence number different branches science attacks part simplistic easily demolished discusses evolution branches science coexist religious beliefs describes darwin started creationists thinking changed time examines current attitudes towards evolution science general finds many cases problem people facts evolution ideas implies note information book summarized correct book originally published many people topics mentioned discussed book wikipedia pages accessed clicking highlighted synopsis unless specifically stated otherwise material including quoted text section taken book ie book sole reference material june science historian frank sulloway author michael shermer spent month retracing charles darwins footsteps gal치pagos islands shermer good physical condition found challenging excursion due lack water harsh environment struck clear evidence creationism contrary iconic myth darwin actually departed gal치pagos still creationist shermer attributes myth mistaken idea science proceeds select eureka discoveries journal entry months later darwin refers different mockingbirds collected gal치pagos islands varieties rather evolution separate species sulloway made study darwins journals concluded darwins acceptance evolution came meeting march ornithologist john gould studied darwins bird specimens faced conclusive evidence transmutation one species another occurred forced abandon universally accepted notion species fixed immutable confident enough write findings friend compared revelations confessing murder publish years acceptance slow scientific community even slower general public poll showed americans hold creationist views compared believe evolution open idea teaching public schools creationism much less prevalent outside usa author acknowledges also believed creationism adopted view became bornagain christian high school argued creationist case graduate school mastered statistics studying psychology understood importance determining hypothesis true false took course evolution see side debate quickly realized creationist literature presented darwinian cardboard cutout child could knock discovered evidence many different scientific disciplines converged conclusion evolution happened observed geneticist theodosius dobzhansky nothing biology makes sense except light evolution ever since darwins book origin species came attack suggested put forward data drawn conclusions darwin points observation must view service also become fight religion science since evolution compatible idea god simply created species prior developing theory evolution darwin published monograph entitled structure distribution coral reefs showed appeared different types coral reefs actually different stages coral reef development unlike evolution came hypothesis first found data verify later work voyage hms beagle took gal치pagos unlike contemporaries darwin insisted theory comes facts political philosophical beliefs thomas henry huxley one strongest vocal supporters darwin idea became known darwins bulldog one main opposing arguments came william paleys book natural theology includes wellknown watchmaker argument says since complexity watch clearly requires human designer life much complex watch must require god designer shermer refers top explanation evolution bottom explanation ernst mayr outlines general tenets evolutionary theory discovered years since darwin mayr also gives rules natural selection operates creationist arguments evolution tend simplistic one example evolution likened warehouse full parts randomly assorting jumbo jet focus random nature variations fail acknowledge selection process random darwin concerned lack transitional fossils various species ernst mayr provided explanation known allopatric speciation related common way new species emerge small group one species breaks away becomes geographically isolated experience rapid genetic changes happen quickly produce significant fossil record larger original group relatively stable little genetic change time diverse interbreeding small breakaway group later grows become large group also become relatively stable new species similar distinct original one niles eldridge stephen jay gould apply fossil record suggest changes occur approximately discontinuous manner call punctuated equilibrium william whewell nineteenth century philosopher suggested prove theory one needs convergence evidence different paths case evolution abundant consistent evidence geology paleontology botany zoology herpetology entomology biogeography comparative anatomy genetics population genetics creationists like claim evolution science one observe nevertheless abundant evidence prove evolution valid theory hypothesis branches science geology cosmology also lack ability directly observe past events evolution wolf dog good example examination mitochondrial dna remains early dogs strongly indicate connection ancient american eurasian domestic dogs old world gray wolves excellent compilation evolutionary convergence richard dawkins book ancestors tale addition convergence evidence different branches science comparative method used examine characteristics evolve together across species adapting changing environmental conditions modern organisms show variety structures simple complex reflecting evolutionary history rather instantaneous creation eye given example variety complexities different organisms human eye built upside backwards light travel blood vessels various cells reaching light receptors seems inconsistent intelligent design humans numerous useless vestigial structures including male nipples male uterus remnant thirteenth rib humans coccyx tail bone wisdom teeth appendix body hair goose bumps extrinsic ear muscles third eyelid remnant seems consistent evolution intelligent design hypotheticodeductive method often used analyzing fossils excavated hypothesis formed existing data used make deductions tested acquiring additional data confirm negate hypothesis shermer gives example method used jack horner paleontologist explain mystery happened large herd maiasaurs whose fossil remains shared unusual characteristics bones aligned separated size fractured lengthwise explanation involved two stage process involving ash volcanic eruption killed followed later flood william jennings bryan prepared speech make famous scopes monkey trial related teaching evolution speech basically said evolution eliminates god leading breakdown morality loss meaning humanity shermer proposes main reason rejection many people evolution refusal consider evidence favor shermer points accepting evolution force us jettison morals ethics rejecting evolution ensure constancy gives reasons people resist accepting evolution fact shermer sulloway asked many people believe god think people believe found female religious parents large family makes one religious male educated conflict ones parents makes one less religious five common reasons believing order preference six common reasons people think others believe order preference sulloway shermer see differences intellectual attribution bias people see rational believers others emotional believers flaw intelligent designer argument designer needed explain existence world explain existence designer replaced one mystery another one shermer mentions famous quote arthur c clark sufficiently advanced technology indistinguishable magic proposes sufficiently advanced extraterrestrial intelligence indistinguishable god shermer observes biological evolution slow happening many generations technological evolution happen within single generation computational power tends increase exponentially time proposed could lead singularity appear essentially infinite shermer wonders extraterrestrials thousands even millions years advanced would capable theologian langdon gilkey points according bible god like watchmaker rather creates nothing theologian paul tillich said god exist beyond essence existence shermer gives several reasons engage debate intelligent design advocates scottish philosopher david hume stated important maxim testimony sufficient establish miracle unless testimony kind falsehood would miraculous fact endeavors establish often stated extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence darwin provided fairly extraordinary evidence favor evolution creationists done claim supernatural creation burden proof lies shermer discusses eitheror fallacy given two possible explanations something disproving one prove since truth might different creationists often claim disprove evolution offer primary evidence supernatural explanation correct shermer defines fossil fallacy scarcity transitional fossils different species proof evolution false words lack one particular piece evidence somehow negates convergence overwhelming amount evidence proves truth evolution generally creationists employ god gaps argument apparent gap scientific knowledge viewed evidence supernatural design rather area need scientific research example isaac newtons plane problem orbits planets lie approximately plane newton could think scientific reason therefore proposed god started planets motion astronomers good understanding solar system formed need supernatural explanation methodological naturalism term means life behavior universe result natural processes best arguments intelligent design richard feynman said look new law first guess words use imagination come hypothesis test see good proponents intelligent design took first step failed throw hypothesis failed testing stage instead decided use legislative process force idea classroom private schools right teach children please one could argue public schools funded taxes teach taxpayers want problematic since large number differing religious beliefs school doesnt time teach religious views origin life well instead scientific one changes generally accepted fact scientific community typically slow process one example relating evolution theory symbiogenesis says evolution driven mainly exchange genomes rather random mutations taken years theory reach point somewhat general acceptance shermer defines science testable body knowledge open rejection confirmation science utilizes hypothetical deductive method formulate hypothesis make predictions hypothesis test predictions facts worlds data hypotheses possible explanations facts need tested theories hypotheses data rather robust explanatory ideas data tested considered reliable nevertheless theories tentative subject reexamination possible rejection replacement case example ptolemaic theory planetary motion earth stationary center universe two court cases related evolution vs creationism codified scientific principle law one edwards v aguillard went way supreme court majority opinion court science creationscience science seeks naturalistic explanations case kitzmiller v dover area school district school board sued introducing book intelligent design prosecution able show quite easily reinvented version creationscience previously ruled unscientific supreme court therefore allowed presented alternative scientific theory classroom shermer describes friendly interactions william dembski paul nelson stephen c meyer proponents intelligent design although claim pursuing scientific agenda also admit believe intelligent designer judeochristian god shermer says knowledge one leading advocates intelligent design evangelical christians exception follower reverend moon member unification church identifies moon messiah looking data relating intelligent design shermer concludes religious political agenda behind whatever science think pursuing conference dembski told audience job apologetics clear ground clear obstacles prevent people coming knowledge christ theres anything think blocked growth christ free rein spirit people accepting scripture jesus christ darwinian naturalistic view phillip e johnson fountainhead intelligent design movement author wedge truth put bluntly attack naturalism religious war science meeting bible institute los angeles paul nelson acknowledged easily biggest challenge facing id community develop fullfledged theory biological design lee anne chaney professor biology christian says dont think intelligent design helpful provide things refutable organizations promoting intelligent design heavily funded right wing religious groups think christian nation rather secular one darwins father grandfather physicians darwin decided medicine wasnt liking instead chose study theology allowed study natural phenomena since could considered natural theology time religious practicing member church england lost faith gradually travels hms beagle particularly influenced cruel nature relationship predators prey felt odds concept creation beneficent god suffering humans sentient beings seemed often serve purpose case included loss year old daughter came view agnostic focused scientific research preferred make statements religion stated felt people could convinced direct arguments religion rather gradually illuminated science make minds religion shermer proposes three possible relationships science religion shermer argues third model viable theists ie believe god intervenes universe science must falsifiable must test could show false want test existence god studies see prayer scientifically measurable effect date studies adhered strict scientific controls shown measurable effect proponents intelligent design produced scientifically acceptable evidence existence god separate worlds model however problem since assumption rules science apply world science darwins thinking seems fall separate worlds category reality real use nature prove supernatural evolution created body god created soul pope john paul ii wrote encyclical truth contradict truth regarding compatibility evolution religion god beyond dominion science science outside realm god darwin edition origin species stated saw reason theory evolution considered incompatible religious beliefs survey found american scientists believe god yet poll indicated group believed validity theory evolution president jimmy carter evangelical christian also scientist accepts evolution pope john paul ii proclaimed evolution happened threat religion shermer estimates million american christians believe god used evolution guide process creating advanced forms life studies show considerable differences levels acceptance evolution among different groups democrats republicans liberals conservatives college educated without college education younger older southern states less regions shermer points many scientific facts much wider acceptance including suncentered solar system gravity continental drift germ theory disease genetic basis heredity etc shermer also argues creationist view god limiting views god mere watchmaker constructs lifeforms parts rather creator universe laws nature process evolution led formation family values social harmony enhance survival family community also led negative human attributes coming competition resources honest communication particular importance promoting social harmony religions often characterize harmonious choices moral good opposite choices bad evil shermer proposes similarity darwins theory natural selection adam smiths concept invisible hand free market economics beneficial consequences intentional shermer discusses current thinking following questions detail shermer recounts experiences esalen hot springs retreat workshop center california coast spot attracted broad spectrum creative people including scientists philosophers writers new age gurus shermer mentions long time desire visit reading autobiographical book physicist richard feynman called surely youre joking mr feynman shermer gave talk evolutionary origins morality conference evolutionary theory later returned weekend workshop science spirituality many interesting conversations time shermer notes anything generates sense awe may source spirituality science spades suggests maybe god laws natureor even nature shermer puts darwin matters evolution matters evolution matters science matters science matters preeminent story age epic saga came going intelligent design inherently supernatural explanation offers testable hypotheses science order demonstrate logical absurdity intelligent design shermer closes book amusing rewriting genesis scientific document typically every court case curriculum dispute regarding evolution includes demand equal time shermer points considerable number alternate ideas myths origin life universe ideas unscientific pseudoscientific isnt enough time typical science class discuss detail addition biblical ideas also many ideas religions shermer divides several general categories section book detailed notes referred various chapters section book lists number books also websites support intelligent design support evolution section detailed index contents book ebook edition include index since contents searched directly christopher hitchens commented book forensic polemical skill could left dead instead generously urges stop wasting time real steven pinker wrote readable wellresearched book perhaps vital scientific topic age anyone snowed thinking real scientific controversy evolution natural selection enlightened darwin matters genial intellectually robert lee hotz los angeles times explained none writes fiercely defense evolution shermer sustained indignation former creationist shermer savage shortcomings intelligent design eloquent spirituality science darwin matters assembled invaluable primer anyone caught argument wellintentioned intelligent design norman levitt states book gets high marks amiable style readability unmistakable moral passion author impressive wide range issues questions addresses levitt however indicate thinks book could benefitted bit comprehensive tania lombrozo states shermer experiences expertise make uniquely suited task explaining overwhelming evidence evolutionand attack emphasizes source resistance evolution rarely scientific details rather perceived consequences evolution atheism ethical nihilism lack jim walker wrote book appeal christians want understand evolution want feel offended
