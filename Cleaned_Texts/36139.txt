cladistics kləˈdɪstɪks ancient greek κλάδος kládos approach biological classification organisms categorized groups clades based hypotheses recent common ancestry evidence hypothesized relationships typically shared derived characteristics synapomorphies present distant groups ancestors however empirical perspective common ancestors inferences based cladistic hypothesis relationships taxa whose character states observed theoretically last common ancestor descendants constitute minimal clade importantly descendants stay overarching ancestral clade example terms worms fishes used within strict cladistic framework terms would include humans many terms normally used paraphyletically outside cladistics eg grade fruitless precisely delineatewhy especially including extinct species radiation results generation new subclades bifurcation practice sexual hybridization may blur closely related hypothesis clade rejected groupings explicitly excluded may found excluded group actually descend last common ancestor group thus emerged within group evolved misleading cladistics descendants stay ancestral group upon finding group paraphyletic way either excluded groups granted clade group branches divergence next significant eg extant sister considered stemgroupings clade principle level stands assigned unique name fully bifurcated tree adding group tree also adds additional named clade new level branch specifically also extinct groups always put sidebranch distinguishing whether actual ancestor groupings found techniques nomenclature cladistics applied disciplines biology see

today cladistics popular method inferring phylogenetic trees morphological data development effective polymerase chain reaction techniques allowed application cladistic methods biochemical molecular genetic traits organisms vastly expanding amount data available phylogenetics time cladistics rapidly became popular evolutionary biology computers made possible process large quantities data

symplesiomorphies shared ancestral character states outcome cladistic analysis cladogram treeshaped diagram interpreted represent best hypothesis phylogenetic relationships although traditionally cladograms generated largely basis morphological characters originally calculated hand genetic sequencing data computational phylogenetics commonly used phylogenetic analyses parsimony criterion abandoned many phylogeneticists favor sophisticated less parsimonious evolutionary models character state transformation cladists contend models unjustified evidence recover true correct results actual empirical data sets every cladogram based particular dataset analyzed particular method datasets tables consisting molecular morphological andor characters list operational taxonomic units otus may genes individuals populations species larger taxa presumed monophyletic therefore form together one large clade phylogenetic analysis infers branching pattern within clade different datasets different methods mention violations mentioned assumptions often result different cladograms scientific investigation show likely correct recently example cladograms like following generally accepted accurate representations ancestral relations among turtles lizards crocodilians turtles lizards crocodilians birds phylogenetic hypothesis correct last common ancestor turtles birds branch near lived earlier last common ancestor lizards birds near molecular evidence however produces cladograms like lizards turtles crocodilians birds accurate last common ancestor turtles birds lived later last common ancestor lizards birds since cladograms show two mutually exclusive hypotheses describe evolutionary history one correct cladogram right represents current universally accepted hypothesis primates including strepsirrhines like lemurs lorises common ancestor whose descendants primates form clade name primates therefore recognized clade within primates anthropoids monkeys apes humans hypothesized common ancestor whose descendants anthropoids form clade called anthropoidea prosimians hand form paraphyletic taxon name prosimii used phylogenetic nomenclature names clades prosimians instead divided clades strepsirhini haplorhini latter contains tarsiiformes anthropoidea lemurs tarsiers may looked closely related humans sense close evolutionary tree humans however perspective tarsier humans lemurs would looked close exact sense cladistics forces neutral perspective treating branches extant extinct manner also forces one try make statements honestly take account findings exact historic relationships groups following terms coined hennig used identify shared distinct character states among terms plesiomorphy apomorphy relative application depends position group within tree example trying decide whether tetrapods form clade important question whether four limbs synapomorphy earliest taxa included within tetrapoda earliest members tetrapoda inherit four limbs common ancestor whereas vertebrates least homologously contrast group within tetrapods birds four limbs plesiomorphy using two terms allows greater precision discussion homology particular allowing clear expression hierarchical relationships among different homologous features difficult decide whether character state fact thus classified synapomorphy may identify monophyletic group whether appears thus homoplasy identify group danger circular reasoning assumptions shape phylogenetic tree used justify decisions character states used evidence shape phylogenetics uses various forms parsimony decide questions conclusions reached often depend dataset methods nature empirical science reason cladists refer cladograms hypotheses relationship cladograms supported large number variety different kinds characters viewed robust based limited mono para polyphyletic taxa understood based shape tree done well based character compared table cladistics either generally specific applications criticized beginnings decisions whether particular character states homologous precondition synapomorphies challenged involving circular reasoning subjective course potential unreliability evidence problem systematic method matter empirical scientific endeavor transformed cladistics arose late attempt resolve problems removing priori assumptions phylogeny cladistic analysis remained cladistic method identify fossil species actual ancestors instead fossil taxa identified belonging separate extinct branches fossil species could actual ancestor clade way know therefore conservative hypothesis fossil taxon related fossil extant taxa implied pattern shared apomorphic otherwise extinct group extant descendants considered literally instance date extinction anything biology sex complicated messy cladistics many species reproduce sexually capable interbreeding millions years worse period many branches may radiated may take hundreds millions years whittled one theoretically assign proper last common ancestors groupings inadvertently include earlier process true cladistic bifurcation thus take much extended time one usually aware practice recent radiations cladistically guided findings give coarse impression complexity detailed account give details fractions introgressions groupings even geographic variations thereof used argument use paraphyletic typically reasons quoted horizontal gene transfer mobility genetic info different organisms immediate delayed effects reciprocal several processes nature cause horizontal gene transfer typically directly interfere ancestry organism complicate determination ancestry another level one map horizontal gene transfer processes determining phylogeny individual genes using cladistics unclarity mutual relationships lot possible trees assigning names possible clade may prudent furthermore established names discarded cladistics alternatively carry connotations may longer hold additional groups found emerged naming changes direct result changes recognition mutual relationships often still flux especially extinct species hanging older naming andor connotations counterproductive typically reflect actual mutual relationships precisely eg archaea asgard archaea protists slime molds worms invertebrata fishes reptilia monkeys ardipithecus australopithecus homo erectus contain homo sapiens cladistically sensu lato meaning originally extinct stem groups sensu lato generally means generously keeping previously included groups may come include even living species pruned sensu stricto meaning often adopted instead group would need restricted single branche stem branches get name level commensurate fact senior stem branches fact closer related resulting group basal stem branches stem branches may lived short time affect assessment cladistics comparisons used acquire data cladograms based limited field group individuals classes hypothesized common ancestor set common characteristics may may apply compared
