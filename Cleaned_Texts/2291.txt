environmental exposure toxins primary immunodeficiencies genetic disorders majority diagnosed children age one although milder forms may recognized adulthood recognized inborn errors immunity ieis vast majority pids people united states born primary immune deficiencies result persistent recurring infections autoinflammatory disorders tumors disorders various organs currently limited treatments

primary immunodeficiency depend type defect generally symptoms signs lead diagnosis immunodeficiency include recurrent persistent infections developmental delay result infection particular organ problems eg diseases involving skin heart facial development skeletal system may present certain conditions others predispose autoimmune disease immune system attacks bodys tissues tumours sometimes specific forms cancer lymphoma nature infections well additional features may provide clues exact nature immune definition primary immune deficiencies due genetic causes may result single genetic defect multifactorial may caused recessive dominant inheritance latent require certain environmental trigger become manifest like presence environment reactive allergen problems become apparent due aging bodily cellular maintenance processes basic tests performed immunodeficiency suspected include full blood count including accurate lymphocyte granulocyte counts immunoglobulin levels three important types antibodies igg iga tests performed depending suspected due rarity many primary immunodeficiencies many tests highly specialised tend performed research criteria diagnosis agreed instance antibody deficiency diagnosed presence low immunoglobulins recurrent infections failure development antibodies exposure antigens criteria also distinguish definitive probable possible diagnosis primary immunodeficiency definitive diagnosis made likely years patient chance diagnosis made level diagnosis achievable detection genetic mutation specific circumstantial abnormalities
