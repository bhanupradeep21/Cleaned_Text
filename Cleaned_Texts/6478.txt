bromeliads survive extremely wet extremely dry periods found seasonallymoist habitats tropical forests exploiting niches water supplies intermittent mesophytic plants survive likewise chaparral plants adapted mediterranean climates wet winters dry summers plants live arctic conditions also need xerophytic adaptations since water unavailable uptake ground frozen european resurrection plants haberlea rhodopensis ramonda environments high salinity mangrove swamps semideserts water uptake plants challenge due high salt ion levels environments may cause excess ions accumulate cells halophytes xerophytes evolved survive environments xerophytes may also considered halophytes however halophytes necessarily xerophytes succulent xerophyte zygophyllum xanthoxylum example specialised protein transporters cells allows storage excess ions vacuoles maintain normal cytosolic ph ionic many factors affect water availability major limiting factor seed germination seedling survival plant growth

species caudiciforms plants swollen bases used store water may also display similarities conditions water scarcity seeds different xerophytic plants behave differently means different rates germination since water availability major limiting factor dissimilarities due natural selection ecoadaptation seeds plants species evolve suit xerophytic plants less overall surface area plants reducing area exposed air reducing water loss transpiration evaporation also smaller leaves fewer branches plants example leaf surface reduction spines cactus effects compaction reduction branching
