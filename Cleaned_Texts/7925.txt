domainspecific learning theories development hold many independent specialised knowledge structures domains rather one cohesive knowledge structure thus training one domain may impact another independent domaingeneral views instead suggest children possess general developmental function skills interrelated single cognitive therefore whereas domaingeneral theories would propose acquisition language mathematical skill developed broad set cognitive skills domainspecific theories would propose genetically neurologically computationally independent domain specificity supported variety theorists early supporter jerry fodor argued mind functions partly innate domainspecific mental modularity mind fodor proposed hypothesis modest modularity stating input systems perception language

domainspecific modules genetically shaped selection pressures carry innate complex core knowledge theorists elizabeth spelke hold knowledge separated highly specialised domainspecific poverty stimulus pos argument proposed noam chomsky takes nativist view towards language acquisition suggesting innate domainspecific knowledge structures help us navigate tough linguistic environments flows contrary empiricist views learning knowledge derive sensory pos argument maintains mismatch linguistic knowledge acquire much information available us chomsky believed children empiricist learners language many linguistic principles neither simple natural acquire therefore sufficient linguistic environment would required facilitate full understanding language however data needed grasp linguistic principles always available due different environmental conditions despite normal children still able formulate accurate representation grammar led chomsky theorise children must innate domainspecific

child development regardless setting task developmental stage objections therefore raised unitary approach lack consideration variation across instead researchers proposed socialisation process involving five domains stating different parentchild relationships serve different functions rely different ways bring behavioural change different protection primarily responsible giving child sense

achieve socialisation agents goals consequently outcomes involving childs ability suppress conflicting desires make correct moral principled judgements typical guided learning aims effectively guide childrens learning strategies feedback help acquire target knowledge skills group participation parents attempt encourage shared identity child promoting routines rituals reflect group norms successful outcomes involve children conforming adopting group values build notions social identity although five domains demonstrated initial evidence input output differences socialisation
