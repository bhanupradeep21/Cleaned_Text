hypokalemic periodic paralysis hypokpp also known familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis rare autosomal dominant channelopathy characterized muscle weakness paralysis fall potassium levels blood individuals mutation attacks sometimes begin adolescence commonly occur individual triggers rest strenuous exercise attacks exercise rare high carbohydrate meals meals high sodium content sudden changes temperature even excitement noise flashing lights cold temperatures stress weakness may mild limited certain muscle groups severe fullbody paralysis attack reflexes may decreased absent attacks may last hours persist several days recovery usually sudden occurs due release potassium swollen muscles recover patients may fall abortive attack develop chronic muscle weakness later life people develop symptoms periodic paralysis due hyperthyroidism overactive thyroid entity distinguished thyroid function tests diagnosis instead called thyrotoxic periodic hypokalemic periodic paralysis condition causes episodes extreme muscle weakness typically beginning childhood adolescence often episodes involve temporary inability move muscles arms legs attacks cause severe weakness paralysis usually lasts hours days people may episodes almost every day others experience weekly monthly rarely attacks occur without warning triggered factors rest exercise viral illness certain medications often large carbohydraterich meal vigorous exercise evening trigger attack upon waking following morning although affected individuals usually regain muscle strength attacks develop persistent muscle weakness later mutations following genes cause hypokalemic periodic paralysis association voltagegated potassium channel also described currently excluded disease definition action potentials central nervous system cause endplate potentials nmj causes sodium ions enter depolarise muscle cells depolarisation propagates ttubules triggers entry calcium ions via well sarcoplasmic reticulum associated ryanodine receptor causes contraction tensing muscle depolarisation motor end plate causes potassium ions leave muscle cells repolarising muscle closing calcium channels calcium pumped away contractile apparatus muscle relaxescitation needed mutations altering usual structure function channels therefore disrupt regulation muscle contraction leading episodes severe muscle weakness paralysis mutations identified arginine residues making voltage sensor voltage sensor comprises alpha helix four transmembrane domains iiv protein contains basic residues allow entry positive sodium ions appropriate membrane voltages blocking opening channel pore mutations also found domains ii iv mutations lossoffunction channels open normallycitation needed patients mutations therefore channel reduced excitability signals central nervous system unable depolarise muscle result muscle contract efficiently paralysis condition hypokalemic manifests potassium low causing hypokalemia low extracellular potassium ion concentration cause muscle repolarise resting potential quickly even calcium conductance occur sustained becomes difficult reach calcium threshold muscle contract even reached muscle likely relax severity would reduced potassium ion concentrations kept mutations lead hypokalemic periodic paralysis cardiac arrhythmias called syndromecitation needed contrast hyperkalemic periodic paralysis refers gainoffunction mutations sodium channels maintain muscle depolarisation therefore aggravated high potassium ion concentrationscitation needed condition inherited autosomal dominant pattern high proportion sporadic cases means one copy altered gene cell sufficient cause disordercitation needed diagnosis achieved specialized form electromyographic emg testing called long exercise test test measures amplitude nerve response called compound muscle action potential cmap minutes following minutes exercise affected patients progressive fall amplitude potential besides patient history report serum potassium low normal low attack long exercise test current standard medical testing genetic diagnosis often unreliable common gene locations tested even extensive testing people clinical diagnosis hypokalemic periodic paralysis known mutation two known standard emg testing diagnose patient unless full blown attack time testing provoking attack exercise diet trying oral potassium diagnostic also dangerous form pp alternate form known hyperkalemic periodic paralysis symptoms almost treatment different old glucose insulin challenge dangerous risky point lifethreatening never done options readily availablecitation needed factors known trigger episodes stress cold environment hypothermia carbohydrate load infection glucose infusion metabolic alkalosis alcohol strenuous exercise steroidscitation needed people hypokalemic periodic paralysis often misdiagnosed conversion disorder hysterical paralysis since weakness musclebased doesnt correspond nerve spinal root distributions tendency people hypokalemic periodic paralysis get paralyzed epinephrine released fight flight situations adds temptation misdiagnose disorder treatment hypokalemic periodic paralysis focuses preventing attacks relieving acute symptoms avoiding carbohydraterich meals strenuous exercise identified triggers taking acetazolamide another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor may help prevent attacks weakness patients also take potassiumsparing diuretics spironolactone help maintain potassium paralysis attacks managed drinking one various potassium salts dissolved water debate exists one particular best used potassium chloride bicarbonate common rapidly absorbed boluses liquid potassium generally needed abort attack patients also find positive maintenance results timereleased potassium tablets iv potassium seldom justified unless patient unable swallow daily potassium dosage may need much higher potassium replacement simple hypokalemia meqs potassium often needed manage daily fluctuations muscle strength functioncitation needed perioperatively prevention includes avoiding neuromuscular blockade avoid excessive hyperventilation warm patient provide adequate hydration avoid glucose infusions give diuretics closely monitor electrocardiogram signs hypokalemia normal saline preferred iv solution patients familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis glucose containing solutions may cause weakness additionally high chloride content cause mild acidosis would preferred alkalosiscitation needed prognosis periodic paralysis varies overactivity diet low sodium carbohydrates simply unfortunate gene mutation lead type chronic low level weakness called abortive attack permanent muscle damage abortive attacks often respond extra potassium cutting carbohydrates getting plenty rest increasing doses medication gentle daily exercise short walks permanent muscle weakness sounds like permanent irreparable damage muscles associated weakness vacuoles tubular aggregates form destroy healthy muscle tissue type damage typically observed via muscle biopsy even anabolic steroids repair type muscular damagecitation needed life span expected attacks drop potassium levels low enough cause lifethreatening breathing problems heart arrhythmia patients often report muscle pain cognitive problems attacks migraines occur hypokalemic periodic paralysis patients may include less common symptoms like phantom smells sensitivity light sound loss words medical literatures states muscle strength normal attacks patients often report baseline strength fact lower healthy individualscitation needed dozens possible gene mutations drugs treatments work fine one patient work another example patients well acetazolamide dont patients well extra magnesium bodys natural ion channel blocker fish oil nutrients make patients worse patients caregivers take extreme caution new drugs treatment planscitation needed scottish physician dr mary walker first recognise association familial periodical paralysis hypokalaemia also described glucose challenge test used diagnosing hypokalaemic periodic paralysis use intravenous potassium
