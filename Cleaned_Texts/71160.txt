notexin toxin produced tiger snake notechis scutatus myotoxic presynaptic neurotoxic phospholipase enzymes hydrolyze bond fatty acid tail glycerol fatty acids name notexin comes fact toxin first found major component venom tiger name notexin thus combination genus name notechis word toxin tiger snake first described wilhelm peters toxin first purified hundred years later karlsson et prompted research notexin consists single molecule molecule singlepeptide chain amino acid residues crosslinked xray diffraction used determine crystal structure notexin led conclusion notexin belongs either space group lattice parameters b å c å β data found resolution å rfactor protein data rfactor usually indicating crystal structure notexin relatively well defined supramolecular structure notexin similar notexin many contain four characteristic main helices αa αb αc αe helices short carboxyl end helix secondary structure also active site seems similar enough order use model building studies discussing enzymatic properties notexin deviate significantly due different main chain lengths conformation amino acid active site notexin contains residue close contact carboxylate oxygens residue also present wall active site covered hydrophobic residues lone pair oxygen water attacks ester residue facilitates proton transfer substratess carbonyl oxygen possibly fixated stabilized positively charged nhgroups notexin generally lethal enters bloodstream rats lethal effect result presynaptic blockade transmission across neuromuscular junctions breathing muscles causing asphyxiation also shown myotoxic effects upon intravenous myotoxic effects generally entail muscle proposed dixon et al myotoxicity notexin result notexin binding sarcolemma causing hypercontraction thereby muscle necrosis result membrane places hypercontraction presynaptic activity however much potent least notexin causes indirect reduction complete end release acetylcholine affected nerve terminals acetylcholine normally causes action potential thereby muscle contraction found reduction acetylcholine release caused impaired recycling synaptic vesicles reduction content synaptic vesicles abnormally large vesicles observed affected tissues followed shrinking nerve terminals amount vesicles terminals exact way interaction cell unknown suggested notexin like interacts highaffinity specific protein receptors lowaffinity lipid domains muscle cells motor neurons interaction notexin plasma membrane results hydrolysis phospholipids cell study showed without activity notexin also membrane damaging effects suggesting notexin multiple mechanisms damage cell membrane cell membranes become permeable ions cause influx extracellular medium muscle cells influx causes hypercontraction myofilaments cause mechanical damage plasma mitochondria take eventually leading reduced mitochondrial functionality high concentration cytosol activates proteinases endogenous phospholipase calpains degrade cytoskeletal components cell phospholipase hydrolyses cell membrane leads cell degradation bigger influx certain point damage irreversible necrosis cell neurons influx calcium causes release readytorelease synaptic vesicles reserve pool synaptic research showed neurons treatment notexin strongly reduced numbers synaptic vesicles results seem indicate notexin inhibits endocytosis new synaptic vesicles besides exocytosis result like muscle cells influx neurons also leads reduced mitochondrial functionality activation calpains endogenous leads structural damage muscle experimental research also showed notexinhad nephrotoxic effects mice showed depending dose renal tubular glomerular damage within hours much metabolism notexin known however studies shown toxin made ineffective specific certain study mice become resistant notexin similar isoforms toxin venoms origin done exposing mice nondetoxified notexin found cterminal part notexin peptide chain binding site antibodies thus known site antigenic another study showed least antigens able block effects notexin certain antibodies also shown different affinities different notexin isoforms different isoforms occur snakes different geographical thus case notexin antibodies necessarily bind notexin isoforms affinity notexin causes pain site bite followed excessive salivation weakness drowsiness difficulty breathing decreased blood pressure paralysis lips larynx tongue facial muscles possibly blurring vision ptosis headaches convulsions may also research reaction notexin humans however known upon injection toxin muscle damage myoglobinuria data shown tiger snake one major causes snake bites australia leading second common cause death several results toxic effects notexin rodents injecting μg pure toxin rat soleus muscle destroy muscle mice mgkg applied subcutaneously mgkg applied also researches functional morphological properties regrowing mouse extensor digitorum longus edl muscles notexin injection three days injection complete fiber breakdown loss functional capacity ten days muscles made entirely regrowing notexin antivenom available market two general tiger snake antivenoms available
