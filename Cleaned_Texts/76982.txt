interstitial nephritis also known tubulointerstitial nephritis inflammation area kidney known renal interstitium consists collection cells extracellular matrix fluid surrounding renal tubules also known intestinal nephritis clinical picture may include mesenteric lymphadenitis cases acute pyelonephritis mostly due use nsaids specifically case recurrent urinary tract infection secondary infection spread adjacent addition providing scaffolding support tubular architecture interstitium shown participate fluid electrolyte exchange well endocrine functions variety known factors provoke inflammatory process within renal interstitium including pharmacologic environmental infectious systemic disease contributors spectrum disease presentation range acute process chronic condition progressive tubular cell damage renal dysfunction interstitial nephritis may present variety signs symptoms many nonspecific fever common occurring patients particularly druginduced interstitial general symptoms occur variable frequency include nausea vomiting fatigue lack appetite weight loss specific symptoms flank pain pain urination visible blood urine well signs like hypertension helpful
