function acute chronic states following clinical experiences inspirations klein completed postdoctoral training immunology harvard medical klein first demonstrate hiv envelope protein could induce calcium transients neurons astrocytes via chemokine receptor first author paper journal immunology highlighting findings provided basis understanding neuronal damage inflammation result klein helped discover deficiency chemokine receptor decreased monocyte recruitment cns help reduce symptoms experimental autoimmune klein first author paper development reported chemokine receptor important cerebellar granule cell proliferation klein work continually shown immune signalling brain contributes brain disease pathogenesis cognitive defects could treated immune targeting therapies klein completed postdoctoral work recruited washington university school medicine st louis missouri wusm klein appointed still holds professorships departments medicine pathology immunology klein arrived

scientists work probe neuroimmune mechanisms underlying pathogenesis brain related klein named vice provost assistant dean graduate education division biology biomedical addition promoting departmental collaborations ensuring graduate students supported pursuits variety different career paths klein focusing improving diversity equity program recruiting students underrepresented goals line kleins past achievements involvements advocating diversity equity codirector amgen scholars program washington university ensuring diverse group undergraduate students opportunity experience science top president academic women network washington university school medicine klein promotes career development mentorship women klein conducted research gender bias conference organization highlighting fact conference committee composition matters selection diverse klein reports naming problem first step solving suggesting conducting quantitative studies gender bias scientific meetings hiring acceptances grant awards etc first step towards actually solving issues increasing representation research klein lab focused exploring cellular molecular mechanisms orchestrate inflammation mediate effect central nervous lab looks specifically inflammation result viral autoimmune encephalitides via interactions endothelial neural immune cell interactions lab focused two main mechanisms immune system signals interacts central nervous system first leukocytes infiltrating brain second cytokines chemokines directly affecting neuronal lab extensively explored cytokines chemokines affect blood brain barrier permeability lab discovered novel role cytokines chemokines regulation bloodbrain barrier permeability arboviruses protective versus pathogenic example since west nile virus shown cause significant brain damage leading memory loss klein lab researches ways prevent found microglia brain innate immune cells accumulate around neurons site infection complement protein also highly expressed site klein also found microglia remain active long infection clears leading postinfection inflammation synapse findings signify increased neuronal pruning destruction microglia leading memory loss patients west nile virus since inflammatory cues infection regulate central nervous system repair via regulation neural stem cells yet another mechanism klein lab probes understand viral infections demyelinating diseases cause impaired learning memory lab specifically explores cues drive localization proliferation differentiation neural stem cells mediate ability successfully repair damaged neurons since demyelinating diseases focus lab klein made discovery multiple sclerosis ms disproportionally effects women compared men due higher expression blood vessel receptor protein protein expressed even higher levels ms patients brain regions affected another goal klein lab understand glial cells regulate cell activity viral infections autoimmune inflammation research areas highlighted extensive communication astrocytes cells astrocytes play critical role trafficking cells throughout cns disease overall kleins work contributes increased understanding normal central nervous system surveillance relationship inflammatory patterns observed disease states ultimately helps identify therapeutic targets wide array brain diseases lack cures treatments
