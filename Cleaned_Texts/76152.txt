working memory previously stated memory system stores manipulates information complete cognitive tasks completed demonstrates great declines aging process various theories offered explain changes may

cited areascitation needed theorists argue capacity working memory decreases age hence people able hold less theory declines working memory described result limiting amount information individual simultaneously keep active higher degree integration manipulation information possible products earlier memory processing forgotten subsequent another theory examined explain age related declines working memory limit attentional resources seen age means older individuals less capable dividing attention two tasks thus tasks higher attentional demands difficult complete due reduction mental

working memory deficits result various studies completed examining topic salthouse argues one ages speed processing information decreases significantly decrease processing speed responsible inability

support group ways avoid contrast implicit procedural memory typically shows decline types shortterm memory show little semantic knowledge eg vocabulary actually improves addition enhancement seen memory emotional events also maintained losing working memory cited primary reason decline variety cognitive tasks due aging tasks include longterm memory problem solving decision making working memory involves manipulation information obtained using information complete task example ability one recite numbers given backwards requires working memory rather simple rehearsal numbers would require shortterm memory ones ability tap ones working memory declines aging process seen complex task difficulty aging person completing task active reorganization manipulation information becomes increasingly harder adults older individual completing task conversation work using working memory help complete task age ability multitask seems decline thus interruption often difficult aging individual successfully finish task additionally working memory plays role comprehension production speech often decline sentence comprehension sentence production individuals age rather linking decline directly deficits linguistic ability actually deficits working memory contribute decreasing language research memory aging focused older adults perform worse particular memory task however researchers also discovered simply saying older adults thing less always accurate cases older adults seem using different strategies younger adults example brain imaging studies revealed older adults likely use hemispheres completing memory tasks younger addition older adults sometimes show positivity effect remembering information seems result increased focus regulating emotion seen instance eye tracking reveals older adults showed preferential looking toward happy faces away sad httpsenwikipediaorgwikimemoryandaging
