evolutionary biology developmental bias refers production towards certain ontogenetic trajectories ultimately influence direction outcome evolutionary change affecting rates magnitudes directions limits trait historically term synonymous developmental however latter recently interpreted referring solely negative role development modern evolutionary biology idea developmental bias embedded current thought called structuralism emphasizes role organism causal force evolutionary needed structuralist view phenotypic evolution result action natural selection previously filtered variation course contrasts functionalist also adaptationist panselectionist externalist view phenotypic evolution results interaction deterministic action natural selection variation caused rationale behind role organism specifically embryo causal force evolution existence bias follows traditional neodarwinian approach explain process behind evolutionary change natural selection acting upon heritable variation caused genetic however natural selection acts phenotypes mutation produce phenotypic variation thus conceptual gap regarding connection mutation potential change mutation readily alter phenotype hence visible natural selection modify ontogenetic trajectory process referred developmental kinds reprogramming likely occur others given nature map determines propensity system vary particular thus creating bias words underlying architecture developmental systems influences kinds possible phenotypic outcomes however developmental bias evolve natural selection processes simultaneously influence phenotypic evolution example developmental bias affect rate path adaptive peak highfitness conversely strong directional selection modify developmental bias increase phenotypic variation direction developmental constraints limitations phenotypic variability absence variation caused inherent structure dynamics developmental constraints bias certain ontogenetic trajectory consequently thought limit adaptive developmental drive inherent natural tendency organisms ontogenetic trajectories change particular direction ie bias towards certain ontogenetic type bias thought facilitate adaptive evolution aligning phenotypic variability direction morphospace quantitative representation phenotypes multidimensional space dimension corresponds trait phenotype

exist natural process generates almostevenly quasi stochastic distributed pattern phenotypes morphospace regarding new species necessary tend occupy point morphospace close phylogenetic however widely acknowledged organisms evenly distributed along morphospace ie isotropic variation instead nonrandomly distributed ie anisotropic words exists discordance apparent theoretical possible phenotypes actual thus phenotypes inaccessible impossible due underlying architecture developmental trajectory others accessible however possible phenotypes easier probable occur example phenotype classical figure dragon ie giant reptilelike creature two pairs limbs anterior pair wings may impossible vertebrates forelimbs anterior pair wings homologous characters eg birds bats thus mutually exclusive hand two phenotypes possible equally fit one form reprogramming requires one mutation requires two former likely occur assuming genetic mutations occur important distinction structuralism functionalism regards primarily interpretation causes empty regions morphospace inexistent phenotypes functionalist view empty spaces correspond phenotypes ontogenetically possible equally probable eliminated natural selection due low contrast structuralist view empty spaces correspond ontogenetically impossible improbable thus implying bias types phenotypes produced assuming equal amounts variation genetic mutations classical natural example bias shown small proportion possible snail shell shapes realized nature actual species confined discrete regions shellmorphospace rather continuously another natural example shown soildwelling centipedes enormous variation number pairs legs lowest highest pairs however species even number leg pairs suggests either phenotypes somehow restricted development developmental drive odd conversely developmental abnormalities teratologies also used classic example understand logic behind mechanisms produce example wide range animals fish humans twoheaded organisms much common threeheaded organisms similarly siamese twins theoretically could fuse region body fusion occurs frequently abdominal trend referred transpecific parallelism
