emphasis placed simple practical construction particular locomotives characterised high tractive power smaller types generally based lower speed favour tractive standardgauge locomotives category particularly suitable shunting operating purposes branch light railways especially narrowgauge railways steep gradients tight curves generally light superstructure substructure locomotives two axles often meet requirements terms tractive force caused wear track wheel tyres due wheel load therefore larger locomotives axles available shown twoaxle coupled locomotives full weight machines three coupled axles used adhesion weight however since wheel pressure distributed six wheels instead four locomotives category could run much lighter rails twoaxle locomotives weight therefore tractive force type locomotive could therefore used wherever existing track required powerful locomotive possible without exceeding permissible wheel pressure superstructure constructed relatively lightly particularly longer lines latter considered sake substantial savings however track curves must larger using locomotive locomotive travel small curves light superstructure advisable purchase locomotive two axles svivelling axle type especially suitable longer distances allowed light superstructure also able carry larger supplies locomotives wheel pressure design also advantage centre gravity could set lower types together large wheelbase gave machines particularly smooth ride could also run relatively higher speed according mainly suitable small railways feeder lines depending particular
