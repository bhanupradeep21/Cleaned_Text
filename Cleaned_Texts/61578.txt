broken escalator phenomenon also known escalator effect walker effect sensation losing balance confusion dizziness reported people stepping onto escalator working said brief odd sensation imbalance despite full awareness escalator going shown effect causes people step inappropriately fast onto moving platform longer moving even obvious participant even though subjects fully aware platform escalator moving parts brains still act previous experience gained moving misjudge step onto thus effect demonstrates separateness declarative procedural functions brain broken escalator phenomenon result locomotor aftereffect replicates posture adopted walking onto moving platform stabilise aftereffect studied adolfo bronstein raymond reynolds experiment published explored series additional experiments bronstein associates phenomenon originally discussed brian simpson named escalator effect regarded perceptual consequence failed expectation thought something common duncker also considered related sensation experienced alighting stationary bronstein reynolds initial experiment attempted reproduce conditions broken escalator phenomenon asking subjects walk onto stationary sled trials walk onto moving moving trials finally stationary trials subjects experienced aftereffect walking onto stationary sled trials characterised forward sway torso increased walking speed increased muscular leg activity measured emg compared condition subjects expressed surprise behaviour compared experience walking onto outoforder aftereffect found direct consequence motor adaptation facing external threat balance central nervous system trigger neural processes order stabilise case walking onto moving platform moving escalator people adopt methods prevent backwards fall moving trials experiment methods consist forward sway torso increased gait velocity increased leg emg thus step onto moving escalator alter posture gait order stabilise external threat aftereffect consists inappropriate expression method trials instead walking onto stationary sled way trials subjects adopted similar method moving trials resulted walking inappropriately fast excessively swaying torso stepping onto sled leading sensation similarly walking onto non moving escalator people adopt method use moving escalator therefore almost failing keep balance broken escalator phenomenon result dissociation declarative procedural functions central nervous system central nervous system enables us adapt movement escalator however locomotor adaptation inappropriately expressed walking onto broken escalator aware escalator move still modify gait posture adapt movement shows separation declarative cognitive system procedural motor system know brain declarative memory processes memories consciously aware whereas procedural memory processes fact walk inappropriately fast onto escalator know broken evidence motor adaptation without declarative memory motor system operates without cognitive control leading unconscious generation aftereffect subjects additional experiment indeed unable suppress aftereffect even consciously voluntarily attempting bronstein et al remarked signs aftereffect could measured footsled contact suggesting aftereffect labelled preemptive postural aftereffect preemptive anticipates threat balance rather triggered one postural control usually generated external threat example slippery surface lead cautionary gait case postural adaptation aversive case stepping onto broken escalator person anticipate movement make sure would fall escalator move person undertakes worst case scenario seems strategic option preparing platform move even though wont better indeed well distinction motor cognitive systems another factor leading aftereffect argued fearrelated mechanisms fear falling somehow escalator moved could enough adopt precautionary behaviour despite knowledge broken fearrelated mechanisms indeed known impervious cognitive however another experiment demonstrated aftereffect intense subjects walked onto stationary sled opposite leg one theyd stepped moving trials aftereffect generated fear platform would move would triggered whenever however subject stepped onto therefore suggests aftereffect mainly generated procedural memory intense conditions adaptation phase perfectly replicated aftereffect internally generated postural threat must dealt without braking system reduce impact balance would fall stepping onto stationary escalator external threats balance dealt vestibular however experiment showed intensity aftereffect subjects lacking vestibular function labyrinthine defective subjects superior normal subjects suggesting vestibular system responsible braking instead first trial aftereffect strongest increase leg emg activity observed subjects increase generated unconsciously footsled braking aftereffect therefore anticipatory process rather triggered external threat central nervous system anticipates aftereffect occur threaten balance generates mechanisms deal stepping onto stationary escalator anticipatory motor mechanisms prevent us falling attenuating aftereffect
