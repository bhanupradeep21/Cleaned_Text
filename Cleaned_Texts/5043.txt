syringomyelia generic term referring disorder cyst cavity forms within spinal cord often syringomyelia used generic term etiology cyst called syrinx expand elongate time destroying spinal cord damage may result loss feeling paralysis stiffness back shoulders extremities syringomyelia may also cause loss ability feel extremes hot cold especially hands may also lead capelike bilateral loss pain temperature sensation along upper chest arms combination symptoms varies one patient another depending location syrinx within spinal cord well extent syringomyelia prevalence estimated cases per symptoms usually beginning young adulthood signs disorder tend develop slowly although sudden onset may occur coughing straining myelopathy syringomyelia causes wide variety neuropathic symptoms due damage spinal cord patients may experience severe chronic pain abnormal sensations loss sensation particularly hands patients experience paralysis paresis temporarily permanently syrinx may also cause disruptions parasympathetic sympathetic nervous systems leading abnormal body temperature sweating bowel control issues problems syrinx higher spinal cord affecting brainstem syringobulbia vocal cord paralysis ipsilateral tongue wasting trigeminal nerve sensory loss signs may rarely bladder stones occur onset weakness lower classically syringomyelia spares dorsal columnmedial lemniscus spinal cord leaving pressure vibration touch proprioception intact upper extremities neuropathic arthropathy also known charcot joint occur particularly shoulders patients loss sensory fibers joint theorized lead degeneration joint generally two forms syringomyelia congenital acquired syringomyelia generally chronic disorder occurs time resulting muscular atrophy acquired syringomyelia caused serious physical trauma body road traffic accident syringomyelia also classified communicating noncommunicating forms communicating typically occurs due lesions foramen magnum noncommunicating occurring due spinal cord first major form relates abnormality brain called malformation chiari malformation common cause syringomyelia anatomic abnormality may due small posterior fossa causes lower part cerebellum protrude normal location back head cervical neck portion spinal canal syrinx may develop cervical region spinal cord symptoms usually begin ages may worsen straining called valsalva maneuver activity causes cerebrospinal fluid pressure fluctuate suddenly patients however may long periods stability patients form disorder also hydrocephalus cerebrospinal fluid accumulates skull condition called arachnoiditis covering spinal arachnoid cases syringomyelia familial although second major form syringomyelia occurs complication trauma meningitis hemorrhage tumor arachnoiditis syrinx cyst develops segment spinal cord damaged one conditions syrinx starts expand sometimes referred noncommunicating syringomyelia symptoms may appear months even years initial injury starting pain weakness sensory impairment originating site primary symptom posttraumatic syringomyelia often referred using abbreviation pain may spread upward site injury symptoms pain numbness weakness disruption temperature sensation may limited one side body syringomyelia also adversely affect sweating sexual function later bladder bowel control typical cause pts would car accident similar trauma involving whiplash make pts difficult diagnose fact symptoms often first appear long actual cause syrinx occurred eg car accident occurring patient first experiencing pts symptoms pain loss sensation reduced ability skin feel varying degrees hot cold number months car pathogenesis syringomyelia debated cerebrospinal fluid also serves cushion brain excess cerebrospinal fluid central canal spinal cord called hydromyelia term refers increased cerebrospinal fluid contained within ependyma central canal fluid dissects surrounding white matter forming cystic cavity syrinx term syringomyelia applied conditions coexist majority cases term syringohydromyelia applied terms used observed obstruction cerebrospinal fluid spaces subarachnoid space result syrinx formation alleviation obstruction may improve symptoms number pathological conditions cause obstruction normal cerebrospinal fluid spaces include chiari malformation spinal arachnoiditis scoliosis spinal vertebrae misalignment spinal tumors spina bifida others reasons blockage cerebrospinal fluid space within subarachnoid space result syrinx formation fully understood although small posterior fossa one known cause unclear syrinx fluid originates bulk movement cerebrospinal fluid spinal cord bulk transmural movement blood fluids spinal vasculature syrinx combination recent work suggests central nervous system compliance underlying problem central nervous system also hydrocephalus syringomyelia related physicians use magnetic resonance imaging mri diagnose syringomyelia mri radiographer takes images body anatomy brain spinal cord vivid detail test show syrinx spine conditions presence tumor mri safe painless informative greatly improved diagnosis physician may order additional tests help confirm diagnosis one called electromyography emg show possible lower motor neuron note test isnt used diagnostically injuries spine nerves musclesthis would part patients rehab routine addition computed axial tomography ct scans patients head may reveal presence tumors abnormalities like mri ct scans another test called myelogram uses radiographs requires contrast medium injected subarachnoid space since introduction mri test rarely necessary diagnose possible causes trauma tumors congenital defects usually observed part spinal cord corresponding neck area symptoms due spinal cord damage include pain decreased sensation touch weakness loss muscle tissue diagnosis confirmed spinal ct myelogram mri spinal cord cavity may reduced surgical furthermore evidence also suggests impact injuries thorax area highly correlate occurrence cervicallocated treating syringomyelia sometimes requires surgery surgery involving spinal cord carries certain risks medical treatment potential benefits weighed possible complications hand delaying treatment increase risk permanent damage evaluation condition necessary syringomyelia remain stationary long periods time cases progress main goal surgical intervention correct condition led formation syrinx draining syrinx also help preventing becoming worse symptoms syrinx already caused may go awaycitation needed cases involving malformation main goal surgery provide space cerebellum base skull upper cervical spine without entering brain spinal cord often causes syrinx shrink disappear time normal flow cerebrospinal fluid restored syringomyelia caused tumor removing tumor possible treatment patients symptoms stabilize modest improvement following surgery syringomyelia come back however requiring additional surgeries may less cases including communicating noncommunicating forms condition syrinx may require ongoing drainage done shunt uses tubes valves let cerebrospinal fluid csf drain syrinx another cavity within body usually abdomen type shunt called ventriculoperitoneal shunt particularly useful cases involving hydrocephalus continually draining syrinx shunt arrest progression symptoms relieve pain headache many factors affect decision use shunt risks injury spinal cord infection drainage becoming blocked bleeding always achieve intended results draining fluid quickly produce better outcomes syrinxes shunt drainage case traumarelated syringomyelia surgeon operates level initial injury syrinx collapses surgery tube shunt usually necessary prevent surgery always recommended syringomyelia patients medication cure condition many patients main treatment analgesia manage symptoms physicians specializing pain management develop medication treatment plan ameliorate pain medications combat neuropathic pain symptoms shooting stabbing pains eg gabapentin pregabalin would firstline choices opiates usually prescribed pain management condition conversely facet joint injections indicated treatment radiation rare may used tumor involved cases halt extension cavity may help alleviate treatment usually reserved cases causing symptoms treatment may provide enough benefits recommended elderly patients symptoms stable instead worsening whether treated many patients advised avoid activities involve conservative approach may recommended natural history syringomyelia yet well understood surgery currently advised patients monitored regular physical evaluations precise causes syringomyelia still unknown although blockage flow cerebrospinal fluid known important factor since scientists uk us continue explore mechanisms lead formation syrinxes spinal cord demonstrated block free flow cerebrospinal fluid contributing factor pathogenesis disease duke university america warwick university conducting research explore genetic features surgical techniques also refined neurosurgical research community successful procedures expand area around cerebellum spinal cord improving flow cerebrospinal fluid thereby reducing also important understand role birth defects development hindbrain malformations lead syringomyelia syringomyelia feature intrauterine life also associated spina bifida learning defects occur development fetus help understanding similar disorders may lead preventive treatment stop formation birth diagnostic technology another area continued research mri enabled scientists see situation within spine including syringomyelia symptoms appear new technology known dynamic mri allows investigators view spinal fluid flow within syrinx ct scans allow physicians see abnormalities brain diagnostic tests also improved greatly availability
