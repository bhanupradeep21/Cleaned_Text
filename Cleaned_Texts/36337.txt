genital trauma trauma genitalia doctors nurses conducting sexual assault examinations collecting evidence victims assault years amount scientific data collected genital injuries postsexual assault still minimal therefore available evidence show specific patterns injury resulting sexual motivation investigating collecting data genital injuries primarily within context legal system proving disproving sexual assault rather medical purposes studies done past years relation sexual assault cases judicial system laid groundwork interpreting sexual assault injuries important research genital injuries broadly relating sexual activity sexual assault improve medical knowledge methods studying documenting genital injury greatly improved use tissue staining dyes colposcopy first studies used newer methods retrospective chart reviews done hospital doctor nurse studies used several different methods identify document injuries direct visualization colposcopy andor tissue staining dyes earlier studies used direct visualization vaginal trauma possible consensual nonconsensual intercourse difficult determine circumstances trauma occurs based physical examination difficult differentiate injuries consensual sex injuries sexual assault women three times likely vaginal injuries intercourserelated injuries forced assault consensual sexual vaginal lacerations happen consensual non consensual intercourse might need surgery victims forced assault need additional services police intervention trauma little research minor injuries adult premenopausal women adolescent girls postmenopausal women require surgery factors predispose women vaginal injury consensual sex things include first sexual experience pregnancy vigorous penetration vaginal atrophy spasm previous operation radiation therapy disproportionate genitalia penile ornamentation congenital vaginal intercourse missionary position legs tilted way back penis reaches deepest penetration extreme rotation uterus leads hyper distention vaginal wall cases cause rupture position likely position vaginal laceration vaginal wall right side commonly torn site vaginal lengthening lubrication usually occurs naturally consensual sexual situation vaginal tearing occur rape victims two things occur consistent fact injuries result sexual assault consensual inability produce adequate vaginal lubrication dilatation thought underlying cause severe tears upper area intercourserelated lacerations range superficial tears severe lacerations tears rarely extend rectal lumen peritoneal cavity rectovaginal injuries usually result assault foreign object rape accidental gynecologic injury injuries severity resulted consensual sex posterior right vaginal fornix lacerations known occur consensual vaginal intercourse location lacerations usually based womans reproductive anatomy common women uterus lies slightly right exposes right fornix makes easier type tearing trauma lacerations posterior pericervical vagina tend occur missionary position hips legs hyperflexed positions also expose posterior vaginal wall usually protected cervix allows posterior fornix tears tears upper area vagina often reported consensual intercourse forced intercourse complications severe vaginal lacerations assault include hemoperitoneum pneumoperitoneum retroperitoneal hematoma without vaginal perforation tears along long axis vagina posterior fourchette lacerations likely occur rape lacerations tears hymen common indicative consensual nonconsensual diagnosing treating vaginal trauma often difficult delayed due sensitive personal nature types injuries also may enhanced patient young repair genital injuries require suture bleeding area usually bleeding results extreme vaginal tears copious leading hemorrhagic shock patient may need blood transfusion treatment lacerations could warrant surgical vulvar trauma common prepubertal children due small labial fat pads physical activity adults protected though injuries serious accidental minor blunt traumas common type injury straddle injury incurred normal activities like bicycle riding due vascularity vulva may form large hematoma injured vulva also injured sexual assault vulvar trauma occur concurrently vaginal trauma especially sharp object vaginal trauma occur something inserted vagina example sharp object causing penetrating vaginal trauma occur result initial painful sexual experience sexual vaginal trauma occur children result straddle injury though distressing serious injuries instances severe injury occurs requires immediate medical attention especially bleeding vaginal trauma occurs penile trauma take several forms abrasions caused zipper injury fractures caused sexual one type penile trauma penile amputation penile amputation rare injury considered emergency urological condition reasons may occur selfmutilation psychiatric disturbances sexual need accidents iatrogenic injuries revenge marriage breakdown since
