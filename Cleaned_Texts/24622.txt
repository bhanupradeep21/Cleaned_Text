separated shoulder also known acromioclavicular joint injury common injury acromioclavicular ac joint located outer end clavicle attaches acromion symptoms include nonradiating pain may make difficult move shoulder presence swelling bruising deformity shoulder also common depending severe dislocation commonly due fall onto front upper part shoulder arm classified type ii iii iv v vi higher number severe diagnosis typically based physical examination type ii injuries minimal deformity type iii injury deformity resolves upon lifting arm type iv v vi deformity resolve lifting generally types ii treated without surgery type iii may treated without surgery types iv v vi treated type ii treatment usually sling pain medications week type iii injuries surgery generally done symptoms remain following treatment without separated shoulder common injury among involved sports especially contact makes half shoulder injuries among play hockey football affected typically years males often

rugby snowboarding skateboarding crack whip cycling roller derby separation classified types increasing severity severe common mechanism injury fall tip shoulder also fall outstretched hand falls force transmitted indirectly often acromioclavicular ligament affected coracoclavicular ligaments remain ice hockey separation sometimes due lateral force one gets forcefully checked side acromion scapula connected clavicle superior acromioclavicular ligament coracoclavicular ligaments connect clavicle coracoid process two ligaments form coracoclavicular ligaments trapezoid conoid ligaments

treatment separated shoulder depends severity injury beginning treatment first steps control inflammation rest ice joint antiinflammatories ibuprofen may also relieve pain inflammation joint iced every four hours fifteen minutes time type type ii shoulder separation common types rarely need however risk arthritis type ii separations greatly increased becomes severe mumford procedure distal clavicle excision performedcitation needed nonsurgical treatment options include first immobilizing arm sling approximately weeks followed gradually improving shoulder movement using physical therapy build muscles help stabilize literature regarding longterm followup surgical repair type iii injuries scarce treated nonoperatively generally quite many studies come conclusion nonsurgical treatment good better surgical treatment anything attained surgery quite appears body remodels joint either expanding distal clavicle causing may also potential surgical repair may less painful long run pain eased rangeofmotion exercises started followed strength training program strength training include strengthening rotator cuff shoulder blade muscles cases pain goes away three weeks although full recovery take six weeks type ii twelve weeks type iii separated shoulder often return full function although may continued pain area ac joint continued pain things maybe causing may due abnormal contact bone ends joint motion development arthritis injury piece cushioning cartilage found bone ends surgical interventions including repositioning shoulder joint repairing torn ligaments may necessary severe injuries shoulder medical device implants including coracoclavicular screws hook plate fixation pins surgical wire may necessary repair devices need surgically removed shoulder healed allografts biological grafts arthroscopicassisted coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction may also type iv v vi shoulder separations uncommon require surgery debate among orthopedic surgeons however treatment type iii shoulder many type iii shoulder separation undergo surgical treatment recover well receive avoid added risks surgery may type iii injuries opt surgery often faster recovery times avoid hospitalization able return work sports studies suggest early surgical treatment type iii separation may benefit laborers athletes perform overhead motions potential benefit surgical treatment type iii remains many surgeries described complete acromioclavicular separations including arthroscopic surgery consensus best focus attempting restore horizontal well vertical instability review found although horizontal stability reliably restored additional acromioclavicular joint reconstruction addition coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction clear advantage respect common surgery form modified weaverdunn procedure involves cutting end clavicle portion partially sacrificing coracoacromial ligament suturing displaced acromial end lateral aspect clavicle stabilization often form additional support introduced replace coracoclavicular ligaments variations support includes grafting tendons use synthetic sutures suture surgeries used rockwood screw inserted initially removed weeks physical therapy always recommended surgery patients get flexibility back although possibly somewhat limited one surgery sling worn support protect shoulder days first couple physical therapy visits treatment focus controlling pain swelling type treatment include ice electrical stimulation massage hand treatment help ease pain muscle spasm four weeks range motion exercises started passive exercises done shoulder joint moved muscles stay relaxed six eight weeks active therapy started exercises include isometric strengthening works muscles without straining healing joint three months active strengthening incorporated focus improving strength control rotator cuff muscles muscles around shoulder blade exercises therapist gives patient done home done able get better recovery long
