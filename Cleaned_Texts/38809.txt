justifying rape fallacy way would fallacy accuse scientists research causes cancer justifying cancer instead say understanding causes rape may help create preventive wilson et al argue evolutionary psychologists like thornhill palmer use naturalistic fallacy inappropriately forestall legitimate discussion ethical implications theory according thornhill palmer naturalistic fallacy infer ethical conclusions eg rape good true false statements fact eg rape natural wilson et al point combining factual statement ethical statement derive ethical conclusion standard ethical reasoning naturalistic fallacy moral judgment deduced exclusively factual statement argue one combines thornhill palmers factual premise rape increases fitness womans offspring ethical premise right increase fitness offspring resulting deductively valid conclusion rape also positive effects ethical status ambiguous wilson et al state thornhill palmer dismiss ethical objections phrase naturalistic fallacy although

victims may also improved evolutionary considerations according thornhill palmer argue view rape due domination desire explain victim rapist seemed sexually motivated evolutionary considerations also help explain emotional pain felt well form takes may also help rape victim understand rape victims partner may see rape form infidelity also argued victims partner may helped understanding able change
