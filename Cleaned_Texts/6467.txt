heavily controversies surrounded proposed environmental causes example vaccine hypothesis although disproved continues hold sway certain term autism become commonly used reference autism spectrum autism highly variable neurodevelopmental whose symptoms first appear infancy childhood generally follows steady course without autistic people may severely impaired respects average even superior overt symptoms gradually begin age six months become established age two three autistic children experience regression communication social skills reaching developmental milestones normal said distinguished characteristic triad symptoms impairments social interaction impairments communication repetitive behavior aspects atypical eating also common essential individual symptoms autism occur general population appear associate highly without sharp line separating pathologically severe common autistic people social impairments often lack intuition others many people take granted unusual social development becomes apparent early childhood autistic infants show less attention social stimuli smile look others less often respond less name autistic toddlers differ strikingly social norms example less eye contact turntaking ability use simple movements express pointing three fiveyearold autistic children less likely exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate respond emotions communicate nonverbally take turns others however form attachments primary autistic children displayed moderately less attachment security neurotypical children although difference disappears children higher mental development less pronounced autistic children highfunctioning autism intense frequent loneliness compared nonautistic peers despite common belief autistic children prefer alone making maintaining friendships often proves difficult autistic people quality friendships number friends predicts lonely feel functional friendships resulting invitations parties may affect quality life differences communication may present first year life may include delayed onset babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness vocal patterns synchronized caregiver second third years autistic children less frequent less diverse babbling consonants words word combinations gestures less often integrated words autistic children less likely make requests share experiences likely simply repeat others words reverse deficits joint attention may present example may look pointing hand instead object hand autistic children may difficulty imaginative play developing symbols
