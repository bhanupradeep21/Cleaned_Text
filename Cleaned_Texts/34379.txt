interspecific competition ecology form competition individuals different species compete resources ecosystem eg food living space contrasted mutualism type symbiosis competition members species called intraspecific competition tree species dense forest grows taller surrounding tree species able absorb incoming sunlight however less sunlight available trees shaded taller tree thus interspecific competition leopards lions also interspecific competition since species feed prey negatively impacted presence less food competition one many interacting biotic abiotic factors affect community structure moreover competition always straightforward direct interaction interspecific competition may occur individuals two separate species share limiting resource area resource support populations lowered fecundity growth survival may result least one species interspecific competition potential alter populations communities evolution interacting species individual organism level competition occur interference exploitative competition types described also apply intraspecific competition competition among individuals within species also specific example interspecific competition described terms mechanism eg resource interference outcome symmetric asymmetric exploitative competition also referred resource competition form competition one species consumes either reduces efficiently uses shared limiting resource therefore depletes availability resource thus indirect interaction competing species interact via shared resource interference competition form competition individuals one species interacts directly individuals another species via antagonistic displays aggressive behavior review synthesis experimental evidence regarding interspecific competition described six specific types mechanisms competition occurs including consumptive preemptive overgrowth chemical territorial encounter consumption competition always resource competition others always regarded exclusively exploitative interference separating effect resource use interference easy good example exploitative competition found aphid species competing sap plant phloem aphid species feeds host plant sap uses resource leaving less competing species one study fordinae geoica observed outcompete f formicaria extent latter species exhibited reduction survival another example one competition calling space amphibians calling activity species prevents one calling area wide would last example driving bisexual rock lizards genus darevskia natural habitats daughter unisexual interference competition ruled case parthenogenetic forms lizards never demonstrate aggressive behavior type competition also observed forests large trees dominate canopy thus allow little light reach smaller competitors living interactions important implications population dynamics distribution species scramble contest competition refer relative success competitors scramble competition said occur competitor equal suppressed either reduction survival birth rates contest competition said occur one competitors unaffected competition others suffer greatly either reduction survival birth rates sometimes types competition referred symmetric scramble vs asymmetric contest competition scramble contest competition two ends spectrum completely equal completely unequal effects apparent competition actually example predation alters relative abundances prey trophic level occurs two species habitat affect shared natural enemies higher trophic two species share common predator example apparent competition exist two prey items presence prey species increases abundance shared enemy thereby suppresses one prey mechanism gets name experiments one prey species removed second prey species increases abundance investigators sometimes mistakenly attribute increase abundance second species evidence resource competition prey species apparently competition fact due shared predator parasitoid parasite pathogen many studies including cited previously shown major impacts individuals populations interspecific competition documentation impacts found species every major branch organism effects interspecific competition also reach communities even influence evolution species adapt avoid competition evolution may result exclusion species habitat niche separation local extinction changes species time also change communities species must adapt competitive exclusion principle also called gauses arose mathematical analysis simple competition models states two species use limiting resource way space time coexist must diverge time order two species coexist one species often exhibit advantage resource use superior competitor outcompete efficient use limiting resource result inferior competitor suffer decline population time excluded area replaced superior competitor welldocumented example competitive exclusion observed occur dolly varden charr troutsalvelinus malma white spotted char trouts leucomaenis japan species morphologically similar former species found primarily higher elevations latter although zone overlap species excluded dominant region becoming better adapted habitat time cases species gets displaced exclusive segment original habitat species suffers competition natural selection favors avoidance competition way niche differentiation process competitive exclusion leads differences resource use previous example niche differentiation resulted spatial displacement cases may result changes also avoid competition competition avoidance achievable species occupy edge niche become specialized area thus minimizing competition phenomenon often results separation species time become specialized edge niche called niche differentiation species separate habitats however avoid niche overlap species adapt regionally utilizing different resources ordinarily would order avoid competition several welldocumented cases birds species similar change habitat use overlap example may consume different food resources use different nesting habitat materials galapagos islands finch species observed change dietary specializations generations order utilize limited resources minimize competition cases third party species interfere detriment benefit competing species laboratory study coexistence two competing bacterial species mediated phage type interaction actually helped maintain diversity bacterial
