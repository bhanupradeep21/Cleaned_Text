appears expectation makes rapid selection key stimuli become available large body research explored way attention expectation affect behavior nonhuman animals much work suggests attention operates birds mammals reptiles much way animals trained discriminate two stimuli say black versus white said attend brightness dimension says little whether dimension selected preference others enlightenment comes experiments allow animal choose several alternatives example several studies shown performance better example color discrimination eg blue vs green animal learned another color discrimination eg red vs orange training different dimension x shape versus shape reverse effect happens training forms thus earlier learning appears affect dimension color form animal attend experiments shown animals learned respond one aspect environment responsiveness aspects suppressed blocking example animal conditioned respond one stimulus pairing stimulus reward punishment animal responds consistently second stimulus b accompanies additional training trials later tests b stimulus alone elicit little response suggesting learning b blocked prior learning result supports hypothesis stimuli neglected fail provide new information thus experiment cited animal failed attend b b added information supplied true interpretation important insight attentional processing conclusion remains uncertain blocking several related phenomena explained models conditioning invoke attention limited resource noneorall response attention devoted one aspect environment less available number experiments studied animals
