phage group sometimes called american phage group informal network biologists centered max delbrück contributed heavily bacterial genetics origins molecular biology century phage group takes name bacteriophages bacteriainfecting viruses group used experimental model organisms addition delbrück important scientists associated phage group include salvador luria alfred hershey seymour benzer charles steinberg gunther stent james watson frank stahl renato dulbecco bacteriophages subject experimental investigation since félix dherelle isolated developed methods detecting culturing beginning delbrück physicistturned biologist seeking simplest possible experimental system probe fundamental laws life first encountered phage visit h morgans fly lab caltech delbrück unimpressed morgans experimentally complex model organism drosophila another researcher emory ellis working elementary phage next years ellis delbrück collaborated methods counting phage tracking growth curves established basic stepwise pattern virus growth obvious features lytic retrospective emory ellis stated soon max delbruck arrived caltech biology division intent discovering background physical sciences could productively applied biological problems showed stepgrowth curves first comment dont believe however ellis describes delbruck soon dispelled initial reaction disbelief analysis phenomenon promptly joined work enthusiasm bringing training mathematics physics intense interest genetics initial collaborative findings published phage group started around delbrück luria met physics conference delbrück salvador luria began series collaborative experiments patterns infection different strains bacteria bacteriophage soon established mutual exclusion principle individual bacterium infected one strain phage fluctuation test later dubbed experiment showed genetic mutations phage resistance arise absence selection rather response traditional wisdom among bacteriologists prior bacteria chromosomes genes experiment showed bacteria like established model genetic organisms genes spontaneously mutate generate mutants may reproduce form clonal lineages year also began working alfred hershey another phage three would share nobel prize physiology medicine work replication mechanism genetics viruses described retrospectively circumstances leading experiment using phage performed research assistant martha chase later known experiment provided key evidence dna distinct protein genetic material phage therefore likely genetic material generally luria made finding destined open new insight stability dna achieved see pg discovered uv irradiation two dead phage entered bacterial cell often became alive produced normal live first example reactivation cells organisms damaged radiation interpreted reactivation correctly result genetic recombination see also homologous recombination james watson future codiscover structure dna winner nobel prize lurias first graduate student indiana university phd thesis project watson showed xrayed phage participate genetic recombination multiplicity reactivation remembered luria pg discovery reactivation irradiated phage referred multiplicity reactivation immediately started flurry activity study repair radiation damage within early phage group reviewed turned later repair damaged phage mutual help luria discovered one special case dna repair cells types bacteria viruses organisms studied including humans known complex biochemical processes repairing dna damages see dna repair dna repair processes also recognized playing critical roles protecting aging cancer infertility jim watson retrospective described first experiences student luria apparently according watson students afraid luria reputation arrogant toward people wrong however fall term wore watson saw evidence rumored inconsiderateness toward dimwits thus real reservations except occasional fear bright enough move circle asked luria whether could research direction spring term luria promptly said yes gave watson task studying xrayinduced multiplicity reactivation phage described scientist lurias lab time watson shared lab bench renato dulbecco future member phage group recently arrived italy experiments phage multiplicity reactivation later semester watson met first time delbruck briefly visiting luria wrote almost delbrucks first sentence knew going disappointed beat around bush intent words always clear even important youthful appearance spirit watson noted occasion many subsequent occasions delbruck talked bohr physicist belief complementarity principle perhaps like needed understanding quantum mechanics would key real understanding biology renato dulbecco caltech delbrück worked procedure assaying animal virus particles formation plaques sheet cultured cells phage form plaques lawn bacterial cells procedure set stage dulbecco implement comprehensive research program quantitative studies animal viruses fathom intracellular reproductive cycle work recognized award nobel prize discovery structure dna still unclear dna replicated favored model time semiconservative replication experimental proof needed performed matthew meselson franklin stahl key experiment provided convincing evidence semiconservative replication mechanism known correct meselson stahl described circumstances leading key since described beautiful experiment beauty tied simplicity result although route led experiment far simple described retrospective seymour benzer joined delbrücks phage group caltech postdoctoral fellow shared lab room jean weigle collaborative experiments phage upon leaving caltech benzer continued experiments phage pasteur institute paris purdue university developed system studying fine structure gene using mutants defective riia riib genetic experiments involving crosses rii mutants led finding unique linear order mutational sites within genes result provided strong evidence key idea gene linear structure equivalent length dna many sites independently mutate salvador luria discovered phenomenon restrictionmodification modification phage growing within infected bacterium upon release reinfection related bacterium phages growth restricted described pgs weigle working giuseppe bertani werner arber soon clarified basis phenomenon showed restriction actually due attack specific bacterial enzymes modified phages dna work led discovery class enzymes known restriction enzymes enzymes allowed controlled manipulation dna laboratory thus providing foundation development genetic engineering weigle also demonstrated inducible nature dna damageresponse genes bacteria phenomenon come known sos response response includes dna damageinducible mutagenesis termed weigle mutagenesis honor inducible repair following dna damage termed weigle reactivation sydney brenner early member phage group collaborated francis crick leslie barnett richard wattstobin cavendish laboratory cambridge perform genetic experiments demonstrated basic nature genetic code experiments carried mutants riib gene phage showed gene encodes protein three sequential bases genes dna specify successive amino acid protein thus genetic code triplet code triplet called codon specifies particular amino acid also obtained evidence codons overlap dna sequence encoding protein sequence read fixed starting point gunther stent joined phage group taking phage course cold spring harbor new york ongoing informal discussions among workers progress research led book stent entitled molecular biology bacterial viruses dedicated max lucid account accomplishments emerging field later memoirs stent described activities personal interactions illustrated unique intellectual spirit phage group early crucial years delbrück charm enthusiasm brought many biologists physicists phage research early seecharles steinberg delbrück promoted phage treaty call phage researchers focus limited number phage bacterial strains standardized experimental conditions helped make research different laboratories easily comparable replicable helping unify field bacterial apart direct collaborations main legacy phage group resulted yearly summer phage course taught cold spring harbor laboratory taught sporadically caltech beginning delbrück others taught young biologists fundamentals phage biology experimentation instilling phage groups distinctive math physicsoriented approach biology many leaders emerging field molecular biology alumni phage course continued taught millard susman published retrospective article phage course given years cold spring harbor new york california institute article lists many graduates course describes accomplishments provides interesting anecdotes related course richard feynman distinguished caltech theoretical physicist learned work phage summer help charles steinberg experimental results included publication edgar et isolation conditional lethal mutants phage phage group members provided opportunity study function virtually genes essential growth phage laboratory one class conditional lethal mutants known amber mutants isolated genetically characterized richard epstein antoinette bolle charles although publication initial findings delayed years see epstein et al complete genetic characterization amber mutants described epstein et al another class conditional lethal mutants referred temperaturesensitive mutants obtained robert edgar ilga studies two classes mutants led considerable insight numerous fundamental biologic problems thus understanding gained functions interactions proteins employed machinery dna replication repair recombination viruses assembled protein nucleic acid components molecular morphogenesis furthermore role chain terminating codons elucidated one noteworthy study performed sydney brenner collaborators using amber mutants defective gene encoding major head protein phage experiment provided strong evidence widely held prior still unproven sequence hypothesis amino acid sequence protein specified nucleotide sequence gene determining
