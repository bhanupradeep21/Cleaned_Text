incest taboo cultural rule norm prohibits sexual relations certain members family mainly individuals related blood human culturesdisputed discuss norms exclude certain close relatives considered suitable permissible sexual marriage partners making relationships taboo however different norms exist among cultures blood relations permissible sexual partners sexual relations related persons subject taboo called incestuous relationships cultures proscribe sexual relations clanmembers even traceable biological relationship exists members clans permissible irrespective existence biological relationship many cultures certain types cousin relations preferred sexual marital partners whereas others taboo cultures permit sexual marital relations auntsuncles nephewsnieces instances marriages practised elites regularity unions almost universally debate origin incest taboo often framed question whether based nature nurture one explanation sees incest taboo cultural implementation biologically evolved preference sexual partners one unlikely share genes since inbreeding may detrimental outcomes widely held hypothesis proposes socalled westermarck effect discourages adults engaging sexual relations individuals grew existence westermarck effect achieved empirical another school argues incest prohibition cultural construct arises side effect general human preference group exogamy arises intermarriage groups construct valuable alliances improve ability groups thrive according view incest taboo necessarily universal likely arise become strict cultural circumstances favour exogamy endogamy likely become lax circumstances favor endogamy hypothesis also achieved empirical supportcitation needed theoretically possible natural selection may certain genetic circumstances select individuals instinctively avoid mating close relatives incest still exist gene pool even genetically weakened inbred individuals better watchposts predators none weak individuals useful stronger individuals group looking predators without able seriously compete stronger discuss additionally protecting health closer relatives inbred offspring evolutionarily advantegous punishing said relative especially context predation starvation significant factors opposed rich welfare modern anthropology developed time great many human societies illiterate much research incest taboos taken place societies without legal codes therefore without written laws concerning marriage incest nevertheless anthropologists found institution marriage rules concerning appropriate inappropriate sexual behavior exist every following excerpt notes queries anthropology wellestablished field manual ethnographic research illustrates scope ethnographic investigation matter incest sexual intercourse individuals related certain prohibited degrees kinship every society rules prohibiting incestuous unions sexual intercourse recognized marriage two prohibitions necessarily coincide uniformity degrees involved prohibitions rules regulating incest must investigated every society means genealogical method prohibition may narrow include one type relationship though rare within elementary family wide include genealogical classificatory kinship traced usual practice unions certain relatives considered incestuous relationships regulated type descent emphasized societies unions certain persons related affinity also considered incestuous penalties fall individuals concerned b community whole penalties enforced authority believed ensure automatically action supernatural force correlation severity penalty nearness bloodtie partners guilt children born result incestuous unions treated methods ritual legal persons fall within prohibited degrees wish marry break relationship become free noted theories anthropologists generally concerned solely incest claiming sexual relations among family members taboo even necessarily considered incestuous society theories complicated fact many societies people related one another different ways sometimes distantly classified together siblings others closely related genetically considered family members moreover definition restricts sexual intercourse mean forms sexual contact occur proscribed prescribed example inuit societies arctic traditionally bali mothers would routinely stroke penises infant sons behavior considered sexual also noted theories anthropologists primarily concerned marriage rules actual sexual behavior short anthropologists studying incest per se asking informants meant incest consequences incest order map social relationships within community excerpt also suggests relationship sexual marriage practices complex societies distinguish different sorts prohibitions words although individual may prohibited marrying sexual relations many people different sexual relations may prohibited different reasons different penalties example trobriand islanders prohibit sexual relations woman woman describe prohibitions different ways relations woman brother fall within category forbidden relations among members clan relations woman father trobrianders matrilineal children belong clan mother father thus sexual relations man mothers sister mothers sisters daughter also considered incestuous relations man fathers sister man fathers sister often flirtatious relationship far taboo trobriand society encourages man fathers sister daughter fathers sister sexual relations explanation taboo due instinctual inborn aversion would lower adverse genetic effects inbreeding higher incidence congenital birth defects see article inbreeding depression since rise modern genetics belief theory verification increase frequency birth defects often attributed inbreeding results directly increase frequency homozygous alleles inherited offspring inbred leads increase homozygous allele frequency within population results diverging effects child inherit version homozygous alleles responsible birth defect parents birth defect expressed hand child inherit version homozygous alleles responsible birth defect would actually decrease ratio allele version responsible birth defect population overall consequences diverging effects depends part size population small populations long children born inheritable birth defects die killed reproduce ultimate effect inbreeding decrease frequency defective genes population time gene pool healthier however larger populations likely large numbers carriers survive mate leading constant rates birth besides recessive genes also reasons inbreeding may harmful narrow range certain immune systems genes population increasing vulnerability infectious diseases see major histocompatibility complex sexual selection biological costs incest also depend largely degree genetic proximity two relatives engaging incest fact may explain cultural taboo generally includes prohibitions sex close relatives less often includes prohibitions sex distal children born close relatives decreased many mammal species including humanitys closest primate relatives avoid westermarck effect first proposed edvard westermarck theory children reared together regardless biological relationship form sentimental attachment nature melford spiro argued observations unrelated children reared together israeli kibbutzim nevertheless avoided one another sexual partners

encountered tens thousands potential mates marriages higher would expected chance marriages five men women reared together first six years lives would argue westermarck study taiwan marriages future bride adopted grooms family infant small child found marriages higher infidelity divorce lower fertility ordinary marriages argued observation consistent westermarck another approach looking moral objections thirdparty incest increases longer child grown together another child opposite sex occurs even child genetically humans argued special kin detection system besides incest taboo also regulates tendency towards altruism towards one objection instinctive genetic basis incest taboo incest anthropologists also argued social construct incest incest taboo thing biological phenomenon inbreeding example equal genetic relation man daughter fathers sister man daughter mothers sister biologists would consider mating incestuous instances trobrianders consider mating incestuous one case anthropologists documented great number societies marriages first cousins prohibited incestuous marriages first cousins encouraged therefore argued prohibition incestuous relations societies based motivated concerns biological studies cousin marriages found support biological basis also current supporters genetic influences behavior argue genes determine behavior absolutely genes may create predispositions affected various ways environment including steve stewartwilliams argues view incest taboo western phenomenon arguing brothersister marriage reported diverse range cultures egyptian

complex instinctual aversion incest instinctual influenced many theorists seeking explain incest taboo using sociological anthropologist claude lévistrauss developed general argument universality incest taboo human societies argument begins claim incest taboo effect prohibition endogamy effect encourage exogamy exogamy otherwise unrelated households lineages form relationships marriage thus strengthening social solidarity lévistrauss views marriage exchange women two social groups theory based part marcel mausss theory gift lévistrauss words argued exchange primitive societies consists much economic transactions reciprocal gifts reciprocal gifts far important function primitive form exchange merely essentially economic nature aptly calls total social fact event significance social religious magic economic utilitarian sentimental jural also based lévistrausss analysis data different kinship systems marriage practices documented anthropologists historians lévistrauss called attention specifically data collected margaret mead research among arapesh asked man ever sleeps sister arapesh replied dont sleep sisters give sisters men men give us sisters mead pressed question repeatedly asking would happen brother sister sex one another lévistrauss quotes arapesh response would like marry sister matter anyway dont want brotherinlaw dont realize marry another mans sister another man marries sister least two brothersinlaw marry sister none hunt garden applying mausss theory data meads lévistrauss proposed called alliance theory argued primitive based agriculture class hierarchies centralized fundamentally relationship man woman transaction involving woman forges two anthropologists argue nuclear family incest avoidance explained terms ecological demographic economic benefits lévistrauss generally discounted relevance alliance theory africa particularly strong concern incest fundamental issue among age systems east africa avoidance men ageset daughters altogether intense sexual avoidance paraphrasing lévistrausss argument without avoidance rivalries power agesets coupled close bonds sharing agemates could lead sharing daughters spouses young men entering age system would find dire shortage marriageable girls extended families would danger dying thus parading avoidance daughters senior men make girls available younger agesets marriages form alliances mitigate rivalries exogamy households descent groups typically prescribed classless societies societies divided unequal prescribe different degrees endogamy endogamy opposite exogamy refers
