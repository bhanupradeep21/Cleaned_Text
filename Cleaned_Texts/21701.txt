needed majority elasmobranchs viviparous show wide range strategies provide offspring nourishment respiratory requirements sharks simply retain young dilated posterior segment oviduct simplest form uterus provide additional nutrients embryos however elasmobranchs develop secretory uterine villi produce histotroph nutrient supplements yolk stores oocyte uterine secretions perhaps advanced stingrays following depletion yolk uterine lining hypertrophies secretory appendages termed trophonemata process uterine secretions also known uterine milk histotroph produced resembles breast milk mammals furthermore milk rich protein lipid embryo grows vascularisation trophonemata enlarges form sinusoids project surface form functional respiratory membrane lamnoid sharks following yolk use
