motion camouflage camouflage provides degree concealment moving object given motion makes objects easy detect however well coloration matches background breaks outlines principal form motion camouflage type generally meant term involves attackers mimicking optic flow background seen target enables attacker approach target appearing remain stationary targets perspective unlike classical pursuit attacker moves straight towards target times often appears target move sideways attacker chooses flight path remain line target landmark point target therefore see attacker move landmark point

falcons echolocating bats since bats hunting night using strategy camouflage named describing mechanism constant absolute target direction efficient homing strategy suggested antiaircraft missiles could benefit similar techniques many animals highly sensitive motion example frogs readily detect small moving dark spots ignore stationary therefore motion signals used defeat moving objects disruptive camouflage patterns remain harder identify uncamouflaged objects especially similar objects nearby even though detected motion completely break conspicuousness motion raises question whether motion could camouflaged several mechanisms one strategy minimise actual motion predators tigers stalk prey moving slowly stealthily strategy effectively avoids need camouflage movement
