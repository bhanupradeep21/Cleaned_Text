stethacanthus extinct genus sharklike lived late devonian late carboniferous epoch dying around million years ago fossils found australia asia europe north america stethacanthus comes greek στῆθος stēthos meaning chest ἄκανθος akanthos meaning spine thorn name refers distinctive anvilshaped first dorsal fin spine displayed mature males stethacanthus different sizes depending species altonensis length metres ft productus reached metres many respects sharklike appearance however best known unusually shaped dorsal fin resembled anvil ironing board small spikes enlarged versions dermal denticles commonly covering shark skin covered crest ratfishs head crest may played role mating rituals aided clamping belly larger marine animals used frighten potential like members stethacanthidae stethacanthus unique pelvic girdles singlecrowned nongrowing scales pectoral fin composed metapterygium accompanying whip attached distinctive first dorsal fin spine termed spinebrush complex neurocranium narrow suborbital shelf broad supraorbital shelf short oticooccipital division large cladodontic teeth aligned precisely addition features stethacanthus also male pelvic claspers nonprismatic calcified cartilage distal spinebrush complex occupies site first dorsal fin ratfish contains basal plate extending inside usually posteriorpointing dorsal spine composed trabecular dentine spines resemble modern sharks rays curiously lack enamellike surface trabecular dentine contains patches fibers suggesting attachments epaxial musculature way muscles would positioned implies spine could moved anterioposterior direction socalled brush fibrous originally believed consists number parallel membranous made globular calcified brush base basal plate covered thin acellular bone zangerl asserts tubules similar erectile tissues humans thus complex may complex covered nine rows large denticles pointing anteriorly dorsal side head collection denticles point presence large denticles led theories spinebrush complex combination denticles head used scare away predators simulating mouth larger complex affirmed males males reached sexual whether complex present females species still another theory spinebrush complex involved either attracting mating process pectoral fins stethacanthus composed triangularshaped metapterygium observed modernday sharks additional long metapterygial structure called fin whip fin whips contain least axial cartilages extended past pelvic fins three anterior axials shorter posterior purpose fin whips unknown suggested used tooth files whorlshaped palatoquadrate scalloped recesses allow tooth families individual teeth widely separated tooth teeth cladodont variety bases teeth broadest lingual side support single large cusp two pairs smaller accessory cusps total five medial lateral cusps fluted teeth appear mostly orthodentine viewed crosssection change abruptly osteodentine enameloid singlelayered overlaying thick mantle addition dentition teeth also number buccopharyngeal denticles lining denticles lining top head top spinebrush complex larger dentition teeth appear elongate monocuspid stethacanthus pelvic girdles consist sheets prismatic cartilage shape subtriangular rounded plate anterior edge girdle slightly concave posterior convex appears union two two types pelvic girdles found stethacanthids primitive condition derived condition primitive condition pelvic girdles metapterygial element supporting one two radials fin radials attached directly pelvic plate derived condition differs much higher number radials supported pelvic plate feature accompanied broadening pelvic girdle order accommodate increased number radials characteristic stethacanthus males claspers clubshaped distal ends composed nonprismatic globular calcified caudal fin variety among stethacanthus species low angle heterocercal tails tails approaching broad hypochordal lobe supported long splayed fin certain stethacanthus carnivore considering small size probably fed small fish brachiopods crinoid ossicles like sharks additionally spinebrush complex rather large structure seems likely combination forwardfacing denticles structure would produced drag force fast locomotion therefore stethacanthus probably slowmoving shark fins stethacanthus also smaller sharks size teeth also small side relative small paleozoic sharks suggesting stethacanthus may considering stethacanthus specimens recovered bear gulch limestone montana possible area breeding ground sharks also stethacanthus suggesting several species stethacanthus discovered late established based solely upon isolated spines initially confused paleontologist john strong newberry thinking spines constituted new kind fin originally believed spines part pectoral fins bilaterally meanwhile first associated skeletal remains found mississippian montana devonian mississippian ohio remained undescribed nearly since complete skeletons extremely rare stethacanthus classification vague based characteristics family stethacanthidae defined richard lund stethacanthus differed greatly elasmobranchs relative classifications symmoriids compared

globular calcified cartilage spinebrush complex base plate brush claspers interesting first record large mass globular calcified cartilage chondrichthyan high presence globular calcified cartilage raises several questions evolution sharks possible prismatic cartilage defining feature chondrichthyans evolutionary derivative globular calcified cartilage case primitive chondrichthyans would appeared sharklike scales based instead globular calcified cartilage another feature note thin acellular bone layer coating brush baseplate spinebrush complex possible coating spinebrush complex first record endoskeletal bone primitive chondrichthyans endoskeletal features lost extant chondrichthyans also possible fin spine could unique distribution dermal skeleton thus derived neural crest following assumption brush would finbaseplate extension endoskeletal location absence fin radials supports latter taxonomic relationships hard define stethacanthus much variability characteristics discovered chondrichthyes monophyletic group characterized development endoskeletal tesserae mineralized blocks cartilage internal chondrichthyes divided two subclasses elasmobranchii holocephali stethacanthids classified member group paleoselachii subdivision elasmobranchii stethacanthus classified part order symmoriida classification sparked controversy two main hypotheses regarding classification one hypothesis states order symmoriida consists families symmoriidae stethacanthidae falcatidae thus monophyletic group another symmoriids actually females derived hypothesis due fact stethacanthids symmoriids poorly defined symmoriids thought lack spinebrush complex otherwise identical stethacanthidae stethacanthids identified presence spinebrush complex cases nonexistent eg juvenile males making certain classification stethacanthids symmoriids recently symmoriida whole reclassified part holocephali meaning stethacanthus closely related modern chimaeras
