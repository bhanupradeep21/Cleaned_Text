swine influenza infection caused several types swine influenza viruses swine influenza virus siv swineorigin influenza virus soiv refers strain influenza family viruses endemic identified siv strains include influenza c subtypes influenza known swine influenza virus common throughout pig populations worldwide transmission virus pigs humans rare always lead human illness often resulting production antibodies blood transmission causes human illness called zoonotic swine flu people regular exposure pigs increased risk swine flu infections around century identification influenza subtypes made possible allowing accurate diagnosis transmission humans since transmissions confirmed strains swine flu rarely pass human human symptoms zoonotic swine flu humans similar influenza influenzalike illness include chills fever sore throat muscle pains severe headache coughing weakness shortness breath general discomfort estimated flu pandemic global population billion equivalent around million

swine flu outbreak united states cdc advised physicians consider swine influenza infection differential diagnosis patients acute febrile respiratory illness either contact persons confirmed swine flu one five us states reported swine flu cases mexico seven days preceding illness diagnosis confirmed swine flu requires laboratory testing respiratory sample simple nose throat common cause death respiratory failure causes death pneumonia leading high fever leading neurological problems dehydration excessive vomiting diarrhea electrolyte imbalance kidney fatalities likely young children elderly influenza quite common pigs half breeding pigs exposed virus antibodies virus also common pigs main route transmission direct contact infected uninfected close contacts particularly common animal transport intensive farming may also increase risk transmission pigs raised close proximity direct transfer virus probably occurs either pigs touching noses dried mucus airborne transmission aerosols produced pigs coughing sneezing also important means virus usually spreads quickly herd infecting pigs within transmission may also occur wild animals wild boar spread disease people work poultry swine especially intense exposures increased risk zoonotic infection influenza virus endemic animals constitute population human hosts zoonosis reassortment vaccination workers influenza surveillance new influenza strains among population may therefore important public health transmission influenza swine humans work swine documented small surveillance study performed university study among others forms basis recommendation people whose jobs involve handling poultry swine focus increased public health professions particular risk infection veterinarians meat processing workers although risk infection groups lower farm pigs unusual infected influenza strains usually infect three different species pigs birds pigs host influenza viruses might exchange genes thus producing new

control strategies rely vaccination may control swine influenza vaccination become difficult recent decades evolution virus resulted inconsistent responses traditional vaccines standard commercial swine flu vaccines effective controlling infection virus strains match enough significant crossprotection custom autogenous vaccines made specific viruses isolated created used difficult present vaccination strategies siv control prevention swine farms typically include use one several bivalent siv vaccines commercially available united states recent isolates examined isolates strong serologic crossreactions antiserum three commercial siv vaccines since protective ability influenza vaccines depends primarily closeness match vaccine virus epidemic virus presence nonreactive siv variants suggests current commercial vaccines might effectively protect pigs infection majority united states department agriculture researchers say pig vaccination keeps pigs getting sick block infection shedding facility management includes using disinfectants ambient temperature control viruses environment unlikely survive outside living cells two weeks except cold freezing conditions readily inactivated herd management includes adding pigs carrying influenza herds exposed virus virus survives healthy carrier pigs three months recovered outbreaks carrier pigs usually responsible introduction siv previously uninfected herds countries new animals outbreak immunity exposed pigs wanes new outbreaks strain swine infected avian human flu strains influenza therefore hosts antigenic shifts occur create new influenza transmission swine humans believed occur mainly swine farms farmers close contact live pigs although strains swine influenza usually able infect humans may occasionally happen farmers veterinarians encouraged use face masks dealing infected animals use vaccines swine prevent infection major method limiting swinetohuman transmission risk factors may contribute swinetohuman transmission include smoking especially wearing gloves working sick animals thereby increasing likelihood subsequent handtoeye handtonose handtomouth influenza spreads humans infected people cough sneeze people breathe virus touch something virus touch cdc warned touching mucosal membranes eyes nose mouth pandemic common entry points flu swine flu spread pork products since virus transmitted swine flu humans contagious first five days illness although people commonly children remain contagious ten days diagnosis made sending specimen collected first five days recommendations prevent spread virus among humans include using standard infection control includes frequent washing hands soap water alcoholbased hand sanitizers especially chance transmission also reduced disinfecting household surfaces done effectively diluted chlorine bleach influenza spread coughs sneezes increasing body evidence shows small droplets containing virus linger tabletops telephones surfaces transferred via fingers eyes nose mouth alcoholbased gel foam hand sanitizers work well destroy viruses bacteria anyone flulike symptoms sudden fever cough muscle aches stay away work public transportation contact doctor social distancing another infection control tactic individuals avoid people might infected infected isolate others duration infection active outbreaks
