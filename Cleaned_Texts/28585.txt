familial aortic dissection fad refers splitting wall aorta either arch ascending descending portions fad thought passed autosomal dominant disease inherited result dissection aorta dissecting aneurysm aorta rarely aortic arterial dilation young age dissection refers actual tearing open aorta however exact genes involved yet occur absence clinical features marfan syndrome systemic time weakness along systolic pressure results tear aortic intima layer thus allowing blood enter layers tissue cause tearing eventually complete rupture aorta occurs pleural cavity fills blood warning signs include chest pain ischemia hemorrhaging chest cavity condition unless found treated early usually results death immediate surgery best treatment fad confused pau penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers imh intramural hematoma present ways similar familial aortic inheritance thought rather complex good amount evidence shows disease autosomal dominant penetrance also possibility age related dependence known marfan syndrome ehlerdanlos syndrome lead increased risk development fad marfan syndrome required aortic one study suggests chromosomal locus gene study found genes may linked include loci marfan ehlerdanlos syndromes genes metalloproteinase tissue inhibitor malloproteinase well two loci chromosomes still studies show mutations smooth muscle cellspecific isoforms alpha actin beta myosin heavy chain may cause mutations genes tgfbr known cause dissections aortas normal diameter size cm gene mutations typically affect aortas larger diameters several hypotheses attempt explain dissection physically occurs first states tear develops intima layer aorta allows blood flow lumen aorta intima event creates dissection essentially two lumens second hypothesis suggests vasa vasorum ruptures causes hemorrhage wall aorta hemorrhaging promotes tearing intima eventually aortic major risk factors fad include high blood pressure old age haematoma genetic weakening aortic wall cocaine use pregnancy diseases causing abnormal connective one study found average ages occurrence dissection caused degenerative aneurysm years dissections thought result genetic mutations appear likely occur

candidates instead medical management common response treating keeping dissections descending aorta type type fad call treatment immediate surgery replace aorta surgery required due high risk mortality type less severe requires maintenance blood pressure diet exercise upon diagnosing someone fad intravenous antihypertensive treatment frequently used often intravenous sodium nitroprusside used efficiency lessening pulsatile load thus reducing blood pressure reducing force slows progression dissection surgical success depends age severity symptoms postoperative organ dysfunction stroke surgical intervention always indicated type cases aortic surgery palliative curative goal merely prevent rupture restore blood flow fix aortic valve post operative protocols include frequent
