mantoux test test also known mantoux screening test tuberculin sensitivity test pirquet test ppd test purified protein derivative tool screening tuberculosis tb tuberculosis diagnosis one major tuberculin skin tests used around world largely replacing multiplepuncture tests tine test heaf test form tine test used uk replaced mantoux test mantoux test endorsed american thoracic society

purified protein derivative ppd tuberculin precipitate speciesnonspecific molecules obtained filtrates sterilized concentrated cultures tuberculin reaction first described robert koch test first developed described german physician felix mendel named charles mantoux french physician built work koch clemens von pirquet create test however test unreliable due impurities tuberculin tended cause

negative result may occur person recently infected tb whose immune system hasnt yet reacted bacteria case second tuberculin test necessary carried arm avoid hypersensitising skin role mantoux testing people vaccinated disputed us recommends tuberculin skin testing contraindicated bcgvaccinated persons prior bcg vaccination influence interpretation test uk recommends interferonÎ³ testing used help interpret positive mantoux tests repeated tuberculin skin testing must done people bcg vaccinations general us recommendation may result larger number people falsely diagnosed latent tuberculosis uk approach increased chance missing patients latent tuberculosis treatedcitation needed according us guidelines latent tuberculosis infection diagnosis treatment considered bcgvaccinated person whose skin test mm greater circumstances present cases anergy lack reaction bodys defence mechanisms comes contact foreign substances tuberculin reaction occur weakly thus compromising value mantoux testing example anergy present aids disease strongly depresses immune system therefore anergy testing advised cases suspicion anergy present however routine anergy skin testing people infected tb may negative reaction tested years infection immune system response may gradually wane initial skin test though negative may stimulate boost bodys ability react tuberculin future tests thus positive reaction subsequent test may misinterpreted new infection fact result boosted reaction old use twostep testing recommended initial skin testing adults retested periodically eg health care workers ensures future positive tests interpreted caused new infection rather simply reaction old infection person diagnosed infected distant past twostep testing called tuberculin reactor us recommendation prior bcg
