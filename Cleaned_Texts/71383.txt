also known cortodoxone inn well endogenous glucocorticoid steroid hormone metabolic intermediate towards cortisol first described tadeusz reichstein substance thus also referred reichsteins substance compound acts glucocorticoid though less potent although weaker glucocorticoid activity compared cortisol still bind glucocorticoid receptors exert certain metabolic antiinflammatory effects participates feedback mechanisms involved regulating secretion adrenocorticotropic hormone acth pituitary gland inhibiting production synthesized converted cortisol mammals limited biological activity mainly acts metabolic intermediate within glucocorticoid pathway leading however sea lampreys early jawless fish species originated million years ago plays crucial role primary ultimate glucocorticoid hormone mineralocorticoid properties also takes part binding specific corticosteroid receptors intestinal osmoregulation sea lamprey metamorphosis develop seawater tolerance downstream sea lampreys possess enzyme responsible converting cortisol corticosterone observed mammals absence enzyme sea lampreys indicates existence complex highly specific corticosteroid signaling pathway emerged least million years ago advent early vertebrates lack cortisol corticosterone sea lampreys suggests presence enzyme may absent early stages vertebrate absence cortisol corticosterone sea lampreys suggests enzyme may present early vertebrate mammals limited glucocorticoid activity direct precursor major mammalian glucocorticoid result level measured diagnose impaired cortisol synthesis find enzyme deficiency causes impairment along pathway cortisol differentiate adrenal deficiency levels increase excess leads mineralocorticoidbased opposed deficiency patients low blood pressure lack mineralocorticoids low levels cortisol affect blood pressure causing decrease sodium retention volume expansion cortisol plays role regulating balance water electrolytes body cortisol levels low less sodium reabsorption kidneys leading increased excretion sodium urine ultimately reduces blood volume lowers blood pressure hand high levels cortisol also affect blood pressure causing increase sodium retention volume expansion cortisolinduced hypertension accompanied significant sodium retention leading increase extracellular fluid volume exchangeable sodium results increase blood volume subsequently increases blood pressure underlying mechanisms effects involve various factors suppression nitric oxide system alterations vascular responsiveness pressor agonists like adrenaline increased cardiac output stroke volume due plasma volume expansion potential dysregulation glucocorticoid receptors enzyme activity important note mechanisms may relevant cortisolinduced hypertension also conditions cushings syndrome excess cortisol production apparent mineralocorticoid excess related defects enzymes liquorice abuse glycyrrhetinic acid affecting glycyerrhetinic acid receptor chronic renal failure prolonged halflife cortisol due reduced activity even essential hypertension may abnormalities activity glucocorticoid receptor low levels cortisol lead reduced vascular tone cortisol helps maintain normal vascular tone promoting vasoconstriction low levels cortisol lead decreased vasoconstriction resulting relaxed blood vessels lower overall blood pressure also low cortisol levels lead impaired fluid balance cortisol affects fluid balance influencing sodium water reabsorption kidneys cortisol levels low sodium absorption may reduced leading increased excretion sodium urine subsequent lowering blood volume blood pressure additionally low levels cortisol cause dysregulated reninangiotensin system cortisol interacts reninangiotensin system regulates blood pressure vasoconstriction fluid balance low cortisol levels disrupt system leading altered angiotensin production reduced aldosterone secretion subsequently lower blood pressure conversely high levels cortisol lead increased vascular tone enhanced sodium retention increased sympathetic activity stressinduced release highlevel glucocorticoids cortisol activates sympathetic nervous system sns sns controls heart rate cardiac output vasomotor tone causing constriction thereby increasing peripheral arterial resistance resulting increase blood deficiency also converted androstenedione pathway could explain increase androstenedione levels deficiency levels biochemist tadeus reichstein working switzerland began research extracts animal adrenal glands order isolate physiologically active
