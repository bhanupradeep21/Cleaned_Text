university heritage college osteopathic medicine analysis brain cavity revealed erlikosaurus quite likely therizinosaurids well developed senses smell hearing balance traits better associated carnivorous theropods enlarged forebrain erlikosaurus may also useful complex social behavior predator evasion senses also welldeveloped earlier coelurosaurs theropods indicating therizinosaurs may inherited many traits carnivorous ancestors used different specialized dietary graham hughes john finarelli analyzed olfactory bulb ratio modern birds preserved skulls several extinct dinosaur species predict many genes would involved olfactory strength extinct species analysis found erlikosaurus genes encoding olfactory receptors olfactory bulb ratio indicating moderate senses smell scores erlikosaurus higher dromaeosaurids despite herbivorous lifestyle taxon may reflect transition complex sociality andor reduced visual capacities hughes finarelli pointed dinosaurian lineages became larger size olfactory bulb increased may suggest olfaction main sensory modality largebodied nonavian lautenschlager performed digital reconstructions cranial musculature erlikosaurus found relatively weak bite force compared theropods whole adductor musculature primarily function close total force n small portion actually used biting bite force starts decline distance bite point jaw joint lautenschlager found lowest force snout tip n highest last maxillar tooth region n factors like presence large gut process vegetation lack damage patterns teeth suggest erlikosaurus used tip snout premaxillary region reach soft foliage fruits lesser bite force erlikosaurus better served leafstripping plantcropping feeding mechanism rather active mastication study lautenschlager also suggested erlikosaurus may able process mainly thin branches plant matter based stegosaurus moreover comparably narrow width snout could indicate selective feeding therizinosaurid lastly behaviour erlikosaurus
