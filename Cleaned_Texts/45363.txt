ewing sarcoma type pediatric forms bone soft symptoms may include swelling pain site tumor fever bone common areas begins legs pelvis chest cases cancer already spread parts body time complications may include pleural effusion type small round cell cause ewing sarcoma unknown cases appearing occur though strongly associated known hereditary cancer syndromes accumulating evidence suggests strong inherited risk identifying genetic component multiple chromosome loci associated ewing sarcoma sometimes ewing sarcoma associated germline underlying mechanism often involves genetic change known reciprocal diagnosis based biopsy treatment often includes chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery stem cell targeted therapy immunotherapy fiveyear survival number factors however affect james ewing

transcription factors involved cell differentiation cell cycle fusion protein phase transition properties allowing transition liquidlike phase separated compartments consisting membraneless organelles phase transition property allows fusion protein access activate microsatellite regions genome would otherwise inaccessible fusion protein convert usually silent chromatin regions fully active enhancers leading oncogenesis fusion protein also causes variable expression genome via epigenetic mechanisms fusion protein recruiting enzymes affect dna methylation histone acetylation direct inhibition noncoding promotes histone acetylation leads uncoiling dna usually tightly wound around histones chromatin relaxation leads dna accessible transcription factors thus enhancing expression associated dna methylation leads gene silencing prevents transcription factor binding reduces dna methylation occurs mostly areas corresponding transcription enhancers leading increased gene fusion protein inhibits certain micrornas cells normally activates rnainduced silencing complexes riscs inhibit degrade mrna involved cell thus inhibition microrna leads increased pluripotency decreased

multiple confluent lytic bone lesions moth eaten pattern due permeative destruction also displaced periosteum new subperiosteal layer bone begins grow top tumor raised displaced periosteum consistent classic radiographic finding codman proliferative reaction bone also create delicate laminations constituting periosteal layers giving radiographic appearance onion plain films add valuable information initial evaluation screening wide zone transition eg permeative useful plain film characteristic differentiation benign versus aggressive malignant lytic lesions magnetic resonance imaging mri routinely used workup malignant tumors show full bony soft tissue extent relate tumor nearby anatomic structures eg vessels gadolinium contrast necessary give additional information noncontrast studies though current researchers argue dynamic contrastenhanced mri may help determine amount necrosis within tumor thus help determining response treatment prior computed axial tomography ct also
