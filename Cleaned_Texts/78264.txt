castleman disease cd describes group rare lymphoproliferative disorders involve enlarged lymph nodes broad range inflammatory symptoms laboratory abnormalities whether castleman disease considered autoimmune disease cancer infectious disease currently unknown castleman disease includes least three distinct subtypes unicentric castleman disease ucd human herpesvirus associated multicentric
