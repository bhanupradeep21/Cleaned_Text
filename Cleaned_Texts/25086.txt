speech sound disorder ssd speech disorder sounds phonemes produced used correctly term protracted phonological development sometimes preferred describing childrens speech emphasize continuing development acknowledging delay speech sound disorders may subdivided two primary types articulation disorders also called phonetic disorders phonemic disorders also called phonological disorders however may mixed disorder articulation phonological problems exist though speech sound disorders associated childhood residual errors may persist adulthood articulation disorders also called phonetic disorders simply artic disorders short based difficulty learning physically produce intended phonemes articulation disorders main articulators lips teeth alveolar ridge hard palate velum glottis tongue disorder anything articulators articulation disorder usually fewer errors phonemic disorder distortions likely though omissions additions substitutions may also present often treated teaching child physically produce sound practice production hopefully becomes natural articulation disorders confused motor speech disorders dysarthria actual paralysis speech musculature developmental verbal dyspraxia motor planning severely impaired phonemic disorder also called phonological disorder child trouble learning sound system language failing recognize soundcontrasts also contrast meaning example sounds k may recognized different meanings call tall might treated homophones pronounced tall called phoneme collapse cases many sounds may represented one eg might replace k ɡ result number error sounds often though always greater articulation disorders substitutions usually common error phonemic disorders often treated using minimal pairs two words differ one sound draw childs attention difference effect communication children phonemic disorders hear two phonemes different others speak aware phonemes sound speak called fis phenomenon scenario speech pathologist says said fis mean fish child responds didnt say fis said fis cases child making sounds similar acoustically distinct others hear difference two sounds treated separate phonemes language spoken though phonemic disorders often considered language disorders language system affected also speech sound disorders errors relate use phonemes makes different specific language impairment primarily disorder syntax grammar usage language rather sound system however two coexist affecting person disorders deal variety different ways pronounce consonants examples glides liquids glides occur articulatory posture changes gradually consonant vowel liquids include l ɹ cases phonetic phonemic errors may coexist person case primary focus usually phonological component articulation therapy may needed part process since teaching child use sound practical child know produce even though speech sound disorders successfully treated childhood may even outgrow errors may sometimes persist adulthood rather age appropriate persisting errors referred residual errors may remain life errors produced children speech sound disorders typically classified four categories sometimes even experts telling exactly type made obvious distorted forms ɹ may mistaken w casual observer yet may actually either sound somewhere children severe speech sound disorders may difficult understand making hard tell word actually intended thus actually wrong terms used describe one categories lisp often replacement θ substitution distortion producing behind teeth resulting sound somewhere θ three different levels classification determining magnitude type error produced note omissions mean sound produced sounds may produced easily frequently appearing certain sounds someone might able say separately st may able produce sound beginning word end magnitude problem often vary different sounds speaker speech sound disorders occur without known cause child may learn produce sounds correctly may learn rules speech sounds children may problem speech development always mean simply outgrow many children develop speech sounds time often need services speechlanguage pathologist learn correct speech soundsclarification needed speech sound errors result syndromes disorders according speech typical child may intelligible childs speech intelligible overall able clearly produce words consistent community norms age misarticulation certain difficult sounds l ɹ z θ ð ʒ may normal years children speech sound disorder pronunciation difficulties inappropriate age difficulties caused hearing problems congenital deformities motor disorders selective diagnostic criteria speech sound disorder require persistent difficulty speech sound production since early developmental age diagnosis must lead difficulty effective communication tangible negative social outcomes like reduced academic occupational performance diagnosis ruled underlying cause birth defect acquired condition cerebral palsy cleft palate deafness hearing loss traumatic brain injury speech disorders diagnosed along speech sound disorder although differential diagnosis selective mutism difficult due normal speech observed children disorder lifelong speech difficulties
