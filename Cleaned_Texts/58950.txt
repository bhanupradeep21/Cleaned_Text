highaltitude adaptation humans instance evolutionary modification certain human populations including tibet asia andes americas ethiopia africa acquired ability survive altitudes meters adaptation means irreversible longterm physiological responses highaltitude environments associated heritable behavioural genetic changes rest human population would suffer serious health consequences indigenous inhabitants regions thrive well highest parts world humans undergone extensive physiological genetic changes particularly regulatory systems oxygen respiration blood circulation compared general
