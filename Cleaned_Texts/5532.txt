stem cell line group stem cells cultured vitro propagated indefinitely stem cell lines derived either animal human tissues come one three sources embryonic stem cells adult stem cells induced stem cells commonly used research regenerative medicine definition stem cells possess two properties selfrenew means divide indefinitely remaining undifferentiated state pluripotent multipotent means differentiate form specialized cell types due selfrenewal capacity stem cells stem cell line cultured vitro indefinitely stemcell line distinctly different immortalized cell line hela line stem cells propagate indefinitely culture due inherent properties immortalized cells would normally divide indefinitely gained ability due mutation immortalized cell lines generated cells isolated tumors mutations introduced make cells stem cell line also distinct primary cells primary cells cells isolated used immediately primary cells divide indefinitely thus cultured long periods time vitrocitation needed embryonic stem cell line created cells derived inner cell mass blastocyst early stage preimplantation humans blastocyst stage occurs days post fertilization create embryonic stem cell line inner cellmass removed blastocyst separated trophoectoderm cultured layer supportive cells vitro derivation human embryonic stem cell lines embryos left vitro fertilization ivf procedures used fact blastocyst destroyed process raised controversy ethical concerns embryonic stem cells pluripotent meaning differentiate form cell types body vitro embryonic stem cells cultured defined conditions keep pluripotent state stimulated biochemical physical cues differentiate different cell types adult stem cells found juvenile adult tissues adult stem cells multipotent generate limited number differentiated cell types unlike pluripotent embryonic stem cells types adult stem cells include hematopoietic stem cells mesenchymal stem cells hematopoietic stem cells found bone marrow generate cells immune system blood cell types mesenchymal stem cells found umbilical cord blood amniotic fluid adipose tissue generate number cell types including osteoblasts chondrocytes adipocytes medicine adult stem cells mostly commonly used bone marrow transplants treat many bone blood cancers well autoimmune see hematopoietic stem cell transplantation types adult stem cells successfully isolated identified mesenchymal stem cells successfully grown culture long periods time adult stem cell types hematopoietic stem cells difficult grow propagate identifying methods maintaining hematopoietic stem cells vitro active area research thus mesenchymal stem cell lines exist types adult stem cells grown vitro better classified primary cells induced pluripotent stem cell ipsc lines pluripotent stem cells generated adultsomatic cells method generating ipscs developed shinya yamanakas lab group demonstrated introduction four specific genes could induce somatic cells revert pluripotent stem cell compared embryonic stemcell lines ipsc lines also pluripotent nature derived without use human process raised ethical concerns furthermore patientspecific ipsc cell lines cell lines genetically matched individual patientspecific ipsc lines generated purposes studying developing patientspecific medical therapies stemcell lines grown maintained specific temperature atmospheric conditions degrees celsius incubators culture conditions cell growth medium surface cells grown vary widely depending specific stem cell line different biochemical factors added medium control cell example keep stem cells pluripotent state differentiate specific cell type stemcell lines used research regenerative medicine used study stemcell biology early human development field regenerative medicine
