neuropharmacology study drugs affect function nervous system neural mechanisms influence two main branches neuropharmacology behavioral molecular behavioral neuropharmacology focuses study drugs affect human behavior neuropsychopharmacology including study drug dependence addiction affect human molecular neuropharmacology involves study neurons neurochemical interactions overall goal developing drugs beneficial effects neurological function fields closely connected since concerned interactions neurotransmitters neuropeptides neurohormones neuromodulators enzymes second messengers cotransporters ion channels receptor proteins central peripheral nervous systems studying interactions researchers developing drugs treat many different neurological disorders including pain neurodegenerative diseases parkinsons disease alzheimers disease psychological disorders addiction many others neuropharmacology appear scientific field early part century scientists able figure basic understanding nervous system nerves communicate one another discovery drugs found demonstrated type influence nervous system french scientists began working compound called phenothiazine hope synthesizing drug would able combat malaria though drug showed little hope use malariainfected individuals found sedative effects along appeared beneficial effects toward patients parkinsons disease black box method wherein investigator would administer drug examine response without knowing relate drug action patient response main approach field late early scientists able identify specific neurotransmitters norepinephrine involved constriction blood vessels increase heart rate blood pressure dopamine chemical whose shortage involved parkinsons disease serotonin soon recognized deeply connected depressioncitation needed scientists also became better able measure levels specific neurochemicals body thus correlate levels invention voltage clamp allowed study ion channels nerve action potential two major historical events neuropharmacology allowed scientists study information transferred one neuron another also study neuron processes information within itselfcitation needed neuropharmacology broad region science encompasses many aspects nervous system single neuron manipulation entire areas brain spinal cord peripheral nerves better understand basis behind drug development one must first understand neurons communicate one anothercitation needed understand potential advances medicine neuropharmacology bring important understand human behavior thought processes transferred neuron neuron medications alter chemical foundations processescitation needed neurons known excitable cells surface membrane abundance proteins known ionchannels allow small charged particles pass cell structure neuron allows chemical information received dendrites propagated perikaryon cell body axon eventually passing neurons axon terminal voltagegated ion channels allow rapid depolarization throughout cell depolarization reaches certain threshold cause action potential action potential reaches axon terminal cause influx calcium ions cell calcium ions cause vesicles small packets filled neurotransmitters bind cell membrane release contents synapse cell known presynaptic neuron cell interacts neurotransmitters released known postsynaptic neuron neurotransmitter released synapse either bind receptors postsynaptic cell presynaptic cell reuptake save later transmission broken enzymes synapse specific certain neurotransmitter three different actions major areas drug action affect communication two types receptors neurotransmitters interact postsynaptic neuron first types receptors ligandgated ion channels lgics lgic receptors fastest types transduction chemical signal electrical signal neurotransmitter binds receptor cause conformational change allow ions directly flow cell second types known gproteincoupled receptors gpcrs much slower lgics due increase amount biochemical reactions must take place intracellularly neurotransmitter binds gpcr protein causes cascade intracellular interactions lead many different types changes cellular biochemistry physiology gene expression neurotransmitterreceptor interactions field neuropharmacology extremely important many drugs developed today disrupting binding molecular neuropharmacology involves study neurons neurochemical interactions receptors neurons goal developing new drugs treat neurological disorders pain neurodegenerative diseases psychological disorders also known case neuropsychopharmacology technical words must defined relating neurotransmission receptor actioncitation needed following neurotransmitterreceptor interactions affected synthetic compounds act one three sodiumpotassium ion channels also manipulated throughout neuron induce inhibitory effects action potentialscitation needed gaba neurotransmitter mediates fast synaptic inhibition central nervous system gaba released presynaptic cell bind receptor likely gabaa receptor causes postsynaptic cell hyperpolarize stay action potential threshold counteract effect excitatory manipulation neurotransmitterreceptor interactionscitation needed gabaa receptor contains many binding sites allow conformational changes primary target drug development common binding sites benzodiazepine allows agonist antagonist effects receptor common drug diazepam acts allosteric enhancer binding another receptor gaba known gabab enhanced molecule called baclofen molecule acts agonist therefore activating receptor known help control decrease spastic movementcitation needed dopamine neurotransmitter mediates synaptic transmission binding five specific gpcrs five receptor proteins separated two classes due whether response elicits excitatory inhibitory response postsynaptic cell many types drugs legal illegal affect dopamine interactions brain parkinsons disease disease decreases amount dopamine brain dopamine precursor levodopa given patient due fact dopamine cross barrier ldopa dopamine agonists also given parkinsons patients disorder known restless leg syndrome rls examples ropinirole psychological disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd treated drugs like methylphenidate also known ritalin block reuptake dopamine presynaptic cell thereby providing increase dopamine left synaptic gap increase synaptic dopamine increase binding receptors postsynaptic cell mechanism also used illegal potent stimulant drugs cocaine neurotransmitter serotonin ability mediate synaptic transmission either gpcrs lgic receptors excitatory inhibitory postsynaptic effects serotonin determined type receptor expressed given brain region popular widely used drugs regulation serotonin depression known ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors drugs inhibit transport serotonin back presynaptic neuron leaving serotonin synaptic gapcitation needed discovery ssris also drugs inhibited enzyme breaks serotonin maois monoamine oxidase inhibitors increased amount serotonin synapse many sideeffects including intense migraines high blood pressure eventually linked drugs interacting common chemical known tyramine found many types ion channels located surface membrane neuron allows influx sodium ions outward movement potassium ions action potential selectively blocking ion channels decrease likelihood action potential occur drug riluzole neuroprotective drug blocks sodium ion channels since channels activate action potential neuron perform transduction chemical signals electrical signals signal move drug used anesthetic well one form behavioral neuropharmacology focuses study drug dependence drug addiction affects human mind research shown major part brain reinforces addiction neurochemical reward nucleus accumbens image right shows dopamine projected area longterm excessive alcohol use cause dependence
