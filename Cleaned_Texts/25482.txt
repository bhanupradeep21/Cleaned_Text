asymmetric cell division produces two daughter cells different cellular fates contrast symmetric cell divisions give rise daughter cells equivalent fates notably stem cells divide asymmetrically give rise two distinct daughter cells one copy original stem cell well second daughter programmed differentiate nonstem cell fate times growth regeneration stem cells also divide symmetrically produce two
