monquirasaurus monquirá lizard extinct genus giant shortnecked pliosaurs lived early cretaceous aptian colombia one species known boyacensis described almost complete fossil skeleton discovered town villa de leyva located boyacá published descriptions holotype specimen estimate reach total size approaching ft length making monquirasaurus large representative pliosaurids taxon long informally identified species belonging related genus kronosaurus even named kronosaurus boyacensis study published identification due fact holotype specimen banned local access descriptions published help

description however conducted using photographs remote imaging techniques junta de acción comunal local community allow access holotype specimen resulting lacking untrustworthy description wasnt specimen reexamined first hand described distinct genus monquirasaurus boyacensis holotype specimen still remains type locality local museo el fósil built around generic name derives monquirá vereda administrative division holotype discovered similarly species name refers boyacá monquirasaurus relatively large pliosaur measuring metres ft long weighing metric tons short tons based direct measurement photogrammetric noè gómezpérez suggested sexually mature young adult individual would measured metres ft skull monquirasaurus large blunt ft long snout tip posterior end right squamosal posterior end retroarticular process mandible ft wide across lateral margin quadrates viewed side cranium elongated low however still severely crushed jaws holotype tightly closed dentition preserved situ cranium suffer crushing dorsal surface also heavily weathered many bones missing making almost impossible observe skull sutures skull undulating margins lateral expansions visible dorsal view first present along lateral margins premaxilla followed expansion around large anterior caniniforms one beneath orbits expansion probably also present posterior area skull around lateral margins temporal fenestra anterior expansions immediately followed medial constriction cranium nares located ft snout tip anterior orbits level maxillary tooth mandible preserved better condition cranium largely resisting crushing affected latter however still dorsoventral compression present around mandibular mandible robust resembles classic pliosaurid morphology large caniniform teeth housed anterior margin bone anterior portion slightly upturned expanded simolestes acostasaurus teeth monquirasaurus round cross section largest caniniforms anterior dentition markedly anisiodont interlocking posterior areas skull tooth rows overlapping anterior caniniforms maxilla instance obscure dentary teeth region posterior dentary teeth form pronounced underbite obscuring posterior maxillary teeth makes difficult determine original tooth count animal anterior expansion premaxilla contains teeth side premaxillary tooth largest extending halfway mandible tooth large right still smaller preceding tooth uncertainty surrounds presence small tooth behind premaxillary area almost entirely obscured dentary caniniform however hint small alveolous area absence visible sutures makes separation premaxillary maxillary dentition uncertain noè gómezpérez suggest small tooth would present would likely reason pliosaurids paja formation united presence premaxillary teeth furthermore pointing first maxillary tooth pliosaurs oftentimes much smaller followed large caniniform next preserved tooth monquirasaurus last preserved premaxillary first maxillary caniniform extends toothless gap diastema equivalent diameter area taken large tooth first preserved potentially second overall maxillary tooth largest jaw although broken either side tooth inferred reached beyond ventral margin mandible following tooth continuously smaller caniniforms followed many much smaller maxillary teeth progressively grow smaller towards posterior anterior mandibular teeth large interlocking premaxillary teeth largest dentary still smaller later maxillary caniniforms larger premaxillary teeth dentary teeth small tooth obscured maxillary caniniforms however likely also rather small larger dentary teeth preserved posterior overlap overall monquirasaurus may minimum teeth upper jaw whilte mandibles preserve tooth positions right body monquirasaurus metres ft long along vertebral column including skull missing tail preserved body broad however life would narrower vertebral column largely preserved articulation gaps towards posterior end body neck monquirasaurus short articulated vertebrae preserved excluding atlasaxis complex obscured cranium presence third vertebra obscured cranium possible certain cervical series followed pectoral dorsal sacral vertebrae vertebrae last dorsal first sacrals preserved impressions preserved neural arch vertebrae dorsals dorsally subtriangular narrow anteriorly flattened posteriorly suggesting tonguedandgrooved interlocking arrangement

overlaying although noè gómezpérez conduct phylogenetic analysis comparison morphology monquirasaurus morphology pliosaurid families suggests certainly member pliosauridae considered unlikely member brauchaucheniinae previously considered cretaceous pliosaurid lineage authors instead suggest alongside sachicasaurus acostosaurus may part unrecognized lower cretaceous nonbrauchaucheniin family pliosaurs however extensive phylogenetic analysis required support monquirasaurus found arcillolitas abigarradas member paja formation formation preserves shoreface lower shoreface environment great
