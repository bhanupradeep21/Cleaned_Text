toxoplasma gondii ˈtɒksəˌplæzmə ˈɡɒndiaɪ iː parasitic protozoan specifically apicomplexan causes found worldwide gondii capable infecting virtually warmblooded felids known definitive hosts parasite may undergo sexual rodents gondii alters behavior ways increase rodents chances preyed upon support manipulation hypothesis stems studies showing gondiiinfected rats decreased aversion cat urine infection mice lowers general anxiety increases explorative behaviors increases loss aversion predators cats one hosts within gondii sexually reproduce behavioral manipulations thought evolutionary adaptations increase parasites reproductive success since rodents avoid cat habitations likely become cat primary mechanisms behavioral changes rodents occur epigenetic remodeling neurons govern

serological studies estimate global population exposed may chronically infected gondii although infection rates differ significantly country estimates shown highest igg seroprevalence ethiopia gondii contains organelles called rhoptries micronemes well organelles life cycle gondii may broadly summarized two components sexual component occurs within cats felids wild domestic asexual component occur within virtually warmblooded animals including humans cats gondii sexually reproduce within cats cats therefore definitive host gondii hosts asexual reproduction occur intermediate hosts feline infected gondii eg consuming infected mouse carrying parasites tissue cysts parasite survives passage stomach eventually infecting epithelial cells cats small inside intestinal cells parasites undergo
