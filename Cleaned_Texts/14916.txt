kidney loop henle english ˈhɛnli henles loop henle nephron latin counterpart ansa nephroni portion nephron leads proximal convoluted tubule distal convoluted tubule named discoverer german anatomist friedrich gustav jakob henle loop henles main function create concentration gradient medulla means countercurrent multiplier system uses electrolyte pumps loop henle creates area high urea concentration deep medulla near papillary duct collecting duct system water present filtrate papillary duct flows aquaporin channels duct moving passively concentration gradient process reabsorbs water creates concentrated urine loop henle divided four parts tissue type loop simple squamous epithelium thick thin terminology refer size lumen size epithelial loop also sometimes called nephron loopcitation needed loop henle supplied blood series straight capillaries descending cortical efferent arterioles capillaries called vasa recta recta latin straight also countercurrent multiplier mechanism prevents washout solutes medulla thereby maintaining medullary concentration water osmotically driven descending limb interstitium readily enters capillaries low bloodflow vasa recta allows time osmotic equilibration altered changing resistance vessels efferent arteriolescitation needed well blood vasa recta still large proteins ions filtered glomerulus provides oncotic pressure ions enter vasa recta interstitiumcitation needed main function loop henle set concentration gradientcitation needed descending loop henle receives isotonic mosml fluid proximal convoluted tubule pct fluid isotonic ions reabsorbed gradient time system water also reabsorbed maintaining osmolarity fluid pct substances reabsorbed pct include urea water potassium sodium chloride glucose amino acids lactate phosphate bicarbonate since water also reabsorbed volume fluid loop henle less pct approximately onethird original volume interstitium kidney increases osmolarity outside loop henle descends mosml outer medulla kidney mosml inner medulla descending portion loop henle extremely permeable water less permeable ions therefore water easily reabsorbed solutes readily reabsorbed mosml fluid loop loses water higher concentration outside loop increases tonicity reaches maximum bottom loop area represents highest concentration nephron collecting duct reach tonicity maximum adhclarification needed ascending limb loop henle receives even lower volume fluid different characteristics compared descending limb ascending portion loop becomes impermeable water cells loop actively reabsorb solutes luminal fluid therefore water reabsorbed ions readily reabsorbed ions leave lumen via symporter antiporter concentration becomes hypotonic reaches approximately mosml ascending limb also called diluting segment nephron ability dilute fluid loop mosml flow fluid entire loop henle considered slow flow increases ability loop maintain osmolar gradient reduced vasa recta capillary loops also slow flow well increases vasa recta flow wash away metabolites cause medulla lose osmolarity well increases flow disrupt kidneys ability form concentrated overall loop henle reabsorbs around filtered ions filtered water normal kidney ions mostly na k powering force nakatpase basolateral membrane maintains ion concentrations inside cells luminal membrane na enters cells passively using symporter nakatpase pump na peritubular fluid k cell nonlumen side cell gives lumen fluid loop positive charge comparison creates na concentration gradient push na cell via antiporter hydrogen ion antiporter comes enzyme carbonic anhydrase takes water carbon dioxide forms bicarbonate hydrogen ion hydrogen ion exchanged na tubular fluid loop physical shape loop henle vital creation maintenance medullary gradient length imposes limit gradient words length loop henle limits concentration gradient ie longer loop greater osmotic gradient thus longer loops would allow steeper gradients greater capacity concentrate urine countercurrent multiplier loop henle increases osmolarity medulla loop henle always ushaped tubule descending limb ascending limb however length varies among different vertebrates associated fact two functions whilst first clean wastes second maintain balance ions allows balance blood pressure blood ph membrane potentials achieve balance water ions loop henle coordinates function collecting duct regulate amount water reabsorb excrete loop henle makes medulla kidney salty collecting duct regulates permeability water could reabsorbed salty environment saltier medulla water reabsorbed preurine collecting duct becomes urine sits collecting duct selectively inserted cell membranes according bodys needs reabsorb water create vertebrates live desert access lots water therefore longer loop henle creates saltier medulla leading reabsorb water preurine example urine concentration humans concentrated mosm limited length loop henle ie mm camels loop henle around mm reach mosm another example australian mouse whose loop henle mm make medulla salty permits urine rodents reach mosm words highly concentrated urine transverse section pyramidal substance kidney adult
