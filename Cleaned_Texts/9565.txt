möbius syndrome moebius syndrome rare congenital neurological disorder characterized facial paralysis inability move eyes side side people möbius syndrome born complete facial paralysis close eyes form facial expressions limb chest wall abnormalities sometimes occur syndrome people möbius syndrome normal intelligence although lack facial expression sometimes incorrectly taken due dullness unfriendliness named paul julius möbius german neurologist first described syndrome moebius syndrome foundation founded later year first moebius syndrome foundation conference held los people möbius syndrome born facial paralysis inability move eyes laterally often upper lip retracted due muscle occasionally cranial nerves v viii symptoms sometimes occur möbius syndrome arecitation needed children möbius syndrome may delayed speech paralysis muscles move lips soft palate tongue root however speech therapy people möbius syndrome develop understandable möbius syndrome associated increased occurrence symptoms möbius syndrome prevent individuals experiencing personal professional due importance facial expression smiling social interaction inability form either lead individuals möbius perceived unhappy unfriendly uninterested individuals familiar möbius patients family friends recognize signals emotion body language point sometimes report forgetting person facial indeed people möbius syndrome often adept compensating lack expression using body language posture vocal tone convey möbius syndrome results underdevelopment vi vii cranial causes möbius syndrome poorly understood thought result vascular disruption temporary loss blood flow brain prenatal many reasons vascular disruption leading möbius syndrome cases appear genetic however genetic links found families maternal trauma may result impaired interrupted blood flow ischemia lack oxygen hypoxia developing fetus cases associated reciprocal translocation chromosomes maternal illness use drugs traumatic pregnancy may also linked development möbius syndrome use drugs misoprostol thalidomide women pregnancy linked development möbius syndrome cases misoprostol used induce abortions brazil argentina well united states misoprostol abortions successful time meaning time pregnancy continues studies show use misoprostol pregnancy increases risk developing möbius syndrome factor dramatic increase risk incidence möbius syndrome without misoprostol use estimated one births making incidence möbius syndrome misoprostol use less one use cocaine also vascular effects implicated möbius child born möbius syndrome may difficulty closing mouth swallowing tongue may fasciculate quiver hypotonic low muscle tone tongue may larger smaller average may low tone muscles soft palate pharynx masticatory system palate may arched excessively high palate tongue form suction would normally shape palate palate may groove may partially due intubation early extended period time may cleft incompletely formed primary baby teeth generally start coming months age teeth may two half years age eruption timing varies greatly may incomplete formation enamel teeth enamel hypoplasia makes teeth vulnerable caries cavities may missing teeth eruptions infant closing properly lower jaws become noticeably deficient micrognathia retrognathia front teeth may touch child closes back teeth overerrupted incomplete formation maxilla condition called anterior open bite facialskeletal implications age children start losing primary teeth occasionally primary teeth slow exfoliate fall dentist may want remove primary tooth early prevent orthodontic problems likewise premature loss primary teeth may create orthodontic problems later tooth lost prematurely removable fixed spacers may needed prevent shifting teeth interceptive orthodontic treatment initiated stage development help crowding help relate upper lower jaws consistent high palate narrow arch shape upper teeth line mouth may cause upper front teeth flare become prone fracture accidentally hit interceptive orthodontics important role situation appliances expand upper arch tend bring front teeth back morenormal position appliances even help allow front teeth close normal openbite situation mouth lips may tend get dry möbius patient last primary tooth lost usually around age twelve final orthodontic treatment initiated patient able close swallow well probably open bite deficient lowerjaw growth narrow archform crowded teeth upper anterior flaring teeth orthognathic jaw surgery may indicated genetic links suggested diagnosis typically made physical characteristics symptoms patient history thorough clinical evaluation specific diagnostic test confirms möbius syndrome specialised tests may carried rule causes facial single course medical treatment cure möbius syndrome treatment supportive accordance symptoms difficulty nursing infants may require feeding tubes special bottles maintain sufficient nutrition physical occupational speech therapy improve motor skills coordination lead better control speaking eating abilities often frequent lubrication eye drops sufficient combat dry eye results impaired blinking surgery correct crossed eyes protect cornea via tarsorraphy improve limb jaw deformities sometimes called smile surgery media muscle transfers grafted thigh corners mouth performed provide ability smile although smile surgery may provide ability smile procedure complex take twelve hours side face also surgery considered cure möbius syndrome improve ability form facial
