antibiotic misuse sometimes called antibiotic abuse antibiotic overuse refers misuse overuse antibiotics potentially serious effects health contributing factor development antibiotic resistance including creation multidrugresistant bacteria informally called super bugs relatively harmless bacteria staphylococcus enterococcus acinetobacter develop resistance multiple antibiotics cause lifethreatening antibiotics around since penicillin discovered alexander fleming antibiotics determined medically important treatment animals could approved veterinary oversight national antimicrobial resistance monitoring system narms starting publications regarding antimicrobial drugs food became annual report starting publicly solicited input data collected reported matters relating use antimicrobials foodproducing animals resulting fda revised sampling structure within narms goal obtaining representative livestock data key organisms narms partners cdc usda published peerreviewed research articles examining nature magnitude antimicrobial resistance hazards associated antibiotic use foodproducing animals fda began working united states department agriculture usda centers

cdc officially recognized need antimicrobial stewardship within us hospitals publication core elements hospital antibiotic stewardship programs programs outline opportunities reducing unnecessary antibiotic usage provide guidelines antibiotic prescription common infections cdc highlighted postprescription tactics antibiotic regulation reassessing dosages class type antibiotic used order
