hair follicle organ found mammalian resides dermal layer skin made different cell types distinct functions hair follicle regulates hair growth via complex interaction hormones neuropeptides immune complex interaction induces hair follicle produce different types hair seen different parts body example terminal hairs grow scalp lanugo hairs seen covering bodies fetuses uterus newborn process hair

cycles controlled chemical signal like epidermal growth factor crucial regulator hair follicle differentiation anagen active growth phase hair root hair dividing rapidly adding hair shaft phase hair grows cm every days hair pulled phase typically root sheath attached appears clear gel coating first mm hair base may misidentified follicle root sebaceous gland nonhealth care professionals scalp hair stays active phase growth years period genetically determined end anagen phase unknown signal causes follicle go catagen phase catagen phase short transition stage occurs end anagen signals end
