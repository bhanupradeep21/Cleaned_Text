task analysis fundamental tool human factors engineering entails analyzing task accomplished including detailed description manual mental activities task element durations task frequency task allocation task complexity environmental conditions necessary clothing equipment unique factors involved required one people perform given information task analysis used many purposes personnel selection training tool equipment procedure design eg design checklists decision support systems automation though distinct task analysis related user analysis safety critical task analysis scta

ergonomics professionals task analysis may manual tasks bricklaying analyzed time motion studies using concepts industrial engineering cognitive task analysis applied modern work environments supervisory control little physical work occurs tasks related situation assessment decision making response planning task analysis also used education model applied classroom tasks discover curriculum components well matched capabilities students learning disabilities task modification might necessary discovers tasks person hasnt mastered information processing demands tasks easy problematic behavior modification breakdown complex behavioral sequence steps often serves basis chaining results task analysis often represented task models clearly indicate relations among various tasks example notation used specify task models concurtasktrees fabio patern√≤ also supported tools freely inclusion knowing task analysis fundamental skill inclusive teaching fact consists backward composition objective leads construction map plan sequence simpler actions abilities achieve specific objective task analysis necessary clearly identify prerequisites activity essential prerequisites knowledge skills competences student support prerequisites environmental facilitators therefore requires organize teaching also indispensable flexibility also three approaches technical students passive tools sociorelational students motivated participate sociotechnical intermediate way students able make decisions solve problems advantages task analysis likened set instructions navigate point point b work

bennett flach p since major change technical documentation emphasize tasks performed system rather documenting system software documentation particularly long printed technical manuals exhaustively describe every function software replaced online help organized tasks part new emphasis usability usercentered design rather systemsoftwareproduct task orientation technical documentation began publishing guidelines issued ibm late later ibm studies led john carrolls theory minimalism development xml markup language suitable print online documentation replacing sgml focus print ibm developed darwin information typing architecture xml standard oasis standard dita strong emphasis task analysis three basic information types task concept reference tasks analyzed steps main goal identifying

hta used produce exhaustive description tasks hierarchical structure goals subgoals operations hta tasks broken progressively smaller operations actions performed people interacting system system plans explain conditions necessary operations describe smallest individual task steps hta ie broken plans operations individual actions visually locate control move hand control user must perform

subgoal hierarchy also plan levels extend system third hierarchical level fourth hierarchical level hta represented list diagram form list form lines indented denote different hierarchical levels diagram form operation placed within box links made lower hierarchical level branch underneath higher level operation plans written next branches describe way branched operations carried hence plans goal oriented achieve success field hta task description method commonly used starting point analyses multimodal cpa hta provide results usability evaluation however able study hta order learn structure different tasks may also allow highlight unnecessary task steps potential errors might occur task performance hta fairly timeconsuming method carry individual operation task needs analysed however creating comprehensive hta considerably reduce time required modelling methods vicente k j cognitive work analysis toward safe productive healthy computerbased work lea bennett k b flach j
