spasmodic torticollis extremely painful chronic neurological movement disorder causing neck involuntarily turn left right upwards andor downwards condition also referred cervical dystonia agonist antagonist muscles contract simultaneously dystonic causes disorder predominantly idiopathic small number patients develop disorder result another disorder disease patients first experience symptoms midlife common treatment spasmodic torticollis use botulinum toxin type initial symptoms spasmodic torticollis usually mild feel invisible tremor head months onset head may turn pull tilt jerky movements sustain prolonged position involuntarily time involuntary spasm neck muscles increase frequency strength reaches plateau symptoms also worsen patient walking periods increased stress symptoms include muscle hypertrophy neck pain dysarthria studies shown patients report neck experience tremor pathophysiology spasmodic torticollis still relatively unknown spasmodic torticollis considered neurochemical nature result structural neurodegenerative changes although lesions present basal ganglia primary spasmodic torticollis fmri pet studies shown abnormalities basal ganglia hyper activation cortical studies suggested functional imbalance striatal control globus pallidus specifically substantia nigra pars reticulata studies hypothesize hyper activation cortical areas due reduced pallidal inhibition thalamus leading activity medial prefrontal cortical areas activity primary motor cortex also suggested functional imbalance due imbalance neurotransmitters dopamine acetylcholine gammaaminobutyric acid neurotransmitters secreted basal ganglia traveling muscle groups neck increase neurotransmitters causes spasms occur neck resulting spasmodic studies local field potentials also shown increase hz oscillatory activity globus pallidus internus myoclonic episodes increase hz activity dystonic muscles compared primary dystonias indicates oscillatory activity

single body two main ways categorize spasmodic torticollis age onset cause disorder categorized early onset patient diagnosed age late onset thereafter causes categorized either primary idiopathic secondary symptomatic spasmodic torticollis categorized direction rotation head movementcitation needed primary spasmodic torticollis defined abnormality dystonic movement occasional tremor type spasmodic torticollis usually inherited studies shown locus chromosome german family locus chromosome italian family associated spasmodic torticollis inheritance loci autosomal dominant loci autosomal dominantly inherited reduced penetrance although loci found still clear extent influence loci spasmodic conditions lead spasmodic torticollis said spasmodic torticollis secondary variety conditions cause brain injury external factors diseases conditions listed secondary spasmodic torticollis diagnosed following present history exogenous insult exposure neurological abnormalities dystonia abnormalities brain imaging particularly basal classify spasmodic torticollis one note position head combination head positions common many patients experience turning tilting actions several treatments spasmodic torticollis commonly used botulinum toxin injections dystonic muscle neck treatments include sensory trick mild occasional twinge oral medications deep brain stimulation combinations treatments used control spasmodic addition selective surgical denervation nerves triggering muscle contractions may offer relief spasms pain limit damage spine result torqued posture spinal fibrosis ie locking spinal facets due muscular contortion resulting fused vertebrae may occur rapidly suggests desynchronization frequency range movement obtaining relief via sensory trick also known geste antagoniste common characteristic present focal dystonias prevalently cervical dystonia however also seen patients sensory tricks offer temporary often partial relief spasmodic torticollis patients report partial relief spasmodic torticollis compared reporting complete relief sensory trick must also applied patient sensory trick applied examiner patients report relief comparable relief since root problem neurological doctors explored sensorimotor retraining activities enable brain rewire eliminate dystonic past dopamine blocking agents used treatment spasmodic torticollis treatment based theory imbalance neurotransmitter dopamine basal ganglia drugs fallen fashion due various serious side effects sedation parkinsonism tardive oral medications used low doses treat early stages spasmodic torticollis relief spasmodic torticollis higher patients take anticholinergic agents compared oral medications many reported complete management gabapentin alone combination another drug clonazepamcitation needed patients use anticholinergic agents report relief patients report relief clonazepam patients report relief baclofen higher doses medications used later stages spasmodic torticollis however frequency severity side effects associated medications usually tolerated side effects include dry mouth cognitive disturbance drowsiness diplopia glaucoma urinary commonly used treatment spasmodic torticollis use botulinum toxin injection dystonic musculature botulinum toxin type often used prevents release acetylcholine presynaptic axon motor end plate paralyzing dystonic disabling movement antagonist muscle agonist muscle allowed move freely botulinum toxin injections patients experience relief spasmodic torticollis approximately several type preparations available worldwide united patients experience develop immunoresistance botulinum toxin type must use botulinum toxin type b approximately patients develop botulinum toxin type antibodies botulinum toxin type b accessible united states myobloc treatment using botulinum toxin type b comparable type increased frequency side effect dry common side effects include pain injection site dysphagia due spread adjacent muscles dry mouth fatigue weakness injected adjacent muscle cochrane review published reported moderatequality evidence single botulinum toxinb treatment session could improve cervical dystonia symptoms although increased risk dry mouth swallowing another cochrane review published botulinum toxina found similar deep brain stimulation basal ganglia thalamus recently used successful treatment tremors patients parkinsons disease technique currently trialed patients spasmodic torticollis patients subjected stimulation globus pallidus internus subthalamic nucleus device analogous pacemaker external battery placed subcutaneously wires skin enter skull region brain stimulate globus pallidus internus microelectrodes placed globus pallidus internus bilaterally surgery performed multiple visits required program settings stimulator stimulation globus pallidus internus disrupts abnormal discharge pattern globus pallidus internus resulting inhibition hyperactive cortical activity globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation preferred surgical procedure due lower frequency side advantages deep brain stimulation include reversibility procedure ability adjust settings one study patients developed immunoresistance botulinum toxin underwent globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation showing improvement three six monthscitation needed low rate side effects undergo deep brain stimulation common side effect headache occurring patients followed infection cognitive dysfunction serious side effects seizure intracerebral hemorrhage intraventricular hemorrhage large subdural hematoma physical treatment options cervical dystonia include biofeedback mechanical braces well patients selfperforming geste antagoniste physical therapy also important role managing spasmodic torticollis providing stretching strengthening exercises aid patient keeping head proper alignment patients cervical dystonia ranked physical therapy intervention second botulinum toxin injections overall effectiveness reducing patients receiving physiotherapy conjunction botulinum toxin injections reported enhanced effects treatment compared injections one study examined patients cervical dystonia treated physiotherapy program included muscle stretching relaxation balance coordination training exercises muscle strengthening endurance significant reduction pain severity
