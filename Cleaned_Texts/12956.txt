certain redescription taxon philip mannion et al recovered cladograms sister species supersaurus vivianae together forming basal diplodocines cladogram published mannion et al using modified matrix whitlock found dinheirosaurus primitive torneria derived however cladogram found group supported fact primitive apatosaurus therefore outside dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis considered species

found dinheirosaurus intermediate diplodocoid along cetiosauriscus amphicoelias diplodocid probable dinheirosaurus possessed whiptail speculated tail could used like bullwhip supersonic recently tactile organ keep touch members related apatosaurus diplodocus dinheirosaurus probably possessed squared snout means probably nonselective groundfeeding dinheirosaurus one relatively sauropods gastroliths found obviously alongside type specimen experiment using dinheirosaurus diplodocus seismosaurus cedarosaurus tested sauropods used gastroliths avianstyle gastric mill analysis took account among hundreds sauropods found gastroliths known associated specimens authors chose use three sauropods associated gastroliths dinheirosaurus diplodocus cedarosaurus large amount gastroliths found birds birds typically found body weight gastroliths sauropod diplodocus highest amount gastroliths amassed body weight means since sauropods dinheirosaurus cedarosaurus less gastroliths body mass
