glomerulonephritis gn term used refer several kidney diseases usually affecting kidneys many diseases characterised inflammation either glomeruli small blood vessels kidneys hence diseases necessarily inflammatory componentcitation needed strictly single disease presentation depends specific disease entity may present isolated hematuria andor proteinuria blood protein urine nephrotic syndrome nephritic syndrome acute kidney injury chronic kidney disease categorized several different pathological patterns broadly grouped nonproliferative proliferative types diagnosing pattern gn important outcome treatment differ different types primary causes intrinsic kidney secondary causes associated certain infections bacterial viral parasitic pathogens drugs systemic disorders sle vasculitis diabetes glomerulonephritis refers inflammation glomerulus unit involved filtration kidney inflammation typically results one nephrotic nephritic nephrotic syndrome characterised finding edema person increased protein urine decreased protein blood increased fat blood inflammation affects cells surrounding glomerulus podocytes increases permeability proteins resulting increase excreted proteins amount proteins excreted urine exceeds livers ability compensate fewer proteins detected blood particular albumin makes majority circulating proteins decreased proteins blood decrease oncotic pressure blood results edema oncotic pressure tissue remains although decreased intravascular oncotic ie osmotic pressure partially explains patients edema recent studies shown extensive sodium retention distal nephron collecting duct predominant cause water retention edema nephrotic worsened secretion hormone aldosterone adrenal gland secreted response decrease circulating blood causes sodium water retention hyperlipidemia thought result increased activity nephritic syndrome characterised blood urine especially red blood cell casts dysmorphic red blood cells decrease amount urine presence hypertension syndrome inflammatory damage cells lining glomerulus thought result destruction epithelial barrier leading blood found urine time reactive changes eg proliferation mesangial cellswhich may result decrease kidney blood flow resulting decrease production urine system may subsequently activated decrease perfusion juxtaglomerular apparatus may result characterised forms glomerulonephritis number cells changed forms usually result nephrotic syndrome causes include minimal change disease characterised cause nephrotic syndrome without visible changes glomerulus microscopy minimal change disease typically presents edema increase proteins passed urine decrease blood protein levels increase circulating lipids ie nephrotic syndrome common cause nephrotic syndrome children although changes may visible light microscopy changes electron microscopy within glomeruli may show fusion foot processes podocytes cells lining basement membrane capillaries glomerulus typically managed corticosteroids progress chronic kidney focal segmental glomerulosclerosis characterised sclerosis segments glomeruli likely present nephrotic syndrome form
