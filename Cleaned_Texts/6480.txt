paroxysmal exerciseinduced dystonia ped rare neurological disorder characterized sudden transient involuntary movements often including repetitive twisting motions painful posturing triggered exercise physical ped class paroxysmal dyskinesia group rare movement disorders characterized attacks hyperkinesia intact term paroxysmal indicates episodes sudden short lived usually unpredicted return normal number reported cases people ped small leading difficulty studying classifying disease studies limited small number test subjects episodes relatively shortlived lasting anywhere minutes cases disappear completely cessation physical exercise patients experience episodes per month attacks muscles often affected usually legs feet reported cases upper body muscles arms face neck trunk also observed affected episodes age onset usually sometime childhood range years one study found mean age onset around years similarly study legs common affected part body attacks reported stiffening cramps affected episode ped patients find walking nearly cerebral spinal fluid analysis showed twofold increase homovanillic acid acid immediately following exercise compared normal levels indicated increased dopaminergic transmission could contribute ped paroxysmal neurological examinations eeg brain imaging normal ped cases ped familial also sporadic familial cases pedigrees examined shown ped autosomaldominant inheritance ped also associated parkinsons disease epilepsy migraines although exact relationship suspected contributor familial ped mutation gene codes transporter protein responsible glucose entry across thought mutation causes complete loss function protein rather slightly reduces transporters study ped patients median cerebrospinal fluidblood glucose ratio compared normal found addition reduced glucose uptake mutated transporters compared wildtype xenopus oocytes confirmed pathogenic role another recent study performed continue look possible connection ped mutations gene codes transporter ped occur isolation also noted occurs association epilepsy well study genetics fivegeneration family history ped epilepsy evaluated results noted mutations due frameshift missense mutations looking homologous transporters species noted serine position valine position asparagine position highly conserved therefore mutations residues would likely pathogenic therefore areas interest looking could lead ped mutations observed appeared affect ability transport glucose ability inserted membrane observed maximum transport velocity glucose reduced anywhere study performed determine mutation known pnkd locus chromosome cause ped addition loci observed familial hemiplegic migraine fhm locus chromosome familial infantile convulsions paroxysmal choreoathetosis icca three suspected regions found contain mutations therefore ruled possible candidates cause sporadic cases may brought minor head injuries concussions observed one patient started experiencing painless dystonia mild exercise following research still needs done determine injuries induce ped little known area two cases ped associated insulinomas removal symptoms ped since age onset relatively young ped important correctly diagnose disease limited cases limited knowledge disease makes difficult characteristics seem consistent appears patients ped would normal neurological examinations mri noticeable characteristic would low levels glucose cerebral spinal fluid due ped differs two closely related disorders example paroxysmal kinesogenic dyskinesia pkd paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia pnkd based brings symptoms namely prolonged exercise brisk walking running least minutes contrast pkd symptoms brought sudden movements pnkd symptoms spontaneous nature prolonged ped usually affects muscles sides body bilateral also observed unilateral effectscitation needed ped also shown precursor parkinsons disease two observed cases ped preceded symptoms parkinsons disease years although rare indicator ped early sign disorder suggesting one case patient ped showed evidence dopamine depletion revealed dopamine transporter spect scan typical parkinsons disease showing linkage correlation epilepsy ped observed several families across multiple generations demonstrating autosomal dominant heritability symptoms occurrence coexistent seizures ped symptoms observed mainly infancy childhood symptoms ped continuing throughout epileptic seizures vary type observed absence generalized seizures simultaneous seizure ped attacks often premeditated bouts dizziness attacks shown reduced prevented food ingestion although reasons unclear various evidence shows disorders likely caused dysfunction voltagegated ion channels may lead abnormal excitability different brain regions specifically cerebral cortex basal appeared connection ped mutated transporters possible treatment looking changing patients diets common treatment another disorder deficiency syndrome mutated transporter ketogenic diet diet strict ratio fat protein carbohydrates diet thought help restore unbalance created decreased amount glucose brain caused faulty transporter diet administered three patients screened found mutation genes coding experiencing ped symptoms three showed benefit treatment reduction ped episodes able exercise run long distances first time lives studies performed using diet many patients feel advantages diet outweigh cases noted patients able alleviate lessen ped attacks sugary snack another diet tried patients one rich carbohydrates additional frequent carbohydratecontaining snacks four patients reported ped symptoms put diet observable improvements noted fact one patient even complained worsening additionally observed levodopa may reduce symptoms associated ped may demonstrate ped precursor parkinsons disease acetazolamide beneficial patients also worsened symptoms others additionally modified version atkins diet helped regulate glucose levels cerebrospinal patients ped associated insulinomas appeared symptoms resolved consuming sugary currently drugs particularly useful completely curing symptomscitation needed reported cases ped approximately reported sporadic cases ped ped families dispute exact number addition appears ped becomes less severe aging prior onset ped episode patients reported onset symptoms including sweating pallor hyperventilation brain scans observed patients suffering form frequent peds increased metabolism putamen brain decreased metabolism frontal another study using subtraction single photon emission computed tomographic spect imaging technique coregistered mri patient presented ped symptoms showed increased cerebral perfusion primary somatosensory cortex area mild increase region primary motor cortex correlations fully understand exactly happening brain provides areas interest study hopefully understand ped fullycitation needed since paroxysmal exerciseinduced dystonia rare disorder makes difficult study disease find consistencies many current studies seem contradicting conclusion due fact studies usually limited small number test subjects
