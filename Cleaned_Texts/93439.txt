human echolocation ability humans detect objects environment sensing echoes objects actively creating sounds example tapping canes lightly stomping foot snapping fingers making clicking noises mouths people trained orient echolocation interpret sound waves reflected nearby objects accurately identifying location size term echolocation coined zoologist donald griffin however reports blind humans able locate silent objects date back human echolocation known formally studied since least earlier times human echolocation sometimes described facial vision obstacle sense believed proximity nearby objects caused pressure changes series experiments performed cornell psychological laboratory show sound hearing rather pressure changes skin mechanisms driving field human animal echolocation surveyed book form early see also white et al many blind individuals passively use natural environmental echoes sense details environment however others actively produce mouth clicks able gauge information environment using echoes passive active echolocation help blind individuals sense environments see environments often readily perceive echoes nearby objects due echo suppression phenomenon brought precedence effect however training sighted individuals normal hearing learn avoid obstacles using sound showing echolocation general human lore thaler led researchers durham university determine could teach echolocation people tenweek period taught blind people others vision hearing akin interprets detections reflected waves energy vision processes light waves travel source bounce surfaces throughout environment enter eyes similarly auditory system processes sound waves travel source bounce surfaces enter ears neural systems extract great deal information environment interpreting complex patterns reflected energy sense organs receive case sound waves reflected energy referred echoes echoes sounds convey spatial data comparable many respects conveyed blind traveler using echoes perceive complex detailed specific features world distances far beyond reach longest cane arm echoes make information available nature arrangement objects environmental features overhangs

something low sparse sounds like bush object tall broad sparse probably blind people skilled echolocating silent objects simply producing mouth clicks listening returning echoes although studies performed neural basis human echolocation studies report activation primary visual cortex echolocation blind expert driving mechanism brain region remapping phenomenon known neuroplasticity study thaler researchers first made recordings clicks faint echoes using tiny microphones placed ears blind echolocators stood outside tried identify different objects car flag pole tree researchers played recorded sounds back echolocators brain activity measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging remarkably echolocation recordings played back blind experts perceive objects based echoes also showed activity areas brain normally process visual information sighted people primarily primary visual cortex result surprising visual areas normally active visual tasks brain areas process auditory information activated sound recordings outdoor scenes containing echoes sound recordings outdoor scenes echoes removed importantly experiment carried sighted people echolocate individuals could perceive objects echorelated activity anywhere brain suggests cortex blind echolocators plastic reorganizes primary visual cortex rather auditory area becomes involved computation echolocation tasks despite evidence extent activation visual cortex blind echolocators contributes echolocation abilities previously mentioned sighted individuals ability echolocate however show comparable activation visual cortex would suggest sighted individuals use areas beyond visual cortex echolocation echolocation developed daniel kish works blind nonprofit organization world access leads blind teenagers
