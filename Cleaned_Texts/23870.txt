direct thrombin inhibitors dtis class anticoagulant drugs used prevent treat embolisms blood clots caused various diseases inhibit thrombin serine protease affects coagulation cascade many ways dtis undergone rapid development since technological advances genetic engineering production recombinant hirudin made possible opened door new group drugs use dtis therapy prophylaxis anticoagulation stayed years use heparin derivatives warfarin well known disadvantages dtis still development research focus shifted towards factor xa inhibitors even dual thrombin fxa inhibitors broader mechanism action inhibiting factor iia thrombin xa recent review patents literature thrombin inhibitors demonstrated development allosteric multimechanism inhibitors might lead way safer anticoagulation therapy long history john berry haycraft described substance found saliva leeches hirudo medicinalis anticoagulant effects named substance hirudine latin name use medicinal leeches dated back way ancient early century jay mclean l emmet holt jr william henry howell discovered anticoagulant heparin isolated liver heparin remains one effective anticoagulants still used today although disadvantages requiring intravenous administration variable doseresponse curve due substantial protein low molecularweight heparin lmwh developed derived heparin enzymatic chemical depolymerization better pharmacokinetic properties first clinical use warfarin vitamin k antagonist reported warfarin originally used rat poison thought unsafe humans suicide attempt suggested relatively safe humans vitamin k antagonists commonly used oral anticoagulants today warfarin prescribed drug united states actually widely prescribed oral anticoagulant warfarin disadvantages though like heparin narrow therapeutic index multiple food drug interactions requires routine anticoagulation monitoring dose since heparin warfarin downsides search alternative anticoagulants ongoing dtis proving worthy competitors first dti actually hirudin became easily available genetic engineering available recombinant form lepirudin refludan desirudin revasc iprivask development dtis followed hirudin analog bivalirudin small molecular however dtis also side effects bleeding complications liver toxicity longterm effects doubtcitation needed blood vessel ruptures gets injured factor vii comes contact tissue factors starts process called blood coagulation cascade purpose stop bleeding repair tissue damage process active due various problems risk blood clots embolisms increases name indicates cascade multistep procedure main product thrombin made activating various proenzymes mainly serine proteases step cascade thrombin multiple purposes mainly converts soluble fibrinogen insoluble fibrin furthermore activates factors v viii xi cleaving sequences glyglyglyvalargglypro phepheseralaargglyhis selectively arginine arg glycine factors generate thrombin thrombin also activates factor xiii stabilizes fibrin complex therefore clot stimulates platelets help coagulation given broad action thrombin stands good drug target anticoagulant drugs heparin warfarin dtis antiplatelet drugs like thrombin serine protease family binding domains thrombininhibition drugs bind proteases deep narrow gap active binding site consists two Î²barrel subdomains make surface gap binds substrate peptides surface gap seems limiting access molecules steric hindrance binding site consists amino acids thrombin also two exosites thrombin little different serine proteases exosite anionbinding binds fibrin similar substrates exosite heparinbinding dtis inhibit thrombin two ways bivalent dtis block simultaneously active site exosite act competitive inhibitors univalent dtis block active site therefore inhibit unbound fibrinbound thrombin contrast heparin drugs bind exosite form bridge thrombin antithrombin natural anticoagulant substrate formed body strongly catalyzes function heparin also form bridge thrombin fibrin binds exosite protects thrombin inhibiting function heparinantithrombin complex increases thrombins affinity dtis bind anionbinding site shown inactivate thrombin without disconnecting thrombin fibrin points separate binding site dtis arent dependent cofactors like antithrombin inhibit thrombin inhibit freesoluble thrombin well fibrin bound thrombin unlike inhibition either irreversible
