ocular immune system protects eye infection regulates healing processes following injuries interior eye lacks lymph vessels highly vascularized many immune cells reside uvea including mostly macrophages dendritic cells mast cells fight intraocular infections intraocular inflammation manifest uveitis including iritis retinitis cornea eye immunologically special tissue constant exposure exterior world means vulnerable wide range microorganisms moist mucosal surface makes cornea particularly susceptible attack time lack vasculature relative immune separation rest body makes immune defense difficult lastly cornea multifunctional tissue provides large part eyes refractive power meaning maintain remarkable transparency must also serve barrier keep pathogens reaching rest eye similar function dermis epidermis keeping underlying tissues protected immune reactions within cornea come surrounding vascularized tissues well innate immune responsive cells reside within cornea important function cornea transmit refract light allow sharp highresolution images produced back retina collagen within cornea highly ordered nanometers diameter placed nanometers apart reduce light furthermore tissue vascularized contain lymphoid cells defense mechanisms apart dendritic cells factors necessitate small number cells within cornea however necessitates keeping immune cells relative distance effectively creating time delay exposures pathogen mounting immune therefore many immune protective responses within cornea moistening nutrition come nonlocal sources conjunctiva innate immune responses defend pathogens toxin nondiscriminatory manner provide inherent barrier corneal infection also serving primary mode defense present birth instance orbit eyelid guard traumatic exterior debris may contain microorganisms components ocular innate immune system include tears epithelial cells keratocytes corneal nerves complement system interferons acquired immune responses much pathogenspecific innate immune counterparts pathways cellmediated understood controlled part langerhans cells cornea langerhans cells antigenpresenting cells pick pieces invading pathogens use elicit immune response cellmediated immune responses much slower acting efficient cause damage surrounding tissue resulting damage vision innate acquired responses important ocular defenses one major pathway incorporated network lymphoid cells form mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue malt malt major component mucosal organs including respiratory genital digestive ocular tracts regulated migrations immune cells known occur mucosal organs however role malt human ocular defenses fully understood however known lacrimal glands conjunctiva contribute ocular defenses via secretion immunoglobulins lymphoid tissues latter understood organized clumps lymphoid follicles well diffuse lymphoid follicular form malt antigens taken follicles presented lymphocytes antigen presenting cells leads activation b cells carry immune reaction diffuse lymphoid tissues hand composed mainly interspersed effector generally pathways lead activation migration immune cells within mucosal tissues including conjunctiva conjunctiva covers sclera whites eyes well insides eyelids provides nutrients underlying surrounding tissue conjunctiva also one closest vascularized tissues cornea provides major source immune components cornea conjunctiva produce iga like lacrimal glands also contains macrophages neutrophilic granulocytes mast cells lymphocytes aspects general mucosal immune like rest malt pathway conjunctiva found possess lymphoid follicles develop puberty decline old age well diffuse lymphoid tissues conjunctiva also possess macrophages play part modulating tcell immune response mediating innate acquired immune responses tear film composed three layers lipid aqueous play role creating smooth surface facilitate refraction lubricating movement eyelid passively transporting gases oxygen carbon dioxide protecting cornea last function achieved functions various layers within tear film tears bathe corneal epithelial cells moist environment preventing drying weakening however liquid layer tear film also contains antimicrobial properties resulting presence lysozymes lactoferrins lipocalin betalysine facilitate pathogen defenses lysis bacterial cell walls prevention bacterial viral binding inflammation detoxification furthermore white blood cells transported corneal surface via tear film toxic agents well debris diluted washed away tear tear film also contains immunoglobulins especially iga found concentrations significantly higher serum iga shown prevent bacterial binding along another immunoglobulin present tear film igg iga also neutralize viruses bind bacteria aiding detection via pathways corneal epithelial cells present physical barrier prevent microbes reaching interior eye chamber effectively separated rest body via tight junctions time corneal epithelial cells also secrete cytokines activate microbial one cytokine interleukin stored epithelial cells automatically released cell membrane ruptured infection trauma however longterm effects lead enhanced immune infiltration cornea also neovascularization formation new blood vessels lead loss corneal transparency therefore cornea also found secrete antagonist decreases leucocyte invasion cornea suppresses neovascularization help preserve keratocytes flattened cells found dispersed within corneal stroma primary role sparse population cells thought maintaining extracellular matrix collagen lamellae surround however keratocytes also play defensive role pathogenic invasion influenced secreted corneal epithelial cells tumor necrosis factor tnfÎ± produce defensins former found combine synergistically interleukins increase costimulation immune aspects well increase antibody secretion latter defensins wide range antimicrobial affects bacteria fungi viruses well effects accelerating healing damaged epithelial also found presence secreted defensins secreted corneal keratocytes correlated cases corneal transplant suggesting peptides may role tissue rejection furthermore keratocytes also found secrete attracts neutrophils infections involving herpes simplex corneal nerves serve form defense detecting presence foreign bodies corneal surface leads reflexive reactions increased lacrimal secretion blinking release neuropeptides induce cytokine httpsenwikipediaorgwikiocularimmunesystem
