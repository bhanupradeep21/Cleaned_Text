sunburn form radiation burn affects living tissue skin results overexposure ultraviolet uv radiation usually sun common symptoms humans animals include red reddish skin hot touch painful general fatigue mild dizziness symptoms include blistering peeling skin swelling itching nausea excessive uv radiation leading cause primarily nonmalignant skin extreme cases lifethreatening sunburn inflammatory response tissue triggered direct dna damage uv radiation cells dna overly damaged uv radiation type celldeath triggered tissue sun protective measures like sunscreen sun protective

topical systemic medications dermatologic disorders aggravated exposure sunlight considerations diagnosis include duration intensity uv exposure topical systemic medication use history dermatologic
