different morphogen gradient responses encoded dna using diverse drosophila species different sized eggs study set structured would coevolved coadapted changes concentration gradients morphogen gradient systems core fundamental subject developmental biology models morphogen gradient responses encoded previously proposed tested across set unrelated enhancers constructed shared regulatory grammar located throughout genome three major unexpected findings resulted work first finding gradient responses general evolve changes transcription factor tf binding site quality quantity site
