sleep state misperception ssm term international classification sleep disorders icsd commonly used people mistakenly perceive sleep though proposed applied severely overestimate sleep time positive sleep state sleepers condition report slept previous night slept clinical recordings generally show normal sleep patterns though sleep patterns found ssm long considered indistinguishable without preliminary research suggest may subtle differences see symptoms diagnosis spectral patients otherwise generally good associated fear negative consequences insomnia insomnia phobia actual loss sleep state misperception adopted icsd replace two previous diagnostic terminologies subjective insomnia complaint without objective findings subjective sleepiness complaint without objective validity reliability sleep state misperception pertinent diagnosis studies finding poor empirical sleep state misperception classified intrinsic medical medical source ssm regarded subtype insomnia also established separate sleepcondition distinct nonetheless value distinguishing type insomnia types debatable due relatively low frequency ssm sleep state misperception also broken several types patients validity reliability sleep state misperception pertinent medical entity study found poor empirical support diagnostic sleep disorder frequently applies patients report feeling tired despite subjective perception medical source generally may describe experiencing several years sleep short sleep nonrestorative sleep otherwise patients appear healthy psychiatrically condition often asymptomatic could explain relatively unreported however upon clinical observation found patients may severely overestimate time took fall reporting slept half amount time indicated polysomnogram electroencephalography eeg may record normal observing discrepancy subjective objective reports clinicians may conclude perception poor sleep primarily illusionary alternatively people may report excessive daytime sleepiness chronic disabling sleepiness sleep disorder found methods diagnosing sleepiness objectively multiple sleep latency test confirm sleepiness observed despite finally opposite end spectrum patients may report feeling slept much longer proposed experience subclassified sleep state misperception positive sleep state misperception reverse sleep state misperception negative sleep state misperception patient complaint insomnia sleep quality duration normal polysomnographic monitoring demonstrates normal sleep latency normal number arousals awakenings normal sleep duration without multiple sleep latency test demonstrates mean sleep latency greater minutes medical mental disorder produces complaint sleep disorders producing insomnia present degree would explain patients complaint detecting sleep state misperception objective means study published journal psychosomatic medicine shown sleep misperception ie underestimation sleep duration prevalent among chronic insomniacs sleep objectively hours sleep lab psychological profile chronic insomniacs objective normal sleep duration characterized depressive anxiousruminative traits poor coping resources thus appears chronic insomniacs underestimate sleep duration sleep misperception clinical characteristic chronic insomniacs objective normal sleep duration furthermore rumination poor coping resources may play significant role sleep according may article published new scientist spectral analysis may help clinicians find objective evidence sleep state misperception uncovered subtle differences eegs sleeping insomniacs alpha waves signatures wakefulness supposed show early sleep intruding deep sleep psychologist sleep researcher michael perlis andrew krystal duke university durham north carolina used spectral analysis quantify much intruding krystals nonsleepers greater proportion alpha disturbances alpha waves bigger delta waves correspondingly smaller wasnt perlis researchers applied spectral analysis algorithms eegs sleeping insomniacs found different patterns fast waves known beta gamma sleep vol p normally indicators consciousness alertness even anxiety like alpha waves perlis calls beta gamma waves intrusions normal sleep somebody playing switch boop boop flipping mad rate wake considered objective insomnia unlike ssm easily confirmed empirically clinical testing experience ssm may believe slept extended periods time fact sleep without perceiving example patients claim little sleep may usually acknowledge impaired job performance daytime drowsiness sleep state misperceivers often cases objective total insomnia extremely rare recorded predominantly ascribed rare incurable genetic disorder called fatal familial insomnia patients rarely survive months onset much behavioral treatment effective sedative hypnotics may also help relieve additionally education normal patterns sleepwake cycle may alleviate anxiety patients severe depression resulting fear insomnia electroconvulsive therapy appears safe effective subject monitored recording observer may way tell treatment working properly due amnesic nature ssm condition may worsen result persistent attempts treat symptoms conventional methods dealing insomnia prescription hypnotics stimulants may lead drug dependency nonetheless chronic ssm may increase risk depression anxiety substance also noted patients condition may sometimes opt take medications treatments wrong reasons eg euphoriant ssm poorly understood little information regarding risk factors though believed prevalent among young middle aged distribution among general population gender unknown clinical population may though figure subject sampling bias httpsenwikipediaorgwikisleepstatemisperception
