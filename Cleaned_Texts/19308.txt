charles darwin expanded ronald fisher present five sub mechanisms explain mate choice evolved time direct phenotypic benefits sensory bias fisherian runaway hypothesis indicator traits genetic compatibility majority systems mate choice exists one sex tends competitive samesex sex choosy meaning selective comes picking individuals mate direct indirect benefits selective species females choosy sex discriminates among competitive several examples reversed roles see preferable individual choose compatible mate species order maintain reproductive factors influence mate choice include pathogen stress major histocompatibility complex mhc charles darwin first expressed ideas sexual selection mate choice book descent man selection relation sex perplexed elaborate ornamentation males species features appeared detrimental survival negative consequences reproductive success darwin proposed two explanations existence traits traits useful malemale combat preferred article focuses latter darwin treated natural selection sexual selection two different topics although biologists defined sexual selection part natural ronald fisher wrote paper evolution female preference secondary sexual fifteen years later expanded theory book called genetical theory natural selection described scenario fisherian runaway feedback mate preference trait results elaborate characters long tail male peacock using drosophila model angus john bateman presented experimental evidence male reproductive success limited number mates obtained female reproductive success limited number pregnancies thus female must selective choosing mate quality offspring depends males must fight form intrasexual competition opportunity mate males chosen females became known batemans principle although major finding added work darwin fisher overlooked george c williams emphasised importance soon williams revival subject robert l trivers presented parental investment theory trivers defined parental investment investment made parent benefits current offspring cost investment future offspring investments include costs producing gametes well care efforts parents provide birth hatching reformulating batemans ideas trivers argued sex exhibits less parental investment necessarily male compete mating opportunities sex invests differences levels parental investment create condition favours mating act choosy likely selected way assess whether potential partners contributions would capable producing andor maintaining viability offspring utilizing behaviors usually results two types benefits individual choosy usually animal biologists assume mate choice biased relatives negative consequences however certain natural constraints act limit evolution inbreeding avoidance particularly risk mating partner different species heterospecific mating losing fitness inclusive fitness appears maximized matings intermediately related five proposed mechanisms address evolution mate choice direct andor indirect benefits drive mating biases described mechanism possible mechanisms cooccur although relative roles evaluated choosy mate tends preferences certain types known would benefit potential partner traits must reliable commutative something directly benefits choosy partner mating preference advantageous situation directly affects reproductive fitness direct benefits widespread empirical studies provide evidence mechanism one example sexually selected trait direct benefits bright plumage northern cardinal common backyard bird eastern united states male northern cardinals conspicuous red feathers females cryptic coloration example females choosy sex use male plumage brightness signal picking mate research suggests males brighter plumage feed young frequently males duller increased help caring young lifts burden mother raise offspring could without help though particular mechanism operates premise phenotypes must communicate something benefits choosy mate directly selected phenotypes also additional indirect benefits mother benefiting offspring example increased help feeding young seen northern cardinals plumagebrightness comes increase overall amount food likely given offspring even mother though females may choose trait presumed directly advantageous aim allowing time energy allocate producing offspring also benefits offspring two parents provide food instead one thereby increasing likelihood overall amount food available offspring despite possible increase amount offspring sensorybias hypothesis states preference trait evolves nonmating context exploited less
