perspectivetaking act perceiving situation understanding concept alternative point view another vast amount scientific literature suggests perspectivetaking crucial human may lead variety beneficial perspectivetaking may also possible nonhuman theory research suggested ages children begin perspectivetake ability develops research suggests certain people attention deficit hyperactivity disorder comorbid conduct problems oppositional defiant may reduced ability engage perspectivetaking studies assess brain regions involved perspectivetaking suggest several regions may involved including prefrontal cortex perspectivetaking related theories concepts including theory perspectivetaking takes place individual views situation anothers perspectivetaking defined along two dimensions perceptual perceptual perspectivetaking ability understand another person experiences things senses ie visually literature devoted perceptual perspectivetaking focuses visual perspectivetaking ability understand way another person sees things physical conceptual perspectivetaking ability comprehend take viewpoint another persons psychological experience ie thoughts feelings theory mind awareness people individual psychological states differ one within perspectivetaking literature term perspectivetaking theory mind sometimes used interchangeably studies use theory mind tasks order test someone engaging two concepts related different theory mind recognition another person different thoughts feelings perspectivetaking ability take persons point empathy defined ability share emotions another person empathy perspectivetaking studied together variety ways always clear lines distinction empathy perspectivetaking two concepts often studied conjunction one another viewed related similar research distinguishes two concepts points literature theorizes perspectivetaking one component studies assessed age humans capable visual perspectivetaking drawn different conclusions jean piaget b√§rbel inhelder conducted study assess visual perspectivetaking abilities young children study come known three mountain found ages nine ten children successfully complete three mountain problem seem able understand someone standing different location ie different mountain top different view however children ages eight struggled since classic study number studies suggested visual perspectivetaking may possible earlier age example study used different method assess visual perspectivetaking suggested children may able successfully visually perspectivetake age four half years study fourandahalfyearold children able understand someone sitting closer picture would better view picture however researchers found children three threeandahalf years old struggled task led conclude age range three fourandahalf years old could crucial perspectivetaking developmental psychologist john h flavell suggested two levels visual perspectivetaking emerge children studies examined children able demonstrate level level perspectivetaking studies shown children months months may able engage level perspectivetaking able understand various lines sight depending position research also suggests children engage level perspectivetaking early two half years studies also suggest visual perspectivetaking ability improves childhood example comparing sixyearolds eightyearolds tenyearolds adults averaging years old researchers found peoples age increases visual perspectivetaking tasks done accuracy piagets theory cognitive development suggests perspectivetaking begins concrete operational stage third stage ranges ages seven stage idea decentration introduced cognitive ability decentration ability take account way others perceive various aspects given another developmental perspectivetaking theory created robert l selman called social perspectivetaking theory roletaking theory theory suggests five developmental stages involved perspectivetaking ranging ages three six characterized egocentrism inability think things anothers point view teenagers adults understand another persons point view whose understanding informed recognizing another persons environment theory suggests humans mature childhood adulthood ability perspectivetake improves studies selman colleagues suggest children perspectivetake different ways different studies assess children begin take viewpoint another person considering feelings thoughts attitudes although distinction visual cognitive perspectivetaking important authors claim forms perspectivetaking rely general ability different types perspectivetaking respect visual perspectivetaking adults tversky hard shown observers tend use point view another person describing spatial relations processing perspectives may spontaneous according studies even also cases spontaneously evaluate another person seeing make systematic mistakes striking example person scene looking towards mirror often interpret seeing even layout makes impossible phenomenon known venus visual perspectivetaking studies focus brain regions generally performed collecting functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri data participants perform perspectivetaking tasks example participant may shown picture another person objects around asked take viewpoint person indicate number objects see level visual perspectivetaking objects located right left person level visual participant completing task also fmri scan metaanalysis looked fmri research visual perspectivetaking suggested several areas brain clustered activation perspectivetaking tasks areas included left prefrontal cortex precuneus left studies suggest areas brain involved visual respectivelyclarification needed research also suggests multiple brain areas involved conceptual perspectivetaking studies conducted administering positron emission tomography pet scan asking participants engage perspectivetaking tasks example one study participants medical students asked consider knowledge base someone medical field would list medical studies suggest regions activated cognitive perspectivetaking include right parietal lobe posterior cingulate cortex among areas seem involved people imagine imagine perspective others example participants asked imagine engaging activity versus imagining another person engaging activity precuneus supplementary motor area sma activated suggesting visual imagery motor movement thoughts involved research highlights perspectivetaking may difficult children attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd plus cooccurring conduct disorders adhd research shown children diagnosis demonstrate impairments attention harder time taking viewpoint others children evidence suggests children autism may able engage visual perspectivetaking difficulty engaging conceptual example study compared perspectivetaking scores children diagnosed autism compared children diagnosis found significant difference scores level level visual perspectivetaking however study found much harder autistic children engage conceptual perspectivetaking studies explored potential interventions could help improve perspectivetaking abilities children autism suggest video may help teach perspectivetaking skills one intervention study autistic children found showing children video someone engaging perspectivetaking tasks explaining actions led improved perspectivetaking abundance literature links perspectivetaking abilities behaviors much literature focuses conceptual conceptual perspectivetaking gives one ability better understand reason behind another persons actions also helps one engage social conversations acceptable friendly way many studies associate perspectivetaking empathy psychologist mark davis suggested empathy consists multiple dimensions assess davis developed interpersonal reactivity index iri consists four subscales fantasy empathic concern personal distress perspectivetaking perspectivetaking subscale asks participants report likely engage trying see things another persons point studies using widely cited measure found perspectivetaking associated many prosocial behaviors one study assessed crosscultural data countries using iri concluded perspectivetaking empathic concern associated volunteerism agreeableness well selfesteem life research suggests perspectivetaking leads empathic research distinguishes two different types perspectivetaking thinking oneself would act feel behave placed someone elses situation thinking way another person thinks feels behaves results research reveals thinking another person behaves feels situation leads feelings empathy however thinking one would behave another persons situation leads feelings empathy well research also finds negotiations taking perspective another person empathizing may differential outcomesclarification needed one study found people engaged perspectivetaking effective making deal another person finding innovative agreements satisfied parties compared empathized someone research reveals perspectivetaking associated sympathy toward others prosocial behavior children young months study sibling interactions found toddlers older siblings likely help take care younger siblings theyclarification needed demonstrated higher perspectivetaking perspectivetaking also associated creativity increases amount creative ideas generated team one study suggests perspectivetaking leads creative innovative ideas particularly participants internally driven complete many studies find potential benefits perspectivetaking perceptions outgroup membersclarification needed studies perspectivetaking bias stereotyping generally done asking participants take perspective another person different certain domains ie asking young adult participants take perspective elderly person asking white participants take perspective black person seen photograph studies show perspectivetaking lead reduced stereotyping outgroup improved attitudes towards increased helping behavior outgroup membersclarification needed perspectivetaking lead reduced ingroup research implicit unconscious biases found perspectivetaking reduce implicit bias scores measured implicitassociation test well recognition subtle discriminationclarification research differences conversation someone agree versus someone disagree finds participants disagreed enhanced perspectivetaking ability could better remember researchers suggest drawbacks perspectivetaking example studies found asking people engage perspectivetaking tasks lead increased stereotyping target target deemed stereotypic adopting stereotypic behaviors outgroup studies assess nonhuman animals successfully engage perspectivetaking drawn consistent conclusions many studies assess perspectivetaking training animals specific tasks measuring consistently animals follow eye gaze humans able successfully follow anothers eye gaze could indicate animal aware human seeing paying attention something different study spider monkeys capuchin monkeys found primates successfully performed eye gazing tasks led researchers conclude monkeys demonstrated ability consider another persons however another study found rhesus monkeys unsuccessful eye gazing studies suggest dogs complex social one study researchers told dog allowed eat treat placed treat location dog could dogs likely eat treat instructed barrier hid dog instructor dogs less likely eat treat barrier smaller size window study also showed dogs struggled tasks focused dogs visual attention researchers suggest
