qianshanosuchus genus basal crocodyloid paleocene qianshan basin china fossil material includes incomplete skull parts lower jaw show various features usually associated juvenile crocodiles alongside various unique traits used erect new genus first basal crocodyloid currently known paleocene china previously yielded alligatoroids planocraniids presence part world basal position species genus asiatosuchus supports idea crocodyloids dispersed asia europe qianshanosuchus includes single species qianshanosuchus qianshanosuchus known single specimen ibcas incomplete skull associated part mandible based small size holotype several anatomical traits thought preserve juvenile specimen material collected near xialou village qianshan basin china joint expedition belgian chinese researchers

show slight lateral compression typically seen juvenile crocodilians also found adult several features skull also indicative fact material forms qianshanosuchus belonged juvenile includes relative size orbits compared full skull similarly size skull table compared total skull width overall orbits take three quarters skulls width one quarter length supratemporal fenestrae shallow widely spaced seen juveniles modern species skull lacks pronounced ornamentation typical adult crocodiles various characters related teeth frontal bone elements likewise suggest specimen yet mature time death spite variable features however deemed diagnostic qianshanosuchus determined unaffected ontogeny modern crocodilians exception regards upturned margins orbits remain unchanged species disappear age determine relationship qianshanosuchus crocodylians two different datasets used boerman colleagues matrix et al chosen first dataset due extensive coverage asian crocodylians second matrix hand rio mannion offers series additional advantages dissadvantages compared shans dataset rio mannion included several additional characters reductive coding objective wording however unlike former dataset include large amount basal crocodyloids orientalosuchines two matrices subsequently differ notably recover internal relationships crocodylia et al recovers tomistominae independent group closely related crocodylidae basal gavialoidea dataset shows tomistomines gavialines forming clade derived material qianshanosuchus thought belonged juvenile matrices used multiple times changed circumstances account features would change age initial analysis took datasets additional tests either removed juvenile characters qianshanosuchus included data juvenile specimens american alligator nile crocodile using matrix et al consistently recovered qianshanosuchus basal member crocodyloidea less derived various species asiatosuchus outcome remained unchanged regardless inclusion juvenile characters likewise results formed rio mannion matrix showed little impact juvenile characters general placement qianshanosuchus unlike former tests taxon placed outside crocodyloidea even longirostres clade formed crocodyloids gavialoids dataset found consistently align asiatosuchus although exact relations formed clade varied slightly across boerman colleagues conclude although precise topology different crocodilian clades differ analysis matrices qianshanosuchus consistently shows affinities taxa typically considered basal crocodyloids argue different results stemming rio mannion matrix may partially caused relative recency tentatively assign qianshanosuchus crocodyloidea two phylogenetic trees show qianshanosuchus position recovered matrix et al left rio mannion right respectively

paleocene china previously oldest member clade asiatosuchus grangeri middle eocene approximately million years later phylogenetic analysis following matrix et al suggests qianshanosuchus would immediately basal prodiplocynodon albertosuchus two taxa late cretaceous north america following results would require asian qianshanosuchus diverged north american relatives point maastrichtian hypothesis could corroborated jiangxisuchus cretaceous china previous analysis placed basal crocodyloid however description qianshanosuchus recovered alligatoroid instead regardless dispersal may occurred bering land bridge would exposed maastrichtian although alligatoroids suggested also dispersed north america europe prior eocene lack crocodyloids cretaceous europe suggests ancestors
