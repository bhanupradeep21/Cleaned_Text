photic sneeze reflex also known autosomal dominant compelling helioophthalmic outburst achoo inherited congenital autosomal dominant reflex condition causes sneezing response numerous stimuli looking bright lights periocular surrounding eyeball injection condition affects worlds exact mechanism action well photic sneeze reflex manifests form uncontrollable sneezing response stimulus would produce sneeze people without trait sneezes generally occur bursts sneezes followed refractory period long hourscitation needed photic sneeze results exposure bright light common manifestation photic sneeze reflex reflex seems caused change light intensity rather specific wavelength survey conducted school optometry university alabama birmingham found respondents identified photic sneezers female caucasian study also found photic sneezing significantly common people deviated nasal studies revealed mechanism even less well understood photic sneezing sneezing response periocular injection trait appears inherited autosomal dominant surgeries around eye corneal transplant surgery patient often requires injection local anesthetic eye patients show photic sneeze reflex injection eye undergone retrobulbar peribulbar block often elicit sneeze patient procedures patient may sedated prior periocular injection patient begins sneeze needle inserted eye often resulting anesthesiologist remove needle injecting local condition called gustatory rhinitis cause individuals sneeze eating particularly consumption spicy stomach fullness another example stimulus cause uncontrollable sneezing exhibit symptom disorder called snatiation undergo uncontrollable fits sneezes immediately eating large meals completely fill stomach regardless type food eaten snatiation believed allergic reaction sneezing generally present particular risks individual usually annoyance risk injury fits sneezing brought photic sneeze reflex however dangerous implications certain scenarios activities operating vehicle undergoing operations dental optical bright lights directed towards patients facecitation needed fit sneezing operating vehicle cause operator lose control vehicle resulting injury person damage vehicle andor surroundings particular photic sneezing poses considerable risk pilots due frequent presence bright sunlight precise reactions needed successfully control aircraft pilot fighter aircraft uncontrollable fit sneezing occur aerial combat pilot could incapacitated situational awareness needs greatest plane landing aircraft carrier shoreline also requires precise movements quick reflexes reflection sun surrounding water high probability producing least one photic sneeze pilots reflex amount sneezing attempting land could cause pilot lose control potentially resulting uncontrollable fits sneezing common patients propofol sedation undergo periocular retrobulbar much debate true cause mechanism sneezing fits brought photic sneeze reflex sneezing occurs response irritation nasal cavity results afferent nerve fiber signal propagating ophthalmic maxillary branches trigeminal nerve trigeminal nerve nuclei brainstem signal interpreted trigeminal nerve nuclei efferent nerve fiber signal goes different parts body mucous glands thoracic diaphragm thus producing obvious difference normal sneeze photic sneeze stimulus normal sneezes occur due irritation nasal cavity photic sneeze result wide variety stimuli theories also genetic factor increases probability photic sneeze c allele snp particularly implicated although mechanism unknown gene increases probability response stimulation ophthalmic branch trigeminal nerve may enhance irritability maxillary branch resulting increased probability sneezing similar mechanism photophobia develops persistent light exposure relaying signals optic nerve trigeminal nerve produce increased sensitivity ophthalmic branch increased sensitivity occurred maxillary branch instead ophthalmic branch sneeze could result instead parasympathetic nervous system many neighboring fibers respond different stimuli one stimulus activates multiple nerve fibers parasympathetic nervous system parasympathetic generalization occurring possibility sensory input eyes could travel neurons cortex interpret signals neighboring neurons involved sneezing also activated due generalization could lead sneeze response stimulus nasal trigeminal nerve directly stimulated possibility increased light sensitivity ocular nerve could result example directly stimulating would plucking eyebrow pulling hair many people show photic sneeze reflex even direct stimulation lead photic sneeze find easier sneeze looking bright uncontrollable sneezing periocular injection sedated propofol likely caused drug propofol shown temporarily suppress inhibitory neurons brainstem also trigeminal nucleus sneeze center brain lies chain events leads increased sensitivity stimulation reduced threshold involuntary responses hypersensitive state periocular injection stimulates ophthalmic andor maxillary branch trigeminal nerve results summation trigeminal nuclei summation lead sneeze unconscious smallscale study comprising caucasian family spain done sevillano et al july revealed prominent corneal nerves might associated photic sneeze phenomenon poorly understood recent research shown antihistamines used treat rhinitis due seasonal allergies may also reduce occurrence photic sneezes people affected affected photic sneezing may find relief shielding eyes andor faces hats scarves applying transverse pressure philtrum photic sneeze effect genetic tendency begin sneezing sometimes many times consecutively due nasoocular suddenly exposed bright light condition tends occur severely one emerged light spending time dark although syndrome thought affect human population relatively harmless widely photic sneeze effect documented many centuries greek philosopher aristotle one first contemplate strange phenomenon bce exploring looking sun causes person sneeze book problems heat sun provoke hypothesized suns heat caused sweating inside nose triggered sneeze order remove century english philosopher francis bacon disproved aristotles hypothesis facing sun eyes closed elicit ordinary sneeze response bacon therefore guessed eyes played vital part triggering photic sneezing assumed looking suns light made eyes water moisture proceeded seep nose irritate causing although plausible scientists later determined hypothesis also incorrect suninduced sneezing occurs quickly sunlight exposure watering eyes slower process could play vital part triggering today scientific attention mainly focused hypothesis proposed henry everett first call lightinduced sneezing photic sneeze effect places condition also referred pepper sun due similar reaction experienced inhaling pepper particles since nervous system transmits signals extremely fast pace dr everett hypothesized syndrome linked human nervous system perhaps caused confusion nerve genetic basis photic sneezing still remains unclear single genes condition found studied however condition often occurs within families suggested
