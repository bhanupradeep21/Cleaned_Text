dynatoaetus extinct genus large bird prey pleistocene australia among largest known raptors region second haasts eagle new zealand although closely related modern vultures shows clear adaptations towards active predatory lifestyle form robust powerful talons genus monotypic meaning contains single species gaffae first fossil remains identified belonging dynatoaetus discovered mairs cave located flinders ranges south australia material included variety body parts including toes upper arm sternum bones found around ft cave covered thin calcite layer showing bones buried instead preserved simply lying floor cave later years fossils large raptors recovered several fossil sites across australia including cooper creek within lake eyre basin victoria fossil cave south australia wellington caves new south wales however discovery additional remains mairs cave including skull bones vertebrae various remains found belonged single species discovery remains made group recreational speleologists palaeontologists entered cave express purpose finding fossils bird many bones mairs cave found belonged single individual bird served holotype fossils described distinct genus species ellen k mather et al genus name dynatoaetus derives ancient greek dynatós word meaning mighty powerful āetós eagle species name chosen honor priscilla gaff first discuss fossil material animal hindlimbs dynatoaetus robust much like modern eagles femur particular described extremely large robust tarsometatarsus follows condition robust large metatarsals however relatively short although match bones robustness much different length observed female wedgetailed eagles ungual phalanges claws toes much larger modern wedgetailed eagles fossil remains indicate eagle largest bird prey inhabited australia twice weight extant wedgetailed eagle however large female haasts eagle hieraaetus moorei time new zealand gigantohierax suarezi buteonine cuba unlike two birds prey likely obtained massive sizes due insular gigantism lack notable competitors dynatoaetus continental species like woodwards eagle amplibuteo woodwardi north america therefore believed size least part due evolutionary history given aegypiine vultures known regularly obtain large sizes instance gyps melitensis pleistocene malta well chinese vultures aegypius jinniushanensis torgos sp similar size range dynatoaetus however due much derived ecology influence morphology precise size difference difficult dynatoaetus may reached wingspan phylogenetic analysis fossil remains dynatoaetus used molecular morphological data order determine relationship birds prey resulting three parsimonious trees nine anatomical characters connect dynatoaetus vultures subfamily aegypiinae however unique group may also found birds prey like gypaetinae perninae strict consensus tree recovered sister taxon aegypiine vultures basal cryptogyps together dynatoaetus derived aegypiines clade serpent eagles subfamily circaetinae group includes philippine eagle bayesian analysis shows similar results dynatoaetus likewise found position basal modern aegypiines key difference analysis cryptogyps found part clade instead much basal bird prey generally unique mix characters seen dynatoaetus thought large part result combining phylogenetic traits inherited ancestry morphological traits developed support

south wales may reflect raptors actual range could instead simply result preservation collection bias well fact large predators inherently rarer animals mather et al thus suggest bird prey may much widespread pleistocene regardless hypothetical range dynatoaetus appears inhabited variety habitats dry inland australia temperate coastal regions dynatoaetus much larger extant wedgetailed eagle foot span two rather similar due formers proportionally short toes however notably robust thought adaptation towards tackling larger prey items due increased strength talons short robust toes would allowed bird attack maintain grip large prey even struggled similar adaptations seen variety large predatory birds including african crowned eagle south american harpy eagle known hunt primates small ungulates like antelopes peccaries respectively geographically closer example would haasts eagle pleistocene holocene new zealand hunted giant moas home pleistocene australia would abundant potential prey could included kangaroos shortfaced kangaroos juvenile weak giant wombats megapodes flightless birds genyornis unlike large insular haasts eagle however dynatoaetus compete resources large carnivores like monitor lizard megalania terrestrial crocodile quinkana marsupial predators thylacoleo would impacted behaviour niche like modern eagles dynatoaetus likely scavenging well even lacked specific adaptations characterise derived vultures would put raptor competition smaller cryptogyps given size similar interactions observed modern scavenging birds believed dynatoaetus would able dominate carcasses coming contact smaller relative dynatoaetus would also competition eagles genus aquila remains wedgetailed eagles known localities larger raptor hypothesised pleistocene wedgetailed eagles may limited ecology due pressure put dynatoaetus hunters cryptogyps scavengers large vulturelike raptor capable killing prey well scavenging dynatoaetus also comparable lappetfaced vulture africa known kill mammals size juvenile dynatoaetus likely went extinct approximately years ago late pleistocene coinciding extinction much australias endemic megafauna disappearance scavenging
