dividing interfering tubulin early trials epothilones better efficacy milder adverse effects september epothilones f identified early studies cancer cell lines human cancer patients indicate superior efficacy taxanes mechanism action similar chemical structure simpler due better water solubility cremophors solubilizing agents used paclitaxel affect cardiac function cause severe hypersensitivity endotoxinlike properties known paclitaxel like activation macrophages synthesizing inflammatory cytokines nitric oxide observed epothilone epothilones originally identified metabolites produced soildwelling myxobacterium sorangium structure epothilone determined using xray principal mechanism epothilone class inhibition microtubule microtubules essential cell division epothilones therefore stop cells properly dividing epothilone b possesses biological effects paclitaxel vitro cultured cells share binding site well binding affinity microtubule like paclitaxel epothilone b binds αβtubulin heterodimer subunit bound rate αβtubulin dissociation decreases thus stabilizing microtubules furthermore epothilone b also shown induce tubulin polymerization microtubules without presence gtp caused formation microtubule bundles throughout cytoplasm finally epothilone b also causes cell cycle arrest transition phase thus leading cytotoxicity eventually cell ability epothilone inhibit spindle function generally attributed suppression microtubule recent studies demonstrated suppression dynamics occurs concentrations lower needed block mitosis higher antimitotic concentrations paclitaxel
