within field developmental biology one goal understand particular cell develops final cell type known fate determination within embryo several processes play cellular tissue level create organism processes include cell proliferation differentiation cellular programmed cell cell embryo receives molecular signals neighboring cells form proteins rnas even surface interactions almost animals undergo similar sequence events early development conserved process known embryogenesis cells exist three germ layers undergo gastrulation embryogenesis studied century recently past years scientists discovered basic set proteins mrnas involved embryogenesis evolutionary conservation one reasons model systems fly drosophila melanogaster mouse mus musculus organisms used models study embryogenesis developmental biology studying model organisms provides information relevant animals including humans studying different model systems cells fate discovered determined via multiple ways two combination transcription factors cells cellcell cells fate determination mechanisms categorized three different types autonomously specified cells conditionally specified cells syncytial specified cells furthermore cells fate determined mainly using two types experiments cell ablation results obtained experiments helped identifying fate examined cells development new molecular tools including gfp major advances imaging technology including fluorescence microscopy made possible mapping cell lineage caenorhabditis elegans including technique fate mapping used study cells differentiate gain specified function merely observing cell becomes differentiated embryogenesis provides indication mechanisms drive specification use molecular techniques including gene protein knock downs knock outs overexpression allows investigation mechanisms fate improvements imaging tools including live confocal microscopy super resolution allow visualization molecular changes experimentally manipulated cells compared controls transplantation experiments also used conjunction genetic manipulation lineage tracing newer cell fate determination techniques include lineage tracing performed using inducible crelox transgenic mice specific cell populations experimentally mapped using reporters like brainbow colorful reporter useful brain tissues follow differentiation path embryogenesis number
