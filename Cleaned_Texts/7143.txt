dichotic pitch dichotic pitch phenomenon pitch heard due binaural processing brain combines two noises presented simultaneously words heard sound stimulus presented monaurally one ear presented binaurally simultaneously ears sensation pitch binaural stimulus presented ears headphones simultaneously several respects except narrow frequency band common variation huggins pitch presents whitenoise differ interaural phase relation narrow range humans phenomenon restricted fundamental frequencies lower hz extremely low sound pressure experts investigate effects dichotic pitch instance studies suggested evokes activation lateral end heschls continuous white noise frequency content hz presented headphones left right ear listener binaurally given particular interaural phase relationship left right ear signals sensation pitch psychophysics may thus stimulation either ear alone gives rise sensation white noise stimulation ears together produces pitch therefore special case dichotic listening pitch called dichotic pitch binaural pitch generally dichotic pitch perceived somewhere head amidst noisy sound filling binaural space specific dichotic pitch characterized three perceptual properties pitch value timbre inhead position lateralization experiments dichotic pitch motivated context study pitch general binaural system particular relevant sound localization separation competing sound sources see cocktail party effect past various configurations dichotic pitch studied several auditory models developed however singular model developed accounts aspects dichotic pitch formed lateralization dichotic great challenge psychophysical physiological acoustics predict pitch value pitchimage position one model information references audio demos etc see huggins pitch binaural edge pitch elicit puretone like sound singular frequency generated creating interaural phase shift narrow frequency changes point sound wave first reaches ear sound wave white noise stimulus reaches ear different points words noise decorrelated hp occur white noise identical frequencies except narrow frequency band must presented simultaneously allpass filter used narrow frequency band create interaural phase shift radians sometimes referred phase bep created introducing interaural phase shift Ï€ radians phase shift best heard within frequency range fourcin pitch dichotic repetition pitch complex tones generated creating large interaural delays binaural stimulus differ large interaural delays fp similar pure tones sense interaural phase shift needed however also presents different stimuli differing interaural delays ear drp presents stimuli singular large interaural delay binaurally simultaneously equalizationcancellation ec model explains dichotic pitch created specifically binaural edge pitch huggins related binaural dichotic pitch stimulus processed twostep process equalization followed equalization process binaural system modifies differences interaural time delay level differences time stimulus reaches ears difference loudness frequency ear different phase wave reaches ear respectively allows binaural system subtract perfectly correlated broadband noise left interaural phase shift created narrow frequency part broadband noise results ec heard hp specifically bep created ec process creates central spectrum sharp edge highpass lowpass sound bep found characteristics white noise stimulus influences huggins pitch lateralized includes centre frequency interaural time delay white noise halfperiod rule theorizes lateralization huggins pitch depends difference time takes noise reach ear otherwise known interaural time delay however model accurately account lateralization dichotic pitch using dichotic pitch pitch processing relation heschls gyrus brain studied using various pitch evoking stimuli fmri scans hall placks study found multiple areas including heschls gyrus primarily planum temporale posterior heschls gyrus activated pitchevoking stimuli binaural stimulus huggins activation heschls gyrus planum temporale replicated another study used dichotic pitches huggins pitch binaural band pitch pure tones sound dichotic pitch dissimilar characteristics study whether activation depended characteristics pitch fmri scans showed dichotic pitch corresponding pure tone activated areas lateral end heschls gyrus lateral border planum temporal reflects heschls gyrus activation may depend characteristics pitch pitch huggins pitch also found affect region planum temporale also found responsive changes pitch found many
