evidence suggesting different processes involved remembering something versus knowing whether appears remembering knowing represent relatively different characteristics memory well reflect different ways using memory remember conscious recollection many vivid contextual details information remembering utilizes episodic memory requires deeper level processing eg undivided attention knowing errors
