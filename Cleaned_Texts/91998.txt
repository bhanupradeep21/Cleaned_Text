honours swiss pastor lichenologist ludwig emanuel proposal put forth conserve name schaereria defined theodor magnus fries group species cinereorufa type species instead using schaereria defined körber reason proposal cinereorufa wellknown species name schaereria körber applied name lugubris different species named cinereorufa conserving name schaereria suggested avoids need create new name group lichens prevents confusion another genus called ropalospora accepting proposal ropalospora schaereria could continue used current meanings avoiding unnecessary subsequent recommendations
