respiratory tract subdivision respiratory system involved process respiration respiratory tract lined respiratory epithelium respiratory air breathed nose nasal cavity layer nasal mucosa acts filter traps pollutants harmful substances found air next air moves pharynx passage contains intersection oesophagus larynx opening larynx special flap cartilage epiglottis opens allow air pass closes prevent food moving airway larynx air moves trachea intersection known carina branches form right left primary main bronchi bronchi branches secondary lobar bronchus branches tertiary segmental bronchi branch smaller airways called bronchioles eventually connect tiny specialized structures called alveoli function gas exchange lungs located thoracic cavity protected physical damage rib cage base lungs sheet skeletal muscle called diaphragm diaphragm separates lungs stomach intestines diaphragm also main muscle respiration involved breathing controlled sympathetic nervous system lungs encased serous membrane folds form pleurae twolayered protective barrier inner visceral pleura covers surface lungs outer parietal pleura attached inner surface thoracic cavity pleurae enclose cavity called pleural cavity contains pleural fluid fluid used decrease amount friction lungs experience breathing respiratory tract divided upper airways lower airways upper airways upper respiratory tract includes nose nasal passages paranasal sinuses pharynx portion larynx vocal folds cords lower airways lower respiratory tract includes portion larynx vocal folds trachea bronchi bronchioles lungs included lower respiratory tract separate entity include respiratory bronchioles alveolar ducts alveolar sacs respiratory tract also divided conducting zone respiratory zone based distinction transporting gases exchanging conducting zone includes structures outside lungs nose pharynx larynx trachea structures inside lungs bronchi bronchioles terminal bronchioles conduction zone conducts air breathed filtered warmed moistened lungs represents division respiratory tract conducting zone respiratory tract conducts gases lungs excludes respiratory zone exchanges gases conducting zone also functions offer low resistance pathway airflow provides major defense role filtering abilities respiratory zone includes respiratory bronchioles alveolar ducts alveoli site oxygen carbon dioxide exchange blood respiratory bronchioles alveolar ducts responsible gas exchange alveoli responsible respiratory zone represents division respiratory tract bronchi dividing tubes become progressively smaller estimated divisions ending upper respiratory tract refer parts respiratory system lying sternal angle outside vocal folds cricoid larynx sometimes included upper lower larynx also called voice box associated cartilage produces sound tract consists nasal cavity paranasal sinuses pharynx nasopharynx oropharynx laryngopharynx sometimes includes larynx lower respiratory tract lower airway derived developing foregut consists trachea bronchi primary secondary tertiary bronchioles including terminal respiratory lungs including also sometimes includes larynx lower respiratory tract also called respiratory tree tracheobronchial tree describe branching structure airways supplying air lungs includes trachea bronchi division point generation one airway branches two smaller airways human respiratory tree may consist average generations respiratory tree mouse generations proximal divisions closest top tree bronchi mainly function transmit air lower airways later divisions including respiratory bronchiole alveolar ducts alveoli specialized gas exchange trachea largest tube respiratory tract consists tracheal rings hyaline cartilage branches two bronchial tubes left right main bronchus bronchi branch smaller sections inside lungs called bronchioles bronchioles give rise air sacs lungs called lungs largest organs lower respiratory tract lungs suspended within pleural cavity thorax pleurae two thin membranes one cell layer thick surround lungs inner visceral pleura covers lungs outer parietal pleura lines inner surface chest wall membrane secretes small amount fluid allowing lungs move freely within pleural cavity expanding contracting breathing lungs divided different lobes right lung larger size left hearts situated left midline right lung three lobes upper middle lower superior middle inferior left lung two upper lower superior inferior plus small tongueshaped portion upper lobe known lingula lobe divided segments called bronchopulmonary segments lung costal surface adjacent ribcage diaphragmatic surface faces downward toward diaphragm mediastinal surface faces toward center chest lies heart great vessels carina two mainstem bronchi branch base trachea alveoli tiny air sacs lungs gas exchange takes place mean number alveoli human lung diaphragm contracts negative pressure generated thorax air rushes fill cavity happens sacs fill air making lung expand alveoli rich capillaries called alveolar capillaries red blood cells absorb oxygen air carry back form oxyhaemaglobin nourish cells red blood cells also carry carbon dioxide away cells form carbaminohemoglobin release alveoli alveolar capillaries diaphragm relaxes positive pressure generated thorax air rushes alveoli expelling carbon dioxide respiratory tract covered epithelium varies tract glands mucus produced goblet cells parts well smooth muscle elastin cartilage epithelium nose bronchioles covered ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium commonly called respiratory cilia beat one direction moving mucus towards throat swallowed moving bronchioles cells get cuboidal shape still ciliated glands abundant upper respiratory tract fewer lower absent starting bronchioles goes goblet cells although scattered ones first bronchioles cartilage present small bronchi trachea cshaped rings hyaline cartilage whereas bronchi cartilage takes form interspersed plates smooth muscle starts trachea joins cshaped rings cartilage continues bronchi bronchioles completely encircles instead hard cartilage bronchi bronchioles composed elastic tissue lungs made thirteen different kinds cells eleven types epithelial cell two types mesenchymal epithelial cells form lining tracheal bronchial tubes mesenchymal cells line lungs differences cells along respiratory tract transverse section tracheal tissue note image incorrectly labeled ciliated stratified epithelium upper right respiratory tract exists merely piping system air travel lungs alveoli part lung exchanges oxygen carbon dioxide blood respiration rhythmical process breathing air drawn alveoli lungs via inhalation subsequently expelled via exhalation human inhales air travels trachea bronchial tubes lungs entire tract protected rib cage spine sternum lungs oxygen inhaled air transferred blood circulated throughout body carbon dioxide transferred returning blood back gaseous form lungs exhaled lower respiratory tract upper complete process breathing unlike trachea bronchi upper airway collapsible compliant tube able withstand suction pressures generated rhythmic contraction diaphragm sucks air lungs accomplished rhythmic contraction upper airway muscles genioglossus tongue hyoid muscles addition rhythmic innervation respiratory center medulla oblongata motor neurons controlling muscles also receive tonic innervation sets baseline level stiffness size diaphragm primary muscle allows lung expansion contraction smaller muscles ribs external intercostals assist process epithelial lining upper respiratory tract interspersed goblet cells secrete protective mucus helps filter waste eventually either swallowed highly acidic stomach environment expelled via spitting epithelium lining respiratory tract covered small hairs called cilia beat rhythmically lungs moving secreted mucus foreign particles toward laryngopharynx upwards outwards process called mucociliary clearance prevent mucus accumulation lungs macrophages alveoli part immune system engulf digest inhaled harmful agents hair nostrils plays protective role trapping particulate matter cough reflex expels irritants within mucous membrane outside airways lungs contain rings muscle passageways irritated allergen muscles constrict respiratory tract common site infections upper respiratory tract infections probably common infections world respiratory system prone developing infections lungs infants older adults likely develop infections lungs lungs strong fighting infections infections used fatal new research medicine treatable bacterial infections antibiotics prescribed viral infections harder treat still curable common cold flu common causes upper respiratory tract infection cause serious illness develop lower respiratory tract pneumonia common frequent lower respiratory tract infection either viral bacterial fungal infection common pneumonia airborne inhale infection air particles enter lungs move air sacs infection quickly develops lower part lung fills lung fluid excess mucus causes difficulty breathing coughing lower respiratory tract tries get rid fluid lungs prone developing infection asthma flu heart disease bronchitis another common infection takes place lower respiratory tract inflammation bronchial tubes two forms infection acute bronchitis treatable go away without treatment chronic bronchitis comes goes always affect ones lungs bronchitis increases amount mucus natural respiratory tract chronic bronchitis common smokers tar smoking accumulates time causing lungs work harder repair tuberculosis one many infections occurs lower respiratory tract contract infection airborne droplets inhaled risk disease bacterial infection deteriorates lung tissue resulting coughing infection deadly treated cancers environmental causes smoking tobacco product inhaled smoke paralyzes cilia causing mucus enter lungs frequent smoking time causes cilia hairs die longer filter mucus tar smoke inhaled enters lungs turning pinkcoloured lungs black accumulation tar could eventually lead lung cancer chronic obstructive pulmonary chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd common lower respiratory disease caused exposure harmful chemicals prolonged use tobacco disease chronic progressive damage lungs irreversible eventually fatal copd destroys alveoli lung tissue makes breathing difficult causing shortness breath hyperventilation raised chest decreased number alveoli causes loss oxygen supply lungs increased accumulation carbon dioxide two types copd primary secondarycitation needed primary copd found younger adults type copd deteriorates air sacs lung mass secondary copd found older adults smoke smoked history bronchitiscitation needed copd includes symptoms emphysema chronic bronchi main passages right left lungs airways carry oxygen bronchioles inside lungs inflammation bronchii bronchioles cause swell could lead asthma attack results wheezing tightness chest severe difficulty breathing different types asthma affect functions bronchial tubes allergies also set allergic reaction causing swelling bronchial tubes result air passage swell close general air inhaled nose inhaled mouth possible breathe nose however chronic mouth breathing cause dry mouth lead httpsenwikipediaorgwikirespiratorytract
