pleurothotonus commonly known pisa syndrome rare neurological disorder occurs due prolonged exposure antipsychotic drugs may also referred neuroleptics characterized dystonia abnormal sustained involuntary muscle contraction may cause twisting jerking movements body body part although pisa syndrome develops commonly undergoing longterm treatment antipsychotics reported less frequently patients receiving medications acetylcholinesterase inhibitor however also seen diseases causing neurodegeneration receiving medication idiopathic pisa syndrome characteristic development pisa syndrome consists two types dystonia acute dystonia tardive dystonia also known tardive dyskinesia underlying pathology druginduced pisa syndrome complex development may due underlying dopaminergiccholinergic imbalance serotonergicnoradrenergic predominant symptom pisa syndrome dystonia dystonia neurological movement disorder characterized sustained muscle contraction leading abnormal posture twisting repetitive movement pisa syndrome specifically commonly tonic flexion trunk body one side leading slight lean reminiscent leaning tower pisa hence name pisa syndrome usually associated backward axial rotation spine indifferent markedly abnormal posture patients diagnosed pisa syndrome usually experience either acute dystonia tardive dystonia also known tardive dyskinesia differential diagnosis two may hard accomplish without complete patient history since types dystonia may occur simultaneously patient symptoms generally disappear discontinuation antipsychotic drug time onset symptoms may vary depending drug administered neurological characteristics patient acute dystonia nearly always develops weeks dopamine blocking agentmedication begun substantial increase antipsychotic dosage acute dystonic reaction consists sustained painful muscular spasms producing twisting trunkbody abnormal posture frequent occurrences spasms reported neck tongue jaw oculogyric crisis opisthotonus also common acute effects dopamine antagonists also include parkinsonslike symptoms manifested bradykinesia pin rolling tremor rigidity body movements may fluctuate hours temporarily dissipate response reassurance individual episodes may last minutes hours acute reactions common older patients females pathophysiology underlying reactions unknown movements usually occur

antipsychotic drugs known main drugs concerned syndrome several drugs reported caused syndrome well certain antidepressants psychoactive drugs antiemetics also found cause pisa syndrome drugs found

alleviated anticholinergic drugs considered asymmetric brain functions neural transmission may underlying mechanismcitation needed drugs interact biochemistry brain cause syndrome unknown topic current researchcitation needed typically females older patients organic brain changes likely develop pisa syndrome organic brain changes physical changes brain lead neurological dysfunction including dementia frontal lobe syndrome includes presence neurodegenerative illnesses alzheimers disease parkinsons two lines treatment pisa syndrome first line entails discontinuation reduction dose antipsychotic drugs second line treatment anticholinergic medication pharmacological therapy pisa syndrome caused prolonged use antipsychotic drugs established reducing dosage antipsychotic drugs resulted gradual improvement abnormal posture cases discontinuing use drugs resulted complete disappearance syndrome time took improvement disappearance syndrome depended type drug administered specific cause syndrome anticholinergic drugs reported extremely effective patients pisa syndromecitation needed patients pisa syndrome resistant anticholinergic drugs mostly resolved reduction administration antipsychotic drugs previously mentioned specific pathology underlying idiopathic pisa syndrome unknown administration anticholinergic drugs provided resolution known pisa syndrome discovered karl axel ekbom swedish neurologist early cases syndrome first observed three elderly female patients presenile dementia women undergoing treatment antipsychotic drug methylperone haloperidol combination two use neuroleptic drugs caused patients exhibit lateral flexion along rotation trunk patients walked experienced increase rotation postural gait disturbances symptoms set apart form acute dystonia previously observed symptoms proved making new dystonic reaction termed pleurothotonus pisa first patient woman family history neuroleptic disease put two periods treatment methylperone first trial drug administered february beginning patient demonstrated symptoms dystonia however within first days patient began exhibit tilting right upon walking women taken methylperone treatment result progressively regressed back previous state exhibiting symptoms within first two months patient started second trial methylperone treatment late october little week drug treatment began express previous symptoms including bending trunk towards right along rotation patient also experienced pulling away direction walking difficulty turning within couple days exhibiting symptoms patient treated orphenadrine treatment helped regress expressed symptoms quicker first time end week patient able return normal second patient undergo methylperone treatment woman presenile dementia caused experience restlessness paranoid hallucinations methylperone treatment able alleviate womans problems induced dementia take long woman begin experience symptoms pisa syndrome result taken methylperone treatment like first patient able overcome induced symptoms pisa syndrome within month patient treated methylperone two months first treatment soon patient began lean toward right standing walking administered orphenadrine soon stopped patients tilting final patient woman diagnosed presenile dementia expressing symptoms memory dysfunction depression urinary incontinence result woman put methylperone treatment soon caused bending rotation left symptoms disappeared soon taken methylperone unlike two patients woman administered methylperone exhibit previous dystonic symptoms two weeks treatment patient switched small dosage haloperidol along typical dosage orphenadrine used previous patients instead symptoms pisa syndrome woman began experience leaning left side particular rotation shoulder towards left haloperidol eliminated treatment patient longer cases syndrome came research discovered switching drug treatments debated possible inducer diseasecitation needed cases disease proven caused medications neuroleptic drugscitation needed patients observed exhibiting symptoms pisa syndrome result prior neurodegenerative diseasecitation needed current research focusing discovering underlying mechanisms pisa syndrome since little known biological pharmacological reasons pisa syndrome occurs although theories dopaminergic dysfunction suggested pisa syndrome mostly associated antipsychotic drugs incidents idiopathic pisa syndrome development pisa syndrome neurological disorders pisa syndrome intellectual future research aims pinpoint essential
