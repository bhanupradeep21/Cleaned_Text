disease usually resulting death within first second decade life mutation specific genes cockayne syndrome known widespread effects relationship dna repair yet well named english physician edward alfred cockayne first described redescribed neilldingwall syndrome named mary dingwall catherine two scientists described case two brothers cockayne syndrome asserted disease described cockayne

oxygen occurs body cellular metabolism produces several highly reactive forms oxygen called free radicals cause oxidative damage cellular components including dna normal cells body repairs damaged sections case disease due subtle defects transcription childrens genetic machinery synthesizing proteins needed body operate normal capacity scientists believed childrens genetic machinery synthesizing proteins needed body operate normal capacity time went theory results developmental failure death every minute body pumps liters oxygen blood carrying billions cells bodies normal molecular form oxygen harmless however cellular metabolism involving oxygen generate several highly reactive free radicals free radicals cause oxidative damage cellular components including dna average human cell several thousand lesions occur dna every day many lesions result oxidative damage damaged section snipped dna repaired preserve normal function unrepaired dna lose ability code proteins mutations also result mutations activate oncogenes silence tumor suppressor genes according research oxidative damage active genes preferentially repaired severe cases repair slowed throughout whole genome resulting accumulation oxidative damage could impair normal functions dna may even result triggering program cell death apoptosis children disease repair active genes oxidative damage occurs normally oxidative damage repair faster active genes make less five percent genome inactive regions dna resulting accumulation oxidative damage could impair normal functions dna may even result triggering program cell death cockayne syndrome classified genetically contrast cells normal repair capability csa csb deficient cells unable preferentially repair cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers

optimal nutrition also help genetic counseling parents recommended disorder chance passed future children prenatal testing also another important aspect prevention recurrence cs siblings identification gene defects involved makes possible offer genetic counseling antenatal diagnostic testing parents already one affected currently two ongoing projects focused development gene therapy
