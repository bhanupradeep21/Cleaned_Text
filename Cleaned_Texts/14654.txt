heart valve biological oneway valve allows blood flow one direction chambers heart four valves usually present mammalian heart together determine pathway blood flow heart heart valve opens closes according differential blood pressure four valves mammalian heart two atrioventricular valves separating upper atria lower ventricles mitral valve left heart tricuspid valve right heart two valves entrance arteries leaving heart semilunar valves aortic valve aorta pulmonary valve pulmonary artery heart also coronary sinus valve inferior vena cava valve discussed heart valves chambers lined endocardium heart valves separate atria ventricles ventricles blood vessel heart valves situated around fibrous rings cardiac skeleton valves incorporate flaps called leaflets cusps similar duckbill valve flutter valve pushed open allow blood flow close together seal prevent backflow mitral valve two cusps whereas others three nodules tips cusps make seal tighter pulmonary valve left right

valves heard lub first heart sound closure sl valves heard dub second heart sound mitral valve also called bicuspid valve contains two leaflets cusps mitral valve gets name resemblance bishops mitre type hat left side heart allows blood flow left atrium left ventricle diastole normallyfunctioning mitral valve opens result increased pressure left atrium fills blood preloading atrial pressure increases left ventricle mitral valve opens opening facilitates passive flow blood left ventricle diastole ends atrial contraction ejects final blood transferred left atrium left ventricle amount
