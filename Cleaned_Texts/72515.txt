paleoindian male infant whose remains found south central montana united states date years child found tools made stone antlers dusted red ocher suggesting honorary human discovered clovis complex first ancient native american genome fully paleogenomic analysis remains revealed siberian ancestry close genetic relationship modern native americans including central south findings support hypothesis modern native americans descended asian populations crossed beringia years discovery subsequent analysis controversial remains found private land compliance native american graves protection repatriation act nagpra required study however native american tribal members montana felt consulted researchers undertook analysis infants skeleton montana state law require consultation native americans concerning disposition ancient skeletal remains consultation reburied june shields river valley intertribal numerous clovis artifacts associated first burial curated montana historical society helena anzick site accidentally discovered two construction workers collapsed rock shelter near wilsall montana private remains found ranch anzick remains found buried among numerous tools stone tools remnants tools made antler site contained hundreds stone projectile points bifaces flake tools well skull fragment second individual dated circa years ago associated artifacts covered red stone points identified part clovis complex distinct shape originally two human skeletons thought contemporaneous clovis complex stone points later carbon dating revealed one human skeletons clovis predates skeleton two skeletal remains included cranial fragments left clavicle several bones discovered highly fragmented states however partial reconstruction crania allowed age estimation investigation basic health indicators information cultural practices originally investigators thought left clavicle showed evidence cremation analysis revealed discoloration result groundwater staining additionally remains stained ocher masks natural color infants age death individual determined several skeletal markers including cranial suture closure tooth eruption rates rates epiphyseal fusion long bones cranial bones fuse together along suture lines throughout life every human used estimate age death human small size lack suture closure crania revealed individual years metopic suture also present frontal bone suture present human infants closes well adulthood presence frontal suture remains corroborates age estimation years old cranial bones also useful detecting evidence physiological reconstructed frontal parietal occipital bone fragments analyzed indicators health however crania showed evidence cribra orbitalia porotic hyperostosis conditions indicate porotic hyperostosis characterized porous lesions parietal occipital sometimes frontal cribra orbitalia another pathological skeletal lesion manifests porosity orbital porotic hyperostosis cribra orbitalia indicators nutritional deficiency leads many cultures use wrappings boards manipulate malleable cranial bones infants different shapes may hold cultural ritual practice recorded historically several different bioarchaeological contexts throughout shape cranial vault revealed evidence cultural cranial vault team researchers throughout united states europe conducted paleogenetic research skeletal remains sequenced mitochondrial dna mtdna full nuclear dna ychromosome compared sequences modern populations throughout results analyses allowed researchers make conclusions ancient migration patterns peopling americas analyses revealed individual closely related native americans central south america instead closely related people canadian arctic previously thought likely people arctic distinct native americans south including lower north america central south america infant also related persons siberia central asia believed ancestral population indigenous peoples americas finding supports theory peopling americas occurred asia across bering strait human nuclear dna located inside nucleus every cell makes human humans inherit half nuclear dna mother half throughout human evolution mutations occur inherited subsequent different populations different frequencies mutations population histories ascertained mutations comparing mutations one individual genomes specific ethnic genome sequenced analyzed look specific mutations might shed light population history modern native genome compared native american genomes comparison researchers found significantly similar modern eurasian genome closer native american populations central south america native american populations north america samples north america limited tribes united states reluctant mtdna dna located mitochondria organelle found human cells mitochondria maternally inherited persons analysis mtdna provide information maternal mtdna genomes classified different haplogroups based shared common ancestor distinct haplogroups provide information ancient migration morten rasmussen sarah l anzick et al sequenced mitochondrial dna determined infant represents ancient migration north america siberia found mtdna belongs haplogroup founder haplogroup might represent people taking early coastal migration route haplogroup also found modern native american populations provides link modern native although rare todays native americans us canada genes common native people south america suggests greater genetic complexity among native americans previously thought including early divergence genetic lineage years ago one theory suggested crossing north america siberia group first americans lineage moved south along pacific coast finally thousands years central south america another line may moved inland east rocky mountains ultimately populating united states ychromosome inherited directly paternal line father son generation males xchromosome ychromosome females two xchromosomes ychromosome inherited males father specific mutations ychromosome used trace paternal lineage male like mtdna mutations grouped categorized haplogroups ychromosome sequenced researchers determined ychromosome haplogroup one major founding lineages mtdna nuclear dna ychromosome analysis revealed close genetic affinity modern native americans provided evidence gene flow siberia americas nearly years ago earlier findings support beringia hypothesis peopling americas directly refute solutrean proponents latter theory think evidence beringia hypothesis mainstream model peopling americas posits migration early amerindians siberia across land bridge spanned bering hypothesis supported genetic archaeological evidence places migration earlier years ancient native americans could entered new world across beringian land bridge passing south alaska icefree corridor canada another concept used boats sail along coast siberia beringia land bridge pacific coast north archeological evidence former area land bridge coastal path lost rise sea levels paleogenetic analysis lends support beringia hypothesis theory showing humans arrived montana nearly years solutrean hypothesis scientific hypothesis paleontology posits subset members solutrean culture prehistoric europe directly ancestral clovis culture north america based primarily similarities flintknapping styles belief also popular amongst north american white nationalists typically interpret hypothesis demonstrating ethnic europeans amongst first first settlers continental united states fact genome extant genome clovis site relevant genetic similarity european population generally seen evidence disproving hypothesis results commonly cited representing genetic evidence solutrean studying remains ancient native americans ethical minefield calls question ownership interpretation larry echohawk member pawnee nation legal scholar united states assistant secretary interior indian affairs president barack obama said excavation native american remains regardless motive expropriating indian graves impact activity upon affected indians always emotional trauma spiritual remains excavated analyzed several teams
