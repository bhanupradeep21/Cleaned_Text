white dot syndromes inflammatory diseases characterized presence white dots fundus interior surface majority individuals affected white dot syndromes younger fifty years age symptoms include blurred vision visual field many theories etiology white dot syndromes including infectious viral genetics autoimmune classically recognized white dot syndromes specific characteristics regarding white dots predicted etiology presented selected diseases acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy primarily occurs adults mean age symptoms include blurred vision eyes onset may occur different time eye yellowwhite placoid lesions posterior pole level retinal pigment epithelium suggest genetic predisposition disease others postulate abnormal immune response multiple evanescent white dot syndrome occurs mostly females symptoms include sudden loss central vision patients eventually regain normal vision white dots small located posterior pole level retinal pigment epithelium white dots may disappear first weeks disease cause generally unknown viral illness reported prior multiple evanescent white dot syndrom onethird since disease occurs primarily females hormonal status might contributing discrepancy exists whether acute zonal occult outer retinopathy considered white dot syndrome however may definitely related diseases included white dot syndrome group acute zonal occult outer retinopathy occurs young middle age adults may eventually progress retinal cell death symptoms include acute visual field loss photopsias suspected causes include autoimmune viral multifocal choroiditis occurs mainly myopic females fundus presents yellow gray lesions white dots level choroid retinal pigment epithelium size white dots micrometres localized macula disease characterized vitritis anterior chamber inflammation decreased vision due vitreous inflammation may occur unlike multiple evanescent white dot syndrome multifocal choroiditis chronic disorder macular scarring contributes severe visual loss theories regarding cause include exogenous pathogen sensitizing individual antigens within photoreceptors retinal pigment epithelium punctate inner choroiditis inflammatory choroiditis occurs mainly young females symptoms include blurred vision scotomas graywhite yellow lesions mainly present posterior pole micrometres size punctate inner choroiditis one socalled white dot syndromes come heading posterior uveitis appearance punctate punched areas level inner choroid lesions typically located centrally back eye posterior pole serpiginous choroiditis also known geographic helicoid choroidopathy uncommon chronic progressive inflammatory condition affecting adult men women equally second seventh decades life white dots white dot syndromes lesions

white dots similar composition center lesion consists macrophages epithelioid cells cells periphery granuloma benezra theorized large amount suppressor cells observed later stages disease order regulate inflammatory immune formation granuloma occurs activated antigen presenting cells specifically dendritic cells bind cells release proinflammatory cytokines chemokines response attracts additional antigen presenting cells eventually become granuloma choroidal dendritic cells span several levels within choroid also associate retinal pigment epithelium usually dendritic cells disappear

scar important note formation white dots may occur frequently undetected normal cases inflammation retina choroid occur muller retinal pigment epithelium cells normally release immunosuppressive factors certain combinations cytokines may stimulate retinal pigment epithelium cells release factors encouraging generally mild intraocular inflammation results small discrete evanescent lesions larger dots less discrete borders result high intensity intraocular essence immune response normal amount appropriate cytokine release result small white dots misregulated response eventually produce
