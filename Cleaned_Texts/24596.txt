gilman earl sutherland theodore rall discovered cyclic amp second messenger signal transduction responsible activating enzymes cell cyclic amp produced hormones first messengers bind cell cyclic amp formed atp enzymes adenylyl cyclase martin rodbell found hormones directly influence cyclic amp existed molecules third messengers rodbell discovered cyclic amp activated guanosine triphosphate gtp released cell membrane however know gtp molecules gilman pursued mystery signalling process found lymphoma cancer cells hormones lost activity activate adenylyl cyclase thereby losing ability produce cyclic amp due loss proteins cancer cells introduced missing protein normal cells cancer cells normal hormone action produced showed missing membrane protein responsible mediating hormonal signal cyclic amp producing gtp findings published series papers succeeded identifying isolating new protein named g protein specifically binds gtp gilman played active roles defending science education
