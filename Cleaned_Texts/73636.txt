animal navigation ability many animals find way accurately without maps instruments birds arctic tern insects monarch butterfly fish salmon regularly migrate thousands miles breeding many species navigate effectively shorter distances dead reckoning navigating known position using information ones speed direction suggested charles darwin possible mechanism century karl von frisch showed honey

earths magnetic field olfaction vision ronald lockley demonstrated small seabird manx shearwater could orient fly home full speed released far home provided either sun stars visible several species

argues pigeons build remember mental map odours area recognizing local wallraffs gradient model argues steady largescale gradient odour remains stable long periods two gradients different directions pigeons could locate two dimensions intensities odours however clear stable gradients papi find evidence anosmic pigeons unable detect odours much less able orient navigate normal pigeons olfaction
