cycle quantificationqualification cq parameter used realtime polymerase chain reaction techniques indicating cycle number pcr amplification curve meets predefined mathematical criterion cq may used quantification target sequence determine whether target sequence present two criteria determine cq used different thermocyclers threshold cycle ct number cycles required fluorescent signal cross given value threshold usually threshold set baseline times standard deviation noise avoid random effects ct however threshold shouldnt set much higher avoid reduced reproducibility due uncontrolled factors crossing point cp take point top cycle value maximum second derivative amplification biology article stub help wikipedia expanding httpsenwikipediaorgwikicycleofquantificationqualification
