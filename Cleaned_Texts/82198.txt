primary progressive aphasia type neurological syndrome language capabilities slowly progressively become impaired types aphasia symptoms accompany ppa depend parts left hemisphere significantly damaged however unlike aphasias ppa results continuous deterioration brain tissue leads early symptoms far less detrimental later symptoms ppa slowly lose ability speak write read generally comprehend language eventually almost every patient becomes mute completely loses ability understand written spoken although first described solely impairment language capabilities mental functions remain recognized many ppa experience impairment memory shortterm memory formation loss executive functions first described distinct syndrome marsel mesulam primary progressive aphasias clinical pathological overlap frontotemporal lobar degeneration ftld spectrum disorders alzheimers disease however ppa considered synonymous alzheimers disease due fact unlike affected alzheimers disease ppa generally able

often difficult assess neurologically degenerative diseases alzheimers disease currently reliable noninvasive diagnostic tests aphasias thus neuropsychological assessments tool physicians diagnosing patients aphasias often affect nonlanguage portions neuropsychological tests specific classification primary progressive aphasia updated include three clinical variants patients must first diagnosed ppa divided variants based speech production features repetition single word syntax comprehension confrontation naming semantic knowledge classical mesulam criteria primary progressive aphasia two variants nonfluent type progressive nonfluent aphasia pnfa fluent type semantic dementia third variant primary progressive aphasia logopenic progressive aphasia lpa atypical form alzheimers disease pnfa core criteria diagnosis includes agrammatism slow labored speech inconsistent speech sound errors also common including distortions deletions insertions terms comprehension deficits syntax sentence comprehension due grammatical complexity single word object comprehension relatively second variant sd presents deficits singleword object comprehension naming impairments severe specially lowfrequency objects eventually lead widespread semantic memory deficiency time ability read write also impaired irregularities pronunciation spelling however repetition motor speech relatively logopenic variant involves impairments word retrieval sentence repetition phonological paraphasias comparable conduction aphasia compared semantic variant single word comprehension naming spared however sentence comprehension presents difficulty length grammatical complexity speech include incomplete words hesitations preceding content words however ppa subtypes differ similar aphasias subtypes occur acutely following trauma brain following stroke due differing functional structural neuroanatomical patterns involvement progressive nature due progressive continuous nature disease improvement time seldom occurs patients ppa often patients aphasias caused trauma terms medical approaches treating ppa currently drugs specifically used patients ppa specifically designed interventions ppa large reason limited research done disease however cases patients ppa prescribed drugs alzheimers patients normally primary approach treating ppa behavioral treatment hope methods provide new ways patients communicate order compensate deteriorated speech therapy assist individual strategies overcome difficulties three broad categories therapy interventions aphasia restorative
