driftwood represents aquariums set many types wood used including driftwood bogwood manzanita wood redmoor roots often wood protrude water surface adds enhanced sense nature moss epiphyte plants also commonly used adding beautiful sense maturity aged appearance one type wood usually used order make natural stones also used main iwagumi 岩組 term comes japanese rock formation refers layout stones play leading iwagumi style stone name specific rocks provide bony structure aquascape typical geometry employs design three main stones one larger stone two smaller stones although additional rocks

aquascapes usually little visible hardscape material well limited open space bold coarser leaf shapes echinodorus bleheri used provide wild untamed appearance unlike nature style jungle style follow clean lines employ fine textures jungle canopy effect obtained using combinations darker substrates tall plants growing surface floating plants block light offering dappled lighting effect plants used jungle style aquascapes include microsorum pteropus bolbitis heudelotii vallisneria americana crinum species aponogeton species echinodorus species sagittaria subulata hygrophila pinnatifida anubias species limnobium styles often combine plant animal species based desired visual impact without regard geographic origin instead biotope aquariums designed replicate particular aquatic habitat particular geographic location necessarily provide gardenlike display plants fish need present must match would found nature habitat represented gravel hardscape chemical composition water must also represent habitat desired including organisms naturally exist together biotopes used study ecological interactions relatively natural instance blackwater biotope aquariums mimic blackwater watercourse pond swamp blackwater aquariums resemble native environment many popular aquarium fish chemical composition blackwater rivers amazon rainforest often used contain recalcitrant slowdecaying organics like driftwood leaf litter pinecones organics release tannins humics fulvics darken acidify water water also soft water low dissolved minerals evidence tannins antifungal properties boost fish immune environment less stressful conducive natural behavior breeding blackwater aquaria may contain plants use plants thrive low light levels caused dark water aquarists may decrease artificial lighting mimic dark conditions fish accustomed water pump may added help water flow similar conditions slowmoving paludarium aquarium combines water land inside environment designs represent habitats including tropical rainforests jungles riverbanks bogs even paludarium part aquarium underwater part water substrate built land regions raised waterline tank partially filled water allows plants cyperus alternifolius spathiphyllum wallisii well various anubias bromeliads grow emersed roots underwater tops air well completely submersed configurations plants float surface water eichhornia crassipes pistia stratiotes displayed full advantage unlike aquarium setups paludariums particularly wellsuited keeping riparium paludarium imitates riparian area bank watercourse plants often floating pots attached rear wall may left open plants growing dutch nature style aquascapes traditionally freshwater systems contrast relatively ornamental plants grown saltwater aquarium saltwater aquascaping typically centers instead mimicking reef arrangement live rock forms main structure aquascape populated corals marine invertebrates well coralline algae macroalgae together serve much aesthetic role freshwater lighting plays particularly significant role reef aquascape many corals well tridacnid clams contain symbiotic fluorescent algaelike dinoflagellates called providing intense lighting supplemented ultraviolet wavelengths reef aquarists support health invertebrates also elicit particularly bright colors emitted fluorescent addition design freshwater aquascaping also requires specific methods maintain healthy plants underwater plants often trimmed obtain desired shape positioned tying place inconspicuously serious aquascapers use aquariumsafe fertilizers commonly liquid tablet form help plants fill aquarium substrates containing laterite also provide reverse osmosis filters may used mitigate damaging effects hard water sensitive animals plants filtered water remineralized ideal also necessary support photosynthesis providing light variety lighting systems may used produce full spectrum light usually watts per gallon watts per lights usually controlled timer allows plants acclimated set alternatively aquarists opt placing aquariums near windows usually north northeasternfacing avoid harsh direct sun without artificial lighting thus giving plants consistent natural light cycle depending number plants fish aquascape may also require carbon dioxide supplementation accomplished simple homemade system using bottle filled yeast warm water sugar connected airstone aquarium commonly pressurized tank diffuses set amount carbon dioxide aquarium methods benefits challenges use pressurized carbon dioxide necessitating refilling tanks periodically usually gas supplier yeastsugar methods requiring general maintenance frequent changingout algae including cyanobacteria well true algae considered distracting unwanted aquascaping controlled several ways algae commonly caused excess nutrients waste aquarists perform water changes lower nitrates another method use animals consume algae fish notably cyprinids genera crossocheilus gyrinocheilus catfish genera ancistrus hypostomus otocinclus shrimp snails clean algae collect leaves third method using adequate light promote rapid growth desired plants controlling nutrient levels ensure plants utilize fertilizer without leaving nutrients support adding new fish tank aquascapers may also disinfect plants using diluted hydrogen peroxide bleach unknown plants may carry undesired species algae well potential snail eggs although serious aquascapers often use considerable amount equipment provide lighting filtration supplementation tank hobbyists choose instead maintain plants minimum technology reported success producing lush plant growth approach sometimes called walstad method popularized diana walstad include use soil place aquarium gravel elimination apparatus filtration limited lighting fish shrimp kept limit quantity fish waste plants used perform watercleansing role typically played aquarium filters utilizing fish waste early dutch hobbyists began practice
