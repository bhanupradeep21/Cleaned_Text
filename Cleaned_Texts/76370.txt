athletes foot known medically tinea pedis common skin infection feet caused signs symptoms often include itching scaling cracking rare cases skin may athletes foot fungus may infect part foot often grows next common area bottom fungus may also affect nails member group diseases known athletes foot caused number different including species trichophyton epidermophyton condition typically acquired coming contact infected skin fungus common places funguses survive around swimming pools locker may also spread usually diagnosis made based signs symptoms however confirmed either culture seeing hyphae using athletes foot limited athletes caused going barefoot public showers letting toenails grow long wearing shoes tight changing socks treated topical antifungal medications clotrimazole persistent infections using oral antifungal medications topical creams typically recommended used four keeping infected feet dry wearing sandals also assists athletes foot first medically described globally athletes foot affects males often affected occurs frequently older children younger historically believed rare condition became frequent century due greater use shoes health clubs war athletes foot divided four categories presentations chronic interdigital plantar chronic scaly aka moccasin foot acute interdigital means toes plantar refers sole foot ulcerative condition includes macerated lesions scaly maceration softening breaking skin due extensive exposure moisture vesiculobullous disease type mucocutaneous disease characterized vesicles bullae blisters vesicles bullae fluidfilled lesions distinguished size vesicles less mm bulla larger mm depending upon definition usedcitation needed athletes foot occurs often toes interdigital space fourth fifth digits little toe fore toe commonly cases interdigital athletes foot caused trichophyton rubrum may symptomless may itch skin toes may appear red ulcerative scaly flaky soft white skin kept without itching acute ulcerative variant interdigital athletes foot caused mentagrophytes characterized pain maceration skin erosions fissuring skin crusting odor due secondary bacterial plantar athletes foot moccasin foot also caused rubrum typically causes asymptomatic slightly erythematous plaques areas redness skin form plantar surface sole foot often covered fine powdery hyperkeratotic vesiculobullous type athletes foot less common usually caused mentagrophytes characterized sudden outbreak itchy blisters vesicles erythematous usually appearing sole foot subtype athletes foot often complicated secondary bacterial infection streptococcus pyogenes staphylococcus disease progresses skin may crack leading bacterial skin inflammation lymphatic allowed grow long athletes foot fungus may spread infect feeding keratin condition called athletes foot may itch may also elicit scratch reflex causing host scratch infected area realize scratching damage skin worsen condition allowing fungus easily spread thrive itching sensation associated athletes foot severe may cause hosts scratch vigorously enough inflict excoriations open wounds susceptible bacterial infection scratching may remove scabs inhibiting healing process scratching infected areas may also spread fungus fingers fingernails washed away soon enough infect fingers fingernails growing skin nails underneath scratching spread wherever person touches including parts body ones environment scratching also causes infected skin scales fall ones environment leading possible spread athletes foot fungus infested skin particles spread ones environment clothes shoes bathroom etc whether scratching falling rubbing infect people also reinfect infect host came example infected feet infest ones socks shoes expose feet fungus spores worn againcitation needed ease fungus spreads areas body ones fingers poses another complication fungus spread parts body easily spread back feet feet treated condition called something else place takes hold eg tinea corporis ringworm tinea cruris jock itch persons infected may aware diseasecitation needed individuals may experience allergic response fungus called id reaction blisters vesicles appear areas hands chest treatment underlying infection typically results disappearance id athletes foot form dermatophytosis fungal infection skin caused dermatophytes funguses mold inhabit dead layers skin digest dermatophytes anthropophilic meaning parasitic funguses prefer human hosts athletes foot commonly caused molds known trichophyton rubrum may also caused epidermophyton cases athletes foot general population caused rubrum however majority athletes foot cases athletes caused according uks national health service athletes foot contagious spread direct indirect disease may spread others directly touch infection people contract disease indirectly coming contact contaminated items clothes towels etc surfaces bathroom shower locker room floors funguses cause athletes foot easily spread ones environment funguses rub fingers bare feet also travel dead skin cells continually fall body athletes foot funguses infested skin particles flakes may spread socks shoes clothes people pets via petting bed sheets bathtubs showers sinks counters towels rugs floors carpets fungus spread pets subsequently spread hands fingers people pet pet frequently gnaws upon might fleas reacting may insatiable itch tinea one way contract athletes foot get fungal infection somewhere else body first funguses causing athletes foot may spread areas body feet usually touching scratching affected area thereby getting fungus fingers touching scratching feet fungus remains name condition changes based body infection located example infection known tinea corporis ringworm torso limbs affected tinea cruris jock itch dhobi itch groin affected clothes shoes body heat sweat keep skin warm moist environment fungus needs thrive besides exposed modes transmission presented additional risk factors increase ones chance contracting athletes foot persons athletes foot likely become infected adults likely catch athletes foot children men higher chance getting athletes foot people diabetes weakened immune susceptible disease hivaids hampers immune system increases risk acquiring athletes foot hyperhidrosis abnormally increased sweating increases risk infection makes treatment visiting doctor basic diagnosis procedure applies includes checking patients medical history medical record risk medical interview doctor asks questions itching scratching physical athletes foot usually diagnosed visual inspection skin identifying less obvious symptoms itching affected area diagnosis uncertain direct microscopy potassium hydroxide preparation skin scraping known koh test confirm diagnosis athletes foot help rule possible causes candidiasis pitted keratolysis erythrasma contact dermatitis eczema dermatophytes known cause athletes foot demonstrate multiple septate branching hyphae woods lamp black light although useful diagnosing fungal infections scalp tinea capitis usually helpful diagnosing athletes foot since common dermatophytes cause disease fluoresce ultraviolet several preventive foot hygiene measures prevent athletes foot reduce recurrence include keeping feet dry clipping toenails short using separate nail clipper infected toenails using socks made wellventilated cotton synthetic moisture wicking materials soak moisture away skin help keep dry avoiding tightfitting footwear changing socks frequently wearing sandals walking communal areas gym showers locker according centers disease control prevention nails clipped short kept clean nails house spread recurrence athletes foot prevented use antifungal powder funguses molds cause athletes foot require warmth moisture survive grow increased risk infection exposure warm moist environments eg occlusive boots enclose feet shared humid environments communal showers shared pools treatment chlorine bleach disinfectant common household cleaner kills mold cleaning surfaces chlorine bleach solution prevents disease spreading subsequent contact cleaning bathtubs showers bathroom floors sinks counters bleach helps prevent spread disease including reinfection keeping socks shoes clean using bleach wash one way prevent funguses taking hold spreading avoiding sharing boots shoes another way prevent transmission athletes foot transmitted sharing footwear infected person sharing also applies towels though less common funguses passed along towels especially damp ones athletes foot resolves without medication topical antifungal medication consistently produces much higher rates conventional treatment typically involves thoroughly washing feet daily twice daily followed application topical medication outer skin layers damaged susceptible reinfection topical treatment generally continues layers skin replaced weeks symptoms disappear keeping feet dry practicing good hygiene described section prevention crucial killing fungus preventing reinfection treating feet always enough socks shoes infested funguses wearing reinfect infect feet socks effectively cleaned wash adding bleach washing water effective treatment includes infected areas toenails hands torso etc otherwise infection may continue spread including back treated areas example leaving fungal infection nail untreated may allow spread back rest foot become athletes foot allylamines terbinafine considered efficacious azoles treatment athletes severe prolonged fungal skin infections may require treatment oral antifungal medication many topical antifungal drugs useful treatment athletes foot including miconazole nitrate clotrimazole tolnaftate synthetic thiocarbamate terbinafine butenafine hydrochloride undecylenic acid fungal infection may treated topical antifungal agents take form spray powder cream gel topical application antifungal cream butenafine daily one week terbinafine daily two weeks effective cases athletes foot effective application miconazole plantartype athletes foot resistant topical treatments due presence thickened hyperkeratotic skin sole keratolytic humectant medications urea salicyclic acid whitfields ointment lactic acid useful adjunct medications improve penetration antifungal agents thickened topical glucocorticoids sometimes prescribed alleviate inflammation itching associated solution potassium permanganate dissolved hot water alternative antifungal potassium permanganate salt strong oxidizing agent severe refractory cases athletes foot oral terbinafine effective fluconazole itraconazole may also taken orally severe athletes foot commonly reported adverse effect medications gastrointestinal globally fungal infections affect population additionally population experience athletes foot point athletes foot common individuals wear unventilated occlusive footwear rubber boots vinyl upon exposure athletes footcausing fungus moist conditions generated poor foot ventilation promotes growth fungus foot occupationally studies shown increased prevalence athletes foot among miners soldiers likewise activities marathon running seen increased prevalence athletes countries regions going barefoot common experience much lower rates athletes foot populations habitually wear shoes result disease called penalty studies demonstrated men infected times often cases athletes foot first documented around world war infection among soldiers estimated nearly ten million americans cases athletes foot alarming prevalence disease caused public health concern following year epidemiologic study conducted incoming freshman university california found incoming freshman men athletes foot years end number risen prevalence disease increased specifically among individuals higher socioeconomic status individuals access common shared spaced pools colleges athletic clubs transmission athletes footcausing fungus prevalence united states high enough call use sterilizing footbaths olympics los angeles time public health officials adopted idea athletes foot product modernity dealing disease penalty civilization many treatments proved antifungal properties compounds undecylenic acid studied products containing zinc undecylenate shown effective topical treatment curing use orally ingested griseofulvin shown effective acute cases athletes foot likewise recorded incidence athletes foot decreased among american soldiers vietnam given griseofulvin preventative research supported use itraconazole allylamine known terbinafine drugs effective eliminating athletes foot also dermatophyte infections parts research shown terbinafine times likely cure athletes foot treatment griseofulvin comparative studies itraconazole terbinafine shown little difference httpsenwikipediaorgwikiringwormofthefoot
