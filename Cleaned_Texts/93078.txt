hyperinsulinemia condition excess levels insulin circulating blood relative level glucose often mistaken diabetes hyperglycaemia hyperinsulinemia result variety metabolic diseases conditions well nonnutritive sugars hyperinsulinemia often seen people early stage type diabetes mellitus cause condition one symptom diseasecitation needed opposing view see review type diabetes occurs pancreatic betacell function impaired hyperinsulinemia seen variety conditions including diabetes mellitus type neonates druginduced hyperinsulinemia also occur congenital hyperinsulinism including nesidioblastosis hyperinsulinemia associated hypertension obesity dyslipidemia insulin resistance glucose conditions collectively known metabolic close association hyperinsulinemia conditions metabolic syndrome suggest related common mechanisms hyperinsulinemia shown play role obese hypertension increasing renal sodium type diabetes cells body become resistant effects insulin receptors bind hormone become less sensitive insulin concentrations resulting hyperinsulinemia disturbances insulin reduced response insulin beta cells pancreas secrete increasing amounts insulin response continued high blood glucose levels resulting hyperinsulinemia insulin resistant tissues threshold concentration insulin reached causing cells uptake glucose therefore decreases blood glucose levels studies shown high levels insulin resulting insulin resistance might enhance insulin studies mice genetically reduced circulating insulin suggest hyperinsulinemia plays causal role high fat dietinduced obesity study mice reduced insulin levels expended energy fat cells reprogrammed burn energy hyperinsulinemia neonates result variety environmental genetic factors mother infant diabetic able properly control blood glucose levels hyperglycemic maternal blood create hyperglycemic environment fetus compensate increased blood glucose levels fetal pancreatic beta cells undergo hyperplasia rapid division beta cells results increased levels insulin secreted compensate high blood glucose levels following birth hyperglycemic maternal blood longer accessible neonate resulting rapid drop newborn blood glucose levels insulin levels still elevated may result hypoglycemia treat condition high concentration doses glucose given neonate required maintaining normal blood glucose levels hyperinsulinemia condition subsides one two large abdomen strong indicator hyperinsulinemia measure waist hip ratio best way know hyperinsulinemia get insulin levels checked important note people insulin elevated presence normal glucose years best rely glucose levels without also measuring insulincitation needed patients may experience variety symptoms hypoglycemia present person experiences symptoms visit qualified medical practitioner advised diagnostic blood testing fasting insulin levels may requiredcitation needed possible causes includecitation needed often individuals get metabolically internally sick showing signs obesity visceral obesity go undetected extremely dangerous lifestyle choices including diet exercise sleep deprivation play largest role hyperinsulinemia insulin resistance belly fat strong predictor high insulin levels obesity characterized excess adipose tissue insulin increases synthesis fatty acids glucose facilitates entry glucose adipocytes inhibits breakdown fat hand adipose tissue known secrete various metabolites hormones cytokines may play role causing specifically cytokines secreted adipose tissue directly affect insulin signalling cascade thus insulin adiponectins cytokines inversely related percent body fat people low body fat higher concentrations adiponectins people high body fat lower concentrations adiponectins reported hyperinsulinemia strongly associated low adiponectin concentrations obese people though whether low adiponectin causal role hyperinsulinemia remains fasting insulin levels blood may measured elevated presence normal glucose diagnosis often made checking normal levels glucose exceed mmoll mgdl mg glucagon administered im addition urine samples blood samples also used check levels ketones low free fatty diagnosis people required continue regular check ups treatment typically achieved via diet exercise although metformin may used reduce insulin levels patients typically obesity present referral dietician beneficial another method used lower excessively high insulin levels cinnamon specifically ceylon demonstrated supplemented clinical human healthy diet low simple sugars processed carbohydrates high fiber vegetable protein often recommended includes replacing white bread wholegrain bread reducing intake foods composed primarily starch potatoes increasing intake legumes green vegetables particularly regular monitoring weight blood sugar insulin advised hyperinsulinemia may develop diabetes mellitus type shown many studies physical exercise improves insulin mechanism exercise improving insulin sensitivity well understood however thought exercise causes glucose receptor translocate receptors present membrane glucose taken cells decreasing blood glucose levels causes decreased insulin secretion alleviation another proposed mechanism improved insulin sensitivity exercise ampk beneficial effect exercise hyperinsulinemia shown study found improving fitness exercise significantly decreases blood insulin moreover diet consists high amounts carbs linked weight gain obesity rodents although tested humans assumed could aid prevention weight gain humans possibly medications also studied treat hyperinsulinemia although might side effects could used httpsenwikipediaorgwikihyperinsulinemia
