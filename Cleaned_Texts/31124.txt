adasaurus ˌɑːdəˈsɔːrəs ahdəsorəs meaning evil genus dromaeosaurid dinosaur lived asia late cretaceous period million years ago genus known two partial specimens found nemegt formation mongolia partially described paleontologist rinchen barsbold adasaurus large dromaeosaurid ft long weighing kg lb unlike dromaeosaurids adasaurus developed rather small blunt sickle claw likely reduced use recurved lacrimal bone latter trait also shared austroraptor though reduced sickle claw retained characteristic rounded articulation dromaeosaurids adasaurus originally regarded dromaeosaurine barsbold group includes robust dromaeosaurs deep jaws revisions made specimens showed dromaeosaurid belongs velociraptorinae composed lightlybuilt animals like velociraptor adasaurus first figured mongolian paleontologist rinchen barsbold pelvic comparison theropods would remain informally named taxon proper barsbold published large comparative revision known mongolian theropod taxa time formally named adasaurus type species mongoliensis based two partial specimens generic name adasaurus taken mongolian word ад ada meaning evil spirit greek word σαῦρος sauros meaning lizard specific name single species mongoliensis refers country discovery mongolia barsbold briefly described adasaurus dromaeosaurid noted new taxon possessed notably reduced second pedal ungual given trait contrasted large sharplydeveloped ungual members barsbold listed unique character however authenticity unusual reduction disputed phil senter claimed supposed ungual pertain nevertheless revised diagnosis conducted turner colleagues character still considered widely followed adasaurus known holotype mpcd represents adult individual comprising partial skull missing anterior region right scapulocoracoid sternal plate cervical vertebrae partial dorsal vertebrae sacrum caudal vertebrae partial hindlimbs right foot nearly complete right pelvic girdle comprising ilium ischium pubis second specimen represented less complete paratype mpcd includes two caudal vertebrae nearly complete right foot specimens unearthed nemegt formation locality bügiin tsav gobi desert philip j currie david j varricchio referred another two specimens adasaurus labelled igm igm supposedly specimens recovered locality however specimens actually known shine us khuduk tel ulan chaltsai localities respectively bayan shireh formation thus older remains adasaurus younger nemegt formation represent different new taxon differs adasaurus rather largesized dromaeosaurid holotype estimated length ft weight kg comparatively larger pedal elements paratype indicate gently bigger size latter specimen estimated around ft long kg lb body aside reduced pedal ungual ii adasaurus recognised following additional

present extensor surface tuberosity likely originates insertion muscle tibialis lower tarsals upper ends metatarsals somewhat adasaurus member dromaeosauridae group closely related living birds erected barsbold velociraptorinae conceived group containing velociraptor closely related species characterized smaller size longnarrow snouts however barsbold include adasaurus group instead placed within group defined clade paul sereno sereno defined group dromaeosaurids closely related velociraptor kubota barsbold rexamination adasaurus found taxon closely related velociraptor traditional view velociraptorinae commonly included velociraptor tsaagan linheraptor known complete skulls however analyses vary widely regarding species actually velociraptorines dromaeosaurines turner colleagues supported traditional monophyletic composition however studies found different group dromaeosaurids velociraptorinae longrich currie recovered deinonychus outside velociraptorine traditionally adasaurus assigned dromaeosaurinae includes giant heavily built animals achillobator several analyses suggested belongs velociraptorinae cladogram based phylogenetic analysis conducted james g napoli colleagues linheraptor tsaagan deinonychus adasaurus kuru balaur shri velociraptor norell makovicky stated holotype specimen adasaurus represents largely pathologic due injury disease reaffirmed observation claiming pelvis however large revision dromaeosauridae turner colleagues holotype reexamined found nonpathological instead reflect injured elements several surfaces may represent advanced age individual fused upper ends kubota barsbold stated highly reduced sickle claw adasaurus may used less frequency deinonychosaurs bottom surface lower heel penultimate phalanx apparent asymmetrical ridges like dromaeosaurids denver fowler colleagues suggested new method dromaeosaurids may taken smaller prey predation model raptor prey restraint rpr proposes dromaeosaurids killed prey leaping onto quarry pinning body weight gripping tightly large sickle claws pedal digit manner similar extant accipitrid birds prey like accipitrids dromaeosaurid would begin feed animal still alive eventually died blood loss organ failure proposal based primarily comparisons morphology proportions feet legs dromaeosaurids several groups extant birds prey fairly known predatory behaviors fowler colleagues found feet legs dromaeosaurids closely resemble eagles hawks especially terms enlarged second claw similar range grasping motion short metatarsus foot strength would similar owls rpr model would consistent aspects dromaeosaurid anatomy unusual dentition arm morphology arms covered long feathers may used flapping stabilizers balance atop struggling prey along stiff counterbalancing tail lastly comparatively weak jaws would useful eating prey alive useful forceful dispatch peter bishop reconstructed leg skeleton musculature deinonychus using threedimensional models muscles tendons bones addition mathematical models equations bishop simulated conditions would provide maximum force tip sickle claw therefore likely function among proposed modes sickle claw use kicking cut slash disembowel prey gripping onto flanks prey piercing aided body weight attack vital areas prey restrain prey intra interspecific competition digging prey hideouts results obtained bishop showed crouching posture increased claw forces however forces remained relatively weak indicating claws strong enough used slashing strikes rather used slashing sickle claws likely useful flexed leg angles restraining prey stabbing prey close quarters results consistent fighting dinosaurs specimen preserves velociraptor protoceratops locked combat former gripping onto claws nonextended leg posture despite obtained results bishop considered capabilities sickle claw could varied within taxa given among dromaeosaurids adasaurus unusually smaller sickle claw retained characteristic structure divided two hyperextensible articular surface penultimate phalange could neither confirm disregard pedal digit ii could loss retain adasaurus known late cretaceous nemegt formation age considered late
