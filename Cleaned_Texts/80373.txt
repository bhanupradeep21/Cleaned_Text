kidney paired donation kpd paired exchange approach living donor kidney transplantation patients incompatible donors swap kidneys receive compatible kidney kpd used situations potential donor incompatible better donor hla age matching correlated lower lifetime longer lasting kidney many compatible pairs also participating swaps find better matched kidneys united states national kidney registry organizes majority us kpd including largest swaps first large swap participant chain appeared front page new york second even larger swap included participants completed kpd programs us include unos program launched completed kpd transplant alliance paired according study kidney exchanges improve overall transplant quality leads fewer transplant failures exchanges also reduce waiting times patients needing kidney transplants study found health care cost savings kidney exchanges swaps kidneys come two distinct types cycles chains cycles include donors paired patient donor donates kidney patient receives kidney swap chains initiated nondirected donors donors also known unpaired altruistic donors donate kidney without expectation reciprocal kidney donation specific patient onethird potential living kidney donors want donate kidney friend family member donate due blood type antibody historically donors would turned away patient would lose opportunity receive lifesaving transplant kpd overcomes incompatibility swapping kidneys multiple pairs kpd also used find better matches compatible pairs want lower lifetime longer lasting first paper outlining concept paired exchange authored ft rapaport published first recorded paired exchange transplants organized south korea dr park beginning nearly decade park team south korea utilized novel approach facilitate transplants incompatible pairs first kpd transplants performed followed first kpd transplants united states next ten years united states would become competitive kpd market world dozen kpd programs commencing operations many kpd programs failing outside united states kpd programs organized sponsored governments limited innovation programs three important early kpd programs us hopkins program led dr montgomery dr new england paired kidney exchange nepke led dr delmonico professor alvin ohio organ consortium later reorganized two competing programs paired donation network pdn led dr alliance paired exchange apd led dr hopkins program based johns hopkins hospital led industry early innovations including critical domino chain breakthrough allowed good samaritan donors start dramatically increasing number pairs could matched swap compared loop approach used previously hopkins team began organizing domino chains swaps became larger began attracting national media attention due massive complexity significant impact large swaps unlike hopkins program hospital based nepke launched within new england organ procurement organization served several states north east pdn apd organizations founded transplant surgeons attempted create networks transplant centers would work together pool incompatible pairs much like nepke without opo support apd conceived critically important innovation called nead chains amplified matching power domino chains allowing bridge donors extend chains prior utilization bridge donors chain transplant surgeries would completed one day limited number transplants could performed bridge donor someone whose paired recipient received kidney donate period time generally week months like domino chains increased kpd transplants utilization bridge donors also dramatically increased kpd transplants chains could organized several months avoid logistical limitations performing surgeries one day apd completed first nead year us congress passed charlie norwood clarified paired exchange legal prior passage law many us transplant community feared kpd unlawful due prohibition valuable consideration articulated nota laws govern us transplant passage charlie norwood act many kpd programs launched us including unos kpd program government funding deceased donor registration fees charitable contributions garet jan hil founded national kidney registry nkr daughter age lost kidney function needed transplant parents incompatible could donate daughter later extensive donor search received living donor kidney compatible cousin mr hil first nonphysician startlead kpd program first kpd leader donate one kidneys starting chain facilitated eight transplants national kidney registry completed first kpd transplants implemented next major innovation shipment kidneys commercial airlines breakthrough logistics expanded kpd first living donor kidney shipped commercial airline went new york los started nkrs second chain facilitated eight transplants utilizing several bridge donors initially nkr provided donors option traveling matched recipients hospital donating locally kidney shipped recipients could also choose would accept shipped kidney require donor travel center donate twoyear period preferences shifted nearly recipients would accept shipped kidneys donors willing travel option donor travel phased kidneys needed moved centers shipped several near misses unos reporting deceased donor kidney lost misrouted nkr developed first gps tracking systems human organs monitor location nkr kidney utilization gps tracking devices mandatory nkr shipped kidneys several key innovations yielding results single center kpd program methodist transplant institute san antonio led dr adam bingaman prior dr bingamans work kpd built notion results cross match test determine compatibility generally predictable ensure prediction accurate cross match test must completed prior swap cases cross match tests result unexpected positive cross match bad causes swap fail swap failures costly terms wasted time testing also demoralizing patients donors involved cancelled swap methodist program implemented first donor blood cryopreservation allowing rapid cross matching pairs swap without requiring fresh blood donors approach accelerates matching process reduces swap failure rates provides ability speculatively cross match potential donors highly sensitized patients leading shorter wait times transplants highly sensitized patients although merits using cryopreserved donor blood cross matching clear proved difficult multicenter kpd programs implement cryopreservation due complexity multicenter environment us multicenter kpd program successfully implemented cryopreservation national kidney establishing central lab investing three years software development second important innovation implemented san antonio reengineering donorpatient intake process educate enroll compatible pairs kpd compatible recipient get better matched donor kidney development cryopreservation based cross matching systematic enrollment compatible pairs helped make san antonio one leading kpd centers us unos kpd program completed first nepke pdn programs folded due funding issues increased regulatory requirements imposed us kpd programs cms unos time nkr developed first donor preselect system allowed donors accepted declined match offered innovation taken brokerage industry essentially porting limit order concept kpd preselect concept eliminated need use supercomputers match runs number valid oneways dramatically reduced donor preselect concept developed nkr quickly copied major kpd programs changed nature mathematics needed support kpd dramatically reducing number oneway match possibilities national kidney registry organized largest swap history included surgeries completed five year nkr initiated advanced donation program adp inverted role bridge donor donors donating advance paired recipient alleviated scheduling challenges paired donors national kidney registry set new record organizing swap included surgeries completing two year nkr completed first long term advanced donation whereby donor donated behalf grandson may develop kidney failure years mr hil founder nkr second donor donate kidney program national kidney registry completed kpd transplants accounted us kpd transplants combined volume kpd programs world concerns regarding negative impact cold ischemic time cit may graft survival due shipment kidneys initially caused concern transplant industry slowed adoption kpd concern regarding cit originated deceased donor transplant experiences greater cit correlated lower graft survival prior kpd reason ship living donor kidneys therefore understanding impact cit outcomes concern proved unfounded living donor kidneys shipped research demonstrated cit negative impact kpd completing kpd transplants discovered nkrs graft survival rates actually better graft survival rates typical us nonkpd living donor researchers working better understand nkr kpd transplants superior outcomes believe may driven better hla donor age matching andor better avoidance recipient antibodies researchers determined improved outcomes nkr driven center effect although top us transplant centers participate kpd via nkr improved outcomes kpd transplants opening door compatible pair participation kpd allowing patient compatible living donor essentially tradeup get better matched kidney increasing enrollment compatible pairs kpd shortening wait times incompatible pairs hard match blood type combinations eg patients donors driving matches highly sensitized patients eg cpras researchers also discovered better hla matching leads longer lasting also correlated lower patient mortality better matched kidneys require less immunosuppression less immunosuppression reduces nephrotoxicity negative side effects posttransplant antirejection medications equally important better hla matching reduces number antibodies transplant recipient create making easier get second third fourth issue critical young transplant recipients life expectancy longer expected graft survival ie long transplanted kidney lasts deceased donor kidneys typically last living donor kidneys typically last kpd first started focus enrolling incompatible pairs paired exchange grew process became faster reliable patients compatible donors wanted better match began enrolling kpd researchers identified better matched kidney correlated better outcomes specifically better matched kidney lasts may allow lower dosage posttransplant immunosuppressive also better matched kidney transplant correlated lower lifetime mortality compatible pairs better match lead better outcome also directly helps patients incompatible donors find match get transplanted favorable blood type compatible pair ie donor nono recipient facilitate least one many six additional compatible pair participation fastest growing segment holds promise facilitating better matches patients compatible donors limiting kpd wait times less months patients cpra calculated panel reactive less advanced began expanded include voucher donations swap saver cases expanded rapidly advanced donation accounted nearly half chain starts united states adoption advanced donation increased due timing advantages made donation surgery convenient donor size complexity kpd swaps reduced logical extension trend eventual elimination traditional chain loop swaps replaced chains following academic publications
