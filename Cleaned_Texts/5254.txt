levilactobacillus brevis grampositive rod shaped species lactic acid bacteria heterofermentative creating lactic acid acetic acid ethanol fermentation l brevis type species genus levilactobacillus previously l brevis group comprises found many different environments fermented foods normal microbiota l brevis found food sauerkraut pickles also one common causes beer spoilage ingestion shown improve human immune function patented several times normal gut microbiota l brevis found human intestines vagina feces l brevis one major lactobacilli found tibicos grains used make kefir lentilactobacillus species responsible production polysaccharide dextran kefiran forms major metabolites l brevis include lactic acid ethanol strains l brevis l hilgardii found produce biogenic amines tyramine phenylethylamine ebfred wh peterson ja anderson initially discovered species categorized based ability metabolize certain carbon compounds sugars early study showed produce acetic acid carbon dioxide large amounts mannitol mannitol another carbon source used produce lactic l brevis shown actively transport glucose galactose fructose used carbon source growth l brevis able partially metabolize fructose mannitol strains poorly metabolize glucose prefer disaccharides carbon source using fermentation pathway end result lactic acid acetic appears high temperature conditions acidic environments survival bacteria longer bacteria acidic conditions bacteria live antibiotic resistance acquired conjugation method bacterial reproduction conjugation permits sharing dna allowing bacterium identify various antibiotics exposure information passed replication bacteria l brevis produces organic acids specifically acetic acid ethanol means bacterium produces increased acidic environment alcohol growth conditions depend location bacterium within intestines seem unable significantly replicate anaerobic l brevis heterofermentative uses phosphoketolase pathway metabolize pentoses hexoses l brevis found food sauerkraut pickles also one common causes beer spoilage hop antimicrobial bitter flavoring agent beer fails suppress strains l brevis produce transporter pumps active agents hops bacterial l brevis one major lactobacilli found tibicos grains kefir grains water identified species responsible production polysaccharide dextran forms grains major metabolites l brevis include lactic acid ethanol strains l brevis l hilgardii found produce biogenic amines tyramine found fermentation metabolic pathway commonly found spoiled fermented foods phenylethylamine found chocolates also produce fishy odor foods bacterium physical attributes l brevis common bacteria grampositive bacteria consists external plasma membrane followed periplasmic space finally peptidoglycan layer faces interior bacteria external plasma membrane important bacteria cells recognize possible pathogenesis bacteria peptidoglycan also called murein made series sugars amino acid monomers within grampositive bacteria peptidoglycan layer much thicker gramnegative bacteria actual lattice comprises peptidoglycan referred slayer lattice linked peptidoglycan layer however slayer normally lost processing bacteria laboratory conditions affect measuring adhesion slayer dissolved high concentration levels substances break hydrogen bonds slayers survival time minutes generation l brevis contains approximately two promoters within area meaning significant transcription slayer high levels transcribing sipa sipa gene found aid coding production murin peptidoglycan within bacteria purpose transcription copy dna mrna used create proteins promoter used transcription identify appropriate location begin transcribing within probiotics actually slayer attaches cellular wall gastrointestinal tract ingestion probiotics shown improve human immune function l brevis patented several times l brevis shown survive gastrointestinal tract humans therefore used probiotic currently bacterium ability convert milk yogurt however appropriate used alternative probiotics yogurts within geriatric population use bacteria milk shown increase cellular immunity dietary probiotic supplementation enhances natural killer cell activity elderly investigation agerelated immunological changes l brevis considered appropriate probiotic use significant growth ph particularly normally appropriate range milk significant vaginal bacteria found within vagina l brevis included microbiome collection various bacteria bacteria collaborate protecting vagina vaginal maintenance women childbearing ages significant amount l brevis normally found healthy illnesses disruptions vagina bacteria used aiding restore microbiome lactobacilli found useful preventing urinary tract infections efficiency bacterium defend body normal childbirth appears newborns period days receive transmission l brevis mother appears transmission occurs breast feeding natural child infants resistance also helpful protecting gut various bile acids helicobacter pylori common gut pathogen humans studies shown certain strains l brevis successful combating pathogen vaginosis common form bacterial infection commonly diagnosed yeast infection trichomoniasis sexually transmitted parasite commonly acquired intercourse l brevis along lactobacillus jensenii shown produce high levels hydrogen peroxide may able remediate bacterial vaginosis brevis commonly used ingredient pharmaceutical materials used treat vaginosis evaluation clue cells one method assessing vaginosis assessment performed mounting clue cells vaginal discharge onto slide adding sodium chloride followed microscopic assessment involves bacteria addition surviving within gut organism l brevis also act inhibit pathogenic effects certain gut pathogens also proliferate presence additional bacteria strains resistant certain antibiotics specifically erythromycin antibiotic resistance may helpful maintaining healthy gut microbiome taking
