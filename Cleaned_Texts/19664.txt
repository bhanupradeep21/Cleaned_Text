experiment also called fluctuation test demonstrated bacteria genetic mutations arise absence selective pressure rather response thus concluded darwins theory natural selection acting random mutations applies bacteria well complex organisms max delbrück salvador luria nobel prize physiology medicine part work ideas inheritance mutation generally accepted though role dna hereditary material yet established thought bacteria somehow different could develop heritable genetic mutations depending circumstances found short mutation bacteria preadaptive preexistent postadaptive directed experiment luria delbrück inoculated small number bacteria escherichia coli separate culture tubes period growth plated equal volumes separate cultures onto agar containing phage virus resistance virus bacteria caused induced activation bacteria ie resistance due heritable genetic components plate contain roughly number resistant colonies assuming constant rate mutation luria hypothesized mutations occurred response exposure selective agent number survivors would distributed according poisson distribution mean equal variance delbrück luria found instead number resistant colonies plate varied drastically variance considerably greater mean luria delbrück proposed results could explained occurrence constant rate random mutations generation bacteria growing initial culture tubes based assumptions delbrück derived probability distribution called gives relationship moments consistent experimentally obtained values therefore conclusion mutations bacteria organisms random rather results luria delbrück confirmed graphical less quantitative way newcombe newcombe incubated bacteria petri dish hours replica plated onto two new petri dishes treated phage first plate left unspread second plate respread bacterial cells moved around allowing single cells colony form new colonies colonies contained resistant bacterial cells entering contact phage virus one would expect cells would form new resistant colonies respread dish find higher number surviving bacteria plates incubated growth actually much times greater number bacterial colonies respread dish showed bacterial mutations virus
