virosphere virus diversity virus world global virosphere coined refer places viruses found affected however recently virosphere also used refer pool viruses occurs hosts well viruses associated specific types hosts prokaryotic archaeal invertebrate type genome rna dsdna ecological niche marine scope viral genome diversity enormous compared cellular life cellular life including known organisms double stranded dna genome whereas viruses one least different types genetic information namely dsdna ssdna dsrna ssrna ssrna ssrnart dsdnart type genetic information specific manner mrna synthesis baltimore classification system providing overview mechanisms type genome moreover contrast cellular organisms viruses dont universally conserved sequences genomes compared bycitation needed viral genome size varies approximately fold smallest viruses may consist kb genome coding genes enough successfully evolve travel space time infecting replicating make copies host two basic viral genes replicase gene capsid protein gene soon virus represents biological entity able evolve reproduce cellular life forms viruses may replicase gene use capsid gene eg endogenous virus viral genomes whereas bacteriophages tend larger genomes carrying parts genome translation machinery genes host contrast rna viruses smaller genomes maximum coronavirus rna genomes higher mutation rate genome small enough order harbour many mutations would disrupt essential genes function vast majority viral genes remain unknown und approaches study total number viral genes much higher total number genes three domains life together practically means viruses encode genetic diversity viruses cosmopolites able infect every cell every organism planet earth however different viruses infect different hosts viruses host specific need replicate reproduce within host cell order enter cell viral particle needs interact receptor surface host cell process replication many viruses use replicases protein synthesis dependent host cell protein synthesis machinery thus host specificity limiting factor viral reproductioncitation needed viruses extremely narrow host range able infect certain strain bacterial species whereas others able infect hundreds even thousands different hosts example cucumber mosaic virus cmv use different plant species members viral families like rhabdoviridae infect hosts different kingdoms eg plants members genera psimunavirus myohalovirus infect hosts different domains life eg bacteria capsid outer protecting shell scaffold viral genome capsid enclosing viral nucleic acid make viral particle virion capsid made protein sometimes lipid layer harboured host cell exiting capsid proteins highly symmetrical assemble within host cell due fact assembled capsid thermodynamically favourable state separate randomly floating proteins viral capsids icosahedral helical symmetry whereas bacteriophages complex structure consisting icosahedral head helical tail including baseplate fibers important host cell recognition viruses archaea infecting hosts living extreme environments like boiling water highly saline acidic environments totally different capsid shapes structures variety capsid structures archaeal viruses includes lemon shaped viruses bicaudaviridae family salterprovirus genus spindle form fuselloviridae bottle shaped ampullaviridae egg shaped capsid size virus differs dramatically depending genome size capsid typeicosahedral capsids measured diameter whereas helical complex measured length diameter viruses differ capsid size spectrum nm smallest viruses ssrna viruses like parvovirus icosahedral capsid approximately nm diameter whereas biggest currently known viruses pithovirus mamavirus pandoravirus pithovirus flaskshaped virus nm long nm diameter pandoravirus ovalshaped micron long mamavirus icosahedral virus reaching approximately nm example capsid size depends size viral genome shown comparing icosahedral viruses smallest viruses nm diameter genomes range kb kilo bases kilo base pairs depending type genome biggest near nm diameter genomes also largest million base pairscitation needed viral evolution evolution viruses presumably started beginning second age rna world different types viral genomes arose transition rna rt also emphasises viruses played critical role emergence dna predate luca abundance variety viral genes also imply origin predates viruses share unifying common genes considered polyphyletic multiple origins opposed one common origin cellular life forms virus evolution complex highly prone horizontal gene transfer genetic recombination reassortment moreover viral evolution always considered process coevolution host host cell inevitable virus reproduction hence evolutioncitation needed viruses abundant biological entities viruses viruses capable infecting organisms earth able survive much harsher environments cellular life form viruses included tree life separate structure illustrating viral diversity evolutionary however viral ubiquity imagined virosphere covering whole tree lifecitation needed nowadays entering phase exponential viral discovery genome sequencing technologies including highthroughput methods allow fast cheap sequencing environmental samples vast majority sequences environment wild nature human made reservoirs practically means years virus research discovery bacteriophages viruses bacteria current time scratched surface great viral diversity classic methods like viral culture used previously allowed observe physical virions viral
