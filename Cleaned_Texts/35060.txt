sample xyz window shows planes cut point studied tilt tumbler windows show different projections software downloaded used free technology used visualize cytoplasmic membranes myofibrils transgolgi years later mcintosh team published study using cryofixing electron tomography create model golgi two golgi apparatus main functions modify proteins target next transport within golgi mcintosh team proposed evidence done vesicles cell fuse different membranes microtubules constantly forming shifting around cryofixing rapidly freezing cells studied mcintosh team able preserve cells essentially time using electron microscope visualize work researchers visualized different coatings budding parts able see difference clathrincoated nonclathrincoated buds help molecules golgi transported golgi intended area work researchers describe different cisternae buds vesicles coatings differences cis trans faces visualization technique led conclusion different cisternae golgi also many vesicles surround golgi coated mcintosh team continued earlier interests chromosomemicrotubule interactions mitosis review paper explains spindle microtubules bind chromosomes segregation places called kinetochores description kinetochoredependent point cell block segregation chromosomes chromosomes properly also explains role microtubule proteins motor proteins microtubules segregation motor proteins mentioned article include associated kinetochore plus minus end help disassembly motor proteins associate chromosomes instead kinetochores including chromokinesins work spindle mcintosh also contributed work published many scientists standard kinesin nomenclature work scientists helped create naming structure kinesin proteins involved transport cell along kinesin proteins split fourteen different families given different names new structure naming created existing kinesins easily classified well classify new kinesin proteins authors recommend using protein sequence alignment based homology search help classify also makes specifications makes kinesin additionally paper also gives guidance address kinesins former names applicable mcintosh team published study investigated link depolymerization microtubules generation force showing chemistry tubulin dimers create mechanical researchers attached glass microbeads using laser tweezers mcintosh team able observe bead would move
