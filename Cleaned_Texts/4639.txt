market anomaly financial market predictability seems inconsistent typically riskbased theories asset standard theories include capital asset pricing model famafrench three factor model lack agreement among academics proper theory leads many refer anomalies without reference benchmark theory daniel hirschleifer barberis example indeed many academics simply refer anomalies return predictors avoiding problem defining benchmark academics documented return predictors see list anomalies documented academic journals anomalies however come many caveats almost documented anomalies focus illiquid small moreover studies account trading costs result many anomalies offer profits despite presence additionally return predictability declines substantially publication predictor thus may offer profits finally return predictability may due crosssectional timevariation risk thus necessarily provide good investment opportunity relatedly return predictability disprove efficient market hypothesis one

timeseries regressions give direct evidence unmeasured risk explanation closely related shortcomings capm theory risk well shortcomings empirical tests capm related models perhaps common critique capm derived single period setting thus missing dynamic features like periods high uncertainty general setting capm typically implies multiple risk factors shown mertons intertemporal capm theory moreover icapm generally implies expected returns vary time thus timeseries predictability clear evidence mispricing indeed since capm capture dynamic expected returns evidence timeseries predictability less often regarded mispricing compared crosssectional predictability empirical shortcomings primarily regard difficulty measuring wealth marginal utility theoretically wealth includes stock market wealth
