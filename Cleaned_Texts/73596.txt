pleurisy also known pleuritis inflammation membranes surround lungs line chest cavity result sharp chest pain occasionally pain may constant dull symptoms may include shortness breath cough fever weight loss depending underlying pleurisy caused variety conditions including viral bacterial infections autoimmune disorders pulmonary embolism common cause viral causes include bacterial infection pneumonia pulmonary embolism autoimmune disorders lung cancer following heart surgery pancreatitis occasionally cause remains underlying mechanism involves rubbing together pleurae instead smooth conditions produce similar symptoms include pericarditis heart attack cholecystitis pulmonary embolism diagnostic testing may include chest xray electrocardiogram ecg blood treatment depends underlying paracetamol acetaminophen ibuprofen may used decrease incentive spirometry may recommended encourage larger one million people affected united states descriptions condition date least early bc defining symptom pleurisy sudden sharp stabbing burning dull pain right left side chest breathing especially one inhales feels worse deep breathing coughing sneezing laughing pain may stay one place may spread shoulder sometimes becomes fairly constant dull depending cause pleuritic chest pain may accompanied pleurisy often associated complications affect pleural space cases pleurisy excess fluid builds pleural space called pleural effusion buildup excess fluid often force two layers pleura apart dont rub breathing relieve pain pleurisy large amount fluid result collapse lung make difficult breathe cases pleural effusion excess fluid becomes infected turns abscess called empyema pleural effusion involving fibrinous exudates fluid may called fibrinous pleurisy sometimes occurs later stage pleurisy person develop pleural effusion absence pleurisy example pneumonia heart failure cancer pulmonary embolism lead pleural effusion air gas also build pleural space called pneumothorax result acute lung injury lung disease like emphysema lung procedures like surgery drainage fluid needle examination lung inside light camera mechanical ventilation also cause pneumothorax common symptom sudden pain one side lung shortness breath pneumothorax also put pressure lung cause collapse pneumothorax small may go away large chest tube placed skin chest wall pleural space remove air blood also collect pleural space called hemothorax common cause injury chest blunt force surgery heart chest hemothorax also occur people lung pleural cancer hemothorax put pressure lung force collapse also cause shock state hypoperfusion insufficient amount blood able reach organs pleural space invaded fluid air particles parts body fairly complicates viral infection coxsackie b virus hrsv cmv adenovirus ebv parainfluenza influenza common cause pleurisy however many different conditions cause pleuritic chest space pleurae starts fill fluid pleural effusion chest pain eased shortness breath result since lungs need room expand breathing cases pleuritic chest pain idiopathic means exact cause determined diagnosis pleurisy another pleural condition based medical history physical examinations diagnostic goals rule sources symptoms find cause pleurisy underlying disorder treated doctor uses stethoscope listen breathing method detects unusual sounds lungs person pleurisy may inflamed layers pleurae make rough scratchy sound rub breathing called pleural friction rub depending results physical examination diagnostic tests sometimes performed chest xray takes picture heart lungs may show air fluid pleural space also may show cause eg pneumonia fractured rib lung tumor pleurisy sometimes xray taken lying painful side may show fluid well changes fluid position appear vertical xray blood tests detect bacterial viral infections pneumonia rheumatic fever pulmonary embolism lupus electrocardiography test determine heart condition contributes symptoms ultrasonography uses sound waves create image may show fluid located chest also show tumors although ultrasound may detect fluid around lungs also known pleural effusion sound waves scattered air therefore actual picture lungs obtained ultrasonography ct scan provides computergenerated picture lungs show pockets fluid also may show signs pneumonia lung abscess tumor magnetic resonance imaging mri also called nuclear magnetic resonance nmr scanning uses powerful magnets show pleural effusions tumors arterial bloodgas sampling small amount blood taken artery usually wrist blood checked oxygen carbondioxide levels test shows well lungs taking oxygen presence excess fluid pleural cavity pleural effusion suspected location fluid confirmed sample fluid removed procedure remove fluid chest called diagnostic doctor inserts small needle thin hollow plastic tube chest wall withdraws thoracentesis done doctors office hospital ultrasound used guide needle fluid trapped small pockets around lungs thoracentesis usually cause serious complications generally chest xray done procedure evaluate lungs possible complications thoracentesis include following lung fluid examined microscope evaluated presence chemicals color texture degree clarity indicator infection cancer conditions may causing buildup fluid blood pleural space tuberculosis cancer suspected small piece pleura may examined microscope make definitive diagnosis called biopsy several approaches taking tissue samples available treatment several large amounts fluid air blood removed pleural space may cause lung collapse surgical procedures used drain fluid air blood pleural space follows couple medications used relieve pleurisy symptoms may role use corticosteroids tuberculous pleurisy tacrolimus prograf methotrexate trexall rheumatrex treatment pleurisy studies needed following may helpful management pleurisy ideally treatment pleurisy aimed eliminating underlying cause disease treatment pleurisy depends origin prescribed physician base individual paracetamol acetaminophen amoxicillin antibiotics case bacterial infections common remedies dispensed doctors relieve initial symptoms pain chest viral infections selflimited nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids preferably indometacin usually employed pain control number alternative complementary medicines investigated antiinflammatory properties use pleurisy time clinical trials compounds performed extracts brazilian folk remedy wilbrandia ebracteata taiuia shown reduce inflammation pleural cavity extract thought inhibit enzyme nonsteroidal antiinflammatory pleurisy disorders pleurae serious depending caused generally pleurisy treatment excellent prognosis left untreated cause severe complications example resulting pulmonary heart disease cor pulmonale manifests inflammation arms legs lead heart failure conditions caused pleurisy pleural disorders adequately diagnosed treated early one expect full recovery help pulmonologist respiratory physician uk
