arthritis knee typically particularly debilitating form knee may become affected almost form word arthritis refers inflammation types arthritis include related wear tear cartilage osteoarthritis associated inflammation resulting overactive immune system rheumatoid always certain arthritis knee developscitation needed knee may become affected almost form arthritis including related mechanical damage structures knee osteoarthritis posttraumatic arthritis various autoimmune forms arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis juvenile arthritis slerelated arthritis psoriatic arthritis ankylosing spondylitis arthritis due infectious causes including lyme diseaserelated arthritis gouty arthritis reactive knee one joints commonly affected cartilage knee may begin break sustained stress leaving bones knee rubbing resulting nearly third us citizens affected osteoarthritis knee age obesity known significant risk factor development risk increases proportionally body weight obesity contributes oa development increasing mechanical stress exerted upon knees standing also leads increased production compounds may cause joint parity associated increased risk knee oa likelihood knee replacement risk increases proportion number children woman birthed may due weight gain pregnancy increased body weight consequent joint stress flat feet significant risk factor development additionally structural deformities advanced age female sex past joint trauma genetic predisposition certain atrisk occupations may contribute development osteoarthritis knee often first joint affected lyme arthritis common symptom sle arthritis often symmetric often involves small joints though almost joint may affected knees joints hands often involved sle larger joints including knee avascular necrosis possible complication leading pain reactive arthritis often presents lower limb oligoarthritis including arthritis single joint lower extremities rapid onset highly suggestive gouty knee may sometimes affected cases gouty arthritis knee skin symptoms occur less often however pain swelling may particularly ra often first manifests inflammation particular finger toe joints however pain swelling larger joints including knees may also first diagnosis knee osteoarthritis often entails physical examination assessment symptoms patients medical history may also involve medical imaging blood persistent knee pain limited morning stiffness reduced function crepitus restricted movement bony enlargement appear useful indications knee osteoarthritis standardized medical questionnaires like knee injury osteoarthritis outcome score short form koos western ontario mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index also used diagnose monitor progression knee osteoarthritis physician recommend treatment regimen based upon severity symptoms general recommendations management knee arthritis may include avoiding activities aggravate condition applying cold warm packs using ointments creams relieve pharmaceutical management usually dependent upon nature underlying condition causing arthritis overthecounter medications like acetaminophen paracetamol ibuprofen naproxen nsaids often used firstline medical treatments pain relief andor managing inflammation corticosteroids may injected directly joint cavity provide significant relief inflammation swelling pain medications used management arthritis knee include diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs biopharmaceuticals viscosupplementation including hyaluronic acid injections glucosamine chondroitin hyaluronic acid normally present joints including knee acting lubricant providing shock absorption among functions osteoarthritis loss articular hyaluronic acid activity likely contributing pain stiffness associated condition hyaluronic acid injections fdaapproved treatment osteoarthritis knee sometimes also used joints however merits ha injections still disputed ha injections indicated medications fail offer adequate symptom relief symptom relief associated ha injections may last years injection ha injections appear offer significant pain relief patients others may see benefits severe osteoarthritis without much cartilage benefits hyaluronic observed supportive devices like knee braces used symptom relief osteoarthritis knee braces may however result discomfort skin irritation swelling may provide benefits using cane shockabsorbent footwear inserts elastic bandages knee sleeves may also helpful managing arthritis symptoms braces may especially effective one knee shoe insoles fitted correct flat feet provide significant relief severely flat however found insoles used correct medial knee osteoarthritis common form may offer much pain obesity known significant risk factor development furthermore losing weight reduces mechanical stress acting upon knees standing possibly reducing pain improving function knee however necessary ascertain whether patient actually overweight committing weight loss management exercises help increase range motion flexibility well help strengthen muscles physical therapy exercise often effective reducing pain improving function compared patienteducation program pain function showed improvement eight weeks aquatic exercise twelve weeks showed improvement function inclusion isokinetic quadriceps hamstring strengthening exercises rehabilitation packages patients knee osteoarthritis may also enhance highquality life make contribution decreased hazard landbased exercises focus hip abductor shows improvement related performance function women symptomatic knee cochrane review could conclude whether highintensity exercises provide better results lowintensity surgical intervention may undertaken management technique yields adequate relief surgical procedures may entail arthroscopy seldom used sole osteoarthritis osteotomy performed unilateral earlystage osteoarthritis knee replacement definitive treatment osteoarthritisrelated symptoms type arthroplasty may involve either partial total replacement alternative medicine interventions undertaken pain relief arthritis knee include acupuncture magnetic pulse
