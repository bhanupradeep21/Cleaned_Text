evolutionary biologists developed various theoretical models explain evolution foodsharing unresisted transfer food one foodmotivated individual models foodsharing based upon general evolutionary theory applied human behavior models considered branch human behavioral ecology researchers developed several types foodsharing models involving phenomena kin selection reciprocal altruism tolerated theft group cooperation costly signaling kinselection reciprocalaltruism models foodsharing based upon evolutionary concepts kin selection altruism since theoretical basis models involves reproductive fitness one underlying assumption models greater resourceaccumulation increases reproductive fitness foodsharing theorized important development early human w among first propose explanation natural selection altruistic behaviors among related individuals according model natural selection favor altruistic behavior towards kin benefit contributing factor reproductive fitness towards recipient scaled based upon wrights coefficient genetic relatedness donor recipient outweighs cost giving words kin selection implies food given great benefit recipient low cost donor example would sharing food among kin period surplus implications kinselection natural selection also favor development ways determining kin nonkin close kin distant kin hamiltons rule applied foodsharing behavior simple expectation model close kin receive food shares either frequently larger quantities distant relatives additionally greater imbalances quantities shared close kin expected shared nonkin distantly related however reciprocal altruism important factor may case among close kin also reciprocity see subsection based extension hamiltons model cheating recipients sharing food donors likely take place unrelated distantly related individuals closely related individuals addition expanding ideas hamilton kinbased altruism saul also theorized foodsharing based robert model reciprocal altruism following trivers ideas reciprocal altruism models foodsharing generate expectations recipient food donor share food future interaction like kin selection model food shared benefit towards recipient greater costs donor period surplus jim proposed model evolution reciprocal foodsharing based evidence chimpanzees modern human huntergatherer groups model designed address problems trivers model failed address one problem according moore model adequately explain initial development reciprocal altruism population started one reciprocal altruist gives benefits reciprocal altruists trait would selected would altruists interact moores model made following assumptions assumptions moore proposed human ancestors would learned hunt share food faced punitive action group members individual share food group individual finds scarce defensible resource would faced begging behavior group members costs benefits sharing scenario sorted status fight risk nutritional value nutritional value determined size food portion relative nutritional needs individuals nutritional value remains constant throughout scenario declines value portions consumed obtaining individual another individual begs increasing intensity beggars social cost increases beggars social costs exceed fighting paralleled benefits foodobtainer benefits foodobtainer exceed beggars cost fighting beggar attack time foodobtainer decide share decision made depending expected reaction beggar expected decide share time would maximize benefits minimize loss nutritional value beggar initially dominant may follow first sharing interaction begging fighting reciprocation sharing let incident pass begging fighting impose risk onto beggar foodobtainer might feel behave dominantly become dominant beggar loses inaction allows foodobtainer remain slightly dominant group members witnessed change dominance position beggar may demonstrate redirected aggression attack lowerrank bystander later beggar obtains food may choose reciprocate getting initial foodobtainer beg occurs benefits offered exceed status cost initial foodobtainers begging thus moores model predicted natural selection would favor aggressive sharing assertive reciprocation reestablish status feinman attempted combine kin selection reciprocal foodsharing based inequalities direct access food resources among huntergatherers donors likely share foods recipients direct access feinman also hypothesizes donors reproductive value decreases probability donor giving food increases either without reciprocal sharing example older individuals mostly women foraging societies share food care younger unrelated individuals probability donor giving food decrease reproductive value recipient also decreases foods predictable distribution thus termed less foods become less reliable expected shared rarer commonly encountered food sources food becomes scarcer donors expected become strict sharing habits may favor close relatives recipients actively reciprocate give food recipients higher reproductive value younger offspring prospective mates others donors also tend share remain familiar close proximity feinman also hypothesizes donors likely share culturally similar culturally recent studies chimpanzees nonhuman primates found evidence support reciprocal sharing however factors grooming begging behaviors may also contribute patterns nonhuman primate food models tolerated theft seek explain huntergatherer societies scrounging behaviour tolerated members developed response variancereduction models reciprocal behavior might socially related taboos tied rules preventing person accumulate wealth variancereduction models seek explain redistribution large food packages caches prey items occurs daily practices huntergatherers according variance reduction theory optimal let excess food rot blurton jones argued evolutionary biology perspective taboos exist would beneficial selfish one found food share also accepted shares others essentially cheater altruism models idea selfishness would expected develop dominant behavior unlike cooperative models link sharing hunting tolerated theft links sharing arrival food package either hunted scavenged cooperative reciprocal models according jones could explain foodsharing initially developed societies claimed tolerated theft became frequent reciprocal altruism could jones outlines several assumptions model tolerated therefore individual obtains large package food cases seldom happens faces asymmetric contests food obtainer benefit fighting less valuable portions however latecomers obtained food much gain even less valuable portions worth effort foodobtainer fight portions obtainer expected relinquish without fight since would likely lose latecomer thus another expectation natural selection favor ability assess costs benefits among frequently interacting individuals roles obtainer latecomerthief interchanged balancing benefits latecomer gains obtainer losses reciprocation develops avoid injury equal reciprocal sharing eventual consequence tolerated theft behavior food packages small begin theft less tolerated portions lower returns along assumed diminishing value curve hoarding expected cases either food defended season scarcity synchronous glut ex salmon run agricultural harvest accumulated food longer follows diminishing curve financial capital scrounging expected increase among groups active foragers miss sharing opportunities due acts less successful foraging foragers worse scroungers scroungers able participate sharing events based studies de waal chimpanzees exhibit tolerated theft behaviors typically mother offspring involve commonly available plant foods costly signaling interpreted ethnographic studies regards food sharing explain certain individuals primarily men tend target difficulttoacquire foods sometimes produce less optimal yields one explanation behavior means men signal reproductive quality prospective strategy increases reproductive success hunters successfully capture costly however risk increasing sexual conflicts highquality individuals invest less current partnerships signal low cost behavior study turtle hunting meriam people one indigenous torres strait islander peoples smith bliege frame collective foodsharing behavior within costly signaling framework among meriam family sponsor turtlehunting group collect turtles feasting purposes associated funerary activities since hunting group receive turtles return behavior fit within reciprocal cooperative foodsharing framework instead benefits hunters signals hunting leaders hunting groups signal skills specialized knowledge charisma allow gain widespread social status successful benefit allows hunters gain priority social considerations marriages alliances family sponsored hunting groups receives captured turtles expectation reciprocal payment future costs hunters provisioning hunt including purchase fuel boats among human societies groups often target foods pose level difficulty activities generally require cooperation several individuals despite fact number individuals involved acquisition ownership acquired food often goes single individual finder one successfully kills owners may share nonowners helped acquiring food resource however act sharing may means ensuring cooperation future example inupiat
