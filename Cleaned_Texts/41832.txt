compared genus proterochampsa lifestyle proterochampsa proterochampsids contested number suggestions proposed many early descriptions proterochampsids assumed aquatic semiaquatic lifestyles similar modern crocodiles due superficial similarities shared two groups including dorsoventrally flattened skulls orbits external nares face however recent studies called question assumption proposed terrestrialamphibious distinctly terrestrial lifestyles taxa several studies use histology bones osteoderms order infer lifestyle bone histology indicating compactness comparable modern terrestrial squamates terrestrial lifestyle suggested proterochampsid chanaresuchus bonapartei extension several related proterochampsids sharing similar morphology notably proterochampsa distinct enough taxa could potentially semiaquatic lifestyle despite new number notable proterochampsid features either tentatively suggest terrestrial lifestyle compared modern reptile taxa tail morphology ambiguous definitively suggest one kind lifestyle another simple secondary palate palatal teeth asymmetric foot ghariallike teeth proterochampsids suggested indicative piscivorous diet thus semiaquatic lifestyle due proterochampsa fewer teeth proterochampsids genus may potentially excluded compact nature proterochampsid osteoderms suggested evidence semiaquatic lifestyle due higher bone mass despite small size low number osteoderms supporting large increase bone mass another debate may relevant proterochampsa osteoderms present either species within overall leaves proterochampsa particular features used definitive evidence lifestyle paleontologists called specifically deeper analysis lifestyle studies bone histology proterochampsids used discovery highly vascular fibrolamellar bone
