anabolic steroid synthetic steroid aas features alkyl group specifically methyl ethyl group position unlike many aas aas orally active require intramuscular injection however uniquely possess high potential hepatotoxicity simultaneously limits use addition high risk gynecomastia due uniquely high estrogenic activity although apply aas also ie also dihydrotestosterone dht nandrolone derivatives respectively prototypical example aas methyltestosterone extension alkyl chain longer ethyl group abolishes androgenic activity converts drug antiandrogen topterone allylestrenol extendedchain variant ethylestrenol conversely replacement alkyl group ethynyl group greatly reduces abolish androgenic activity ethisterone norethisterone similarly extension alkyl chain extension ethynyl chain abolishes androgenic activity dimethisterone dienogest antiandrogenic features extension chain form cyanomethyl group position
