adolescent sleep typically poor duration quality sleep duration quality reduce suboptimal levels sleep duration variability latency increases sleep recommendations suggest adolescents obtain hours sleep per night additionally shift bodys circadian rhythm sleep wake timings become later technology social factors physical development thought contribute poor sleep time poor sleep duration quality adolescents linked altered brain functioning development poor mental physical health well higher rates disease concerns surrounding poor sleep adolescence garnered significant public attention especially concerning policies related school start adolescent sleep worsens age specifically longitudinal research demonstrates sleep duration shortens transition high school additionally sleep efficiency amount time spent asleep bed decreased transition daytoday variability sleep duration increased transition suggesting adolescent sleep duration becomes less stable time variety social physical biological psychological factors change adolescence contributes declines particular puberty explored contributor changes adolescent sleep luteinizing hormone lh secreted sleep onset pubertal maturation pointing important relationship sleep pubertal national sleep foundation recommends teenagers years obtain hours recommendation stipulates less hours hours sleep may harmful additionally recommended young adults years obtain hours sleep avoid sleep less hours hours adolescent sleep researchers conducted studies provide stronger empirical evidence sleep recommendations fuligni colleagues examined sample american adolescents found younger adolescents especially elevated levels internalizing symptoms need sleep order experience optimum levels positive mood next additionally another study examining mexicanamerican youth found roughly hours sleep predictive high gpa hours sleep predictive lower internalizing finding suggests optimal sleep duration differs depending outcome research needed understand individual differences sleep duration sleep duration declining since early according evidence also suggests teen females ethnic minorities low socioeconomic status experience lowest durations puberty thought contribute poor sleep adolescence teens undergo physical social burgeoning area adolescent sleep research focused understanding contribution technologyuse poor teen importantly research shows declines adolescent sleep duration characteristic adolescents around poor sleep duration found related altered brain development adolescence telzer colleagues found teens greater daytoday variability sleep duration lower white matter integrity one year result remained controlling sleep duration suggests sleep variability may consequential teen brain development simply duration another study found sleep duration strongly associated gray matter volume bilateral hippocampus among sample healthy children poor sleep duration increased risktaking wellestablished association adolescent sleep literature recent metaanalysis reported poor sleep duration results times greater odds engaging risky direction relationship risktaking sleep duration still unknown thus causal claims plethora research shows low sleep duration linked poor furthermore youth report low sleep duration also demonstrate difficulties emotion particular concern adolescents experience fluctuations mood result pubertal maturation however poor sleep duration worsens mood regulation abilities rendering adolescents vulnerable empirical evidence suggests sleep quality poor poor sleep quality adolescence linked variety negative behaviors outcomes instance poor sleep quality shown positive associated anxiety depressive symptoms among teens study published found sleep quality significantly mediated relationship age depressive symptoms suggesting rise depressive symptoms adolescence partly explained poor sleep long line research also demonstrated poor sleep quality associated increased risktaking behaviors among neuroscience research fmri found poor sleep quality associated greater risktaking behavioral risky behavior associated decreased activity cognitive control regions brain increased activity reward regions brain moreover poor sleep quality found linked dampened intranetwork connectivity regions default mode network brain network undergoes development increased interest understanding relationship sleep technology use among adolescents era social media growing concern bluelight emitted technology may interfering adolescents ability obtain restful sufficient use technologies ie television cell phone computerlaptop associated prolonged sleep duration amount time takes fall asleep shorter sleep duration among television use associated poorest sleep duration adolescent technologyuse also linked excessive daytime sleepiness caffeine suggesting technologyuse may interfere sleep may lead increased caffeine consumption longitudinal data demonstrates time spent using technology predictive short sleep duration however short sleep duration also predictive time spent using longitudinal research larger sample sizes needed clarify mechanisms underlying association technologyuse sleep adolescence adolescence characterized evening chronotype preference adolescents engaging late bed wake evening chronotype unique period adolescence compared childhood adulthood characterized morning chronotype eveningness adolescence linked increased substance worse overall poor increased depressive increased anxiety poor emotion beyond conveying bed wake times chronotype also indicative optimal times functioning instance researchers tested adolescents executive functioning performance two times time optimal chronotype ie evening evening chronotypes vs morning morning chronotypes time suboptimal chronotype ie morning evening chronotypes vs evening morning chronotypes found morning adolescents tested morning performed better evening evening chronotype adolescents tested evening performed better pittsburgh sleep quality index psqi wellvalidated widely used selfreport questionnaire measures sleep nineteen items combined create seven component scores sleep component scores used create overall global score sleep quality seven components consist subjective sleep quality sleep disturbances sleep duration sleep latency habitual sleep efficiency use sleep medications daytime dysfunction psqi high internal reliability cronbachs alpha psqi used many studies assessing adolescent sleep quality actigraph watches commonly used gather objective measures watch worn nondominant wrist measures sleep using body movement data gathered watch includes sleep duration number awakenings total minutes nighttime awakenings first valid reliable measure chronotype created horne Ã¶stberg morningnesseveningness questionnaire meq contains items tapping sleep wake time sample items include assuming adequate environmental conditions easy find getting mornings considering feeling best rhythm time would get entirely free plan day questionnaire consists likert timescale items items scored obtain composite score since creation meq validated adolescent young adult early assessments questionnaires psychometric properties revealed scale good internal consistency httpsenwikipediaorgwikiadolescentsleep
