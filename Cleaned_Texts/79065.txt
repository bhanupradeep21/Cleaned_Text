developed book feeling happens antonio damasios theory consciousness proposes consciousness arises interactions brain body environment according theory consciousness unitary experience rather emerges dynamic interplay different brain regions corresponding bodily states damasio argues conscious experiences influenced emotional responses generated bodys interactions environment emotional responses play crucial role shaping conscious experience theory emphasizes importance body physiological processes emergence consciousness damasios three layered theory based hierarchy stages stage building upon last basic representation organism referred protoself core consciousness extended consciousness damasios approach explaining development consciousness relies three notions emotion feeling feeling feeling emotions collection unconscious neural responses give rise feelings emotions complex reactions stimuli cause observable external changes organism feeling arises organism becomes aware changes experiencing result external internal according damasios theory consciousness protoself first stage hierarchical process consciousness generation shared many species protoself basic representation organism arises brains constant interaction body protoself unconscious process creates map bodys physiological state used brain generate conscious experience map constantly updated brain receives new stimuli body forms foundation development complex forms consciousness damasio asserts protoself signified collection neural patterns representative bodys internal state function self constantly detect record moment moment internal physical changes affect homeostasis protoself represent traditional sense self rather preconscious state provides reference core self autobiographical self build damasio puts protoself coherent collection neural patterns map momentbymoment state physical structure organism damasio multiple brain areas required protoself function namely hypothalamus controls general homeostasis organism brain stem whose nuclei map body signals insular cortex whose function linked emotion brain areas work together keep constant process collecting neural patterns map current status bodys responses environmental changes protoself require language order function moreover direct report ones experience state emotion begins manifest secondorder neural patterns located subcortical areas emotion acts neural object physical reaction drawn reaction causes organism become aware changes affecting realization springs damasios notion feeling occurs patterns contributing emotion manifest mental images brain movies body modified neural objects second layer self known core consciousness sufficiently evolved second layer damasios theory core consciousness emergent process occurs organism becomes consciously aware feelings associated changes occurring internal bodily state able recognize thoughts formulated develops momentary sense self brain continuously builds representative images based communications received level consciousness exclusive human beings remains consistent stable throughout lifetime image result mental patterns caused interaction internal external stimulus relationship established organism object observing brain continuously creates images represent organisms experience qualia damasios definition emotion unconscious reaction internal external stimulus activates neural patterns feeling emerges still unconscious state simply senses changes affecting protoself due emotional state patterns develop mental images float organisms awareness put simply consciousness feeling knowing feeling organism becomes aware feeling bodily state protoself affected experiences response emotion core consciousness born brain continues present nonverbal narrative sequence images mind organism based relationship objects object context anything person melody neural image core consciousness concerned present moment require language memory reflect past experiences project future consciousness moves beyond damasios third final layer emerges extended consciousness level could exist without predecessors unlike requires vast use conventional memory therefore injury persons memory center cause damage extended consciousness without hurting layers autobiographical self draws memory past experiences involves use higher autobiographical layer self developed gradually time working memory necessary extensive display items recalled referenced linguistic areas brain activated enhance organisms experience however according language thought hypothesis language would necessarily required damasios theory consciousness met criticism lack explanation regarding generation conscious experiences brain researchers posited brains interaction body alone account complexity conscious experience additional factors must considered furthermore theory criticized inadequate treatment concept selfawareness lack clear method measuring consciousness hinders empirical testing evaluation theories emotion currently fall four main categories follow one another historical series evolutionary ethological physiological neurological cognitive note current theory emotion falls strictly within single category rather theory uses one approach form core premises able extend main postulates damasios trilevel view human mind posits share two lowest levels animals suggested example see dyer wwwconsciouscomputationwebnodecom dyers triune expansion compared damasios sensorimotor stage cf damasios protoself spatiotemporal stage coreconsciousness cognolinguistic stage extended consciousness important feature damasios theory one shares dyers theory key role played mental images consciously mediating information exchange endocrine cognitive ledoux brown different view emotion connected general cognition place emotionality similar level cognitive states fairness dyers damasios models concur point ie emotionality isolated particular layer within trilevel framework earlier less sophisticated models placed emotions strictly within limbic circuits primary role consciously respond well cause responses within hypothalamus interface intentional mind states metabolic endocrine body states emotionality demonstrably global mind state like consciousness example simultaneously aware lowlevel pain lowlevel body idea high level enters imagination working memory likewise lowlevel emotional reaction painful workplace injury fear threat wellbeing coexist highlevel feeling anger indignation coworker failed follow safety guidelines careful reading damasios work reveals distinguishes theories predecessors formalistic elements interact dynamically integrated system eg suggestion dynamic neural map ultimately posits instantaneous configuration neural state present moment rather supporting biological construct ie conscious identity software hardware even though unique hardware constrains operate software common criticism stems fact knowing feeling processed equal success without conscious awareness machines instance models explain need consciousness qualia
