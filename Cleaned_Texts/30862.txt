quazepam sold brand name doral among others relatively longacting benzodiazepine derivative drug developed schering corporation quazepam used treatment insomnia including sleep induction sleep quazepam induces impairment motor function relatively uniquely selective hypnotic anticonvulsant properties considerably less overdose potential benzodiazepines due novel receptorsubtype quazepam effective hypnotic induces maintains sleep without disruption sleep patented came medical use quazepam used shortterm treatment insomnia related sleep induction sleep maintenance problems demonstrated superiority benzodiazepines temazepam fewer incidence side effects temazepam including less sedation amnesia less usual dosage mg orally quazepam effective premedication prior quazepam fewer side effects benzodiazepines less potential induce tolerance rebound significantly less potential quazepam induce respiratory depression adversely affect motor coordination different side effect profile quazepam may due selective binding profile type benzodiazepine september us food drug administration fda required boxed warning updated benzodiazepine medicines describe risks abuse misuse addiction physical dependence withdrawal reactions consistently across medicines tolerance may occur quazepam slowly seen benzodiazepines quazepam causes significantly less drug tolerance less withdrawal symptoms including less rebound insomnia upon discontinuation compared quazepam may cause less rebound effects benzodiazepine receptor selective nonbenzodiazepine drugs due longer shortacting hypnotics often cause next day rebound anxiety quazepam due pharmacological profile cause next day rebound withdrawal effects firm conclusions drawn however whether longterm use quazepam produce tolerance longterm clinical trials extending beyond weeks chronic use quazepam withdrawn gradually used beyond weeks use avoid risk severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome developing high dosage administration prolonged periods time weeks quazepam animal studies provoked severe withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation including excitability hyperactivity convulsions death two monkeys due withdrawalrelated convulsions monkeys died however diazepamtreated addition documented medical literature one major metabolites quazepam ndesalkylflurazepam longacting prone accumulation binds unselectively benzodiazepine receptors thus quazepam may differ much pharmacologically benzodiazepines require special precaution used pregnancy children alcohol drugdependent individuals individuals comorbid psychiatric quazepam active metabolites excreted breast accumulation one active metabolites quazepam ndesalkylflurazepam may occur elderly lower dose may required quazepam tolerable elderly patients compared flurazepam due reduced next day however another study showed marked next day impairments repeated administration due accumulation quazepam longacting metabolites thus medical literature shows conflicts quazepams side effect study showed significant balance impairments combined unstable posture administration quazepam test extensive review medical literature regarding management insomnia elderly found considerable evidence effectiveness durability nondrug treatments insomnia adults ages interventions underutilized compared benzodiazepines including quazepam nonbenzodiazepine sedativehypnotics appeared offer significant clinical advantages efficacy tolerability elderly persons found newer agents novel mechanisms action improved safety profiles melatonin agonists hold promise management chronic insomnia elderly people longterm use sedativehypnotics insomnia lacks evidence base traditionally discouraged reasons include concerns potential adverse drug effects cognitive impairment anterograde amnesia daytime sedation motor incoordination increased risk motor vehicle accidents falls addition effectiveness safety longterm use agents remain determined concluded research needed evaluate longterm effects treatment appropriate management strategy elderly persons chronic absorption rate likely significantly reduced quazepam taken fasted state reducing hypnotic effect quazepam hours passed since eating food food eaten taking quazepam trifluoroalkyl type benzodiazepine quazepam unique amongst benzodiazepines selectively targets gabaa subunit receptors responsible inducing sleep mechanism action similar zolpidem zaleplon pharmacology successfully substitute zolpidem zaleplon animal quazepam selective type benzodiazepine receptors containing subunit similar drugs zaleplon zolpidem result quazepam little muscle relaxant properties benzodiazepines unselective bind gabaa receptors gabaa receptors gabaa receptors include subunit containing gabaa receptors responsible hypnotic properties drug type receptors include subunits responsible anxiolytic action amnesia muscle relaxant thus quazepam may less side effects benzodiazepines long halflife hours reduces benefits hypnotic due likely next day sedation also two active metabolites halflives hours quazepam may also cause less drug tolerance benzodiazepines temazepam triazolam perhaps due subtype longer halflife quazepam may advantage however causing less rebound insomnia shorter acting subtype selective however one major metabolites quazepam aka ndesalkylflurazepam binds unselectively gabaa receptors metabolite also long halflife likely contributes pharmacological effects quazepam absorption halflife hours peak plasma levels hours eliminated renally active metabolites quazepam metabolite limited pharmacological activity compared parent compound quazepam active metabolite needed quazepam major active metabolite show high selectivity gabaa elimination halflife range quazepam quazepam modulates specific gabaa receptors via benzodiazepine site gabaa receptor modulation enhances actions gaba causing increase opening frequency chloride ion channel results increased influx chloride ions gabaa receptors quazepam unique amongst benzodiazepine drugs selectively targets benzodiazepine receptors results reduced sleep latency promotion quazepam also anticonvulsant quazepam potent sleep inducing sleep maintaining studies animals humans demonstrated eeg changes induced quazepam resemble normal sleep patterns whereas benzodiazepines disrupt normal sleep quazepam promotes slow wave positive effect quazepam sleep architecture may due high selectivity benzodiazepine receptors demonstrated animal human studies makes quazepam unique
