educated bronx high school science new york wandsworth school south london parents returned uk studying university college lecturer senior lecturer developmental biology university glasgow professor head molecular genetics biochemistry st marys hospital medical school university emigrated melbourne australia director murdoch childrens research institute murdoch institute professor medical genetics university melbourne edited several books genetic engineering ethics new genetic sciences since retirement williamson secretary science policy australian academy science honorary senior principal fellow professor university melbourne williamson began career working haemoglobin synthesis reticulocytes immature red blood cells thalassaemias inherited blood disorders lecturer university glasgow studied human gene organisation expression solo author paper provided dual discovery origin cellfree dna nucleosome organisation dna chromosomes including first description nucleosome decades later geneticists steven henikoff george church hailed williamsons report remarkably prescient paper adding simultaneous discovery nucleosome ladder origin cellfree cfdna thus correctly interpreted williamson respectively years nearly decades biological significance nucleosomes clinical utility cfdna appreciated williamson chose follow results turning attention messenger rna study globin genes thalassaemias williamsons group demonstrated severe alphathalassaemia due deletion alpha globin subsequently deltabeta thalassaemia attributed deletion beta globin new position st marys hospital medical school williamsons group went clone human alpha beta gammaglobin genes cdnas used deduce genomic structures williamson colleagues began applying discovery dna markers called restriction fragment length polymorphisms perform linkage mapping locate position important human disease genes working kay davies williamsons group narrowed location xlinked duchenne muscular dystrophy williamson best known research genetics cystic fibrosis williamson lead one three teams independently mapped gene mutated cystic fibrosis chromosome sparking intense international race identify gene group came close isolating defective gene reporting strong candidate scooped lapchee tsui francis collins colleagues throughout williamson colleagues pursued use random dna markers map mutated genes responsible several major genetic disorders including myotonic dystrophy friedreichs ataxias coronary artery disease craniofacial abnormalities alzheimers disease williamsons group also developed first method genetic testing using cheek buccal epithelial cells obtained simple john hardy lecturer williamsons department identified first mutation associated alzheimers disease gene encoding amyloid precursor protein williamson early proponent human gene therapy writing presciently gene therapy yet possible may become feasible soon particularly well understood gene defects although treatment patient raises ethical problems done well changing genes early embryo difficult controversial unlikely required following discovery cf gene turned attention developing strategies gene therapy cf patients final years st marys including nonviral proofofconcept study inaugural issue nature williamson recruited mentored many leading molecular geneticists two decades st marys hospital including royal society fellows dame kay davies stephen brown gillian bates john hardy davies recalled bob nothing impossible always knew someone field would able help whenever needed new technique vector cloning taught much successful could scientist collaborative extensive network basic clinical scientists hardy acknowledged first grant applications wrote unsuccessful without continuing support bob efforts would foundered williamson moved london melbourne australia become director murdoch childrens research institute taking david clinical geneticist trained victor mckusick williamson
