acth test also called cosyntropin tetracosactide synacthen test medical test usually requested interpreted endocrinologists assess functioning adrenal glands stress response measuring adrenal response adrenocorticotropic hormone acth corticotropin another corticotropic agent tetracosactide cosyntropin tetracosactrin synacthen alsactide acth hormone produced anterior pituitary gland stimulates adrenal glands release cortisol dehydroepiandrosterone dhea dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate dheas test small amount synthetic acth injected amount cortisol sometimes aldosterone adrenals produce response test may cause mild side effects test used diagnose exclude primary secondary adrenal insufficiency addisons disease related addition quantifying adrenal insufficiency test distinguish whether cause adrenal low cortisol aldosterone production pituitary low acth insulin tolerance test recognized gold standard assay adrenal insufficiency due cumbersome requirement twohour test risks seizures myocardial infarction acth stimulation test commonly used easier safer though accurate test extremely sensitive specificity primary adrenal insufficiency less secondary adrenal insufficiency specificity secondary adrenal insufficiency may thus dismissed interpreters basis test additional testing may called probability secondary adrenal insufficiency particularly adrenal insufficiency potentially lifethreatening condition treatment initiated soon diagnosis confirmed sooner patient presents apparent adrenal test given lowdose short test conventionaldose short test

test rarely performed earlier testing cortisol acth levels association short test may provide necessary test given glucocorticoids adrenal extract supplement affect test results stress recently administered radioisotope scanscitation needed artificially increase levels may invalidate test results spironolactone contraceptives licorice estrogen androgen including dhea progesterone therapy may also affect aldosterone cortisol stimulation test results stimulate aldosterone consumption salt reduced minimum foods high sodium avoided hours prior testing women ideally undergo testing first week menstrual cycle aldosterone occasionally cortisol may falsely elevated luteal cycle secondary progesterone inhibition leading compensatory rise aldosterone traditionally cortisol acth levels separate lavender top tube drawn baseline time next synthetic acth another corticotropic agent injected im iv depending approximately ml heparinized venous blood collected minutes synthetic acth injection measure cortisol acth samples kept ice sent immediately laboratory whereas cortisol need kept commonly reported reactions nausea anxious sweating dizziness itchy skin redness swelling injection site palpitations fast fluttering heart beat facial flushing may also include arms torso disappear within rarely seen serious side effects include rash fainting headache blurred vision severe swelling severe dizziness trouble breathing irregular healthy individuals cortisol level increase μgdl within minutes mcg cosyntropin stimulation addisons disease cortisol aldosterone levels low cortisol rise cosyntropin stimulation testcitation needed secondary adrenal insufficiency due exogenous steroid administration suppressing pituitary production acth due primary pituitary disorder causing insufficient acth production adrenal glands atrophy time cortisol production fall patients fail stimulation testing early development secondary adrenal insufficiency adrenals may atrophied still stimulate resulting normal cosyntropin stimulation secondary adrenal insufficiency diagnosed insulin tolerance test itt crh corticotropinreleasing hormone stimulation test used distinguish hypothalamic tertiary pituitary secondary cause rarely used clinical measuring morning fasting acth level helps assess etiology adrenal insufficiencycitation needed acth usually well upper limits

happen head acth stimulation test occasionally used test adrenal production aldosterone time cortisol also help determining primary hyperreninemic secondary hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism human acth slight stimulatory effect amount synthetic acth given stimulation equivalent whole days production natural acth aldosterone response easily measured blood cortisol aldosterone double respectable base value around ngdl must fast salt hours sit upright blood draw healthy individualcitation needed aldosterone response acth stimulation test blunted absent patients primary adrenal insufficiency including addisons base value usually midteens less rise less double base value thus indicating primary hypoaldosteronism sodium low potassium renin enzyme high indicator primary adrenal insufficiency addisons diseasecitation needed aldosterone response several factors low base value factoring indicates secondary hypoaldosteronism sodium low potassium renin enzyme low usually doubling quadrupling low base aldosterone value seen secondary adrenal insufficiency decoupling aldosterone acth stimulation test possible ie ngdl stimming result doubling aldosterone may help tandem cortisol stimulation doubled confirm diagnosis secondary adrenal insufficiency rare cases aldosterone stimulation double presence low potassium low renin low acth indicates atrophy aldosterone production prolonged lack renin similar cortisol stimulation acth deficiency test interpreter may lack knowledge properly interpret secondary hypoaldosteronism think result aldosterone doubling low base value good recent data
