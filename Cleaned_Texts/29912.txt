apes including humans rarely documented fossil record hominids suite oreopithecus although less skeletally complete dryopithecus earlier afropithecus equatorius basal characters similarlyaged morotopithecus practiced orthograde locomotion probably sister apes based facial structure shortened phalanges suggest ancestral palmigrade adaptations unlikely pierolapithecus practiced much suspensory behavior however vertical climbing suspension independent abilities integral ape evolution belowbranch suspension may evolved repeatedly convergence later independently ape analysis almécija et al suggests long curved phalanges decoupled orthograde features related vertical climbing acquired find condition genus related retained pronograde plan although lumbars ribs carpals orthograde degree phalanges slight agree however many traits independently acquired leading new advances superimposed basal characters retained extended time pierolapithecus lacked adaptations suspensory hanging unlike moyàsolà et al report suggest capable adaptively although latter remains patella like extant apes dimensions typically regarded mobile knee pierolapithecus differs monkeys hylobatids basal hominoids thicker patellae derived knee might related enhanced climbing notably vertical pelvis shares ancestral template proconsul nyanzae modified orthograde behavior assuming
