mario whilst controlled pointer wii remote therefore enabling lesser experienced players enjoy development team wanted game enjoyed ages early stages development took steps ensure player would adjust game without difficulty however miyamoto thought easy lacked insensitivity asserting game loses excitement made balance difficulty koizumi suggested marios health meter maximum capacity three instead eight time mushrooms checkpoints would placed game koizumi said wanted alter games intensity factor limiting number hits player could take three opposed super mario super mario sunshine featured eight retrospectively iwata added decreasing health meter three eight representative things players notice actually changes gameplay concept gravity spherical platforms central elements gameplay development team drafted several ideas implement koichi hayashida codesigner game initially expressed scepticism incorporating spherical playing field jumpbased platform game stating would bad match shimizu also

take place space advantageous flexible enough accommodate wide range development finished team reflected fundamental part super mario game make player think fun play game rather simply finishing accomplish koizumi made sure certain areas game could enjoyed types people including children shimizu added super mario galaxys ulterior motive everybody gather around tv felt game starring mario necessarily something could enjoyed playing alone game made support six different save files shimizu liked idea one player looking progress another player seeing compared iwata stated first super
