living near coast plesiomorphic mesosaurs whereas characteristic mesosaurus living within pelagic zone derivedclarification needed evolutionary history seen first mesosaurs much like brazilosaurus form first conquering aquatic environments coasts ecca sea creatures like mesosaurus conquer life open brazilosaurus stereosternum mesosaurus many mesosaurid family including stereosternum fossil evidence seems suggest diet mainly included crustaceans evidence large amounts carapaces crustaceans within coprolites mesosaurs mainly come mangrullo formation uruguaycitation needed also evidence small mesosaurid bones within coprolites mesosaurs well suggesting cannibalism within group occur capturing fish small mesosaurs would easier catch swallow since many prey would small soft bodied animals postmolt soft bodied crustaceans would also prey stereosternum mesosaurs although little evidence fossil idea stereosternum used marginal teeth impale prey seems unlikely probably used teeth capturing mechanism quickly entrap restrain ample evidence suggest mesosaurs may oldest known amniotes displayed extended embryo retention could either oviparous viviparous within species laying
