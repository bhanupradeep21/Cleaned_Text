hygroscopy phenomenon attracting holding water molecules via either absorption adsorption surrounding environment usually normal room temperature water molecules become suspended among substances molecules adsorbing substances become physically changed eg changing volume boiling point viscosity physical characteristic property substance example finely dispersed hygroscopic powder salt may become clumpy time due collection moisture surrounding environment deliquescent materials sufficiently hygroscopic absorb much water become liquid form aqueous solution hygroscopy essential many plant animal species attainment hydration nutrition reproduction andor seed dispersal biological evolution created hygroscopic solutions water harvesting filament tensile strength bonding passive motion
