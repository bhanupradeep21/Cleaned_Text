scholarly interest process functions dreaming present since sigmund freuds interpretations neurology dreaming remained misunderstood recent distinctions however information available via modern techniques brain imaging provided new bases study dreaming brain bounds technology afforded created understanding dreaming seems everchanging even questions still remain function content dreams preliminary observations neurology dreaming reported george humphrey oliver zangwill report noted two cases brain injury resulted complete almost complete cessation dreaming patients undergone damage posterior parietal regions one involved predominately left side parietooccipital areas additional effects involved hemianopia reduced visualization waking state disturbances visual memory patients reported visual images dim hard evoke although reported two cases humphrey zangwill offered preliminary ideas neurological components dreaming specifically association forebrain areas link visual imaging ability several difficulties encountered studying subjective experiences like dreaming methodologies dream studies abound conceptual complexities limitations one significant shortcoming dream studies necessary reliance verbal reports dream event reduced verbal report account subjects memory dream subjects experience dream verbal reports also risk influenced number factors first dreams involve multiple pseudosensory emotional motoric elements dream report narrative makes capturing whole picture difficult verbal reports face difficulties like forgetting dreams reports dreams produced distinct states consciousness resulting delay dream event recall awake time lag forgetting may occur resulting incomplete report forgetting proportional amount time elapsed experience also remembering exposed interference recall stage information accessible reconstructing dream memory awake might affect accuracy recall subject may report information actually experienced sequence events may another issue difficulty verbally describing mostly visual subjective experiences like found dreams eg unreal objects bizarre experiences emotions furthermore subjects may intentionally fail report embarrassing immoral private dream experiences fear judgement results censored incomplete reports sleep laboratory environment another major source methodological issues sleep laboratories unnatural awkward environment sleeping subject may feel discomfort anxiety may make sleep difficult inferior quality wellknown first night effect complete adaptation sleep laboratory may take four days longer
