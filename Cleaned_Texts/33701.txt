somnology scientific study sleep includes clinical study treatment sleep disorders irregularities sleep medicine subset somnology invention eeg stages sleep determined harvey loomis first descriptions delta theta waves made walter dovey rem sleep discovered sleep apnea identified first clinical sleep laboratory developed first actigraphy device made krupke continuous positive airway pressure therapy uvulopalatopharyngoplasty created examination committee association sleep disorders centers american academy sleep medicine established administered sleep administrationclarification needed test american board sleep medicine created administer tests eventually assumed duties examination committee united states american board sleep medicine grants certification sleep medicine physicians nonphysicians however board allow one practice sleep medicine without medical created american academy sleep medicine assistance european sleep research society japanese society sleep research latin american sleep society international classification sleep disorders primary reference scientists diagnosticians sleep disorders separated four distinct categories parasomnias dyssomnias sleep disorders associated mental neurological medical conditions sleep disorders enough data available counted definitive sleep disorders icsd created comprehensive description sleep disorder following somnologists employ various diagnostic tools determine nature sleep disorder irregularity tools subjective sleep diaries sleep questionnaire diagnostic tools used patient asleep polysomnograph actigraphy sleep diary daily log made patient contains information quality quantity sleep information includes sleep onset time sleep latency number awakenings night time bed daytime napping sleep quality assessment use hypnotic agents use alcohol cigarettes unusual events may influence persons sleep log usually made one two weeks visiting somnologist sleep diary may used conjunction actigraphy sleep questionnaires help determine presence sleep disorder asking patient fill questionnaire certain aspect sleep daytime sleepiness questionnaires include epworth sleepiness scale stanford sleepiness scale sleep timing questionnaire epworth sleepiness scale measures general sleep propensity asks patient rate chances dozing eight different situations stanford sleepiness scale asks patient note perception sleepiness using sevenpoint test sleep timing questionnaire selfadministration test used place sleep diary questionnaire valid determinate sleep parameters bed time wake time sleep latency wake sleep actigraphy assess sleepwake patterns without confining one laboratory monitors small wristworn movement monitors record activity several weeks sleep wakefulness determined using algorithm analyzes movement patient input bed wake times sleep diary physical examination determine presence medical conditions cause sleep disorder polysomnography involves continuous monitoring multiple physiological variables sleep variables include electroencephalography electrooculography electromyography electrocardiography well airflow oxygenation ventilation measurements electroencephalography measures voltage activity neuronal somas dendrites within cortex electrooculography measures potential cornea retina electromyography used identify rem sleep measuring electrical potential skeletal muscle electrocardiography measures cardiac rate rhythm important point eeg particular always refers collective neurons firing eeg equipment sensitive enough measure single neuron airflow measurement used indirectly determine presence apnea measurements taken pneumotachography nasal pressure thermal sensors expired carbon dioxide pneumotachography measures difference pressure inhalation exhalation nasal pressure help determine presence airflow similar pneumotachography thermal sensors detect difference temperature inhaled exhaled air expired carbon dioxide monitoring detect difference carbon dioxide inhaled exhaled air monitoring oxygenation ventilation important assessment sleeprelated breathing disorders however oxygen values change often course sleep repeated measurements must taken ensure accuracy direct measurements arterial oxygen tension offer static glimpse repeated measurements invasive procedures sampling arterial blood oxygen disturb patients sleep therefore noninvasive methods preferred pulse oximetry transcutaneous oxygen monitoring transcutaneous carbon dioxide pulse transit time pulse oximetry measures oxygenation peripheral capillaries fingers however article written bohning states pulse oximetry may imprecise use diagnosing obstructive sleepapnea due differences signal processing transcutaneous oxygen carbon dioxide monitoring measure oxygen carbon dioxide tension skin surface respectively pulse transit time measures transmission time arterial pulse transit wave lattermost pulse transit time increases one aroused sleep making useful determining sleep apnea snoring detected microphone may symptom obstructive multiple sleep latency test mslt measures persons physiological tendency fall asleep quiet period terms sleep latency amount time takes someone mslt normally performed nocturnal polysomnography ensure adequate duration sleep exclude sleep maintenance wakefulness test mwt measures persons ability stay awake certain period time essentially measuring time one stay awake day test isolates person factors influence sleep temperature light noise furthermore patient also highly suggested take hypnotics drink alcohol smoke test allowing patient lie bed time lying falling asleep measured used determine ones daytime sleepiness though somnology necessarily mean sleep medicine somnologists use behavioral mechanical pharmacological means correct sleep disorder behavioral treatments tend prescribed costefficient treatments treatments include exercise cognitive behavioral therapy relaxation therapy meditation improving sleep improving sleep hygiene includes making patient sleep regularly discourage patient taking daytime naps suggesting sleep different position mechanical treatments primarily used reduce eliminate snoring either invasive noninvasive surgical procedures treating snoring include palatal stiffening techniques uvulopalatopharyngoplasty uvulectomy noninvasive procedures include continuous positive airway pressure mandibular advancement splints tongueretaining pharmacological treatments used chemically treat sleep disturbances insomnia excessive daytime sleepiness kinds drugs used treat sleep disorders include anticonvulsants antinarcoleptics antiparkinsonian drugs benzodiazepines nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics opiates well hormone melatonin melatonin receptor agonists anticonvulsants opioids antiparkinsonian drugs often used treat restless legs syndrome furthermore melatonin benzodiazepines hypnotics nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics may used treat insomnia finally antinarcoleptics help treat narcolepsy excessive daytime sleepiness particular interest benzodiazepine drugs reduce insomnia increasing efficiency gaba gaba decreases excitability neurons increasing firing threshold benzodiazepine causes gaba receptor better bind gaba allowing medication induce generally treatments given behavioral treatment failed drugs tranquilizers though may work well treating insomnia risk abuse treatments first resort sleep disorders narcolepsy require pharmacological treatment httpsenwikipediaorgwikisomnology
