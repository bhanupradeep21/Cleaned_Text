nasal cartilages structures within nose provide form support nasal nasal cartilages made flexible material called hyaline cartilage packed collagen distal portion five individual cartilages make nasal cavity septal nasal cartilage lateral nasal cartilage major alar cartilage greater alar cartilage cartilage aperture minor alar cartilage lesser alar cartilage sesamoid accessory cartilage vomeronasal cartilage jacobsons cartilage nasal cartilages associate cartilage structures nose bones facial skeleton associations create ventlike structures within nose air flow nasal cavity lungs vice versa therefore nasal cartilages structures aid body respiratory functions intake oxygen expire carbon dioxide abnormalities defects nasal cartilages affect airflow nasal cavity resulting respiratory issues surgical techniques produced adjust position repair nasal cartilages maximal airflow accomplished surgical techniques include septoplasty restructuring septal nasal cartilage upper lateral cartilage repositioning restructuring lateral nasal cartilage sliding alar cartilage restructuring major alar cartilage rhinoplasty surgical reconstruction nose increased recent popularity functional social purposes mammals also contain nasal cartilages order maintain structure function nasal cavity orientation nasal cartilages produce different shapes sizes nostrils nasal cavities part animals contain similar cartilage structures within nose vary number different cartilage structures donkeys buffalo camels variety cartilage structures analogous humans lack septal nasal cartilages instead multiple components merging together form nasal septum even though nasal cartilages differ species aid function respiratory system septal nasal cartilage flat quadrilateral piece hyaline cartilage separates nasal cavities one septal nasal cartilage fits place perpendicular plate ethmoid vomer bones also covered internal mucous membrane superior portion septal nasal cartilage attaches nasal bones inferior portion attaches alar cartilages via fibrous tissues septal nasal cartilage separates right left nasal cavities allows air pass providing two cavities generates turbulence within tight spaces allowing air flow quicker bidirectionally septal nasal cartilage also main structure provides orientation nose midline structure organ offset septal nasal cartilage nose appear crooked viewer crooked nose block airflow coming nares lungs vice lead respiratory issues due low oxygen high carbon dioxide counts within body surgical procedure correct issue called septoplasty lateral nasal cartilage winglike expansion extending septal nasal lateral nasal cartilage lies inferiorly nasal bones sitting superiorly major alar cartilage separated narrow fissure lateral nasal cartilage major alar cartilage curl upon interaction one another forming tight connection fibrous tissues like septal nasal cartilage lateral nasal cartilage composed hyaline cartilage hyaline cartilage provides form flexibility within specific structure superior portion lateral nasal cartilage fuses septum provide support within nasal cavities collapse lateral nasal cartilage inner nasal valve could become obstructed prevent movement airflow new surgical technique reposition lateral nasal cartilage constructed relieve site obstruction within inner nasal valve regain maximal airflow throughout nose upper lateral cartilage repositioning major alar cartilages positioned one structure side nasal superiorly major alar cartilages connected lateral nasal cartilage via fibrous tissues composed hyaline cartilage structures thin folded form lateral medial crus medial crus inner portion major alar cartilages situated perpendicularly septal nasal cartilage lateral crus outer portion major alar cartilages associate ala nose crus come together form oval tip nostril sides major alar cartilages merge together form notch tip referred apex nose formation medial lateral walls within nares major alar cartilages function hold open naris allows maximal airflow reach nasal valve allowing optimal respiration due weakness corresponding lateral crus certain individuals technique called sliding alar cartilage sac procedure practiced restructure support nasal minor alar cartilages small hyaline cartilage pieces sides nose sit lateral nasal cartilage major alar associated within ala nose small structures contained within dorsal part ala also known name accessory cartilage structures aid provide form strength base nares conjunction major alar cartilage vomeronasal cartilage thin piece hyaline cartilage attaches vomer extends septal nasal structure associated vomeronasal organ part accessory olfactory system associated organ plays important role sense smell lined similar epithelium olfactory region nose vomeronasal cartilage another small component nose provides strength structure emerging technological advancements reconstruction surgical techniques developed adjust lifestyle health individuals rhinoplasty one surgical practices become common modern era rhinoplastic procedures include septoplasty sliding alar cartilage upper lateral cartilage repositioning procedures aid cosmetic well functional issues involving nose reconstruction procedures produced tested knowledge nasal cartilages increase septoplasty surgical procedure straightens septal nasal cartilage within center crooked septum difficult individual breathe risk getting sinus infection increases also called deviated septum crooked nose block one sides nose affecting quality however deviated septum common always create respiratory issues respiratory issues usually occur severe cases requiring surgery surgery also permitted individuals seek cosmetic changes due moderate cases deviated septum surgery may require surgeon cut remove parts septal nasal cartilages replacing later reconstructed format allow individual receive airflow nostrils surgery fully heals months however risks correlated surgical procedure risks include change shape nose excessive bleeding vacant space septum trouble smelling blood clots need removed numbness facial region smoking also cause damage healing process septoplastic surgery upper lateral cartilage repositioning procedure done move lateral nasal cartilage blocking nasal nasal valve smallest airway within nose common site obstruction surgical procedures open air way employing grafts separate septal nasal lateral nasal cartilages one another grafts need used permanently due complications removing device upper lateral cartilage repositioning technique deploys temporary stint repositions lateral nasal cartilage lets healbe stationary due scar tissue formation removed open rhinoplastic procedure allows nose heal optimal position without permanent use manmade hardware procedure one way resolve issues involving lateral nasal cartilage deformities procedures produced improved upon order generate simplest safe surgical procedure sliding alar cartilage procedure strengthen support nasal medical practice completed greater alar cartilage order reshape structure greater alar cartilages become weak deformities creating respiratory issues medical procedures reshape greater alar cartilages use grafts cartilage resectioning sac procedure completed within two three minutes timeframe tip nose cut open greater alar cartilage manipulated preserve scroll area providing strength structure incision sutured back simple technique creates tip definition maintaining airway function procedures strengthen greater alar cartilage sac procedure gaining momentum
