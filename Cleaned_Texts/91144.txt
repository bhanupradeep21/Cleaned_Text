social psychology scientific study thoughts feelings behaviors influenced actual imagined implied presence social psychologists typically explain human behavior result relationship mental states social situations studying social conditions thoughts feelings behaviors occur variables influence social century social psychology began emerge larger field psychology time many psychologists concerned developing concrete explanations different aspects human nature attempted discover concrete causeandeffect relationships explained social interactions order applied scientific method human first published study field norman tripletts experiment phenomenon social psychological experiments later went form foundation much century social psychological findings early influential research program social psychology established kurt lewin students world war ii social psychologists mostly concerned studies persuasion propaganda us military see also psychological warfare following war researchers became interested variety social problems including issues gender racial prejudice years immediately following world war ii frequent collaborations psychologists sociologists two disciplines however become increasingly specialized isolated recent years sociologists generally focusing highlevel largescale examinations society psychologists generally focusing smallscale studies individual human growing interest topics cognitive dissonance bystander intervention aggression number conceptual challenges social psychology emerged issues ethical concerns laboratory experimentation whether attitudes could accurately predict behavior extent science could done cultural also period theory human behavior changes based situational challenged relevance self personality social psychology developed number solutions issues regard theory present ethical standards regulate research pluralistic multicultural perspectives social sciences emerged modern researchers century interested phenomena attribution social cognition social psychologists addition concerned applied psychology contributing towards applications social psychology health education law social psychology attitude learned global evaluation influences thought attitudes basic expressions approval disapproval likes dislikes example enjoying chocolate ice cream endorsing values particular political party examples people influenced multiple factors given situation general attitudes always good predictors specific behavior example person may generally value environment may recycle plastic bottle specific factors given day research attitudes examined distinction traditional selfreported attitudes implicit unconscious attitudes experiments using implicit association test iat instance found people often demonstrate implicit bias races even explicit responses profess likewise one study found interracial interactions explicit attitudes correlate verbal behavior implicit attitudes correlate nonverbal attitudes also involved several areas discipline conformity interpersonal attraction social perception persuasion active method influencing attempts guide people toward adoption attitude idea behavior rational emotive means persuasion relies appeals rather strong pressure coercion process persuasion found influenced numerous variables generally fall one five major dualprocess theories persuasion elaboration likelihood model maintain persuasion mediated two separate routes central peripheral central route persuasion influenced facts results longerlasting change requires motivation process peripheral route influenced superficial factors eg smiling clothing results shorterlasting change require much motivation social cognition studies people perceive recognize remember information much research rests assertion people think people differently nonsocial nonhuman assertion supported socialcognitive deficits exhibited people williams syndrome major research topic social cognition attributions explanations behavior either ones behavior behavior others one element attribution ascribes cause behavior internal external factors internal dispositional attribution reasons behavior caused inner traits personality disposition character ability external situational attribution reasons behavior caused situational elements second element attribution ascribes cause behavior stable unstable factors ie whether behavior repeated changed similar circumstances individuals also attribute causes behavior controllable uncontrollable factors ie much control one situation hand numerous biases attribution process discovered instance fundamental attribution error bias towards make dispositional attributions peoples actorobserver bias extension theory positing tendency exists make dispositional attributions peoples behavior situational attributions ones selfserving bias tendency attribute dispositional causes successes situational causes failure particularly selfesteem threatened leads assuming ones successes innate traits ones failures due heuristics cognitive shortcuts used make decisions lieu conscious reasoning availability heuristic occurs people estimate probability outcome based easy outcome imagine vivid highly memorable possibilities perceived likely harder picture difficult understand representativeness heuristic shortcut people use categorize something based similar prototype know numerous biases found social cognition researchers hindsight bias false memory predicted events exaggeration actual predictions becoming aware outcome confirmation bias type bias leading tendency search interpret information way confirms ones schemas generalized mental representations organize knowledge guide information processing organize social information experiences schemas often operate automatically unconsciously leads biases perception memory schemas may induce expectations lead us see something one experiment found people likely misperceive weapon hands black man white type schema stereotype generalized set beliefs particular group people incorrect ultimate attribution error stereotypes often related negative preferential attitudes behavior schemas behaviors eg going restaurant laundry known selfconcept whole sum beliefs people selfconcept made cognitive aspects called people guide processing selfreferential example athlete university would multiple selves would process different information pertinent self student would oneself would process information pertinent student taking notes class completing homework assignment etc athlete would self processes information things related athlete selves part ones identity selfreferential information relies appropriate self process react many theories perception behavior leon festingers social comparison theory posits people evaluate abilities opinions comparing others uncertain ability daryl bems selfperception theory claims internal cues difficult interpret people gain selfinsight observing social influence overarching term denotes persuasive effects people seen fundamental concept social psychology study overlaps considerably research attitudes persuasion three main areas social influence include conformity compliance obedience social influence also closely related study group dynamics effects influence strongest take place social first major area social influence conformity conformity defined tendency act think like members group identity members within group ie status similarity expertise well cohesion prior commitment accountability group help determine level conformity individual individual variations among group members play key role dynamic willing people conformity usually viewed negative tendency american culture certain amount conformity adaptive situations nonconformity second major area social influence research compliance refers change behavior due request suggestion another person footinthedoor technique compliance method persuader requests small favor follows larger favor eg asking time asking ten dollars related trick bait switch disingenuous sales strategy involves enticing potential customers advertisements lowpriced items turn unavailable order sell expensive third major form social influence obedience change behavior result direct order command another person obedience form compliance dramatically highlighted milgram study wherein people ready administer shocks person distress researchers unusual kind social influence selffulfilling prophecy prediction made causes become true example financial field widely believed crash imminent investors may lose confidence sell stock thus cause crash similarly people may expect hostility others induce hostility psychologists spent decades studying power social influence way manipulates peoples opinions behavior specifically social influence refers way individuals change ideas actions meet demands social group received authority social role minority within group wielding influence social psychologists study grouprelated phenomena behavior crowds group defined two individuals connected social groups tend interact influence share common identity number emergent qualities distinguish coincidental temporary gatherings termed social shared social identity individuals within group influences intergroup behavior denotes way groups behave towards perceive perceptions behaviors turn define social identity individuals within interacting groups tendency define oneself membership group may lead intergroup discrimination involves favorable perceptions behaviors directed towards ingroup negative perceptions behaviors directed towards groups often moderate improve decision frequently relied upon benefits committees juries groups also affect performance productivity social facilitation example tendency work harder faster presence others another important concept area deindividuation reduced state selfawareness caused feelings anonymity deindividuation associated uninhibited sometimes dangerous behavior common crowds mobs also caused disguise uniform alcohol dark environments online major area study peoples relations interpersonal attraction refers factors lead people like establish relationships cases fall love several general principles attraction discovered social psychologists one important factors interpersonal attraction similar two particular people similar two people general attitudes backgrounds environments worldviews traits likely attracted physical attractiveness important element romantic relationships particularly early stages characterized high levels passion later similarity compatibility factors become important type love people experience shifts passionate companionate robert sternberg suggested actually three components love intimacy passion two people experience three said state consummate love according social exchange theory relationships based rational choice costbenefit analysis person may leave relationship partners costs begin outweigh benefits especially good alternatives available theory similar minimax principle proposed mathematicians economists time longterm relationships tend become communal rather simply based social psychology empirical science attempts answer questions human behavior testing hypotheses careful attention research design sampling statistical analysis important social psychology whenever possible social psychologists rely controlled experimentation requires manipulation one independent variables order examine effect dependent variable experiments useful social psychology high internal validity meaning free influence confounding extraneous variables likely accurately indicate causal relationship however small samples used controlled experiments typically low external validity degree results generalized larger population usually tradeoff experimental control internal validity able generalize population external validity usually impossible test everyone research tends conducted sample persons wider population social psychologists frequently use survey research interested results high external validity surveys use various forms random sampling obtain sample respondents representative population type research usually descriptive correlational experimental control variables psychologists raised concerns social psychological research relying heavily studies conducted university undergraduates academic participants crowdsourcing labor markets amazon mechanical study david experiments used north american undergraduates subjects subset population unrepresentative population regardless method chosen social psychologists statistically review significance results accepting evaluating underlying hypothesis statistics probability testing define constitutes significant finding low less unlikely due replication testing also important ensuring results valid due chance false positive conclusions often resulting pressure publish authors confirmation bias hazard asch conformity experiments used linelength estimation task demonstrate power peoples impulses conform members small group task designed easy assess wrong answers deliberately given least oftentimes well third trials participants conformed majority even though majority judgment clearly wrong seventyfive percent participants conformed least experiment additional manipulations experiment showed participant conformity decreased least one individual failed conform increased individual began conforming withdrew also participant conformity increased substantially number incorrect individuals increased one three remained high incorrect majority grew participants three incorrect participants made mistakes time one two incorrect participants made mistakes time leon festingers cognitive dissonance experiment participants divided two groups asked perform boring task groups later asked dishonestly give opinion task rewarded according two different pay scales end study participants paid say enjoyed task group participants paid tell lie first group later reported liking task better second group festingers explanation people first group paid sufficient incentive led experience dissonance discomfort internal conflict could overcome dissonance justifying lies changing previously unfavorable attitudes task paid provided reason boring task resulted milgram experiment designed study far people would go obeying authority figure experiment showed normal american citizens would follow orders even believed causing innocent person suffer even apparently philip zimbardos stanford prison study simulated exercise involving students playing prison guards inmates attempted show far people would go role playing days guards became brutal cruel prisoners became miserable compliant initially argued important demonstration power immediate social situation capacity overwhelm normal personality subsequent research contested initial conclusions study example pointed participant selfselection may affected participants participants personalities influenced reactions variety ways including long chose remain study bbc prison study designed replicate conditions stanford study produced conclusions drastically different initial albert banduras bobo doll experiment attempted demonstrate aggression learned experiment children grouped based similar levels pretested aggressivity either witnessed aggressive nonaggressive actor interact bobo doll children placed alone room doll observed see would imitate behavior actor observed hypothesized children witnessed aggressive actor imitated behavior proceeded act aggressively towards doll male female children witnessed nonaggressive actor behaved less aggressively towards doll however boys likely exhibit aggression especially observing behavior actor gender addition boys found imitate physical aggression girls displayed verbal aggression goal social psychology understand cognition behavior naturally occur social context act observing people influence alter behavior reason many social psychology experiments utilize deception conceal distort certain aspects study deception may include false cover stories false participants known confederates stooges false feedback given participants techniques help remove potential obstacles needed practice deception challenged psychologists maintain deception circumstances unethical research strategies eg roleplaying used instead research shown roleplaying studies produce results deception studies cast doubt addition deception experimenters times put people potentially uncomfortable embarrassing situations eg milgram experiment stanford prison experiment also criticized ethical reasons virtually social psychology research modern day must pass ethical review colleges universities conducted ethics committee institutional review board examines proposed research make sure harm likely come participants studys benefits outweigh possible risks discomforts people participating furthermore process informed consent often used make sure volunteers know asked experimentclarification needed understand allowed quit experiment time debriefing typically done experiments conclusion order reveal deceptions used generally make sure participants unharmed proceduresclarification needed today research social psychology involves minimal risk greater risk harm expected normal daily activities routine psychological many social psychological research findings proven difficult replicate leading argue social psychology undergoing replication special edition social psychology focused replication studies finding number previously held social psychological beliefs difficult likewise special edition perspectives psychological science focused issues ranging publication bias nullaversion contributed replication factors identified social psychological research contributing crisis one questionable research practices identified common practices necessarily intentionally fraudulent often involve converting undesired statistical outcomes desired outcomes via manipulation statistical analyses sample sizes data management systems typically convert nonsignificant findings significant studies suggested least mild versions practices social psychologists also published fraudulent research entered mainstream academia notably admitted data fabrication diederik well allegations others fraudulent research main contributor replication many researchers attribute failure replicate result difficulty able recreate exact conditions study conducted many years ago environment people even current replication crisis several effects social psychology also found difficult replicate example scientific journal judgment decision making published several studies years fail provide support unconscious thought theory replication failures unique social psychology found many fields one
