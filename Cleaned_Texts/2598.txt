neuroscience attempts clarify neuroscientific methods results using conceptual rigor methods philosophy science list specific issues important philosophy neuroscience many methods techniques central neuroscientific discovery rely assumptions limit interpretation data philosophers neuroscience discussed assumptions use functional magnetic resonance dissociation cognitive single unit computational following descriptions many current controversies debates methods employed neuroscience many fmri studies rely heavily assumption localization functional specialization localization function means many cognitive functions localized specific brain regions good example functional localization comes studies motor seem different groups cells motor cortex responsible controlling different groups muscles many philosophers neuroscience criticize fmri relying heavily assumption michael anderson points subtractionmethod fmri misses lot brain information important cognitive subtraction fmri shows differences task activation control activation many brain areas activated control obviously important task well philosophers entirely reject notion localization function thus believe fmri studies profoundly philosophers maintain brain processing acts holistically large sections brain involved processing cognitive tasks see holism neurology modularity section one way understand objection idea localization function radio repairman thought thought experiment radio repairman opens radio rips tube radio begins whistling loudly radio repairman declares must ripped antiwhistling tube antiwhistling tube radio radio repairman confounded function effect criticism originally targeted logic used neuropsychological brain lesion experiments criticism still applicable neuroimaging considerations similar van ordens paaps criticism circularity neuroimaging according neuroimagers assume theory cognitive component parcellation correct components divide cleanly feedforward modules assumptions necessary justify inference brain localization logic circular researcher uses appearance brain region activation proof correctness cognitive theories different problematic methodological assumption within fmri research use reverse reverse inference activation brain region used infer presence given cognitive process poldrack points strength inference depends critically likelihood given task employs given cognitive process likelihood pattern brain activation given cognitive process words strength reverse inference based upon selectivity task used well selectivity brain region activation article published ny times heavily criticized misusing reverse study participants shown pictures iphones researchers measured activation insula researchers took insula activation evidence feelings love concluded people loved iphones critics quick point insula selective piece cortex therefore amenable reverse inference neuropsychologist max coltheart took problems reverse inference step challenged neuroimagers give one instance neuroimaging informed psychological coltheart takes burden proof instance brain imaging data consistent one theory inconsistent another theory roskies maintains colthearts ultra cognitive position makes challenge since coltheart maintains implementation cognitive state bearing function cognitive state impossible find neuroimaging data able comment psychological theories way coltheart demands neuroimaging data always relegated lower level implementation unable selectively determine one another cognitive theory article richard henson suggests forward inference used infer dissociation function psychological suggests kinds inferences made crossing activations two task types two brain regions change activation mutual control region one final assumption worth mentioning assumption pure insertion assumption pure insertion assumption single cognitive process inserted another set cognitive processes without affecting functioning rest example wanted find reading comprehension area brain might scan participants presented word presented nonword eg floob infer resulting difference brain pattern represents regions brain involved reading comprehension assumed changes reflective changes task difficulty differential recruitment tasks term pure insertion coined donders criticism reaction time methods recently researchers begun using new functional imaging technique called restingstate functionalconnectivity subjects brains scanned subject sits idly scanner looking natural fluctuations bold pattern subject rest researchers see brain regions covary activation together afterward use patterns covariance construct maps functionallylinked brain areas name functionalconnectivity somewhat misleading since data indicates covariation still powerful method studying large networks throughout brain couple important methodological issues need addressed firstly many different possible brain mappings could used define brain regions network results could vary significantly depending brain region chosen secondly mathematical techniques best characterize brain regions brain regions interest somewhat constrained size voxels rsfcmri uses voxels millimeters cubed brain regions defined larger scale two statistical methods commonly applied network analysis work single voxel spatial scale graph theory methods extremely sensitive way nodes defined brain regions divided according cellular architecture according connectivity according physiological measures alternatively could take theoryneutral approach randomly divide cortex partitions arbitrary size choosing mentioned earlier several approaches network analysis brain regions defined seedbased analysis begins priori defined seed region finds regions functionally connected region wig et alcaution resulting network structure give information concerning interconnectivity identified regions relations regions regions seed region another approach use independent component analysis ica create spatiotemporal component maps components sorted carry information interest caused noise wigs et al warns us inference functional brain region communities difficult ica ica also issue imposing orthogonality graph theory uses matrix characterize covariance regions transformed network map problem graph theory analysis network mapping heavily influenced priori brain region connectivity nodes edges places researcher risk cherrypicking regions connections according preconceived theories however graph theory analysis still considered extremely valuable method gives pairwise relationships nodes ica may advantage fairly principled method seems using methods important better understanding network connectivity brain mumford et al hoped avoid issues use principled approach could determine pairwise relationships using statistical technique adopted analysis gene coexpression networks cognitive neuropsychology studies brain damaged patients uses patterns selective impairment order make inferences underlying cognitive structure dissociation cognitive functions taken evidence functions independent theorists identified several key assumptions needed justify functional modularity mind organized functionally separate cognitive modules anatomical modularity brain organized functionally separate modules assumption similar assumption functional localization assumptions differ assumption functional modularity possible separable cognitive modules implemented diffuse patterns brain activation basic organization functional anatomical modularity normal humans assumption needed make claim functional organization based dissociation extrapolates instance case study population transparency subtractivity mind undergo substantial reorganization following brain damage possible remove one functional module without significantly altering overall structure system assumption necessary order justify using brain damaged patients order make inferences cognitive architecture healthy people three principal types evidence cognitive neuropsychology association single dissociation double association inferences observe certain deficits likely cooccur example many cases deficits abstract concrete word comprehension following brain damage association studies considered weakest form evidence results could accounted damage neighboring brain regions damage single cognitive single dissociation inferences observe one cognitive faculty spared another damaged following brain damage pattern indicates two tasks employ different cognitive systems b two tasks occupy system damaged task downstream spared task c spared task requires fewer cognitive resources damaged task gold standard cognitive neuropsychology double dissociation double dissociation occurs brain damage impairs task spares task b brain damage spares task patient damages task b assumed one instance double dissociation sufficient proof infer separate cognitive modules performance tasks many theorists criticize cognitive neuropsychology dependence double dissociations one widely cited study joula plunkett used model connectionist system demonstrate double dissociation behavioral patterns occur random lesions single created multilayer connectionist system trained pronounce words repeatedly simulated random destruction nodes connections system plotted resulting performance scatter plot results showed deficits irregular noun pronunciation spared regular verb pronunciation cases deficits regular verb pronunciation spared irregular noun pronunciation results suggest single instance double dissociation insufficient justify inference multiple charter offers theoretical case double dissociation logic two tasks task task b use almost systems differ one mutually exclusive module apiece selective lesioning two modules would seem indicate b use different systems charter uses example someone allergic peanuts shrimp someone allergic shrimp peanuts argues double dissociation logic leads one infer peanuts shrimp digested different systems john dunn offers another objection double claims easy demonstrate existence true deficit difficult show another function truly spared data accumulated value results converge effect size zero always positive value greater zero statistical power zero therefore impossible fully confident given double dissociation actually exists different note alphonso caramazza given principled reason rejecting use group studies cognitive studies brain damaged patients either take form single case study individuals behavior characterized used evidence group studies group patients displaying deficit behavior characterized averaged order justify grouping set patient data together researcher must know group homogenous behavior equivalent every theoretically meaningful way brain damaged patients accomplished posteriori analyzing behavior patterns individuals group thus according caramazza group study either equivalent set single case studies theoretically unjustified newcombe marshall pointed cases use geschwinds syndrome example group studies might still serve useful heuristic cognitive neuropsychological commonly understood neuroscience
