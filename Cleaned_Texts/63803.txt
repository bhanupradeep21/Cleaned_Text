cardiotocography ctg technique used monitor fetal heartbeat uterine contractions pregnancy labour machine used perform monitoring called cardiotocograph fetal heart sounds described early years ago approximately years ago mechanical stethoscopes pinard horn introduced clinical modernday ctg developed introduced early edward hon roberto caldeyrobarcia konrad hammacher first commercial fetal

continuous intermittent monitoring fetal heart rate activity uterine muscle detected two transducers placed mothers abdomen one fetal heart monitor heart rate fundus uterus measure frequency
