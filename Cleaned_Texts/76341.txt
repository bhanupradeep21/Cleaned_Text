discussed cracks difficult see clinical exam may limit diagnosis however clinical signs may lead diagnosis cts includes wear faceting indicating excessive forces perhaps clenching grinding presence isolated deep periodontal pocket may symbolise split tooth removing restorations may help visualise fracture lines carried gaining informed consent patient removing restoration may prove little diagnostic benefit tactile examination sharp probe may also aid diagnosis dyes may used aid visualisation fractures technique requires days effective temporary restoration may required structural integrity weakened method leading crack propagation transillumination best performed placing fibre optic light source directly onto tooth optimal results achieved aid magnification cracks involving dentine interrupt light transmission however transillumination may cause cracks appear enlarged well causing colour changes become invisible radiographs offer little benefit visualising cracks due fact cracks propagate direction parallel plane film mesiodistal however radiographs useful examining periodontal pulpal status different tools used carrying bite test produce symptoms associated
