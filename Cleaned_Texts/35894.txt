alligator munensis extinct species alligator quaternary thailand skull munensis discovered tentatively assigned chinese alligator recognized distinct species although two still considered close relatives pronounced anatomical differences suggest two species split one another long prior pleistocene possibly uplifting tibetan plateau miocene short robust skull may globular back teeth possibly corresponding greater amount hardshelled prey items nostrils munensis positioned much towards back skull alligators function currently known skull alligator munensis specimen discovered layer quaternary alluvium village ban si liam northeastern thailand specimen first discussed brief report claude et al tentatively referred material extant chinese alligator alligator sinensis although already noted distinct shape specimen skull need additional preparation detailed description possible darlim colleagues published research skull using ctscan data darlim colleagues able compare thailand skull material confidently assigned alligator sinensis concluding material different enough warrant placed species furthermore team concludes based fossils excavation locality yielded fossils dates least middle pleistocene greatly narrowing timeframe initially suggested claude et al proposed ranging miocene pleistocene species name alligator munensis references mun river located near site fossil species skull alligator munensis broadly triangular alligators shows remarkable level compression greatly shortens overall length head furthermore rostrum especially flattened still rather deep around level nostrils condition otherwise known altirostry region around nose raised thanks upturn nasal bones subsequently creates marked ditch behind nares observing skull profile although external nares used identify munensis member genus alligator nares separated one another nasal bones still unique compared species alligator cover third length premaxilla two thirds like species bar splits nares lot broader munensis whereas thin species furthermore internarial bar typically formed mostly nasals premaxilla contribute heavily species thailand greater contribution premaxilla also extends back nares bone wraps around participates posterior border openings entire internarial bar high partially separates nasal cavity finally subcircular rather teardropshaped nares located much back species choana also unique relative species genus almost circular sudden constriction towards back rather elliptical lacks raised rim around back several distinct ridges ornament skull alligator munensis one rostral ridge example stretches across maxilla lacrimal bone transitions pair ridges span prefrontal bones later pair ridges seen species except mcgrewi forms structure referred spectacle additional ridges seen following midlines nasals frontal bone parietal bone notably squamosals lack distinct ridges crests instead flat whereas todays chinese alligator bones raised form low alligator munensis comparably reduced dentition addition typical five teeth premaxilla possessed teeth either maxilla chinese alligators meanwhile possess maxillary teeth teeth known alveoli maxillae clearly enlarged may correlate globular blunt teeth could indicate return ancestral dentition todays generalist alligators evolved specialised type description munensis include detailed phylogenetic tree although authors mention analysis works regardless absence phylogeny darlim et al confident assigning species genus alligator based number shared traits within alligator munensis shows many similarities alligator sinensis suggesting two closely related nevertheless many derived features species indicate relationship two ancestor descendent rather may divergent entirely clear two species diverged one another alligator fossil record asia poorly studied darlim colleagues speculated origin propose ancestor sinensis munensis could inhabited lowlands housed proto yangtzexi mekongchao phraya river systems continued continental drift pushed eastern tibetan plateau miocene two river systems would separated one another consequently prevented two resulting populations interbreeding dispersing others range would caused sinensis munensis evolve isolation one another later restricted protochao phraya river later mekong river based deposits alligator munensis found may inhabited similar environments chinese alligators includes lowlands floodplains variety waterbodies including marshes ponds streams number animals found deposits munensis including softshell turtles large mammals specifically water buffalos sambar enlarged posterior maxillary tooth sockets may suggest back teeth munensis either globular blunt flattened sides seen several shortsnouted alligatoroids coupled overall robust build skull well developed attachment sites jaw musculature suggests alligator munensis strong bite suited crush prey lifestyle appeared crocodilia numerous occasions also happens ancestral state alligatorines meaning todays generalist alligators came specialised ancestry however necessarily indicate munensis specialised well appearance crushing dentition may connect even greater degree opportunism possibly response seasonally available hardshelled prey darlim colleagues point towards omnivorous bigheaded turtle consume greater quantities molluscs certain periods year broadsnouted caimans hand favor hardshelled prey yet lack enlarged posterior teeth durophages chinese alligators also lack particular adaptation ecology generally poorly function restracted nares alligator munensis unknown although similar conditions seen animals similar adaptations instance seen number secondarily marine animals like whales ichthyosaurs plesiosaurs mesosaurs jurassic metriorhynchoids distant cousins crocodilians however marine habits dismissed due locality munensis found also due fact alligators known possessed salt glands rendering indefinite habitation saltwater impossible among crown crocodilians retracted nares also seen purussaurus lesser degree siamese crocodiles well crocodylus httpsenwikipediaorgwikialligatormunensis
