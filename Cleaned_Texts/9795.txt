plasmacytoid dendritic cells pdcs rare type immune cell known secrete large quantities type interferon ifns response viral circulate blood found peripheral lymphoid organs develop bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells constitute peripheral blood mononuclear cells conducting antiviral mechanisms pdcs considered key linking innate adaptive immune systems however pdcs also responsible participating exacerbating certain autoimmune diseases like pdcs undergo malignant transformation cause rare hematologic disorder blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell bone marrow common dendritic cell progenitors expressing receptors able give rise pdcs signaling induces differentiation proliferation pdcs although mechanisms entirely understood phosphoinositide activation mechanistic target rapamycin mtor believed regulate signaling pathway transcription factor also found play key role influencing lineage commitment common dc progenitor course becoming unlike conventional dendritic cells cdcs leave bone marrow precursors pdcs leave bone marrow go lymphoid organs peripheral blood upon completing development plasmacytoid dendritic cells also distinguished cdcs ability produce significant amounts pdc maturation initiated cell comes contact virus prompting upregulation mhc class mhc class ii costimulatory molecules cc chemokine receptor interferon production gradually decreases expression prompts matured pdc migrate lymph node able stimulate interact humans pdcs exhibit plasma cell morphology express hladr bloodderived dendritic cell tolllike receptor tlr within endosomal compartments expression tlr tlr allows pdcs interact viral host nucleic acids tlr tlr detect ssrna unmethylated cpg dna sequences also expressed human pdc surfaces although signaling pathways still obscure however speculations interaction may negative regulatory effect cell interferon unlike myeloid dendritic cells myeloid antigens like present pdc surfaces furthermore pdcs express markers unlike dendritic cell blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm bpdcn rare type myeloid cancer malignant pdcs infiltrate skin bone marrow central nervous system tissues typically disease presents skin lesions eg nodules tumors papules bruiselike patches andor ulcers often occur head face upper presentation may accompanied cpc infiltrations tissues result swollen lymph nodes enlarged liver enlarged spleen symptoms central nervous system dysfunction similar abnormalities breasts eyes kidneys lungs gastrointestinal tract bone sinuses ears andor disease may also present pdc leukemia ie increased levels malignant pdc blood ie nucleated cells bone marrow evidence ie cytopenias bone marrow blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm high rate recurrence following initial treatments various chemotherapy regimens consequence disease poor overall prognosis newer chemotherapeutic novel nonchemotherapeutic drug regimens improve situation upon stimulation subsequent activation cells produce large amounts times cell type type interferon mainly ifnα ifnβ critical antiviral compounds mediating wide range effects induce maturation pdc example secretion type interferon triggers natural killer cells produce ifnγ also activating differentiation b addition produce cytokines tnfα well helping recruit immune cells site capable activating immune cells pdcs serve bridge innate adaptive immunity pdcs ability stimulate cells heightened following maturation mentioned earlier maturation also induces expression mhc class class ii molecules pdcs well allows cell optimize antigenpresenting abilities mhc class pdc surfaces able activate cells mhc class ii found activate cells pdcs also thought able promote cell activation patients suffer psoriasis typically exhibit skin lesions pdcs accumulate inhibiting pdcs secreting ifn diminished appearance skin lesions dna released via apoptosis infected host cell antibodies produced hosts dna see autoantibody antihost dna antibodies able stimulate pdcs proceed secrete ifn furthering activity adaptive although pdcs ability mass produce type interferon effective targeting viral infection also lead systemic lupus erythematosus regulated properly type interferon production strongly correlated progression lupus thought drive excessive maturation pdcs activation b cells among many effects patients lupus pdc levels circulating blood decreased pdcs migrated toward inflamed affected mass production type interferon may result positive negative outcomes response hiv although type interferon efficient facilitating maturation pdcs killing infected cells excessive clearance infected cells may detrimental effects weaken patients compromised immune pdcs infected hiv also capable sensing viral markers ssrna impaired interferonproducing however seems hiv pdcs lose interferon secreting properties also die expediting progression decreases functional live uninfected pdcs resulted decreases cells compromise patients immune defenses hiv thus maintaining balance regulation pdc activity crucial positive prognosis hiv reduced numbers pdcs age associated increased severity possibly cells
