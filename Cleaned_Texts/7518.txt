formally genus name argentinadraco derived argentina plus suffix draco latin word dragon species name barrealensis reference locality lake size argentinadraco difficult estimate preserved segment lower jaw measures mm long symphysis lower jaw likely long taking jaws total length life external cortical bone thin bones jaw thoroughly fused characterizes argentinadraco relatively derived specialized top margin lower jaw straight like members bottom margin symphysis deep mm tall rear becomes shallower front making markedly concave sets argentinadraco apart members azhdarchoidea entire bottom margin blunt thickened also unusually small crest along concave portion bottom margin developed crests top surface symphysis bordered blunt outer margins unlike sharp margins separated narrow depression depression becomes concave shelf back jaw unusually flanked pair welldeveloped ridges inset actual outer margins ridges separated outer margins narrow depressions toothless pterosaurs simple flattened concave surface shallow pit fossa back symphysis caused ending two segments caupedactylus although toothless clearly places argentinadraco dsungaripteroidea sensu kellner specifically within azhdarchoidea precise classification within group elusive lower jaws thalassodrominae chaoyangopteridae azhdarchidae tend either similar radically divergent within group proportions least front portion lower jaw argentinadraco resembles azhdarchid zhejiangopterus chaoyangopterids chaoyangopterus argentinadraco bears differences however three groups jaw robust shorter quetzalcoatlus azhdarchids deep rear end blunt ridges top surface also separate thalassodromines chaoyangopterids thalassodromine tupuxuara crest bottom margin shallow depression top surface kellner calvo tentatively assigned argentinadraco azhdarchidae based provenance may instead represent entirely new group difficult nevertheless argentinadraco confidently excluded pteranodontidae nyctosauridae tapejarinae groups toothless dsungaripteroid pterosaurs back symphysis argentinadraco deep like pteranodontids deepest point forward shelf symphysis also inclined downwards instead arched pteranodontids twosegment ending symphysis known pteranodontids either nyctosaurids additional shelf symphysis top margin lower jaw curves finally argentinadraco downturned lower jaw steplike upper margin deep crest characterize jaw much less study describing javelinadactylus wellnhopterus recovered argentinadraco closely related thalassodromine study since conversely study focused aerotitan recovers chaoyangopterid closely related unusually elaborate combination ridges depressions top surface lower jaw argentinadraco suggests lower jaw interlocked upper jaw way meanwhile inferred depth rear symphysis suggests strong bite forces kellner calvo speculatively suggested argentinadraco used peculiar jaw slice loose sediment rivers lakes environment potentially feeding small invertebrates crustaceans interpreted lifestyle consistent terrestrial feeding habits diverse assemblage animals recovered futalognko quarry represents continental deposit deposited humid environment represents
