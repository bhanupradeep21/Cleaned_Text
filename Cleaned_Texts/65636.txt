general incentives anything persuade person alter behavior desired emphasized incentives matter basic law economists laws behavior state higher incentives amount greater levels effort therefore higher levels incentive powerful tool influence certain desired behaviors action often adopted governments incentives broadly broken two categories intrinsic incentives extrinsic overall types incentives powerful tools often employ increase effort higher performance according law behavior incentives studied area personnel economics economic analysts take part human resources management practices focus firms make employees motivated pay career concerns compensation performance evaluation motivate employees best achieve firms desired performance intrinsic incentive person motivated act certain way personal satisfaction without seeking external reward facing external pressure perform instance singer enjoys singing may intrinsically motivated spend several hours day improve performance without receiving recognition awards often intrinsic incentives useful increasing ones empowerment utility level autonomy reinforce employees work involvement intrinsic incentives extrinsic incentives important driving peoples behavior experts believe intrinsic incentives stronger motivators compared extrinsic incentives increase employees work engagement genuine enjoyment however peoples intrinsic motivation tends decrease offered many extrinsic rewards order maintain action constant incentives provided known overjustification effect types incentive fundamental concept economics play crucial role motivating behavior extent influence individual may depend varies factors factors consider may include type activity incentivized individuals personal values goals context incentive offered welldesigned incentive system take account avoid unintended consequences ensure align desired outcomes parties oppose benefits using extrinsic incentives believe cause harm good opponents believe constant use extrinsic incentives lead crowding intrinsic incentives also valuable performance people constantly incentivized external pressures neglect intrinsic motives could consequently detrimental work employees become comfortable consistently gaining reward acting manner consistent interests firm result employees begin believe deserve earn rewards certain things benefit firm rather benefit leads shirking extrinsic incentive offered return high nonetheless incentives intrinsic extrinsic beneficial altering persons behavior effectively used executed within many different areas life including workforce education within ones personal classified david callahan types incentives broken three broad classes according different ways motivate agents take particular course monetary incentives form financial good given someone incentivize actions align incentives principal provides monetary type extrinsic incentive commonly seen workplace effect monetary incentive broken two categories standard direct price effect indirect psychological effect two types monetary effect often work opposite direction crowd incentivised however several studies suggested possible manage crowdingout effects utilising principalagent model incorporates nonstandard instance monetary incentive may come forms profit sharing bonuses stock options even paid vacation time wellchosen monetary incentive programs produce positive motivation influence productivity output individuals common monetary incentive system used firms performancebased pay incentives paid based employees productivity output particular period time methods commissionbased employee example salesperson receives payment directly correlated output level firms also pay additional wages rewards employees work overtime additional work firm expectations expectancy theory implies provided employees place sufficient value monetary incentive justify extra effort perceive greater effort result better performance incentives motivate employees maintain high levels effort discourage shirking turn increases individual productivity workers overall productivity monetary incentives less direct awarding periodic discretionary bonuses top performers offering possibility promotion higherpaying position profit sharing team alternatively firms also incentivize employees perform threatening demote terminate poor employees feel careers jeopardy likely increase efforts monetary incentives affect effort average performance employees likely dependent scope job task variables routine jobs clerical administration jobs mundane presence monetary incentives encourage employees demonstrate consistent effort diligence intrinsic incentive exhausted hand task assigned challenging monetary incentives make little difference increasing employees contribution effect monetary incentives depend framing rewards example cadaveric organ donation funeral aids perceived ethical particularly showing gratitude honoring deceased donor potentially increase donation willingness direct cash payments monetary nonmonetary incentives act impactful reward system employees superior performance independent predetermined refer use rewards benefits directly related money financial compensation motivate individuals perform specific actions achieve desired outcomes use nonmonetary incentives based recognition individuals motivated range factors beyond financial rewards acts reinforcement encourage work engagement examples incentives include extra paid holidays recognition praise opportunity personal professional growth gifts family benefits even workbased perks interesting projects work individual may motivated sense purpose desire personal fulfillment growth need social recognition status nonfinancial factors providing types incentives tend boost employees job satisfaction feel appreciated efforts lower turnover rates compared monetary incentives studies shown employees find nonmonetary incentives memorable separated normal pay hence addition nonmonetary incentives known promote longterm commitment loyalty among effective use nonmonetary incentives positively influence employees perception companys image well increase morale compared monetary incentives nonmonetary incentives hold stronger longerlasting influence employees motivation results higher utility employees higher job satisfaction morale found better overall performance contribution hence higher another advantage nonmonetary incentives allows positive work culture emphasizes cooperation teamwork social responsibility however nonmonetary incentives also limitations undesirable instance less effective motivating individuals primarily motivated monetary incentives financial rewards may especially true individuals lowpaying jobs face significant financial stress insecurity another concern nonmonetary incentives may difficult quantify evaluate monetary may create several challenges firm organisation design implement effective incentive programs aligned goals objectives overall monetary nonmonetary incentives important tools influence individual organizational behavior monetary incentives may effective individuals contexts nonmonetary incentives equally effective promoting longterm commitment fostering positive work culture promoting social responsibility ultimately effective incentive programs likely incorporate combination monetary nonmonetary incentives create positive comprehensive approach motivation performance economic analysis incentives focuses systems determine incentives needed agent achieve desired outcome dictated incentives help companies link employees rewards productivity firm wants employees produce certain amount output must prepared offer compensation scheme monetary bonus persuade employees reach target compensation must achieve two goals first reduce employee turnover retain highest performing productive employees compensating employees help attract workers work harder retain ability second improve productivity compensation stimulate ability workers produce output also improve enthusiasm employees work thus promoting business rise pay variance across firm reflects increased demand highly productive workers therefore compensation begun shifting towards helps employees recognize direct relationship work output reward incentive become one powerful tool motivate influence certain behaviour action also unintended recent research indicated extensive intrinsic come conflict motivation example poorly designed incentive system potentially lead unintended behaviours actions individuals companies gaming system earn rewards without actually achieving desired outcomes known principalagent problem incentives principal eg government company align incentives agent eg individuals employees incentive conflicts lead adverse selection moral moral hazard refers situation particular party engage risky behaviour fails bear full costs risk hand adverse selection occur asymmetric information different parties adverse selection often creates incentive plans inefficiently distorts benefits incentive bring conflicts parties involve effective management plan required resolve incentive conflicts misaligned incentive refers situation goals different parties involved particular situation firm system aligned may even conflict misaligned incentives potentially arise many contexts government policies healthcare education environmental regulations principals within firm want agents work principals best interests agents often different goals due problem misaligned incentives firms must design compensation plans induce workers act firms best interest generate level output maximizes firms problem asymmetric information means principal know exactly motivate agents act firms best interests consequently compensation plans difficult firms principalagent theory used guiding framework aligning incentives employees effort obtain efficient level output example manager may want certain level output employee know capabilities employee presence imperfect monitoring achieve best outcome optimal incentive scheme must designed motivate worker increase research shows principal offers high incentive agent also recompense higher however relationship informal advantage usually exists among agents principal moral hazard could present principals unable know sure agents giving delegated task adverse selection could exist principals usually insufficient knowledge agents capabilities face difficulties selecting agent best suited instances principals contradicting goals agents agents would incentive shirk leak information competing selfinterested agents may also want maximize interest lying deliberately hiding information principal decrease board directors company plays important role creating incentives ceos best interest aligns shareholders ceos given incentives many forms including salary bonuses shares stock options reward spectacular performance penalties imposed unsatisfactory performance ensure ceos appropriately incentivized ceos made substantial owners companys stock board directors ceos portion companys stock incentive work towards common best interest company shareholders threat dismiss ceos unsatisfactory performance also act incentive reinforce performance ceos turn maximize companys value possibility dismissal increase ceos accountability actions considering possible dismissal would likely lead poor reputation result potential increase work engagement performance apart monetary incentives nonmonetary incentives also play part increasing work performance ceos nonmonetary incentives introduced form benefits power public acknowledgement prestige title however argue nonmonetary incentives less impactful tournament theory describes framework compensation based individuals position within firms theory demonstrates individuals promoted basis absolute performance output instead based performance relative employees position within ceteris paribus larger difference compensation one position next greater incentive exert effort order achieve however incentive diminished size firm therefore potential candidates promotion increases firms must address risk relative compensation scheme could incentivize uncooperative behavior amongst coworkers accordingly firms encounter tradeoff incentivizing workers increase efforts increasing pay variance promoted unpromoted hand minimizing disharmony amongst coworkers maintaining level pay employees know abilities competitiveness risk attitudes potential employers due asymmetric information firms design incentives enhance employees motivation act interests firm maximize output also influence type quality workers known selfselection sorting effect incentives example empirical studies shown firms implement payforperformance rather fixed wage compensation schemes tend attract productive workers less risk greater risk aversion reduces workers willingness work variable opposed fixed accordingly firms may use incentives method filtering low productivity workers workers lack personal characteristics firms searching production increasingly organized around teams many large teamwork may enhance company productivity firms encounter multidimensional complex problems firm may able solve complex task requires high level various different skills assigning expert workers complementary due constantly advancing technologies seldom individual employee absolute advantage across skills required solve complicated problems firms face hence team collaboration crucial beneficial ensure success individualized incentives said dysfunctional interdependent working environment individual performance difficult firms may opt teambased incentives instead teambased incentive refers incentive system rewards employees based performance teambased incentives described beneficial companies individualbased incentives paying straight piece rate individual employees would little motivation help incentives receive irrespective result others hand paying team incentives based team output promote cohesiveness trust cooperation support within researchers found positive relationship teambased incentive employees work efficacy stability well company research shows employees prefer individualbased incentives teambased incentives due reasons firstly believe teambased incentives prone unfairness employees contributions may discouraged seeing employees contributed less receiving level moreover team expands effect team incentives weakens employees struggle establish clear link effort given incentives also inevitable team incentives could induce freerider problem employees motivation maximize individual output could managers may need offer team incentive strong enough ensure workers individual payoff exerting level effort allows company maximize profits greater individual payoff free riding efforts team using game theory illustrate firms need implement teambased incentive results value game greater enforce punishment freeriding makes value x less would ensure team members dominant strategy game work hard nash equilibrium work hard work hard contrast studies shown peer pressure employees intrinsic incentive perform well team environment may mitigate freerider problem associated teambased case studies demonstrate team incentives increase firm productivity settings involve complex interdependent production peer pressure intrinsic incentives outweigh selfish peer rating system also introduced team members rate others contribution task research findings show imposing penalty free riders useful decreasing tendency free incentives arguably beneficial increasing productivity however also adverse effect evident ratchet effect firm may use observation employees output level first employed guide set performance standard objectives knowing employee may deliberately reduce output level first employed hide ability produce higher output intent exploiting rewarded future strategically increase output best performances employees limited thus ratchet effect significantly diminish production levels firm planned additionally psychologists began exploring relationship extrinsic intrinsic motivation whilst economists simultaneously studying crowdingout effects monetary incentives came result richard titmuss publication gift relationship explained constant use extrinsic incentives result conflict intrinsic motivators lead desired behavior crowded publication titmuss argued use monetary incentives disrupting social norms around idea voluntary contribution would ultimately crowdingout effect acknowledged incentives large enough likely offset crowdingout effects least short run incentives offered however titmuss noted making incentives large could also adverse effect due possibility negative inferences drawn size crowdingout effects also occur temporary incentives removed long run workplace complete removal extrinsic incentives result employee effort levels lower incentives offered thereby hindering motivation incentives always effective aligning employees incentives example corporate policies popular aimed encourage productivity led failures result unintended moreover providing stock options intended boost ceo productivity offering remunerative incentive align ceos interests shareholders improve company however ceos found either make good decisions resulted reward longterm price increase stock found fabricated accounting information give illusion economic success retain incentivebased furthermore found extremely costly firms incentivize ceos stock options nevertheless firms forced pay substantial amounts money ensure ceos act best interest incentives bipolar effect company one hand companys incentives employees may create pay gap example lowpaid employees may reduce production contribution company lowpaid employees highpaid employees may able communicate cooperate effectively causing lowpaid employees gradually lose enthusiasm firms provide fair amount incentives lowpaid employees incentives lowpaid workers breaks rather monetary incentives motivating employees financial rewards may make difference thats company profitable first year may plenty bonuses hand employees however company makes less money second year first year company may able give employees bonuses first year even though put effort also reduces employees motivation work therefore incentives may counterproductive firm provide types incentives rather monetary incentives promotion vacation breaks highperforming employees comes volunteering activities monetary incentives bring negative effects according selfperception theory humans constantly seek explanations individuals involved volunteering activities likely perceive prosocial altruistic attach symbolic price act monetary reward attached otherwise prosocial activity volunteering people may perceive originally altruistic actions linked extrinsic causing selfimage prosocial motivation crowdingout effect leads decrease individuals desire volunteer people eventually stop contributing due rewards attached example monetary incentives offered voluntary blood donation negative effect number people donating extrinsic incentives offered unmotivated students potentially positive shortrun effects however use extrinsic incentives education opposed basis morally corrupt potential crowd intrinsic incentives educational furthermore scarce empirical evidence support success monetary incentives awarded educational outputs academic achievement opposed educational inputs attendance dynamic effects incentives evident context education studies demonstrated impact monetary incentives dependent previous academic performance individual monetary incentives tend improve academic results highability students adverse effect performance students lower ultimately always potential conflicts arise short long run application incentives different areas incentives seek change behaviors crowdout intrinsic motivators growing pool evidence suggests economists must broaden focus exploring effects incentives effect largely dependent designed specifically interact intrinsic social motivators short run long httpsenwikipediaorgwikiincentive
