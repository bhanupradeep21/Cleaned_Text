tact term bf skinner used describe verbal operant controlled nonverbal stimulus object event property object maintained nonspecific social reinforcement less technically tact label example child may see pet dog say dog nonverbal stimulus dog evoked response dog maintained praise generalized conditioned reinforcement youre right dog chapter five skinners verbal behavior discusses tact depth tact said make contact world refers behavior control generalized reinforcement controlling antecedent stimulus nonverbal constitutes portion whole physical tact described skinner includes three important related events known stimulus response consequence case verbal response occasioned presence stimulus say ball presence ball scenario ball likely reinforced listener saying cat showing importance third event reinforcement relation stimulus ball response ball although stimulus controls response verbal community establishes stimulus control verbal response speaker example child may say ball presence ball stimulus childs parent may respond yes ball reinforcement thereby increasing probability child say ball presence ball future hand parent never responds child saying ball presence ball probability response decrease future tact may pure impure example environmental stimulus evokes response tact would considered pure tact evoked verbal stimulus resulting tact would considered impure example child shown picture dog emits response dog would example pure tact child shown picture dog given verbal instruction response dog would considered impure tact extended generic metaphorical metonymical solecistic nomination guessing tact also involved abstraction lowe horne harris randle would one example recent work tacts tact said capable generic extension generic extension essentially example stimulus generalization novel stimulus contains relevant features original stimulus example may see red car say car well see white car say car different makes models cars evoke response tacts extended metaphorically case novel stimulus defining features original stimulus example describe something exploding taste drawing common property explosion response eaten something perhaps strong response sudden tacts undergo metonymical extension irrelevant related feature original stimulus controls response metonymical extension one word often replaces another may replace part whole example saying refrigerator shown picture kitchen saying white house place controlling variables unrelated standard immediate reinforcement take control tact said solecistically extended malapropisms solecism catachresis examples skinner notes things like serial order conspicuous features object may come play nominative tacts proper name may arise result tact example house haunted becomes haunted house nominative extension tact guess may seemingly emission response absence controlling stimuli skinner notes may simply tact subtle hidden controlling variables although always case something like guessing landing side coin toss possible alternatives fixed subtle hidden stimuli control skinner deals factors interfere change generalized reinforcement conditions turn affect verbal behavior may depend largely entirely generalized reinforcement children developmental disabilities tacts may need intensive training procedures factors deprivation emotional conditions personal history may interfere change verbal behavior skinner mentions alertness irrelevant emotional variables special circumstances surrounding particular listeners speakers etc refers conditions said produce objective subjective responses example would look motivating operationsestablishing conditions emersion conditions tacts frequently however children disabilities intensive training procedures often distorted stimulus control may minor description tact slight exaggeration stronger conditions distortion may appear original stimulus absent case response called lie skinner notes troubadours fiction writers perhaps motivated similar forms tact distortion initially may recount real events differential reinforcement affects account may see distortion total often individuals autism developmental disabilities language delays difficulty acquiring novel tacts many researchers field verbal behavior developmental disabilities examined intensive training procedures order teach tacts individuals specific types prompts used order make tact response likely example asking student question would example impure tact used prompt correct tact response prompt faded learner emit pure tact echoic prompts teacher repeats correct answer learner must echo also used train tact responses kodak clements found echoic training sessions tact training effective increasing independent tact skinner suggested verbal operants functionally independent meaning teaching one verbal operant individual may able emit topographically response different stimulus conditions example child may able request water may able tact water researchers currently examining procedures may facilitate generalization across verbal operants studies indicated example teaching child mand items could tact well without direct instruction multiple studies found support emergence tact responses without direct teaching procedures especially important individuals autism developmental disabilities learner gain additional skills without direct instruction time mand psychology
