allelomimetic behavior allomimetic behavior range activities performance behavior increases probability behavior performed nearby animals allelomimetic behavior sometimes called contagious behavior strong components social facilitation imitation group coordination usually considered occur members species alternate definition allelomimetic behavior intense frequent response initiation already known response others around individual engaged often referred synchronous behavior mimetic behavior imitative behavior social facilitation allelomimetic behavior displayed animals occur stage life usually starts young behavior continue throughout life especially individual living large group emphasizes group cohesion seen prerequisite group living synchronous activity crucial social however animals large cohesive groups face tradeoffs allelomimetic behavior adopted behavior adopted risk predation capture decreases significantly interindividual competition immediate resources food mates space increase cohesion still many collective group decisions animals result allelomimetism explained allelomimetic behaviors examples cockroaches choosing single aggregation site schooling behaviors fishes pheromonebased path selection ants allows workers go path specific food allelomimetic behavior also seen animal welfare indicator example cattle enough room lie simultaneously indicates enough resources present result lameness animals forced allomimicry affected circadian rhythms circadian cycles activity within groups give overall appearance poor animal welfare allomimetic behavior used welfare indicator must measured several times throughout course mechanisms involved performing allelomimetic behavior require circadian rhythms function decisions individual level often enough encourage patterns allelomimetic behavior vary species species possibly explain behaviors seen animal kingdom group cohesion social animals often benefit behaving similar manner others within group means animals switch behaviors eg lying grazing degree synchrony beneficial sometimes synchrony provided environmental cues times provided group members clayton wrote environmental stimuli provide gross synchrony socially facilitated behavior provide finerscale synchrony functionally important greater cohesion social group synchronous behavior also threatened animals mixedsex herd differing nutritional physical necessities causes group instability often splits herd two separate groups generally male female recreate mimetic behavior smaller samesex group similar needs synchronized allelomimetic behavior also affected many factors age general group size sex space resource availability domestication also seen threat allelomimetic process domestication removes many threats like predation food shortages competition many individuals breeding providing basically unlimited food resources providing protection outside predators domestication may favour less synchronization animals provide adaptation mimetic behavior save energy domesticated domestication also changes interindividual distances animals behavioral synchrony general important antipredator strategies horses like many animals learn imitation parents often mother broodmare owner foal broodmare available foal paired mother mimic mares walking style speed also mimic mares temperament general foal spend much early life around mare unstable temperament irrational fears difficult work would grow unstable adult would develop behavioral abnormalities balking miller also adds behavioral issues also removed allelomimetic processes balking common behavior horses mules occur insecurities fears observed hesitance general fear moving forward due possibility attack invasion personal space behavior eliminated owner fearless looking forward head raised high marching place shows horse nothing fear eventually horse mimic owners behavior sync gate owner follow repeating behavior needed eventually allow horse fully incorporate owners fearless behavior repertoire prevent balking reoccurring bad habits also learned mimicry vast majority animals present specific habitcribbing example one habit foal raised environment abnormal behavior performed older members team mimic habit well even behavior dangerous individuals however mimetic behavior produces bad habits help remove well broodmare unable train offspring falls owner properly train foal proper walking gait speed normal behaviors owner spends enough time foal keeping proper stance ie erect unmoving torso flexed knees walking foal mimic perform proper movements rest sheep provide good basis evaluation allelomimetic behavior due large group sizes social behavior using experimental subject allows determination imitative quality intensity allelomimetic behavior within specific herd merino sheep ovis aries prey species domesticated breed sheep require healthy balance predator avoidance foraging space individual achieve balance spreading forage period time quickly running back centre herd creating fastpacking fastpacking event specifically individual outskirts herd changes behavior grazing running moves towards centre herd fastpacking

activation inactivation rates generally strongly presented males compared females increase number individuals performing activity increase good indication imitation present example herd majority individuals active likelihood another random individual becoming active increases goes herd majority individuals inactive experiments events specific singular spot caused external stimuli would warrant alarm response sheep experiment performed gautrais members sex often performed mimetic behavior compared members mixedsex gautrais also focused behavioral synchrony activity inactivity since cohesion group involves individuals active inactive time rather syncing every activity another even absence animals individuals switch behaviors require activity inactivity digestion inactivity good promote digestion hunger outweighing need rest gautrais believes physiological need prompted first individual herd experiment switch activity inactivity vice versa members herd follow however number individuals heard decreases option perform mimetic behavior also decreases creates higher rate spontaneous switching activity inactivityrelated behaviors contrast larger herd likely mimetic behaviors occur spontaneous switching behavior occurring herd leader members following suit brief period due number conspecifics present given time herd small group fewer conspecifics gives less opportunity imitation occur given individual higher rate switching inactivity activity inactivity two ideas proposed original running individual recruit others running group herd whole coordinate stop running fastpacking events first idea initiation inhibition packing event based allelomimetic effects local interactions second idea close enough distance herd neighbours stop running conclusions stem idea optimization processes sheep individual level allows balance exploring much space possible avoid competition food keeping contact herd members avoid predation reinforce herd cohesion optimization processes adjust allelomimetic interaction strengths individuals ensure necessities synchronous behavior displayed cattle typically thought discussing allelomimetic behavior necessary resources survival food water shelter sufficient cattle display postural synchrony lying standing members herd phenomenon also referred social facilitation occurs freerange cattle live pastures cattle live primarily barns social facilitation allelomimicry first two main ideas behind cattle mimicking others behavior herd acts synchronously whether lying standing grazing according stoye porter one member herd alter behavior ie standing lying vice versa nearest neighbor mimic behavior behavior travel across herd members performing one stoye porter also noted likely cow display behavior nearest neighbor compared randomly selected cow behavior continues despite appearance free individual grazestand lie even herd stationary second idea behind synchronized behavior called concurrent combined response dictates collective behavior mere coincidence individual animals decision change behavior based external discovery food internal exhaustion need restfood similar daily schedules members human example concurrent behavior rush hour many people driving time due similar schedule others others already driving decide well previous studies identified artificial synchronization dairy cattle behavior consistent milking feeding creates similar daily schedule cattle follow turn creates collective behavior members specific milking feeding times according stoye porter cattle synchronous night least synchronous afternoon intermediately synchronous could due cattle milked similar times morning feeding similar times night scheduled activity perform afternoon dogs one common species produce allelomimetic behavior go noticed humans studies conducted across several breeds dog regarding eating habits stress vocalization alone littermates many results shown dogs eat large groups compared eat coined social facilitation eating specific certain breeds study conducted compton scott dogs studied ate groups majority trials overall group consumption together larger summation food consumption dog eating pups considered foodsatiated would eat food even dish front would resume eating hungry littermate introduced room believed since everything addition hungry littermate held constant increased appetite foodsatiated pup caused presence hungry pup allelomimetic behavior allelomimetic behavior occurs dogs develops directly experiences occur critical period scotts proposed theory social motivation theory social facilitation eating rely heavily allelomimetic behavioral system occurs animals isolation large stressor many dogs result separation anxiety left alone others extended lengths time critical period development puppy separated littermates home pen owners critical period produce intense negative emotional reaction reaction subside return littermates home pen reaction natural conditioned learning paradigm constantly repeated infancy remove intensity response housed littermates individual strongly motivated mimic behavior animals around introducing littermates experience severe negative emotion isolation one ways avoid negative reactions isolation individual question provides base mimetic behavior occur pup experiencing severe negative emotions begin mimic behavior littermates adopt neutral scott bronson replicated study originally conducted fredericson vocalization rates beagle puppies confined box alone fredericson found puppies would vocalize significantly less confined another puppy compared alone result replicated confirmed scott bronson many dogs distressed placed alone unfamiliar environment compared known environment unfamiliar environment littermates increase calm behavior multiple littermates unfamiliar environment caused allelomimetic behavior one pup calm many dogs mimic behavior creating litter relaxed dogs likewise one distressed pup many dogs could also mimic distressed behavior former common among allelomimetic behavior often affected domestication lead evolution new social behaviors subtle changes current social thought domestication would reduce level allelomimetic behavior animals due removal many important factors create mimicries predation food pressures competition species members since need worry possible predation lack resources domesticated environment allelomimetic behaviors seen nondomesticated species evolved adaptation domestication became new normal mimetic behaviors incorporated antipredator strategies mating strategies became unnecessary use behaviors experiment conducted eklund jensen using ancestor domesticated chickens red junglefowl domesticated breed white showed allelomimetic behavior prominent used frequently nondomesticated red junglefowl compared white leghorn likely due chance predation starvation lack shelter playing role producing allelomimetic behaviors total synchronization occurred species comforting behaviors perching dust activities outside comfort behavior little mimetic behavior domesticated white leghorn interindividual distances presented chickens perching larger nondomesticated perching red junglefowl occurred frequently mimetic white leghorn social behavior red junglefowl also affected allelomimetism behaviors feather pecking synchronized white difference feeding synchrony also appeared females versus males females likely mimic females eating behaviors compared mixedsex group males mimicking httpsenwikipediaorgwikiallelomimeticbehavior
