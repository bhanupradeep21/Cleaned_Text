small intestine small bowel organ gastrointestinal tract absorption nutrients food takes place lies stomach large intestine receives bile pancreatic juice pancreatic duct aid digestion small intestine metres feet long folds many times fit abdomen although longer large intestine called small intestine narrower diameter small intestine three distinct regions duodenum jejunum ileum duodenum shortest preparation absorption small fingerlike protrusions called villi jejunum specialized absorption lining enterocytes small nutrient particles previously digested enzymes duodenum main function ileum absorb vitamin bile salts whatever products digestion absorbed jejunum length small intestine vary greatly short metres feet long ft also depending measuring technique typical length living person length depends tall person length taller people generally longer small intestine measurements generally longer death bowel approximately centimetres inch diameter newborns weeks gestational cm diameter adults abdominal xrays small intestine considered abnormally dilated diameter exceeds ct scans diameter cm considered abnormally surface area human small intestinal mucosa due enlargement caused folds villi microvilli averages square metres sq small intestine divided three structural parts jejunum ileum suspended abdominal cavity mesentery mesentery part peritoneum arteries veins lymph vessels nerves travel within small intestine receives blood supply celiac trunk superior mesenteric artery branches aorta duodenum receives blood coeliac trunk via superior pancreaticoduodenal artery superior mesenteric artery via inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery two arteries anterior posterior branches meet midline anastomose jejunum ileum receive blood superior mesenteric branches superior mesenteric artery form series arches within mesentery known arterial arcades may several layers deep straight blood vessels known vasa recta travel arcades closest ileum jejunum organs three sections small intestine look similar microscopic level important differences parts intestine follows protein coding genes expressed human cells genes expressed normal genes specifically expressed duodenum genes expressed small intestine corresponding specific proteins expressed glandular cells mucosa fatty acid binding protein specifically expressed genes small intestine also expressed duodenum example

digestion takes place many digestive enzymes act small intestine secreted pancreas liver enter small intestine via pancreatic duct pancreatic enzymes bile gallbladder enter small intestine response hormone cholecystokinin produced response presence nutrients secretin another hormone produced small intestine causes additional effects pancreas promotes release bicarbonate duodenum order neutralize potentially harmful acid coming stomach three major classes nutrients undergo digestion proteins lipids fats carbohydrates digested food able pass blood vessels wall intestine either diffusion active transport small intestine site nutrients ingested food absorbed inner wall mucosa small intestine lined simple columnar epithelial tissue structurally mucosa covered wrinkles flaps called circular folds considered permanent features mucosa distinct rugae considered nonpermanent temporary allowing distention contraction circular folds project microscopic fingerlike pieces tissue called villi latin shaggy hair individual epithelial cells also fingerlike projections known microvilli functions circular folds villi microvilli increase amount surface area available absorption nutrients limit loss said nutrients intestinal fauna villus network capillaries fine lymphatic vessels called lacteals close surface epithelial cells villi transport nutrients lumen intestine capillaries amino acids carbohydrates lacteals lipids absorbed substances transported via blood vessels different organs body used build complex substances proteins required body material remains undigested unabsorbed passes large intestine absorption majority nutrients takes place jejunum following notable exceptions small intestine supports bodys immune presence gut flora appears contribute positively hosts immune system peyers patches located within ileum small intestine important part digestive tracts local immune system part lymphatic system provide site antigens potentially harmful bacteria microorganisms digestive tract sampled subsequently presented immune small intestine complex organ large number possible conditions may affect function small bowel listed common people affected time lives others vanishingly rare small intestine found tetrapods also teleosts although form length vary enormously species teleosts relatively short typically around one half times length fishs body commonly number pyloric caeca small pouchlike structures along length help increase overall surface area organ digesting food ileocaecal valve teleosts boundary small intestine rectum marked end digestive tetrapods ileocaecal valve always present opening colon length small intestine typically longer tetrapods teleosts especially herbivores well mammals birds higher metabolic rate amphibians reptiles lining small intestine includes microscopic folds increase surface area vertebrates mammals develop true boundaries duodenum jejunum ileum somewhat vague even humans distinctions either ignored discussing anatomy animals essentially small intestine nonteleost fish sharks sturgeons lungfish instead digestive part gut forms spiral intestine connecting stomach rectum type gut intestine relatively straight long fold running along inner surface spiral fashion sometimes dozens turns valve greatly increases surface area effective length intestine lining spiral intestine similar small intestine teleosts
