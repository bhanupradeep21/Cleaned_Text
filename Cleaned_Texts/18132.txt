alveolar bone loss closely associated periodontal disease periodontal disease inflammation gums studies osteoimmunology proposed models alveolar bone loss one model states inflammation triggered periodontal pathogen activates acquired immune system inhibit bone coupling limiting new bone formation another model states cytokinesis may inhibit differentiation osteoblasts precursors therefore
