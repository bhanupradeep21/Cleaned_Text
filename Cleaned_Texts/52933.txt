infarction sli one type silent stroke usually shows identifiable outward symptoms thus termed silent stroke clinical diagnosis defined clinical symptoms debate whether sli considered strokes even though pathophysiology presumably samecitation needed individuals sli often completely unaware stroke type stroke often causes lesions surrounding brain tissue visibly detected via neuroimaging techniques mri computed axial tomography ct scan silent strokes including silent lacunar infarctions shown much common previously thought estimated prevalence rate eleven million per year united
