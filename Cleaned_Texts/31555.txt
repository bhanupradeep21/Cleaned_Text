metachirality stronger form chirality applies objects systems chiral identical mirror image addition mirror image symmetry group differs symmetry group original object many familiar chiral objects like capital letter z embedded plane metachiral symmetry group capital letter z embedded plane consists identity transformation rotation half turn case mirror image symmetry group particular asymmetric objects identity transformation symmetry like human hand metachiral since mirror image also asymmetric general twodimensional objects bounded threedimensional objects metachiral example metachiral object infinite helical staircase helix handedness either left right like screw thread whereby differs mirror image infinite helical staircase however symmetries screw operations combination translation rotation symmetry group mirror image infinite helical staircase also contains screw operations opposite handedness hence symmetry groups differ note however symmetry groups isomorphic space groups metachiral nice example metachiral spatial structure also known triamond featured bamboozle mathematical stereochemistry article stub help wikipedia expanding ithttpsenwikipediaorgwikimetachirality
