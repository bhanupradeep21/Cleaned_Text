communication privacy management cpm originally known communication boundary management systematic research theory developed sandra petronio cpm theory aims develop evidencebased understanding way people make decisions revealing concealing private information suggests individuals maintain coordinate privacy boundaries limits willing share various communication partners depending perceived benefits costs information disclosure petronio believes disclosing private information strengthen ones connections others better understand rules disclosure relationships negotiating privacy boundaries petronio uses boundary metaphor explain privacy management process privacy boundaries draw divisions private information public information theory argues people disclose private information depend rulebased management system control level accessibility individuals privacy boundary governs selfdisclosures disclosure made negotiation privacy rules two parties required distressing sense boundary turbulence arise clashing expectations privacy management identified preexisting expectations breached intentionally unintentionally mental image protective boundaries central understanding five core principles petronios cpm petronios communication privacy management cpm theory built altmans dialectical conception privacy process opening closing boundary altman taylors social penetration theory focused selfdisclosure primary way develop close relationships however altman believed openness one part belonging larger whole one expanded include privacy leslie baxters work relational dialectics petronio first developed theory called communication boundary management renamed communication privacy management underscoring disclosure private crux theory content concealing revealing private information petronio favored term private information term selfdisclosure many caveats inherent private information disclosure present firstly motivations behind sharing many including limited sharing burden righting wrong influencing since private information others decision private share plays part taking idea boundaries decision share ultimately left process privacy rule management system combines rules coordination information characteristics disclosure attributes nature boundaries confidant fully committed handle private information abiding original owners privacy someone shares access private information based lose information someone seeks private understand cpm theory important follow metaphor boundary private boundaries division private information public private information shared collective boundary private information remains individual disclosed boundary called personal boundary individuals private information protected boundaries permeability boundaries everchanging boundaries relatively permeable easy cross relatively impregnable rigid difficult cross individuals private information protected individuals boundaries permeability boundaries everchanging allow certain parts public access certain pieces information belonging individual sharing private information risky decision puts owner information vulnerable position therefore rules surrounding boundaries must negotiated protect shared private information shared coowners must coordinate boundaries privacy disclosure based boundary permeability boundary linkage boundary petronio describes mutual boundary coordination coowners drawing borders map around shared piece means easy process considering owner approach information distinct viewpoints referencing personal criteria privacy rule development often boundaries coordinated well maintain level privacy exposure desired owners leads problems known boundary turbulence coordination shared boundaries key avoiding oversharing boundaries unclear owners may come conflict one another turbulence among coowners caused rules mutually understood coowners management private information comes conflict expectations owner happen number reasons boundary turbulence caused mistakes uninvited party overhearing private information causing weak boundary linkage disclosure owner might make influence alcohol drugs disclosure new party intent happens coowners feel expectations maintaining boundaries violated addition boundary turbulence occurs coowner intentionally breaks coordinated boundary privacy disclose private example intentional disclosure would daughter revealing doctor father indeed active smoker father told doctor longer smokes heart surgery daughter case must weigh risks breaking family privacy boundary benefits doctor better informed fathers condition lastly boundary turbulence also occur preexisting rules situation example emergence social media particular facebook boundary rules established parents began join facebook friend children children felt turbulence perception privacy invasion parentchild cases boundary turbulence coowners information feel expectations violated lose trust coowners cases goal party reduce turbulence reestablishing coordinating turbulence doesnt always negative outcome studies show turbulence within relationships lead stronger improved boundary violations boundary turbulence used learning opportunity individuals renegotiate existing boundaries better form new boundaries similar boundary turbulence experienced differently individual reactions violations depend many new boundary linkages created many new people private information reaches factors determine whether boundary turbulence cause distress relationship learning communication privacy management theory understands information well boundaries something owned owner must decide whether willing confidant ie coowner malparida piroba information cases preferable owner another person share private information though may case confidant coownership information characterized two things heavy responsibility knowledge rules particular disclosure however ownership felt different degrees understanding disclosure rules different owner owner also act sharing coupled along realization boundaries expanded may never return original state responsibility coowners decide make clear information shared others sometimes confidentiality agreement instance barber shop sharing life story person cutting hair may feel much pressure hold end disclosure agreement since barley know however counselor bound law leak private information risk breach petronio views boundary management rule based process individual decision rulebased management system allows management individual collective levels system depends three privacy rule management regulate process revealing concealing private information privacy rule characteristics boundary coordination boundary turbulence characteristics privacy rules divided two sections attributes development privacy rule attributes refer people obtain rules privacy understand properties normally done social interactions boundaries rules put test rules set different social situations dictate type disclosure made example difference disclosure family members birthday party versus office event work petronio asserts situation come set rules managing privacy learned time development privacy rule characteristics criteria implemented decide information communication privacy management theory general lists criteria following decision criteria category definition example five criteria personal group privacy rules developed disclosure private information necessitates inclusion others within boundary knowledge demands understanding parties coordinate ownership knowledge petronios understanding argument privacy management rests idea dialectic exists wherever decision made disclose conceal private information thus costs benefits must weighed consideration must given information owned used definition dialectic petronio borrows found leslie baxter barbara montgomerys theory relational dialectics wherein various approaches contradictory impulses relational life discussed theory focuses idea two contradictory stances within relationship weighed using multiple validate effectiveness feasibility communication privacy management theoretical frameworks petronio tested using different methods including limited qualitative quantitative approaches helped researchers translate research practice different fields enabled cpm applied across different contexts primarily include family communication particular focus parental privacy invasions online social media health relational work specific applications cpm highlight

another way family communication uses cpm child bearing lack thereof childlesscouples choose disclose voluntarily want children another way cpm pregnancy loss due miscarriage could unique cpm case family setting couples often manage information jointly decide whether share miscarriage people outside dyad research found couples frame miscarriage shared distinct experience members exert rights ownership information couples privacy rules centered issues social support others need know loss even though couples described privacy rules implicitly understood also recalled explicit conversations develop rules discuss management coowned information improve communication maintain recent researchers apply cpm investigate privacy management online blogging facebook usage online dating

information online functions differently disclosing private information face face mediated nature social media means harder control sees information information spread thus harder control boundaries linkage trust risk management become important factors sharing information social media continues develop become essential part everyday life younger audiences attuned much information surveillance surveillance family schools potential employers means individuals cant fully control boundaries coowners private information implications shared individuals present since facebook one popular social media platforms many researchers employed communication privacy management theory theoretical framework examine individual boundary management practices privacy concerns selfdisclosure important platform sandra petronio together researchers used cpm study young adults tendencies manage privacy communicate facebook different generations family number respondents participated survey concerning online offline facebook communication family members study found young adults share information mainly siblings followed parents finally grandparents another case study analyzing responses participants revealed communication privacy practices individuals using facebook strongly impact amount depth one study explored colleagues professional context respond friend requests study provided

expectations individuals anothers non verbal communication though dealing physical proximity see relation expectancy violations theory cpm pertains privacy close allow another come us physical intimate proximity requires boundaries crossed permeated social penetration theory explains two individuals grow intimacy move one level next relationships popular idea behind social penetration individual like onions layers go deeper intimate become intimacy occur safely say private information needs shared exchanged one boundaries permeated become coowned finally coordinated management meaning explains people establish rules creating interpreting meaning similar cpm coordinated management meaning stages coordination achieved achieved partially achieved similarly boundary ownership boundary turbulence boundary linkage moreover order achieve meaning needs exchange information individuals decipher exchange private information falls directly cpm communication privacy management theory utilizes sociocultural communication tradition within interpersonal context employs positivistic interpretive approach altman speaks values theory advances thinking incorporating different levels combinations participants communication processes altman whereas earlier research theorizing privacydisclosure focused dyads individuals complicated set dynamics carefully enunciated petronio petronio also describes communication within families family members outsiders within outside work social groups many combinations individuals dyads others within across social boundaries addition analysis privacydisclosure turbulence breaches desired communication patterns articulate researchers questioned whether cpm theory truly dialectical nature argued cpm takes dualistic approach treating privacy disclosure independent one another able coexist tandem rather dynamic interplay characteristic dialectics accusation dualistic thinking might result theorys use terms balance equilibrium early versions cpm theory petronio argues cpm focused balance psychological sense instead cpm argues coordination others advocate optimum balance disclosure privacy alternative theory claims shifting forces range privacy disclosure people handle making judgments degrees emphasis original privacy publicness wish experience given interaction pp thus petronio argues legitimate call cpm theory dialectical nature boundary ownership discussed throughout theory remedy provided break boundary ownership rules addition cpm offer ways negotiate boundaries two parties must done mutually
