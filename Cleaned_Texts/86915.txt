domestic cat originated neareastern egyptian populations african wildcat felis sylvestris lybica family felidae living feline species belong arose ten eleven million years ago divided eight major phylogenetic lineages felis lineage particular lineage domestic cat member number investigations shown domestic varieties cats come single species felis lineage felis catus variations lineage found world recently scientists hard time pinning exactly region gave rise modern domestic cat breeds scientists believed one incident led domesticated cat multiple independent incidents different places led breeds complications arose fact wildcat population whole widespread similar one another variations wildcat interbreed freely one another close contact blurring lines recent dna studies advancement genetic technologies better understanding dna genetics whole helped make discoveries evolutionary history domestic cat archaeological evidence documented earlier dates domestication formerly believed current taxonomy tends treat f silvestris f lybica f f bieti different species study feline mitochondrial dna microsatellites approximately cats many different regions including africa azerbaijan kazakhstan mongolia middle east showed genetic lineages wildcat lineages included study showed african wildcat f lybica included domesticated cats wild cats group almost indistinguishable domesticated along dna analysis phylogenetic studies also conducted narrow evolutionary history phylogenetic trees generated based mitochondrial dna analysis study bayesian maximum likelihood parsimony maximum likelihood trees produced identical results show f ornata f cafra f lybica closely related common ancestor also showed group variations monophyletic meaning share common ancestor shared groups trees also helped show f lybica gave rise domesticated cats today f silvestris showed early branching away groups still shares early common ancestor rest domesticated cats neareastern egyptian populations f lybica former gathered around human agricultural colonies latter bc seems mainly attractive behavioral traits started spreading neolithic times become widespread old world classical newer study moves earlier origin southwest study compares many cat genomes tiger dog genomes genomic regions selection domestic cats include involved neuronal processes fear reward behavior homologous recombination increased recombination frequency addition kit mutations responsible whitespotted phenotype blotched tabby cat trait aminopeptidase q mutation arose middle ages wildtype cats mackerel scientists also used archaeological behavioral studies help solidify discovery fs lybica common ancestor domesticated cats fragments teeth bone found burial sites across globe connected dna analysis fs lybica dating far back years ago originally egyptian populations credited early domestication cats approximately years ago archaeological evidence also disputed hypothesis archaeologists working cyprus found even older burial ground neolithic site approximately years old adult human buried cats native area means tribe must brought cats established residence island finding suggests people middle eastern region old world began keeping cats thousands years earlier behavioral analysis fs silvestris european wildcat thought also common ancestor domesticated cats showed significant differences two fs silvestris tendency timid aggressive even raised starting kittens around human population group also territorial showed aggressive behavior within species well hybrids domesticated cats silvestris showed less aggressive behavior docile temperament leading scientist believe behavioral difference genetic likely due difference evidence suggests fs lybica likely common ancestor domesticated cats today unlike domesticated animals bred different physical traits help tasks food hunting security modern cat breeds originated mostly within last years breeding physical traits differentiation aesthetic also different domesticated mammals domesticated cat breeds genetic differences wild counterparts due constant intermixing thousands years genetic exchanges directions genes control physical characteristics hair color pattern differentiate modern wildcat population domesticated domesticated cat breeds also unique fact genetically distinct breeds domesticated animals anywhere genetically distinct five cat breeds recognized association london today cat fanciers association cfa recognizes breeds international cat association tica recognizes breeds defined phenotypic visible characteristics single gene traits found low moderate levels nonpedigree cat characteristics rare seen common house cat unlike pet dogs come mixture purebreed lineages cats started mixture many wildcat variations selectively bred humans certain traits lead modern breeds allowed large increase number breeds shorter amount time also reason associations classify cat breeds use word pedigreed domestic cats true purebred dna studies conducted connect pedigree lines freely bred random studies conducted using techniques mentioned mitochondrial dna microsatellites examined find common ancestor cat breeds found originated eight different regions selectively bred multiple times throughout history relocated multiple times leading approximately modern breeds eight lineages include europe egypt
