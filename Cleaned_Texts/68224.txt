researchers curries classification north american troodontid material single species troodon formosus became widely adopted paleontologists specimens called stenonychosaurus referred troodon scientific literature early century however concept late cretaceous north american troodontids belong one single species began questioned soon curries paper published including currie currie colleagues noted believed judith river troodontids formosus troodontid fossils formations hell creek formation lance formation might belong different species george olshevsky assigned lance formation fossils first named pectinodon bakkeri later synonymized troodon formosus species troodon bakkeri several researchers including currie reverted keeping dinosaur park formation fossils separate troodon inequalis stenonychosaurus zanno colleagues reviewed convoluted history troodontid classification late cretaceous north america followed longrich treating pectinodon bakkeri valid genus noted likely numerous late cretaceous specimens currently assigned troodon formosus thorough review specimens required holotype formosus single tooth renders troodon nomen evans colleagues discussed undiagnostic nature holotype troodon formosus suggested stenonychosaurus used troodontid skeletal material dinosaur park later year aaron j van der reest currie came similar conclusion evans colleagues also split much material assigned stenonychosaurus new genus varricchio colleagues disagreed evans colleagues citing stenonychosaurus used thirty years since currie colleagues synonymized troodon indicated troodon formosus remains proper name conclusion varricchio agreed upon sellés colleagues description varricchios comments later addressed cullen colleagues review dinosaur park formation biodiversity noted stenonychosaurus indeed used years curries original hypothesis subjective synonymy based tooth jaw morphology never directly tested given later research found teeth diagnostic family level troodontids curries original hypothesis therefore supported available data regardless amount time since originally suggested description complete skeletal material ie containing dental frontal postcranial elements tied holotype could allow direct testing synonymy hypothesis reaffirmed given lack supporting evidence synonymy troodon stenonychosaurus maintained merely remaining untested years
