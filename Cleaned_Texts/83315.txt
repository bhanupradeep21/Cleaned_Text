subfornical organ sfo one circumventricular organs name comes location ventral surface fornix near interventricular foramina foramina monro interconnect lateral ventricles third ventricle like circumventricular organs subfornical organ wellvascularized like circumventricular organs except subcommissural organ sfo capillaries fenestrations increase capillary sfo considered sensory circumventricular organ responsive wide variety hormones neurotransmitters opposed secretory circumventricular organs specialized release certain noted capillaries subregions within sfo thus lack barrier circumventricular organs except subcommissural organ contain fenestrated feature distinguishes parts sfo divided six anatomical zones based capillary topography two zones coronal plane four zones sagittal central zone composed glial cells neuronal cell bodies high density fenestrated conversely rostral caudal areas lower density mostly made nerve fibers fewer neurons glial cells seen
