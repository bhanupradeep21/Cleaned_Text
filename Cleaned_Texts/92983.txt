speakers addressees languages organize parts speech classes according functions positions relative parts languages instance make basic distinction group words prototypically denotes things concepts

countable nouns belonging particular type particular shape instance japanese general noun classifier humans nin ‰∫∫ used counting humans whatever trees would linguistics study internal structure complex words processes words formed called morphology languages possible construct complex words built several morphemes instance english word unexpected analyzed composed three morphemes un expect morphemes classified according whether independent morphemes socalled roots whether cooccur attached morphemes bound morphemes affixes classified according position relation root prefixes precede root suffixes follow root infixes inserted middle root affixes serve modify elaborate meaning root languages change meaning words changing phonological structure word example english word run past tense ran process called ablaut furthermore morphology distinguishes process inflection modifies elaborates word process derivation creates new word existing one english verb sing inflectional forms singing sung verbs derivational form singer noun derived verb agentive suffix languages differ widely much rely morphological processes word formation languages example chinese morphological processes grammatical information encoded syntactically forming strings single words type morphosyntax often called isolating analytic almost full correspondence single word single aspect meaning languages words consisting several morphemes vary degree morphemes discrete units many languages notably indoeuropean languages single morphemes may several distinct meanings analyzed smaller segments example latin word bonus good consists root bon meaning good suffix us indicates masculine gender singular number nominative case languages called fusional languages several meanings may fused single morpheme opposite fusional languages agglutinative languages construct words stringing morphemes together chains morpheme discrete semantic unit example language turkish example word evlerinizden houses

tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq means yet said going hunt reindeer word consists morphemes tuntussurqatarniksaitengqiggteuq meanings reindeerhuntfuturesaynegationagainthirdpersonsingularindicative except morpheme tuntu reindeer none morphemes appear many languages use morphology crossreference words within sentence sometimes called agreement example many indoeuropean languages adjectives must crossreference noun modify terms number case gender latin adjective bonus good inflected agree noun masculine gender singular number nominative case many polysynthetic languages verbs crossreference subjects objects types languages single verb may include information would require entire sentence english example basque phrase ikusi nauzu saw past tense auxiliary verb nauzu similar english agrees subject expressed n prefix object expressed zu suffix sentence could directly transliterated see another way languages convey meaning order words within sentence grammatical rules produce new sentences words already known called syntax syntactical rules language determine sentence english love meaningful love notnote syntactical rules determine word order sentence structure constrained constraints contribute example english two sentences slaves cursing master master cursing slaves mean different things role grammatical subject encoded noun front verb role object encoded noun appearing verb conversely latin dominus servos vituperabat servos vituperabat dominus mean master reprimanding slaves servos slaves accusative case showing grammatical object sentence dominus master nominative case showing latin uses morphology express distinction subject object whereas english uses word order another example syntactic rules contribute meaning rule inverse word order questions exists many languages rule explains english phrase john talking lucy turned question becomes john talking john talking latter example may used way placing special emphasis thereby slightly altering meaning question syntax also includes rules complex sentences structured grouping words together units called phrases occupy different places larger syntactic structure sentences described consisting
