gleason grading system used help evaluate prognosis men prostate cancer using samples prostate biopsy together parameters incorporated strategy prostate cancer staging predicts prognosis helps guide therapy gleason score given prostate cancer based upon microscopic cancers higher gleason score aggressive worse prognosis pathological scores range higher numbers indicating greater risks higher mortality system widely accepted used clinical decision making even recognised certain biomarkers like expression might yield higher predictive value future disease histopathologic diagnosis prostate cancer implications possibility methodology gleason example recommended signetring adenocarcinoma urothelial carcinoma prostate scoring discount foamy cytoplasms seen foamy gland total score
