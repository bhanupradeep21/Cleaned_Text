solid black plumage color refers plumage pattern chickens gallus gallus domesticus characterized uniform black color across feathers chicken breeds typical plumage color black australorp sumatra whitefaced black spanish jersey giant others many breeds different color varieties also extended black variety leghorn minorca wyandotte orpington langshan color important feature living organisms wild color great significance affecting survival reproductive success species environmental constraints lead specific colors birds animals strong individuals novel colors tend survive domestication mankind transformed species involved thus freed environmental pressures large extent early color variants mostly selected utility reasons religious practices recent centuries color varieties created purely ornament pleasure fashion playing surprisingly large part development bewildering array colors patterns found domestic occurrence solid nearly solid colored black plumage widespread among avian species phenotypes result mostly single mutations associated increase eumelanin case domestic fowl two genetically different black plumage phenotypes described chicks black plumage varieties also black black beaks legs dorsal side toes varying degree white grayish white ventral surface tip naked eye length black chicks also shorter color juvenile plumage frequently show one white feathers entire surface pure black due presence eumelanin pigmentation parts feathers considerable extension black pigment shanks beaks head hackle back saddle sickles wing bows may beetlegreen purple sheen
