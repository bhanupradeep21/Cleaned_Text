bayesian inference statistical tool applied motor learning specifically adaptation adaptation shortterm learning process involving gradual improvement performance response change sensory information bayesian inference used describe way nervous system combines sensory information prior knowledge estimate position characteristics something environment bayesian inference also used show information multiple senses eg visual proprioception combined purpose either case bayesian inference dictates estimate influenced whichever information certain person uses bayesian inference create estimate weighted combination current sensory information previous knowledge prior illustrated decisions made tennis someone plays familiar opponent likes serve ball strikes sideline ones prior would lead one place racket sideline return serve however one sees ball moving may appear land closer middle court rather completely following sensory information completely following prior one would move racket location sideline suggested prior point eyes indicate ball land another key part bayesian inference estimate closer physical state suggested sensory information senses accurate closer state prior sensory information uncertain prior extending tennis example player facing opponent first time would little certainty hisher previous knowledge opponent would therefore estimate weighted heavily visual information concerning ball position alternatively one familiar ones opponent playing foggy dark conditions would hamper sight sensory information would less certain ones estimate would rely heavily previous knowledge bayes theorem states language bayesian statistics p b displaystyle pab probability given b called posterior p b displaystyle pba p displaystyle pa likelihood prior

variances displaystyle p displaystyle p respectively variance measure uncertainty variable equation indicates higher uncertainty sensory information causes previous knowledge influence estimate vice versa rigorous mathematical bayesian descriptions available many motor tasks exhibit adaptation new sensory information bayesian inference commonly studied reaching adaptation studies often involve person reaching target without seeing either target hisher hand instead hand represented cursor computer screen must move target screen cases cursor shifted small distance away actual hand position test person responds changes visual person learns counteract shifts moving hisher hand equal opposite distance shift still moves cursor target meaning developed prior specific shift cursor shifted new different distance persons reaching hand person reaction consistent bayesian inference hand moves distance old shift prior new shift sensory new shift cursor large cloud dots instead one dot shown figure persons sensory information less clear less influence reacts prior supports bayesian idea sensory information certainty greater influence persons adaptation shifted sensory feedback form adaptation holds true shift small compared distance person reach hit target person reaching target cm away would adapt cm shift cursor bayesian however target cm away cm shift cursor position visual information would recognized person would realize visual information accurately show hand position instead person would rely proprioception prior knowledge move hand target humans also adapt changing forces force field person reaches changes slightly modifies force maintain reaching straight line based partly prior force applied earlier relies prior prior shift less variable certain bayesian inference also applied way humans combine information changes environment multiple senses without consideration prior knowledge two senses strongest influence humans reaching adaptations vision proprioception typically proprioception weight vision adapting hand position depth direction moving toward away person reaching vision weight vertical horizontal however changing conditions alter relative influence two senses example influence vision adapting hand depth increased hand passive proprioception influence hand moreover vision reduced eg darkness proprioception influence determining hand result consistent bayesian inference one sense becomes uncertain humans increase reliance another sense additionally bayesian inference found play part adaptation postural control one study example subjects use wii balance board surfing task must move cursor representing center pressure cop wii surfer got visual information hisher cop clouds dots similar one shown reaching section larger clouds surfers uncertain less able move cop target screen result consistent bayesian inference bayesian mathematical models provide best predictions cop motion perhaps moving cop accurately mechanically difficult reaching therefore extent postural movement described bayesian inference yet clear adaptation shifted feedback also occurs walking running people walking foot different treadmill belt adapt step length one belt begins moving faster additionally runners able alter maximum ground reaction force leg acceleration see graph peak leg however date studies determined humans adapt gates using bayesian inference adaptation studies support application bayesian inference motor learning one study reaching force field found rather influenced prior developed hundreds previous reaches adaptation subsequent reaches influenced recent people reaching force field adapted shifts amount force exerted arm adaptation affected shift force immediately previous reach welldeveloped prior knowledge shifts occurred throughout previous trials experiment appears conflict application bayesian inference adaptation bayesian adaptation proponents argued particular study required participant reaches enough develop reaching studies show evidence bayesian inference participants typically perform reaches indicates bayesian inference used adaptation limited much previous
