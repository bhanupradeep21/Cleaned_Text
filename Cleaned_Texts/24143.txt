semicircular canals three semicircular interconnected tubes located innermost part ear inner ear three canals lateral anterior posterior semicircular canals part bony labyrinth periosteumlined cavity petrous part temporal bone filled perilymph semicircular canal contains respective semicircular duct ie lateral anterior posterior semicircular ducts provide sensation angular acceleration part membranous filled endolymph semicircular canals component bony labyrinth right angles contain respective semicircular duct one end semicircular ducts dilated sac called membranous ampulla twice diameter ducts ampulla contains ampullary crest crista ampullaris consists thick gelatinous cap called cupula many hair cells superior posterior semicircular ducts oriented vertically right angles lateral semicircular duct angle horizontal plane orientations ducts cause different duct stimulated movement head different planes one duct stimulated movement planes lateral semicircular duct detects angular acceleration head head turned anterior posterior semicircular ducts detect vertical head movements head moved head changes position endolymph ducts lags behind due inertia acts cupula bends cilia hair cells stimulation hair cells sends message brain acceleration taking place semicircular canals open vestibule five orifices one apertures common two among species mammals size semicircular canals correlated type locomotion specifically species agile fast jerky locomotion larger canals relative body size move lateral semicircular canal also known horizontal external semicircular canal shortest three canals movement fluid within duct corresponds rotation head around vertical axis ie neck words rotation transverse plane occurs example one turns head side side yaw axis measures mm arch directed horizontally backward laterally thus semicircular canal stands right angles two ampullated end corresponds upper lateral angle vestibule oval window opens close ampullated end anterior

sensory input experiences rotary movements oriented along pitch roll yaw axes lateral semicircular canal oriented yaw axis anterior semicircular canal oriented pitch axis posterior semicircular canal oriented roll axis duct filled fluid called endolymph contains motion sensors within fluids base duct enlarged opening utricle dilated sac one end called membranous ampulla within ampulla mound hair cells supporting cells called crista ampullaris hair cells many cytoplasmic projections apical surface called stereocilia embedded gelatinous structure called cupula head rotates duct moves endolymph lags behind owing inertia deflects cupula bends stereocilia within bending stereocilia alters electric signal transmitted brain within approximately seconds achieving constant motion endolymph catches movement duct cupula longer affected stopping sensation specific gravity cupula comparable surrounding endolymph consequently cupula displaced gravity unlike otolithic membranes utricle saccule macular hair cells hair cells crista ampullaris depolarise stereocilia deflect towards kinocilium deflection opposite direction results hyperpolarisation inhibition lateral semicircular duct

enters turn hair cells semicircular ducts stimulated telling brain aircraft pilot longer moving straight line rather making banked turn pilot sustain constant rate turn endolymph would eventually catch ducts cease deflect cupula pilot would longer feel aircraft turn pilot exits turn semicircular ducts stimulated make pilot think turning opposite direction rather flying straight level response pilot often lean direction original turn attempt compensate illusion serious form called graveyard spiral rather pilot leaning direction original turn may actually reenter turn endolymph stabilizes
