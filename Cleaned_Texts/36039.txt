term phonation slightly different meanings depending subfield phonetics among phoneticians phonation process vocal folds produce certain sounds quasiperiodic vibration definition used among study laryngeal anatomy physiology speech production general phoneticians subfields linguistic phonetics call process voicing use term phonation refer oscillatory state part larynx modifies airstream voicing one example voiceless supraglottal phonations included definition phonatory process voicing occurs air expelled lungs glottis creating pressure drop across larynx drop becomes sufficiently large vocal folds start oscillate minimum pressure drop required achieve phonation called phonation threshold pressure humans normal vocal folds approximately cm motion vocal folds oscillation mostly lateral though also superior component well however almost motion along length vocal folds oscillation vocal folds serves modulate pressure flow air larynx modulated airflow main component sound voiced phones sound larynx produces harmonic series words consists fundamental tone called fundamental frequency main acoustic cue percept pitch accompanied harmonic overtones multiples fundamental according theory resulting sound excites resonance chamber vocal tract produce individual speech sounds vocal folds oscillate sufficiently close one another sufficient tension much tension pressure drop across larynx sufficiently linguistics phone called voiceless phonation speech voiceless phones associated vocal folds elongated highly tensed placed laterally abducted compared vocal folds fundamental frequency main acoustic cue percept pitch varied variety means large scale changes accomplished increasing tension vocal folds contraction cricothyroid muscle smaller changes tension effected contraction thyroarytenoid muscle changes relative position thyroid cricoid cartilages may occur larynx lowered raised either volitionally movement tongue larynx attached via hyoid addition tension changes fundamental frequency also affected pressure drop across larynx mostly affected pressure lungs also vary distance vocal folds variation fundamental frequency used linguistically produce intonation tone currently two main theories vibration vocal folds initiated myoelastic theory aerodynamic two theories contention one another quite possible theories true operating simultaneously initiate maintain vibration third theory neurochronaxic theory considerable vogue since largely discredited myoelastic theory states vocal cords brought together breath pressure applied cords remain closed pressure beneath subglottic pressure sufficient push apart allowing air escape reducing pressure enough muscle tension recoil pull folds back together pressure builds cords pushed apart whole cycle keeps repeating rate cords open close number cycles per second determines pitch aerodynamic theory based bernoulli energy law fluids theory states stream breath flowing glottis arytenoid cartilages held together action interarytenoid muscles pushpull effect created vocal fold tissues maintains selfsustained oscillation push occurs glottal opening glottis convergent pull
