right hemisphere brain damage rhd result injury right cerebral right hemisphere brain coordinates tasks functional communication include problem solving memory deficits caused right hemisphere brain damage vary depending location individuals right hemisphere damage exhibit deficits visual processing appears though able recognize parts picture symbol etc rather seeing image whole shown experiment patients right hemisphere damage draw made small triangles attempted recreate image depicted small triangles countered patients left hemisphere damage able draw left small triangles made addition right hemisphere damage difficulty changing perception whole pertaining image focus one particular whole hard time changing perception incorporating another whole new information presented phenomenon called inference revising individuals right hemisphere damage therefore experience deficit areacitation needed patients right hemisphere brain damage commonly difficulties attention perception learning memory recognition expression emotion frequently occurring though slightly less common deficits include reasoning problem solving awareness also common patients right hemisphere damage flat affect lack emotional expression speaking additionally patients commonly difficulty recognizing peoples emotions expressed facial expressions tone lack ability recognize emotion suggests individuals impaired theory mind ability recognize thoughts feelings others outside ones self although deficits alone may complicate therapy patient may also exhibit anosognosia ignorance due possible anosognosia common patients become frustrated upset unable complete tasks previously able unlike people aphasia speech patterns individuals right hemisphere damage typically characterized word finding problems paraphasias circumlocutions impaired phonological processing circumlocution persons rhd tends center around general concepts specific words example describing brought rhdaffected individual hospital though patient would likely remember word stroke specific words describe situation rhd impairment discourse level cognitive processes would likely prevent describing situation coherent syntax rhdaffected individuals tends accurate varied unlike people aphasia tend difficulty word retrieval addition people right hemisphere damage usually understand literal meaning statements linguistically cases rhd patients seem syntactic deficits typically result problems semantic study eisenson observed looseness verbalization rhdaffected individuals noting right hemisphere damage appears affect relatively abstract language formulations according eisenson evidence right hemisphere likely controls super extraordinary language function words rhd patients trouble higherlevel language tasks relating semantic lexical processing less common daytoday average describing semantic deficits persons right hemisphere damage distinction must drawn convergent divergent semantic processing tasks involving convergent semantic processing relatively straightforward linguistic tasks number responses limited involve straightforward meanings words nearly difficult rhd patients tasks involving divergent semantic processing tasks elicit wide range meanings may diverge single semantic concept include nondominant meanings alternate connotative andor less familiar terms convergent semantic processing people rhd demonstrate semantic impairment phonemic level tend difficulty understanding primary meanings individual words comprehension simple unambiguous sentences also remains intact basic word retrieval evidence suggests tasks functions left hand right hemisphere involved recognizing multiple nonprimary meanings words divergent semantic processing tasks impaired individuals right hemisphere along lines rhd patients experience difficulty verbal fluency experiment rhdaffected individuals asked name items within category tended suggest objects connected ways one many characteristics common example asked name vegetables people rhd would name spinach cabbage lettuce share attributes vegetables also green leafy results support model semantic processing right hemisphere superior generating multiple loosely connected meanings little overlap function clearly affected right hemisphere damagecitation needed result pragmatic deficits individuals right hemisphere damage hard time understanding figurative cues language tend simply understand sentences literal meanings instance someone say joey took lions share would assume joey took portion belonged lion opposed colloquial meaningthe majority vein also understand pragmatics underlying clues language might implicit commands suggestions sentences lost people right hemisphere damage addition hard time staying topic conversation therefore show deficit topic maintenance however may stick main topic bury speech large amount detail relevant main point also tend show lack awareness knowledge share communicating mention people things others reference considering highly contextual often ambiguous nature discourse tends area communication affected right hemisphere damage rhd particularly evident inference patterns affected individuals though rhd patients typically capable making basic inferences situations subtle inferences key discourse conversation often severely impaired penelope myers notes much empirical research shown persons right hemisphere damage significantly impaired generating inferences individual elements pictured scenes significantly compiling information individual elements together understand situation impairment also applies written spoken text example beeman cites patient mentioned ability read straightforward texts noted stopped reading novels multiple characters patients words put together evidence phenomenon research done right hemisphere damaged patients using norman rockwell pieces experiments participants shown painting without title attached asked describe happening scene expected variances answers people right hemisphere damage brain damage experiments provided evidence idea individuals right hemisphere damage hard time recognizing emotions others mention asked describe paintings addition process suggested pick relevant cues difficulty incorporating small details notice together form big picture actually describing paintings patients either give experimenter much description happening without addressing overall theme piece provide basic one sentence description see analyzing comparing descriptions participants brain damage right hemisphere damage researchers found right hemisphere damage used twice many words without brain damage even researchers took part descriptions appeared furthermore rhdaffected individuals experience deficits inferencerevision capabilities example brownell et al presented sentence barbara became bored finish history book rhd subjects control subjects assumed barbara reading book however subjects presented second sentence already spent five years writing control subjects altered initial inference whereas rhd subjects demonstrated great difficulty revising inferences drawing broad revised conclusion information rhd patients difficulty understanding nonliteral meanings also significant cause discourse impairment noted right hemisphere damage affects understanding figurative language idioms result right hemispheres role activating nonliteral peripheral meanings result difficulties understanding alternate meanings making situational inferences people right hemisphere damage face significant challenges terms difficulties communication likely linked patients cognitive deficits example communication breakdown may result patient right hemisphere brain damage fails observe appropriate social conventions patient may ramble fail recognize appropriate times take conversational patient may also difficulty comprehending sarcasm irony paralinguistic aspects although understand irony found patients right hemisphere damage provide clear punchline joke lost punchline connect multiple ideas themes along sticking main point story patients may find difficult extract theme story arrange sentences based theme nespoulous code virbel lecours studied speech different kinds aphasias coined term speech patterns right hemisphere damage according patients engage modalizing speech made speech patients perspective real world found right hemisphere damage contrast wernickes aphasia patients use referential speech nespoulous et al identify speech pertaining real world occurring referential speech patients describe leave attitude towards modalizing speech description real world missing include emotional attitude needed frequently occurring motor deficit leftsided hemiparesis strokes affecting motor cortex less common motor deficit population patients right hemisphere brain damage often display sensory deficits left neglect ignore everything left visual neglect present throughout many daily activities including reading writing selfcare example individuals left neglect typically leave details neglected side drawings try draw details nonneglected homonymous hemianopsia another sensory deficit sometimes observed stroke common source damage right hemisphere damage stroke disorder occurs right hemisphere brain etiologies cause right hemisphere damage include trauma traumatic brain injury disease seizures disorders infections depending etiology causes right hemisphere damage different deficits accounted level deficit disorder individual right hemisphere damage displays depends location extent damage small focal right hemisphere stroke produce specific deficit leave cognitive perceptual processes intact whereas large stroke right hemisphere likely results multiple profound adults right hemisphere damage may exhibit behavior characterized insensitivity others preoccupation self unawareness social context conversations verbose rambling tangential right hemisphere brain damage diagnosed medical professional computerized tomography ct scans magnetic resonance imaging mri often used determine damage occurred severe standardized assessments used speechlanguage pathologists determine presence severity right hemisphere brain damage three popular standardized assessments include mini inventory right brain injury second edition standardized test used identify presence severity identify patients strengths weaknesses right hemisphere language battery second edition comprehensive test battery evaluation right hemisphereinjured adults rehabilitation institute chicago evaluation communicative problems righthemisphere dysfunction revised ricer includes nine subtests include patient interview ratings facial written expression severity ratings nonstandardized tests also useful determining communicative deficits adults righthemisphere brain damage procedures include tests visual spatial perception attention organization component attentional processes visual organization previously listed tests need capitalized nonstandardized tests used include boston diagnostic aphasia exam bdaeauditory comprehension oral expression reading subtests revised token test boston naming test word fluency treatment right hemisphere damage given speechlanguage pathologists much research done regarding

pathologists persons right hemisphere damage results improvement areas problem solving attention memory different treatment approaches used treat different symptoms right hemisphere damage including neglect visuospatial awareness prosody pragmatics therapy person individualized symptoms severity impairment intervention focus needs person communication functional aspects data american speechlanguagehearing association asha indicate treatment individuals right hemisphere damage tends focus areas communication including swallowing memory problem solving deficits language expression language comprehension pragmatics addressed much less frequently individuals lack research focusing communication treatment cited possible explanation low smallscale pilot studies conducted recent years fill identified gaps treatment literature emerging evidence discussed right hemisphere damage lead inability produce comprehend emotional prosody language emotional prosody typically conveyed interpreted changes pitch rhythm loudness leon et al right hemisphere damaged patients difficulty sentence types revolve around pitch inflection sentence types include declarative fall pitch end interrogative rise pitch yesno question drop interrogative pronoun imperative sentence types even pitch rise intensity made end command research thus far focused primarily motoricimitative cognitivelinguistic approaches prosody treatment motoricimitative approach client imitates clinicianmodeled sentences produced target emotional prosody modeling cueing gradually reduced following sixstep hierarchy client reaches independent production cognitivelinguistic approach client prompted produce sentences support cue cards cues include name target emotion vocal characteristics emotional tone picture corresponding facial expression cues gradually removed client progresses toward independent clinical studies small groups participants four revealed statistically significant gains production emotional prosody following treatment additional research needed replicate results limited studies conducted thus far evaluate efficacy additional treatment approaches compare relative efficacy different appears though individuals right hemisphere damage maintain real world knowledge mental scripts world like expect common scenarios cant translate see despite right hemisphere damage lead deficits discourse abilities including difficulty interpretation abstract language making inferences understanding nonverbal particular individuals right hemisphere damage struggle skilled use context interpret express study five participants right hemisphere damage found participants ability orally interpret metaphors statistically significantly improved following fiveweek structured training intervention training program included five phases focused facilitating use word meanings semantic associations increase participants understanding another study three participants found contextual stimulation treatment increased participants ability efficiently activate distantly associated meanings suppress contextually inappropriate additional research needed replicate extend results emerging literature represents small step toward evidencebased treatments right hemisphere research indicated women likely left hemisphere dominant men likely right hemisphere dominant women recover faster left hemisphere damage men likely recover faster right hemisphere damage men suffered right hemisphere stroke also significantly better rehabilitation outcomes men suffer left hemisphere stroke recovery functional abilities often greater male stroke survivors females especially area activities daily left neglect common patients recovering right hemisphere damage right hemisphere controls left half body presence severity neglect shown influence functional outcomes well length rehabilitation strokecitation needed patients neglect peripersonal space space within reach likely recover first days stroke improvements months year post onset unlikely however prognosis patients neglect personal body space neglect far space much better types neglect likely recover completely almost completely months post onset although may lasting effects neglect varying degrees based type many patients neglect likely improve time appelros et al functional independence measure fim often used determine functional skills patient various times brain damage research indicated patients severe neglect less likely make functional improvements patients less severe neglect based fim scores additionally patients level neglect tend reduced functional cognitive communication skills patients without neglect cherney et al patients neglect shown need rehabilitation longer patients suffered right hemisphere damage result neglect average patients neglect stayed inpatient rehabilitation facilities one week longer length stay differ patients less severe neglect cherney et al anosognosia lack awareness understanding loss function caused brain injury common individuals suffered right hemisphere stroke patients anosognosia may unaware deficits may less likely seek treatment released hospital lack proper treatment could lead higher levels dependency later order make functional recovery gains right hemisphere stroke survivors receive rehabilitation services patients anosognosia encouraged seek additional treatment however due anosognosia patients often report higher perceived quality life right hemisphere stroke survivors unawareness resulting deficits daia et al right hemisphere damage may confabulate make stories help explain going minds compared actually occurring outside world example one patient right hemisphere damage wheelchair kept putting left hand spokes nurse asked stop looked said hand since right hemisphere controls motor functioning left side body patient recognize actions hand made story explain going often occurs actually happening deeply disturbing minds need way cope patients smaller lesions often recover faster anosognosia patients larger lesions resulting anosognosia hier et al age younger patients typically recover faster older
