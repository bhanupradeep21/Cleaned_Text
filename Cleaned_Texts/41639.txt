poposauroidea clade advanced pseudosuchians includes poposaurids shuvosaurids ctenosauriscids unusual pseudosuchians qianosuchus lotosaurus however excludes large predatory quadrupedal rauisuchians rauisuchids prestosuchids reptiles allied crocodylomorphs crocodile ancestors clade known loricata sister taxon poposauroids clade paracrocodylomorpha although first formally defined name poposauroidea used many years group referred poposauridae authors although name often used narrowly refer family includes poposaurus close relatives poposauroids went extinct end triassic period along noncrocodylomorph pseudosuchians however among diverse longlasting members noncrocodylomorph pseudosuchia xilousuchus ctenosauriscid living near beginning triassic effigia shuvosaurid surviving near end triassic despite high level diversity anatomical disparity within poposauroidea certain features clade determined particularly structure snout pelvis hip many features examples convergent evolution dinosaurs bipedal poposauroids poposaurus shuvosaurids mistaken theropod dinosaurs poposauroidea diverse group pseudosuchians containing genera many different ecological adaptations poposaurus shuvosaurids shortarmed bipeds others ctenosauriscids lotosaurus robust quadrupeds elongated neural spines creating sail like certain pelycosaurs like dimetrodon spinosaurids lotosaurus shuvosaurids toothless presumably beaked herbivores qianosuchus poposaurus ctenosauriscids sharptoothed predators ecological disparity many members clade means difficult assess ancestral poposauroid would looked like poposauroids differentiated pseudosuchians structure tip snout particularly premaxillary bone lies front nares nostril holes bone possesses two bony extensions processes wrap around nares anterodorsal process wraps nares contact nasal bones top edge snout typically quite short pseudosuchians however poposauroids elongated anterodorsal processes longer main premaxillary body posterodorsal process wraps nares contact maxilla side snout possesses opposite state much shorter poposauroids compared pseudosuchians restricted portion lower edge nares added effect allowing maxilla form rest holes lower rear edge front edge maxilla becoming concave well although snout features rare among pseudosuchians much common certain avemetatarsalians birdline archosaurs pterosaurs saurischian dinosaurs rear branch maxilla tapers poposauroids exception qianosuchus contrasts loricatans branch rectangular however poposauroids also possess several features unusual compared archosaurs general example archosaurs side braincase possesses pit internal carotid arteries may exit brain early poposauroids pits migrated underside braincase thereby resembling primitive condition seen archosaur relatives euparkeria proterochampsians nevertheless reversion undone shuvosaurids possibly earlier although braincase material known poposaurus lotosaurus addition poposauroids possessed elongated necks long thin cervical ribs second neck trait contrasts condition pseudosuchians phytosaurs pterosaurs short stout cervical ribs neural spines dorsal back vertebrae thin platelike even members poposauroidea without sails differs compared vertebrae early pseudosuchians well euparkeria phytosaurs neural spines expand outwards form flat rectangular surface seen like reptiles pelvis poposauroids formed three platelike bones ilium lies acetabulum hip socket pubis front acetabulum ischium behind acetabulum ilium large complex bone forwardpointing preacetabular process rearpointing postacetabular process lower portion forms upper edge acetabulum archosaurs lower portion ilium wedgeshaped forming inner face closed acetabulum however poposauroids lower portion ilium concave creating partially completely open acetabulum formed open space instead bone archosaurs open hip sockets dinosaurs lesser extent crocodylomorphs upper edge acetabulum formed pronounced ridge ilium known supraacetabular rim although poposauroids possessed open acetabula specializations ilium evolve clade containing poposaurus shuvosaurids example supraacetabular crest projects downwards rather outwards clade trait rare archosaurs evolving independently early theropod dinosaurs coelophysis dilophosaurus another feature presence additional diagonal crest branches upwards supraacetabular rim although crest evolved independently number different archosaurs specific subset poposauroids unique crest inclined forwards rather vertical confluent elongated preacetabular blade another derived feature pubis ischium also specialized poposauroids every archosaur two bones contact lower edge acetabulum however poposauroids qianosuchus lotosaurus bones touch leaving acetabulum open sides also width pubis variable different parts shaft portion near acetabulum thickened tip bone except qianosuchus thin seen headon archosaurs pubis consistent width however theropod dinosaurs archosaurs distal part pubis thinner proximal part shuvosaurids lotosaurus also possessed ischia either side body fused midline although ancestral archosaur two sacral hip vertebrae many different archosaur groups acquired additional sacral vertebrae course evolution nesbitt argued additional sacral vertebrae formed two primordial vertebrae gave wellpreserved sacrum poposauroid arizonasaurus evidence process poposauroids three four sacral vertebrae last thirdtolast vertebrae articulating ilium way similar two primordial vertebrae primitive archosauriformes euparkeria phytosaurs secondtolast vertebra form unlike vertebrae archosauriforms nesbitt concluded insertion formed innermost sections two primordial vertebrae although process unique poposauroids known archosaur lineages batrachotomus silesaurids basal poposauroids arizonasaurus qianosuchus three sacral vertebra second vertebra insertion however advanced poposauroids poposaurus shuvosaurids four sacral vertebrae third vertebra recognizable insertion means first vertebra must another addition seemingly last dorsal vertebra repurposed transformed sacral vertebra incorporated dorsal vertebra known dorsosacral presence dorsosacrals trait irregular distribution among archosaurs known ornithosuchids aetosaurs well variety dinosaurs commonly ornithischians almost archosariforms sacral ribs first primordial sacral vertebra contact ilium near base bone close contact pubis however poposauroids first primordial sacral ribs additional forward branches lie inner edge iliums preacetabular blade poposauroids advanced qianosuchus sacral vertebrae fuse single bone sacrum fusion occurred incrementally different portions vertebra example zygapophyses fused together early ctenosauriscids centra main cylindrical portion sacral vertebrae also may fused early bases neural arches portion vertebrae spinal cord fused ctenosauriscids arizonasaurus others bromsgroveia also fused poposauroids advanced unlike pseudosuchians poposauroids lack bony scutes known osteoderms exception qianosuchus possessed numerous tiny osteoderms lying row extending neck poposauroids tip fibula outer shin bone symmetrical straight seen side rather slanted noncrocodylomorph pseudosuchians poposauroids advanced ctenosauriscids flattened hooflike pedal unguals toe claws poposauroids short arms compared length legs although disarticulation qianosuchus lack limb material ctenosauriscids means unknown whether trait basal group whole missing data ctenosauriscids also obscures certain traits caudal tail vertebrae ankle bones gained lost within franz nopcsa first used term poposauridae refer poposauroids time sole member group poposaurus considered theropod dinosaur following years poposauroids placed various groups including saurischia theropoda classification existed better remains indicated poposaurus pseudosuchian rather dinosaur genera sillosuchus shuvosaurus later erected like poposaurus shuvosaurus originally thought theropod sankar chatterjee reclassified poposauroids theropod dinosaurs description new genus postosuchus chatterjee even considered poposauroids ancestors tyrannosaurs postosuchus widely
