initiate puberty despite inefficiency sex steroid synthesis ovaries usually make enough estradiol produce breast development cases even menarche menses continuing years ovarian adrenal androgen production minimal produces little pubic body haircitation needed however insufficient estradiol progesterone produced induce maturation egg ovulation although prepubertal ovaries inactive enough lipid accumulates cause damage begun produce estrogen lipid damage begins accrue ability produce estrogen well ovulate slowly degraded cysts also form ovaries women lipoid cah infertile presumably due
