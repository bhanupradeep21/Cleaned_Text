pesticides exoskeletons hard parts organisms greatly useful assisting preservation organisms whose soft parts usually rot fossilized mineralized exoskeletons preserved shell fragments possession exoskeleton permits couple routes fossilization instance strong layer resist compaction allowing mould organism formed underneath skeleton may later alternatively exceptional preservation may result chitin mineralised burgess transformed resistant polymer keratin resist decay recovered however dependence fossilised skeletons also significantly limits understanding evolution parts organisms

exoskeleton significant limitation although phyla living animals twothirds phyla never found fossils animal species softbodied decay become mineralized skeletons first appear fossil record shortly base cambrian period million years ago evolution mineralised exoskeleton considered possible driving force cambrian explosion animal life resulting diversification predatory defensive tactics however

mineral shells constructed calcium carbonate two forms stable calcite metastable aragonite stable within reasonable range chemical environments rapidly becomes unstable outside range oceans contain relatively high proportion magnesium compared calcium aragonite stable magnesium concentration drops becomes less stable hence harder incorporate exoskeleton tend dissolvecitation needed except molluscs whose shells often comprise forms lineages use one form mineral form used appears reflect seawater chemistry thus form easily precipitated time lineage first evolved calcified skeleton change
