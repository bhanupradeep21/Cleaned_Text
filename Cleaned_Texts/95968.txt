adrenalectomy latin root ad nearat renal related kidneys greek outcutting sometimes written adx procedure resulting surgical removal one unilateral bilateral adrenal glands usually done remove tumors adrenal glands producing excess hormones large size inches centimeters adrenalectomy also done remove cancerous tumor adrenal glands cancer spread another location kidney lung adrenalectomy performed severe coagulopathy whose heart lungs weak undergo surgery procedure performed using open incision laparotomy minimally invasive laparoscopic robotassisted minimally invasive techniques increasingly gold standard care due shorter length stay hospital lower blood loss similar complication one adrenal gland sits kidney two adrenal glands produce hormones steroid hormones catecholamines help regulate blood pressure blood sugar level metabolism immune system stress essential functions one adrenal gland removed adrenal gland take hormoneproducing role adrenal glands removed patient require lifelong steroid adrenal tumors noncancerous benign often found incidentally mass via imaging ct scans mri ultrasound taken health workups see incidentaloma although adrenal masses require evaluation majority approximately require adrenalectomy however due hormoneproducing function adrenal glands noncancerous adrenal tumors may produce much hormones aldosterone called primary aldosteronism cortisol called cushings disease cushings syndrome catecholamines called pheochromocytoma hormoneproducing tumors may need adrenalectomy additionally adrenal tumors larger centimeters size regardless whether produce hormones also require adrenalectomy due increased risk adrenal cancer rarely adrenal tumor may cancerous adrenocortical carcinoma requiring adrenalectomy rarer still mass may metastatic cancer spread another location kidney lung metastasis isolated adrenal gland may candidate absolute contraindication reason surgery situation adrenalectomy patients generally unsuited surgery severe coagulopathy poor cardiopulmonary performance due stress body surgery produce addition american association clinical endocrinologists american association endocrine surgeons guidelines state minimallyinvasive techniques avoided large tumor size larger cm due difficulties maneuvering around large mass adrenocortical carcinoma risk fully removing cancerous however least one metaanalysis patients found shorter length stay less blood loss higher rates complications even large cm tumors using minimallyinvasive techniques adrenalectomy largely divided two types open surgical laparotomy versus minimally invasive techniques surgeons usually reserve open surgery large larger cm cancerous tumors risk fully removing cancerous tissue perform open surgery using traditional instruments cuts minimally invasive techniques may laparoscopic several small cuts incisions made allow surgeon directly control surgical instruments hands visualizing surgery via tiny camera provides magnified view surgical site laparoscopic surgery many benefits example surgery smaller scars less pain less blood loss similar complication rates shorter recovery period traditional open traditionally laparoscopic transperitoneal approach lta small cuts made abdomen reach adrenal glands peritoneum frontside however alternative approach possible called retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy pra adrenal glands reached small cuts made back studies shown lta pra equally safe effective though suggest advantages pra lta terms lower intensity postoperative pain shorter hospital stay faster recovery lower early morbidity systematic review suggests laparoscopic retroperotenial adrenalectomy appears reduce late morbidity time oral fluid food intake time ambulation compared laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy however uncertainty effects due lowquality outcomes allcause mortality early morbidity socioeconomic effects operative postoperative parameter evidence uncertain effects either interventions pra involves high pressure within limited retroperitoneal space therefore may cause kidney injury high sometimes surgeons perform robotassisted adrenalectomies perform surgery small cuts incisions using robotic arms camera instruments attached camera gives doctors highdefinition magnified view surgical site significant differences found laparoscopic robotassisted adrenalectomy two metaanalyses complications blood loss mortality however robotic adrenalectomy shorter hospital stays cost longer operating time higher cost postoperative care highly
