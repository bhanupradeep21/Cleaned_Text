endothiodon ɛndoʊθiːoʊdɔːn inner tooth greek endothi ἔνδοθῐ within odon ὀδών tooth likely named characteristic teeth placed internally extinct genus large dicynodont late permian like dicynodonts endothiodon herbivore lacked two tusks characterized dicynodonts anterior portion upper lower jaw curved upward creating distinct beak thought allowed specialized endothiodon widespread found across southern region single large continent known pangea originally found southern africa also found india brazil close africa time finding brazil marks first dicynodont reported permian south finding also shows part rio rasto formation brazil correlated deposits india malawi mozambique south africa tanzania zambia originally thought nine species reduced fourth species later discovered four currently known species endothiodon e bathystoma e uniseries e whaitsi e mahalanobsi however basic distinction among four species size leads believe e uniseries e bathystoma e whaitsi may actually represent ontogenetic series rather three distinct e mahalanobsi hand likely separate truly smaller species based size juvenile adult forms found apart size e mahalanobsi also single longitudinal ridge snout compared three species lower position pineal boss swollen prefrontal skull endothiodon quickly recognized prominent upturned beak premaxilla palate upper jaw vaulted allows upturned pointed lower jaw fit lower jaw lateral teeth broad groove endothiodon lacks lateral dentary shelf bulbous swelling dentary function swelling yet known pineal foramen situated boss high three species low one e mahalanobsi also boss situated ventral margin anteroventral process anteroposteriorly short triangular bone dicynodonts long teeth upper lower jaw differ morphology well tooth teeth upper jaw tend larger millimetres lower jaw millimetres serrated anterior edge lower jaw serrations posterior although originally thought e bathystoma several rows teeth upper jaw later discovered tips teeth lower jaw left behind upper jaw known upper teeth roughly positioned single entire row moved posteriorly anterior portion premaxilla contains teeth posterior portion still holds two teeth teeth also situated internally edge first thought dentary contained three parallel rows teeth instead arranging teeth longitudinal rows known fall obliquely arranged zahnreihe anteriormost tooth oldest posterior tooth youngest active ongoing replacement tooth rows distal portion tooth compressed side side somewhat pear shaped cross palate shows two distinct regions covered minute foramina areas probably horny covering life broad groove running along tooth row dentary probably also covered horny possible regions allowed occlusion upper teeth met groove lateral lower teeth lower teeth met one regions still scrutiny palatine region short comparison lower tooth row second horn covered area palatine oppose structure lower palatine region shortened effective occlusion shearing would possible lower jaw retracted endothiodon first discovered richard owen karoo region beaufort group south africa based skull mandible genus described based anterior portion snout corresponding part dentary creating upturned several specimens since collected many beaufort group south africa first partial skeleton discovered broom skull lower jaw discovered brazil specimen originally assigned genus endothiodon boos later reexamined specimen confirmed assignment marked endothiodon first permian dicynodont found south four main endothiodont genera endothiodon esoterodon endogomphodon emydochampsa originally separated subfamily endothiodontinae e uniseries first discovered thought type species genus cox sorted taxa endothiodonts found characters originally separating four genera valid four genera grouped one genus originally nine species endothiodon cox able narrow three species based skull size robustness lower fourth species endothiodon found india unique compared three species small size single

starting appear juvenile teeth much simpler similar carnivore herbivore possible different tooth morphology might due change diet insectivorous omnivorous juvenile herbivorous adult would achieved
