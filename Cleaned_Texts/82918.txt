steroidal aromatase inhibitors class drugs mostly used treating breast cancer postmenopausal women high levels estrogen breast tissue increases risk developing breast cancer enzyme aromatase considered good therapeutic target treating breast cancer due involved final step estrogen biosynthetic pathway also inhibition affect production steroids aromatase inhibitors classified two categories based structure nonsteroidal steroidal latter resemble structure steroidal aromatase inhibitors irreversibly inhibit enzyme binding covalently binding site aromatase substrate access worcester foundation experimental biology wfeb established foundation center point collaboration many scientists interested reproduction neurophysiology steroid biochemistry one foundations work understanding mechanism conversion androgens estrogens group worked understanding biosynthesis metabolism steroids produced adrenal glands testes ovaries andre meyer later hypothesized aromatization androstenedione enzymatic proven purification early investigators agreed upon fact aromatization ring facilitated cytochrome enzyme proven blockade aminoglutethimide ag known block harry brodie chemist joined wfeb group started working understanding steriochemistry hydrogen elimination position aromatization mechanistic studies led recognizing therapeutic potential targeting aromatase early

selective aromatase inhibitor due unfavourable characters poor oral bioavailability unfavourable metabolism group led e di salle p lombardi farmitaliacarlo erba part pfizer started working new selective aromatase inhibitor group designed synthesized evaluated new novel steroid exemestane exemestane went clinical trials received fda approval marketed aromasin indication exemestane advanced breast cancer postmenopausal women cancer progressed following tamoxifen therapy exemestane first oral aromatase clinical use steroidal aromatase inhibitors today less limited exemestane use formestane lentaron limited countries used anymore formestane superseded newer better inhibitors better oral availability fewer side effects exemestane newer generation nonsteroidal aromatase majority breast cancers hormone dependent express either estrogen receptor andor progesterone reason compounds inhibit biosynthesis estrogen researched standard adjuvant therapy breast cancer postmenopausal proven breast cancer postmenopausal women treated prevented modulating estrogen receptors ligands aromatase part final step estrogen conversion good target medicine aromatase catalyses final step estrogen conversion inhibiting effect synthesis steroids except postmenopausal women production estrogen ovaries ceased main source estrogen therefore aromatization androgens produced adrenal estrogen production postmenopausal women mainly occurs peripheral adipose brain skin adipose tissue normal breast tissue breast cancer cells aromatase estrogen synthesised breast tissue around cancer cells effect growth cancer aromatase inhibitors stops conversion lowers levels treating breast cancer aromatase inhibitors effective postmenopausal women high levels aromatase ligands substrate ovaries premenopausal women inhibiting aromatase premenopausal women estrogen levels reduced short time leads activation hypothalamus pituitary axis promote gonadotropin secretion causes rise estrogen levels stimulating study shown cross resistance always occur nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors steroidal aromatase nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors working patients relapsing use steroidal aromatase inhibitors could applied better results patients forced switch endocrine therapy cytotoxic chemotherapy therefore avoiding delaying side effects complications aromatase inhibitors used preserve fertility stimulate ovulation premenopausal breast cancer survivors inhibiting aromatase premenopausal women estrogen levels reduced temporarily leads increased gonadotropin secretion stimulate ovaries causes rise estrogen testolactone formestane generation aromatase inhibitors formestane first selective aromatase inhibitor used breast cancer treatment clinical use exemestane steroidal generation aromatase inhibitor advantage formestane potent administered orally clinical studies shown mgday causes suppression estrogen plays major part stimulation breast cancer cell proliferation hormonedependent breast cancer high concentrations estrogen seem promote development breast cancer consequently two main approaches control block pathological activity estrogens first approach focuses inhibition estrogen action antiestrogens interact estrogen receptors second focuses directly inhibiting estrogen production inhibiting estrogen synthetase steroidal aromatase inhibitors identified type inhibitors interact substratebinding site aromatase aromatase cytochrome catalyzes three consecutive hydroxylation reactions converting androgens aromatic estrogens gaining electrons nadphcytochrome reductase aromatase converts androstenedione testosterone estrone estradiol respectively aromatization androgen terminal ratelimiting step estrogen synthesis recent studies focused defining active site region aromatase enzyme evaluate promising reaction mechanism threedimensional models aromatase active region also generated though exact nature structure yet fully drugs like exemestane steroidal aromatase inhibitors steroidal structure competes natural aromatase substrate inhibitor must share important structural features endogenous substrate features androgens allowing interact catalytic site enzyme protein renders steroidal aromatase inhibitors inherently due selective inhibition affect production steroids estrogen biosynthetic drugs bound catalytic site often metabolized intermediates much higher affinity androgen receptor binding intermediate metabolite androgen receptor times parent compound metabolite attaches active site enzyme enzyme initiates typical sequence hydroxylation hydroxylation produces unbreakable covalent bond inhibitor enzyme protein even unattached parts inhibitor removed enzyme activity aromatase restored new enzyme inhibitor thereby blocks activity enzyme even drug cleared circulation thus lasting effect vivo need continued presence drug maintain inhibition turn reduced chance toxic adverse effects due irreversible nature inhibition steroidal ais often marketed inactivators suicide planarity ring important affinity compounds aromatase seen table compounds show substantial inhibition also stereochemical requirements
