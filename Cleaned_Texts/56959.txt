psychology cognitivism theoretical framework understanding mind gained credence movement response behaviorism cognitivists said neglected explain cognition cognitive psychology derived name latin cognoscere referring knowing information thus cognitive psychology informationprocessing psychology derived part earlier traditions investigation thought problem behaviorists acknowledged existence thinking identified behavior cognitivists argued way people think impacts behavior therefore behavior cognitivists later argued thinking essential psychology study thinking become however cognitivists typically presuppose specific form mental activity kind advanced computationalism cognitivism recently challenged postcognitivism process assimilating expanding intellectual horizon termed cognitive development complex physiological structure absorbs variety stimuli environment stimuli interactions able produce knowledge skills parents process knowledge informally home teachers process knowledge formally school knowledge pursued zest zeal learning becomes attention first part cognitive development pertains persons ability focus sustain attention also focus minded individual full concentration one differentiated temperamental characteristics like persistence distractibility sense latter modulates individuals daily interaction attention hand involves behavior performing specific learning instance takes place student gives attention towards teacher interest effort closely relate attention attention active process involves numerous outside stimuli attention organism point time involves three concentric circles beyond awareness margin individuals mental capacity many things someone focus one time theory cognitive development called information processing holds memory attention foundation cognition suggested childrens attention initially selective based situations important capacity increases child grows older since able absorb stimuli another conceptualization classified attention mental attention perceptual attention former described executivedriven attentional brain energy activates taskrelevant processes brain latter immediate spontaneous attention driven novel perceptual cognitive theory mainly stresses acquisition knowledge growth mental structure cognitive theory tends focus conceptualizing students learning process information received information processed organized existing schema information retrieved upon recall words cognitive theory seeks explain process knowledge acquisition subsequent effects mental structures within mind learning mechanics learner rather process depending learner already knows existing information method acquiring new knowledge integrate new information existing knowledge acquisition activity consisting internal codification mental structures within students mind inherent theory student must active participant learning process cognitive approaches mainly focus mental activities learner like mental planning goal setting organizational cognitive theories environmental factors instructional components play important role learning additional key elements like learning code transform rehearse store retrieve information learning process includes learners thoughts beliefs attitude memory plays vital role learning process information stored within memory organised meaningful manner teacher designers play different roles learning process teachers supposedly facilitate learning organization information optimal way whereas designers supposedly use advanced techniques analogies hierarchical relationships help learners acquire new information add prior knowledge forgetting described inability retrieve information memory memory loss may mechanism used discard situationally irrelevant information assessing relevance newly acquired according cognitive theory learner knows implement knowledge different contexts conditions say transfer understanding composed knowledge form rules concepts knowledge stored memory important use knowledge also important prior knowledge used identifying similarities differences novel cognitive theory mostly explains complex forms learning terms reasoning problem solving information emphasis must placed fact goal aforementioned viewpoints considered transfer knowledge student efficient effective manner simplification standardization two techniques used enhance effectiveness efficiency knowledge transfer knowledge analysed decomposed simplified basic building blocks correlation behaviorist model knowledge transfer environment cognitivists stress importance efficient processing source behaviorist uses feedback reinforcement change behavior desired direction cognitivist uses feedback guiding supporting accurate mental different reasons learners task analyzers critical cognitivists behaviorists cognitivists look learners predisposition learning learner activate maintain direct hisher additionally cognitivists examine learners design instruction assimilated ie learners existing mental structures contrast behaviorists look learners determine lesson begin ie level learners performing successfully effective reinforcements ie consequences desired learner specific assumptions principles direct instructional design active involvement learner learning process learner control metacognitive training eg selfplanning monitoring revising techniques use hierarchical analyses identify illustrate prerequisite relationships cognitive task analysis procedure facilitating optimal processing structuring organizing sequencing information use cognitive strategies outlining summaries synthesizers advance organizers etc encouraging students make connections previously learned material creating learning environments recall prerequisite skills use relevant examples analogies cognitive theories emphasize mainly making knowledge meaningful helping learners organizing relate new information existing knowledge memory instruction based students existing schema mental structures effective organisation information connected manner relate existing knowledge meaningful way examples cognitive strategy analogies metaphors cognitive strategies includes use framing outlining mnemonics concept mapping advance organizers cognitive theory mainly emphasizes major tasks teacher designer includes analyzing various learning experiences learning situation impact learning outcomes different individuals organizing structuring new information connect learners previously acquired knowledge abilities experiences new information effectively efficiently assimilatedaccommodated within learners cognitive cognitivism two major components one methodological theoretical methodologically cognitivism positivist approach says psychology principle fully explained use scientific method speculation whether reference also largely reductionist goal belief individual components mental function cognitive architecture identified meaningfully second says cognition contains discrete internal mental states representations symbols changed using rules reference cognitivism became dominant force psychology century replacing behaviorism popular paradigm understanding mental function cognitive psychology wholesale refutation behaviorism rather expansion accepts mental states exist due increasing criticism towards end simplistic learning models one notable criticisms noam chomskys argument language could acquired purely conditioning must least partly explained existence internal mental states main issues interest cognitive psychologists inner mechanisms human thought processes knowing cognitive psychologists attempted shed light alleged mental structures stand causal relationship physical actions various new theories emerged challenged cognitivism idea thought best described computation new approaches often influenced phenomenological postmodern philosophy include situated cognition distributed cognition dynamicism embodied cognition thinkers working field artificial life example rodney brooks also produced noncognitivist models cognition hand much early cognitive psychology work many currently active cognitive psychologists treat cognitive processes computational idea mental functions described information processing models criticised philosopher john searle mathematician
