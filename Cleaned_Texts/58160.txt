mesothorax dark opaque hind wings arise metathorax used flight though cockroaches rarely resort flight abdomen divisible segments surrounded chitinous exoskeleton plates called sclerites including dorsal tergites ventral sternites lateral pleurites american cockroaches three developmental stages egg nymph females produce egg case ootheca protrudes tip abdomen average females produce oothecae although sometimes produce many two days egg cases placed surface safe location egg cases cm long brown purseshaped immature cockroaches emerge egg cases weeks require months mature hatching nymphs feed undergo series moultings ecdysis adult cockroaches live additional year females produce average young american cockroach reproductive cycle last sex pheromone american cockroach sequiterpene

chapter history pheromone chemistry female american cockroaches housed groups close association promotes facultative parthenogenic oothecae produced asexually without process eggs produced automixis meiosis occurs instead giving rise haploid gametes ordinarily happens diploid gametes produced probably terminal fusion meiotic products develop female cockroaches eggs produced parthenogenesis lower
