bisphenol bps organic compound formula two phenol functional groups either side sulfonyl group commonly used curing fastdrying epoxy resin adhesives classified bisphenol close molecular analog bisphenol bpa bps differentiates bpa possessing sulfone group central linker molecule instead dimethylmethylene group case bisphenol bps used curing fastdrying epoxy glues corrosion inhibitor also commonly used reactant polymer reactions bps become increasingly common building block polyethersulfone epoxies following public awareness bpa estrogenmimicking properties widespreadbelief enough

humans share genes expressed development therefore useful model organism understand effects studies zebrafish model shown parental exposure bps causes disrupted thyroid hormone levels parental generation generation fetal exposure bps placenta critical period negative effects developmental programming fetus additionally evidence suggest embryos high levels bps exhibit teratogenic effects vital organs heart liver additionally bps inhibits expression genes within liver used metabolism thus leading increased stress liver zebrafish adult zebrafish exposed low levels bps development display hyperactivity due exponential increase neural activity within clear mechanism bpss effect thyroid hormone levels human exposure endocrine disrupting nature bps encouraged investigations

changes mass suggesting bps reproductive toxin sexes use bisphenola manufacturing household products reduced due effects endocrine disruptor research suggesting disposition greater deleterious effects women compared research suggested bpa cousins bpsbpf etc sex dependent effects male zebrafish exposed bps indicated significant increase estrogen levels decrease testosterone levels decrease testosterone exposed bps found times decrease testosterone increased levels mrna transcription aromatase gene increased levels mrna transcription gnrh genes decreased levels follicle stimulating hormone luteinizing relationship higher bps concentrations linked individuals within certain socioeconomic classes hence placing individuals greater risk possible deleterious effects individuals annual income less found highest concentrations bisphenol individuals annual income lowest concentrations suggesting linear relationship bodily concentrations bps black women highest concentrations bps levels higher white recent work suggests like bpa bps also endocrine disrupting makes bps bpa endocrine disruptors presence hydroxy group benzene ring phenol moiety allows bpa bps mimic estradiol
