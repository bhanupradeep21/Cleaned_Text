stress incontinence also known stress urinary incontinence sui effort incontinence form urinary incontinence due inadequate closure bladder outlet urethral sphincter loss small amounts urine associated coughing laughing sneezing exercising movements increase intraabdominal pressure thus increasing pressure bladder urethra normally supported fascia muscles pelvic floor support insufficient due reason urethra would close properly times increased abdominal pressure allowing urine pass involuntarilycitation needed lab results urine analysis cystometry postvoid residual volume normal sources distinguish urethral hypermobility intrinsic sphincter deficiency latter rare requires different surgical stress incontinence men commonly seen prostate prostatectomy transurethral resection prostate laparoscopic prostatectomy robotic prostatectomycitation needed women pregnancy childbirth obesity menopause often contribute stress incontinence causing weakness pelvic floor damaging urethral sphincter leading inadequate closure hence leakage stress incontinence worsen week menstrual period time lowered estrogen levels may lead lower muscular pressure around urethra increasing chances leakage incidence stress incontinence increases following menopause similarly lowered estrogen levels female highlevel athletes effort incontinence may occur sports involving abrupt repeated increases intraabdominal pressure may exceed perineal floor medications recommended stress behavioral changes improve stress incontinence recommended decrease overall consumption liquids avoid drinking caffeinated beverages irritate bladder spicy foods carbonated beverages alcohol citrus also irritate bladder avoided quitting smoking also improve stress incontinence smoking irritates bladder induce coughing putting stress bladdermedical citation needed effectiveness approaches treat people synthetic midurethral tape surgery result cure failed surgery results systematic review urinary incontinence women found individual active treatments better behavioral therapy alone combined interventions hormones generally effective treatments one common treatment recommendations includes exercising muscles pelvis kegel exercises strengthen retrain pelvic floor muscles sphincter muscles reduce stress patients younger years old benefit patient least daily contractions least possible assess pelvic floor muscle strength using kegel perineometercitation needed bladder training technique encourages people modify voiding habits lengthening time voiding weak evidence suggests bladder training may helpful treatment urinary type intervention take person months learn would therapy option people physically mentally able control incontinence pad multilayered absorbent sheet collects urine resulting urinary incontinence similar solutions include absorbent undergarments adult diapers absorbent products may cause side effects leaks odors skin breakdown uti incontinence pads may also come form small sheet placed underneath patient hospital situations practical patient wear diapermedical citation needed people different preferences regarding type pad use stay dry addition effectiveness incontinence pads differ using different designs depending activity sleepinggoing outstaying men costeffective design incontinence pad diaper women incontinence pads form disposable pullups generally preferred however higher cost associated type women nursing homes diapers preferred washable diapers cost effective however people prefer washable diapers exception men prefer means control incontinence evidence one type incontinence pad superior regard skin pessary medical device inserted vagina common kind ring shaped typically recommended correct vaginal prolapse pessary compresses urethra symphysis pubis elevates bladder neck women may reduce stress leakage however clear well mechanical devices help women stress urinary doctors usually suggest surgery alleviate incontinence treatments tried many surgical options high rates success lessinvasive variants sling operation shown equally effective treating stress incontinence surgical sling one surgery urethropexycitation needed insertion sling vagina rather opening lower abdomen called intravaginal slingplasty ivsmedical citation needed procedure choice stress urinary incontinence females called sling procedure sling implant usually consists synthetic mesh material shape narrow ribbon sometimes biomaterial bovine porcine patients tissue placed urethra one vaginal incision two small abdominal incisions idea replace deficient pelvic floor muscles provide backboard support urethra transvaginal mesh recently come scrutiny due controversy relating food drug administration initially fda approved implantable mesh devices due similarity earlier prototypes known patients allege longterm harm suffering result implanted mesh fda released safety communication led reclassification surgical mesh class high risk device january citation needed insertion sling vagina rather opening lower abdomen called intravaginal slingplasty ivsmedical citation needed transobturator tape tot monarc sling procedure aims eliminate stress urinary incontinence providing support urethra minimallyinvasive procedure eliminates retropubic needle passage involves inserting mesh tape urethra three small incisions groin procedure involves placing polypropylene tape outlet bladder improve stress stress incontinence women results urethra dropping toward vagina therefore common surgery stress incontinence involves pulling urethra normal position working incision vagina abdomen surgeon raises urethra secures string attached muscle ligament bone severe cases stress incontinence surgeon may secure urethra wide sling holds bladder also compresses bottom bladder top urethra preventing leakagemedical citation needed variety materials historically used add bulk urethra thereby increase outlet resistance effective patients relatively fixed urethra blood fat used limited success widely used substance gluteraldehyde crosslinked collagen gax collagen proved value many patients main downfall need repeat procedure timemedical citation needed another procedure treat incontinence use artificial urinary sphincter used men women procedure surgeon enters wraps cuff artificial urinary sphincter around urethra manner blood pressure cuff wraps around arm device includes pump implanted skin pressed patient loosens cuff allowing free urination artificial sphincter automatically regains
