spondylolisthesis displacement one spinal vertebra compared another medical dictionaries define spondylolisthesis specifically forward anterior displacement vertebra vertebra inferior often defined medical textbooks displacement spondylolisthesis graded based upon degree slippage one vertebral body relative subsequent adjacent vertebral spondylolisthesis classified one six major etiologies degenerative traumatic dysplastic isthmic pathologic spondylolisthesis commonly occurs lumbar spine primarily level vertebral body anteriorly translating vertebral olisthesis synonym olisthy term explicitly denotes displacement forward anterior displacement specifically called anterolisthesis commonly involves fifth lumbar backward displacement called retrolisthesis lateral displacement called lateral hangmans fracture specific type spondylolisthesis second cervical vertebra displaced anteriorly relative vertebra due fractures vertebras pedicles anterolisthesis categorized cause location severity anterolisthesis location includes vertebrae involved may also specify parts vertebrae affected isthmic anterolisthesis defect pars common form spondylolisthesis also called spondylolytic spondylolisthesis occurs reported prevalence percent us population slip fracture intravertebral joint usually acquired ages years remains unnoticed adulthood roughly percent isthmic slips lowgrade

sneezing intensify pain individual may also note slipping sensation moving upright position sitting trying stand may painful major components physical exam spondylolisthesis consists observation palpation maneuvers common finding pain lumbar following physical involves specific assessment spondylolisthesis however general examination importantly neurological examination must done rule alternative causes signs symptoms neurological examination often normal patients spondylolisthesis lumbosacral radiculopathy commonly seen patients degenerate patient observed walking standing patients present normal gait abnormal gait often sign high grade patient high grade spondylolisthesis may present posterior pelvic tilt causing loss normal contour antalgic gait rounded back decreased hip extension result severe standing patient observed front back sides increased decreased lumbar lordosis inward curvature lower spine detection spondylolisthesis palpation often done palpating spinous level lumbar spine palpated spinous process palpation definitive method detection adults nonspecific low back pain strong evidence suggests medical imaging done within first six also suggested avoid advanced imaging ct mri adults without neurological symptoms red flags patients general recommendations initial low back pain treatment remaining active avoiding twisting bending avoiding activities worsen pain avoiding bed rest possibly initiating trial nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs consulting children adolescents persistent low back pain may require earlier imaging seen physician imaging deemed necessary combination plain radiography computed tomography magnetic resonance imaging may used images often taken lumbar spine due spondylolisthesis commonly involving lumbar images thoracic spine taken patients history physical suggest thoracic involvement plain radiography often first step medical anteroposterior frontback lateral side images used allow physician view spine multiple oblique view longer evaluating spondylolithesis plain radiographs provide information positioning structural integrity spine therefore detail needed physician may request advanced imaging magnetic resonance imaging preferred advanced imaging technique evaluation preference due effectiveness lack radiation exposure ability evaluate soft tissue abnormalities spinal canal mri limited ability evaluate fractures great detail compared advanced imaging computed tomography helpful evaluating bony vertebral abnormalities helpful determining fracture new old andor progressing ct use spondylolisthesis evaluation controversial due high radiation spondylolisthesis patients without symptoms need nonoperative management also referred conservative treatment recommended treatment spondylolisthesis cases without neurological patients spondylolisthesis respond conservative conservative treatment consists primarily physical therapy intermittent bracing aerobic exercise pharmacological intervention epidural steroid injections majority patients degenerative spondylolisthesis require surgical clear radiological medical guidelines indications surgical interventions degenerative minimum three months conservative management completed prior considering surgical three indications potential surgical treatment follows persistent recurrent back pain neurologic pain
