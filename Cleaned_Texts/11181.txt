others developed mayer mailed report anonymously form two letters british embassy oslo passed london analysis providing invaluable resource british developing countermeasures especially navigational targeting radars contributed british winning battle britain hans ferdinand mayer received doctorate physics university heidelberg spending two years research associate doctoral supervisors philipp lenard laboratory joined siemens ag became interested telecommunications joined siemens communication research laboratory becoming director position contacts europe united states access wide range information electronics development germany especially military sector hitler invaded poland september mayer decided divulge british much could military secrets defeat nazi regime arranged business

november asking british military attaché arrange bbc world service alter introduction germanlanguage programme wished receive report done sent report along vacuum tube prototype proximity fuze also wrote letter longtime british friend henry cobden turner asking communicate via danish colleague niels holmblad indirect communication path required since britain germany war denmark time neutral mayer continued travels denmark visit holmblad asking could relay information turner holmblad readily agreed hitler invaded denmark april communication route longer feasible mayer returned germany although mayer arrested political offenses gestapo imprisoned dachau nazi concentration camps war ended nazis never knew oslo report november captain hector boyes naval attaché british embassy oslo received anonymous letter offering secret report latest german technical developments receive report arrange usual announcement bbc world services germanlanguage broadcast changed hullo hier ist london done resulted delivery parcel week later contained typewritten document type vacuum tube sensor proximity fuze shells bombs document became famous existence revealed would go history oslo boyes quickly appreciated reports potential importance member embassy staff make translation forwarded london along original oslo report received indifference even disbelief british intelligence notable exception dr r v jones young phd physicist recently put charge new field called scientific intelligence jones argued despite breadth information inaccuracies technical details correct argued electronic systems divulged therein explored report jones summarized contribution source present problem may summarised statements germans bringing use rdf radio direction finding british name radar system similar careful review whole report leaves two possible conclusions plant persuade us germans well advanced source genuinely disaffected germany wished tell us knew general accuracy information gratuitous presentation fuse fact source made effort far known exploit matter together subsequent course war recent awakening knickebein weigh heavily favour second conclusion seems source reliable manifestly competent jones summarized importance oslo report probably best single report received source war overall course contributions sources enigma decrypts aerial photographs reports resistance outweighed oslo contribution made organizations involving many sometimes thousands individuals operating throughout war oslo report believed written single individual one great flash given us synoptic glimpse much foreshadowed german military electronics jones trusted oslo report admiralty thought report good true deception abwehr fantastic claims written psychological warfare experts additional argument raised doubters person could wide knowledge weapons technology discussed report mainly service rivalry britain us known similar rivalry germany oslo report concentrated electronic technology

mayer briefly described another remotecontrolled system time aircraft instead rocket german word geschoss used report also translated mean artillery shell german text clearly states rocket meant also clear remark projectile highly unstable fired artillery shells would spinstabilized finstabilized case mortar projectiles mentioned size cm calibre seen curious item time even british rocket developers focused solid fuels thinking diameters around mm solid fuel rocket ten times diameter would caused credibility gap fact happen information later became available british intelligence

torpedo mentioned type used sink hms royal oak described magnetic fuze designed detect deviations earths magnetic field caused ships metal hull explode beneath keel mayer described principle fuze suggested could defended generating suitable magnetic field second type deployed germans mine allies defeated degaussing ships mine could longer detect allies also able sweep mines generating suitable magnetic field trip mine final section report described mechanical fuzes artillery shells discontinued favour electrical fuzes mentioned bombs already electrical fuzes mayer described working bomb fuzes described electrical time fuzes also mentioned idea proximity fuze ie fuze detonates warhead nears target fuze described sensed target changes partial capacitances practice turned impracticable

gave invited talk royal united services institute publicly revealed first time existence importance oslo oslo report told us germans two kinds radar equipment large rockets developed important experimental establishment peenemünde rocketdriven glider bombs tried also much fact many people argued must plant germans one man could possibly known developments report described war progressed one development another actually appeared obvious report largely correct dull moments war used look oslo report see coming along next part talk caught eye press widely publicized jones revealed reports
