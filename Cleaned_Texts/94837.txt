omnivore ˈɒmnɪvɔːr animal ability eat survive plant animal obtaining energy nutrients plant animal matter omnivores digest carbohydrates protein fat fiber metabolize nutrients energy sources often ability incorporate food sources algae fungi bacteria omnivores come diverse backgrounds often independently evolved sophisticated consumption capabilities instance dogs evolved primarily carnivorous organisms carnivora pigs evolved primarily herbivorous organisms despite physical characteristics tooth morphology may reliable indicators diet mammals morphological adaptation observed variety different animals classified omnivores placed subcategories depending feeding behaviors frugivores include cassowaries orangutans grey insectivores include swallows pink fairy granivores include large ground finches mice animals omnivores yet still fall special niches terms feeding behavior preferred foods omnivores gives animals food security stressful times makes possible living less consistent word omnivore derives latin omnis vora vorare eat devour coined french later adopted english traditionally definition omnivory entirely behavioral means simply including animal vegetable tissue recent times advent advanced technological capabilities fields like gastroenterology biologists formulated standardized variation omnivore used labeling species actual ability obtain energy nutrients subsequently conditioned two contextspecific definitions taxonomic utility omnivores traditional behavioral definition limited since diet behavior phylogeny one omnivorous species might different another instance omnivorous pig digging roots scavenging fruit carrion taxonomically ecologically quite distinct omnivorous chameleon eats leaves insects term omnivory also always comprehensive deal mineral foods salt licks consumption plant animal material medical purposes would otherwise consumed ie zoopharmacognosy within nonomnivores though carnivora taxon species classification equivalent exists omnivores omnivores widespread across multiple taxonomic clades carnivora order include carnivorous species species within carnivora taxon carnivorous members carnivora formally referred common find physiological carnivores consuming materials plants physiological herbivores consuming material animals eg felines eating grass deer eating behavioral aspect would make omnivores physiological standpoint may due zoopharmacognosy physiologically animals must able obtain energy nutrients plant animal materials considered omnivorous thus animals still able classified carnivores herbivores obtaining nutrients materials originating sources seemingly complement classification instance well documented animals giraffes camels cattle gnaw bones preferably dry bones particular minerals felines usually regarded obligate carnivores occasionally eat grass regurgitate indigestibles eg hair bones aid hemoglobin production occasionally found animals historically classified carnivorous may deliberately eat plant material example considered american alligators alligator mississippiensis may physiologically omnivorous investigations conducted occasionally eat fruits suggested alligators probably ate fruits accidentally lifehistory omnivores specialized classification given organisms change eating habits life species grazing waterfowl like geese known eat mainly animal tissue one stage lives plant matter true many insects beetles family begin eating animal tissue larvae change eating plant matter mature likewise many mosquito species early life eat plants assorted detritus mature males continue eat plant matter nectar whereas females anopheles aedes culex also eat blood reproduce although cases exist herbivores eating meat carnivores eating plant matter classification omnivore refers adaptation main food source species general exceptions make either individual animals species whole omnivorous concept omnivore regarded scientific classification clear set measurable relevant criteria would need considered differentiate omnivore categories eg faunivore folivore researchers argue evolution species herbivory carnivory carnivory herbivory would rare except via intermediate stage various mammals omnivorous wild species hominids badgers bears foxes coatis civets hedgehogs opossums skunks sloths raccoons hamsters bear species individual diets range almost exclusively herbivorous hypocarnivore almost exclusively carnivorous hypercarnivore depending food sources available locally seasonally polar bears classified carnivores taxonomically order carnivora behaviorally subsist largely carnivorous diet depending species bear generally preference one class food plants animals digested differently canines including wolves dogs dingoes coyotes eat plant matter general preference evolutionarily geared towards however maned wolf canid whose diet naturally plant matter like arboreal species squirrels primarily granivores subsisting nuts however like virtually mammals squirrels avidly consume animal food becomes available example american eastern gray squirrel introduced parts britain continental europe south africa effect populations nesting birds often serious consumption eggs various birds omnivorous diets varying berries nectar insects worms fish small rodents examples include cranes cassowaries chickens related corvids kea rallidae rheas addition lizards galapagos lava lizard turtles fish piranhas catfish invertebrates omnivorous quite often mainly herbivorous creatures eagerly eat small quantities animal food becomes available although trivial time omnivorous herbivorous birds sparrows often feed chicks insects food needed close inspection appears nectarfeeding birds sunbirds rely ants insects find flowers richer supply protein essential nutrients cobaltvitamin absent nectar similarly monkeys many species eat maggoty fruit sometimes clear preference sound refer animals omnivorous otherwise question context emphasis
