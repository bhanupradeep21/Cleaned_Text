characterized approximately medullary thyroid cancer cases genetic nature caused mutation ret protooncogene mtc occurs termed sporadic medullary thyroid cancer medullary thyroid cancer seen people multiple endocrine neoplasia type medullary thyroid cancer due hereditary genetic disorder occurs without endocrine tumours termed familial medullary thyroid cancer major clinical symptom metastatic

multiple endocrine neoplasia accounts approximately medullary thyroid carcinomas seventyfive percent medullary thyroid carcinoma occurs individuals without identifiable family history assigned term sporadic individuals develop sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma tend older extensive disease time initial presentation family history screening likely initiated early age hereditary form approximately sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas somatic mutation one occurs within single parafollicular cell ret protooncogene mutation presumed initiating event although could yet unidentified causes increased serum concentration calcitonin harmful useful marker tested second marker carcinoembryonic antigen cea also produced medullary thyroid carcinoma released blood useful serum blood tumor marker general measurement serum cea less sensitive serum calcitonin detecting presence tumor less minute minute variability therefore useful indicator tumor mass diagnosis primarily performed via fine needle aspiration lesion thyroid distinguish types thyroid microscopic examination show amyloid stroma hyperplasia parafollicular cells recent cochrane systematic review assessed diagnostic accuracy basal stimulated calcitonin medullary thyroid although basal combined basal stimulated calcitonin testing presented high accuracy sensitivity specificity results high risk bias due design
