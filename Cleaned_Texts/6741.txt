muscle relaxant drug affects skeletal muscle function decreases muscle tone may used alleviate symptoms muscle spasms pain hyperreflexia term muscle relaxant used refer two major therapeutic groups neuromuscular blockers spasmolytics neuromuscular blockers act interfering transmission neuromuscular end plate central nervous system cns activity often used surgical procedures intensive care emergency medicine cause temporary paralysis spasmolytics also known centrally acting muscle relaxant used alleviate musculoskeletal pain spasms reduce spasticity variety neurological conditions neuromuscular blockers spasmolytics often grouped together muscle term commonly used refer spasmolytics earliest known use muscle relaxant drugs natives amazon basin south america used poisontipped arrows produced death skeletal muscle paralysis first documented century european explorers encountered poison known today curare led earliest scientific studies pharmacology active ingredient tubocurarine well many synthetic derivatives played significant role scientific experiments determine function acetylcholine neuromuscular neuromuscular blocking drugs became established muscle relaxants practice anesthesia us food drug administration fda approved use carisoprodol metaxalone august cyclobenzaprine august skeletal muscle relaxants type used around world come number drug categories drugs used primarily indication include orphenadrine anticholinergic chlorzoxazone tizanidine clonidine relative diazepam tetrazepam benzodiazepines mephenoxalone methocarbamol dantrolene drugs longer rarely used relax skeletal muscles include meprobamate barbiturates methaqualone glutethimide like subcategories opioids muscle relaxant properties marketed combination drugs skeletal andor smooth muscle relaxants whole opium products ketobemidone piritramide fentanyl preparations equagesic muscle relaxation paralysis theoretically occur interrupting function several sites including central nervous system myelinated somatic nerves unmyelinated motor nerve terminals nicotinic acetylcholine receptors motor end plate muscle membrane contractile apparatus neuromuscular blockers function blocking transmission end plate neuromuscular junction normally nerve impulse arrives motor nerve terminal initiating influx calcium ions causes exocytosis synaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine acetylcholine diffuses across synaptic cleft may hydrolysed acetylcholine esterase ache bind nicotinic receptors located motor end plate binding two acetylcholine molecules results conformational change receptor opens sodiumpotassium channel nicotinic receptor allows na ions enter cell k ions leave cell causing depolarization end plate resulting muscle following depolarization acetylcholine molecules removed end plate region enzymatically hydrolysed normal end plate function blocked two mechanisms nondepolarizing agents tubocurarine block agonist acetylcholine binding nicotinic receptors activating thereby preventing depolarization alternatively depolarizing agents succinylcholine nicotinic receptor agonists mimic ach block muscle contraction depolarizing extent desensitizes receptor longer initiate action potential cause muscle classes neuromuscular blocking drugs structurally similar acetylcholine endogenous ligand many cases containing two acetylcholine molecules linked endtoend rigid carbon ring system pancuronium nondepolarizing generation neuronal signals motor neurons cause muscle contractions dependent balance synaptic excitation inhibition motor neuron receives spasmolytic agents generally work either enhancing level inhibition reducing level excitation inhibition enhanced mimicking enhancing actions endogenous inhibitory substances gaba may act level cortex brain stem spinal cord three areas traditionally referred centrally acting muscle relaxants however known every agent class cns activity eg dantrolene name sources still use term centrally acting muscle relaxant according mesh dantrolene usually classified centrally acting muscle world health organization atc uses term centrally acting adds distinct category directly acting agents use terminology dates back least term spasmolytic also considered synonym spasmolytics carisoprodol cyclobenzaprine metaxalone methocarbamol commonly prescribed low back pain neck pain fibromyalgia tension headaches myofascial pain however recommended firstline agents acute low back pain effective paracetamol nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs fibromyalgia effective nevertheless lowquality evidence suggests muscle relaxants add benefit treatment general highquality evidence supports drug shown better another adverse effects particularly dizziness concerns possible abuse interaction drugs especially increased sedation risk limit muscle relaxant chosen based adverseeffect profile tolerability muscle relaxants according one study advised orthopedic conditions rather neurological conditions spasticity cerebral palsy multiple dantrolene although thought primarily peripherally acting agent associated cns effects whereas baclofen activity strictly associated cns muscle relaxants thought useful painful disorders based theory pain induces spasm spasm causes pain however considerable evidence contradicts general muscle relaxants approved fda longterm use however rheumatologists often prescribe cyclobenzaprine nightly daily basis increase stage sleep increasing sleep stage patients feel refreshed morning improving sleep also beneficial patients muscle relaxants tizanidine prescribed treatment tension diazepam carisoprodol recommended older adults pregnant women people depression history drug alcohol enhancement inhibition cns spasmolytic agents side effects sedation drowsiness may cause dependence longterm use several agents also abuse potential prescription strictly benzodiazepines diazepam interact gabaa receptor central nervous system used patients muscle spasm almost origin produces sedation individuals doses required reduce muscle baclofen considered least effective diazepam reducing spasticity causes much less sedation acts gaba agonist gabab receptors brain spinal cord resulting hyperpolarization neurons expressing receptor likely due increased potassium ion conductance baclofen also inhibits neural function presynaptically reducing calcium ion influx thereby reducing release excitatory neurotransmitters brain spinal cord may also reduce pain patients inhibiting release substance p spinal cord clonidine imidazoline compounds also shown reduce muscle spasms central nervous system activity tizanidine perhaps thoroughly studied clonidine analog agonist receptors reduces spasticity doses result significantly less hypotension neurophysiologic studies show depresses excitatory feedback muscles would normally increase muscle tone therefore minimizing furthermore several clinical trials indicate tizanidine similar efficacy spasmolytic agents diazepam baclofen different spectrum adverse hydantoin derivative dantrolene spasmolytic agent unique mechanism action outside cns reduces skeletal muscle strength inhibiting excitationcontraction coupling muscle fiber normal muscle contraction calcium released sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor channel causes tensiongenerating interaction actin myosin dantrolene interferes release calcium binding ryanodine receptor blocking endogenous ligand ryanodine competitive inhibition muscle contracts rapidly sensitive dantrolene muscle contracts slowly although cardiac muscle smooth muscle depressed slightly likely release calcium sarcoplasmic reticulum involves slightly different process major adverse effects dantrolene include general muscle weakness sedation occasionally common spasmolytic agents include methocarbamol carisoprodol chlorzoxazone cyclobenzaprine gabapentin metaxalone orphenadrine thiocolchicoside muscle relaxant antiinflammatory analgesic effects unknown mechanism acts competitive antagonist gabaa glycine receptors similar potencies well nicotinic acetylcholine receptors albeit much lesser powerful proconvulsant activity used seizureprone patients commonly report sedation main adverse effect muscle relaxants usually people become less alert effects drugs people normally advised drive vehicles operate heavy machinery muscle relaxants effects cyclobenzaprine produces confusion lethargy well anticholinergic side effects taken excess combination substances may also toxic body adjusts medication possible patients experience dry mouth fatigue lightheadedness constipation blurred vision serious unlikely side effects may experienced including mental mood changes possible confusion hallucinations difficulty urinating cases serious rare side effects may experienced irregular heartbeat yellowing eyes skin fainting abdominal pain including stomach ache nausea vomiting lack appetite seizures dark urine loss patients taking carisoprodol prolonged time reported dependence withdrawal abuse although cases reported patients addiction history effects also reported patients took combination drugs abuse potential fewer cases reports carisoprodolassociated abuse appeared used without drugs abuse common side effects eventually caused metaxalone include dizziness headache
