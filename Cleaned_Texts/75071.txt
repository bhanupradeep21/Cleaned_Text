carbetocin sold brand names pabal among others medication used prevent excessive bleeding childbirth particularly following cesarean appears work well due less economical options use recommended nhs given injection vein side effects differ little treatment use recommended people epilepsy carbetocin manufactured long acting form works activating oxytocin receptor causes uterus carbetocin first described approved medical use canada united kingdom world health organizations list essential available united states carbetocin approved use immediately following elective cesarean section local spinal anesthesia since uterus contract following incision cesarean section exogenous administration oxytocin analog necessary restore uterine tone prevent safety carbetocin following vaginal births emergency cesarean sections established though studies suggested efficacy following vaginal births following cesarean sections studies shown ug dose following vaginal delivery caused contractions adverse side carbetocin also shown increase uterine involution return uterus contracted state birth baby humans horses heatstable carbetocin formulation require strict refrigeration found good oxytocin reduction postpartum hemorrhage vaginal hoped make oxytocic hemorrhage control widely available less particularly useful regions developing countries cold chain drug transport storage unreliable power outages equipment due carbetocins considerably longer halflife effects longer lasting oxytocin homologs oxytocin single carbetocin dose compared placebo eighthour intravenous drip oxytocin randomized blind study necessitated less additional oxytocin therapy following cesarean section oxytocin receptor antagonists barusiban atosiban opposite effect depressing oxytocin receptor activity used stop premature labor uterine ten forty percent people experience nausea vomiting abdominal pain itching skin increased body temperature trembling weakness one five percent peoples may experience back chest pain dizziness anemia chills sweating metallic taste tachycardia respiratory contraindications use carbetocin include inappropriate timing labor delivery parturition induce labor allergic reactions carbetocin oxytocin additionally carbetocin used person high blood pressure cardiovascular problems overdosage repeated use carbetocin particularly used pregnancy could cause hyperexcitation oxytocin receptors resulting excessive prolonged stimulation uterine contractions increasing risk uterine rupture placental abruption fetal respiratory distress postpartum due oxytocins close sequence homology vasopressin oxytocin analogs often bind much lower affinity vasopressin receptors uterine lining may consequently interact disrupt vasopressin circuitry feedback loops carbetocin may work synergistically drugs dinoprostone misoprostol ripen cervix concurrent use drugs risky particularly pregnancy prenatal care possibly causing premature labor abortionmedical citation needed carbetocin works oxytocic antihemorrhagic uterotonic drug peripheral nervous system common causes postpartum hemorrhage lack tone uterus overstretching use carbetocin functions agonist peripheral oxytocin receptors particularly myometrium lesser affinity myoepithelial cells oxytocin receptors g mechanism action involves second messengers production inositol carbetocin mimics binding carbetocin oxytocin agonists shown nonselective extracellular nterminus loops oxytocin receptor shows equal affinity oxytocin carbetocin biological effect carbetocin almost endogenous exogenous carbetocin much longer lasting effect oxytocin necessitating single dose carbetocin inhibits endogenous oxytocin release interrupting uterine feedback loop hypothalamus decreasing central peripheral release carbetocin biased agonist oxytocin pregnancy synthesis oxytocin receptors uterus greatly increases reaching peak labor delivery consequently administration carbetocin another oxytocin analog immediately following birth increased uterotonic contractile effect application carbetocin affect nonpregnant uterus lower oxytocin receptor carbetocin also functions thicken blood preventing postpartum carbetocin used induce augment labor since could cause cardiac respiratory distress mother carbetocin used hospital prescription administered intravenously intramuscularly cases recommended dose average adult female ug contractile effects uterus apparent within two minutes observed approximately one though maximum binding occurs minutes intramuscular injection administration performed immediately following parturition minimize risk postpartum hemorrhage inducing uterine contractions increasing muscle tone thickening blood uterine stimulation needed treatment forms oxytocic
