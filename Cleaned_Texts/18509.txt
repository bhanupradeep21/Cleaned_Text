plant genetics study genes genetic variation heredity specifically generally considered field biology botany intersects frequently many life sciences strongly linked study information systems plant genetics similar many ways animal genetics differs key areas discoverer genetics gregor mendel late scientist augustinian friar mendel studied trait inheritance patterns way traits handed parents offspring observed organisms famously pea plants inherit traits way discrete units inheritance term still used today somewhat ambiguous definition referred gene much mendels work plants still forms basis modern plant genetics plants like known organisms use dna pass traits animal genetics often focuses parentage lineage sometimes difficult plant genetics due fact plants unlike animals selffertile speciation easier many plants due unique genetic abilities well adapted polyploidy plants unique able produce energydense carbohydrates via photosynthesis process achieved use chloroplasts chloroplasts like superficially similar mitochondria possess dna chloroplasts thus provide additional reservoir genes genetic diversity extra layer genetic complexity found animals study plant genetics major economic impacts many staple crops genetically modified increase yields confer pest disease resistance provide resistance herbicides increase nutritional value earliest evidence plant domestication found dated years present ancestral wheat initially selection may happened unintentionally likely years ago farmers basic understanding heredity inheritance foundation selection time gave rise new crop species varieties basis crops grow eat research today field plant genetics began work gregor johann mendel often called father genetics augustinian priest scientist born july austriahungary worked abbey st thomas brünn brno czech republic organism choice studying inheritance traits pea plant mendels work tracked many phenotypic traits pea plants height flower color seed characteristics mendel showed inheritance traits follows two particular laws later named seminal work genetics versuche über pflanzenhybriden experiments plant hybrids published went almost entirely unnoticed prominent botanists uk like sir gavin de beer recognized importance republished english mendel died significance mendels work recognized turn century rediscovery prompted foundation modern genetics discoveries deduction segregation ratios subsequent laws used research gain better understanding plant genetics also play large role plant mendels works along works charles darwin alfred wallace selection provided basis much genetics discipline early botanists statisticians began examine segregation ratios put forth mendel castle discovered individual traits may segregate change time selection selection stopped environmental effects taken account genetic ratio stops changing reach sort stasis foundation population independently discovered g h hardy w weinberg ultimately gave rise concept equilibrium published thorough exploration history population genetics see history population genetics bob allard around time genetic plant breeding experiments maize began maize selfpollinated experiences phenomenon called inbreeding depression researchers like nils heribertnilsson recognized crossing plants forming hybrids able combine traits two desirable parents crop also experienced heterosis hybrid vigor beginning identifying gene interactions epistasis early donald forsha jones invented method led first hybrid maize seed available large demand hybrid seed us corn belt mid led rapid growth seed production industry ultimately seed research strict requirements producing hybrid seed led development careful population inbred line maintenance keeping plants isolated unable outcross produced plants better allowed researchers tease different genetic concepts structure populations allowed scientist dobzhansky wright ra fisher develop evolutionary biology concepts well explore speciation time statistics underlying plant work laid foundations future genetic discoveries linkage disequilibrium breeding experiments taking place scientists nikolai charles rick interested wild progenitor species modern crop plants botanists often would travel regions high plant diversity seek wild species given rise domesticated species selection determining crops changed time selection initially based morphological features developed time chromosomal analysis genetic marker analysis eventual genomic analysis identifying traits underlying genetics allowed transferring useful genes traits controlled either wild mutant plants crop plants understanding manipulating plant genetics heyday green revolution brought norman borlaug time molecule heredity dna also discovered allowed scientists actually examine manipulate genetic information directly deoxyribonucleic acid dna nucleic acid contains genetic instructions used development functioning known living organisms viruses main role dna molecules longterm storage information dna often compared set blueprints recipe code since contains instructions needed construct components cells proteins rna molecules dna segments carry genetic information called genes location within genome referred genetic loci dna sequences structural purposes involved regulating use genetic information geneticists including plant geneticists use sequence dna advantage better find understand role different genes within given genome research plant breeding manipulation different plant genes loci encoded dna sequence plant chromosomes various methods done produce different desired genotypes result different desired plant meiosis doublestrand breaks introduced dna genome breaks repaired recombination process employing gene products homologous recombinases employed eukaryotes central elements eukaryotic meiosis pairing homologous chromosomes doublestrand break formation homologous recombinational processes appear optimized repairing dna damage plants like known living organisms pass traits using dna plants however unique living organisms fact chloroplasts like mitochondria chloroplasts dna like animals plants experience somatic mutations regularly mutations contribute germ line ease since flowers develop ends branches composed somatic cells people known centuries mutant branches called sports fruit sport economically desirable new cultivar may obtained plant species capable selffertilization nearly exclusively selffertilizers means plant mother father offspring rare occurrence animals scientists hobbyists attempting make crosses different plants must take special measures prevent plants selffertilizing plant breeding people create hybrids plant species economic aesthetic reasons example yield corn increased nearly fivefold past century due part discovery proliferation hybrid corn plant genetics used predict combination plants may produce plant hybrid vigor conversely many discoveries plant genetics come studying effects hybridization plants generally capable surviving indeed flourishing polyploids polyploid organisms two sets homologous chromosomes example humans two sets homologous chromosomes meaning typical human copies different chromosomes total wheat hand distinct chromosomes considered hexaploid copies chromosome total animals inheritable germline polyploidy less common spontaneous chromosome increases may even survive past fertilization plants however less problem polyploid individuals created frequently variety processes however created usually cross back parental type polyploid individuals capable selffertilizing give rise new genetically distinct lineage start new species often called instant speciation polyploids generally larger fruit economically desirable trait many human food crops including wheat maize potatoes strawberries tobacco either accidentally deliberately created polyploids arabidopsis thaliana also known thale cress model organism study plant genetics drosophila species fruit fly understanding early genetics thaliana understanding plant genetics first plant ever genome sequenced year small genome making initial sequencing attainable genome size mbp encodes incredible amount research done plant database called arabidopsis information resource tair established repository multiple data sets information species information housed tair include complete genome sequence along gene structure gene product information gene expression dna seed stocks genome maps genetic physical markers publications information thaliana research many natural inbred accessions thaliana often referred ecotypes available useful genetic research natural variation used identify loci important biotic abiotic stress brachypodium distachyon experimental model grass many attributes make excellent model temperate cereals unlike wheat tetra hexaploid species brachypodium diploid relatively small genome mbp short lifecycle making genomic studies simpler
