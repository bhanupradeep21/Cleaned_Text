staging systems treatment options may result non recurrence cancer see radio frequency ablation example hcc common use barcelona clinic liver cancer staging treatments include surgery medications ablation methods described sections many chemotherapeutic drugs approved liver cancer including atezolizumab nivolumab keytruda stivarga increasingly immunotherapy agents also called targeted cancer therapies precision medicine used treat hepatobiliary recent advances liver cancer treatment exploring cells engineered chimeric antigen receptors cars targeting gap cells showing potential addressing tumors especially pediatric liver partial surgical resection recommended treatment hepatocellular carcinoma hcc patients sufficient hepatic function survival rates resection massively improved last decades ranges however recurrence rates resection exceed whether due spread initial tumor formation new tumors liver transplantation also considered cases hcc form treatment tolerated tumor fits specific criteria milan criteria general patients considered liver transplantation multiple hepatic lesions severe underlying liver dysfunction percutaneous ablation nonsurgical treatment offer cure many forms percutaneous ablation consist either injecting chemicals liver ethanol acetic acid producing extremes temperature using radio frequency ablation microwaves lasers cryotherapy radio frequency ablation one best reputations hcc limitations include inability treat tumors close organs blood vessels due heat generation heat sink effect addition longterm outcomes percutaneous ablation procedures hcc well studied general surgery preferred treatment modality possible systemic chemotherapeutics routinely used hcc although local chemotherapy may used procedure known transarterial chemoembolization tace procedure drugs kill cancer cells interrupt blood supply applied tumor systemic drugs efficacy treatment hcc research molecular pathways involved production liver cancer produced sorafenib targeted therapy drug prevents cell proliferation blood cell growth sorafenib obtained fda approval treatment advanced hepatocellular carcinoma november drug provides survival benefit advanced transarterial radioembolization trace another option procedure radiation treatment targeted tumor trace still considered add treatment rather first choice treatment dual treatments radiotherapy plus chemoembolization local chemotherapy systemic chemotherapy targeted therapy drugs may show benefit radiotherapy ablation methods eg radiofrequency ablation microwave ablation also option hcc method recommended small localized liver tumors recommended area treated radiofrequency ablation centimeters resection option cholangiocarcinoma fewer cases cholangiocarcinoma resectable diagnosis reason majority intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas able surgically removed often multiple focal tumors within surgery recurrence rates liver transplant may used partial resection option adjuvant chemoradiation may benefit cholangiocarcinomas form perihilar region photodynamic therapy used improve quality life survival time unresectable photodynamic therapy novel treatment uses light activated molecules treat tumor compounds activated tumor region laser light causes release toxic reactive oxygen species killing tumor systemic chemotherapies gemcitabine cisplatin sometimes used inoperable cases radio frequency ablation transarterial chemoembolization internal radiotherapy brachytherapy show promise treatment sometimes improve bile flow decrease symptoms patient radiotherapy may used adjuvant setting palliative treatment removing tumor either surgical resection liver transplant used treatment hepatoblastoma cases surgery offer cure chemotherapy may used surgery chemotherapy including cisplatin vincristine cyclophosphamide doxorubicin used systemic treatment hepatoblastoma drugs cisplatin seems many tumors end amenable surgical treatment options include surgically removing parts liver liver transplantation chemotherapy effective angiosarcomas hemangiosarcomas globally liver cancer common recent epidemiological data suggests liver cancer top
