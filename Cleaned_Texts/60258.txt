epidermis outermost three layers comprise skin inner layers dermis epidermis layer provides barrier infection environmental regulates amount water released body atmosphere transepidermal water epidermis composed multiple layers flattened overlie base layer stratum basale composed columnar cells arranged perpendicularly layers cells develop stem cells basal layer human epidermis familiar example epithelium particularly stratified squamous epithelium word epidermis derived latin ancient greek epidermis ancient greek epi upon ancient greek derma skin something related part epidermis termed epidermal epidermis primarily consists proliferating basal differentiated suprabasal comprise cells also contains melanocytes langerhans cells merkel inflammatory cells epidermal thickenings called rete ridges rete pegs extend downward dermal blood capillaries found beneath epidermis linked arteriole venule epidermis blood supply nourished almost exclusively diffused oxygen surrounding cellular mechanisms regulating water sodium levels enacs found layers epidermal cells tightly interconnected serve tight barrier exterior environment junctions epidermal cells adherens junction type

desquamation differentiated keratinocytes secrete keratin proteins contribute formation extracellular matrix integral part skin barrier function normal skin rate keratinocyte production equals rate taking two weeks cell journey stratum basale top stratum granulosum additional four weeks cross stratum entire epidermis replaced new cell growth period keratinocyte differentiation throughout epidermis part mediated calcium gradient increasing stratum basale outer stratum granulosum reaches maximum decreasing stratum corneum calcium concentration stratum corneum low part relatively dry cells able dissolve ions calcium gradient parallels keratinocyte differentiation considered key regulator formation epidermal elevation extracellular calcium concentrations induces increase
