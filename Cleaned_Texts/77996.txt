term linguistic performance used noam chomsky describe actual use language concrete used describe production sometimes called parole well comprehension performance defined opposition competence latter describes mental knowledge speaker listener part motivation distinction performance competence comes speech errors despite perfect understanding correct forms speaker language may unintentionally produce incorrect forms performance occurs real situations subject many nonlinguistic influences example distractions memory limitations affect lexical retrieval chomsky give rise errors production nonlinguistic factors completely independent actual knowledge establish speakers knowledge language competence distinct actual use language descriptor proponent explication published ferdinand de

grammatical competence pragmatic john hawkinss performancegrammar correspondence hypothesis pgch states syntactic structures grammars conventionalized based whether much structures preferred performance preference related structure complexity processing comprehension efficiency specifically complex structure refers structure containing linguistic elements words end structure beginning structural complexity results decreased processing efficiency since structure requires additional model seeks explain word order across languages based avoidance unnecessary complexity favour increased processing efficiency speakers make automatic calculation immediate constituentictoword order ratio produce structure highest structures high ictoword order structures contain fewest words required listener parse structure constituents results efficient headinitial structures includes example svo vso word order speakers goal order sentence constituents least complex svo word order exemplified english consider example sentences three immediate constituents ics present verb phrase namely vp four words went london required parse vp constituents therefore ictoword ratio contrast vp still composed three ics six words required determine constituent structure vp went late afternoon thus ratio hawkins proposes speakers prefer produce since higher ictoword ratio leads faster efficient hawkins supports analysis providing performance data demonstrate preference speakers ordering short phrases long phrases producing headinitial structures table based english data illustrates

specifically early commitment refers commitment point present earlier utterance late commitment refers commitment point present later explains early commitment favour listener since early prediction subsequent structure enables faster processing comparatively late commitment favour speaker postponing decision making giving speaker time plan wasow illustrates utterance planning influences syntactic word order testing early versus late commitment heavynp shifted hnps sentences idea examine patterns hnps determine performance data show sentences structured favour speaker following examples illustrate meant early versus late commitment heavynp shift applies sentences wasow looked two types vt transitive verbs require np objects heavynp shift applied np available early provide additional information sentence structure appearing late sentence example late commitment contrast heavynp shift shifted np right soon uttered listener knows vp must contain np pp words uttered allows listener predict remaining structure sentence early thus transitive verbs hnps results early commitment favors listener vp prepositional verbs take np object immediately following pp np object hnps applied listener needs hear word something order know utterance contains pp np since object np optional something shifted later sentence thus prepositional verbs hnps results late commitment favours speaker based information wasow predicted sentences constructed speakers perspective heavynp shift would rarely apply sentences containing transitive verb would apply frequently sentences containing prepositional verb opposite prediction made sentences constructed listeners test predictions wasow analyzed performance data corpora data rates occurrence hnps vt vp found hnps occurred twice frequently vp vt therefore supporting predictions made speakers contrast find evidence support predictions made based listeners perspective words given data hnps applied sentences containing transitive verb result favors listener wasow found hnps applied transitive verb sentences rare performance data thus supporting speakers perspective additionally hnps applied prepositional verb structures result favors speaker study performance data wasow found evidence hnps frequently applied prepositional verb structures supporting speakers based findings wasow concludes hnps correlated speakers preference late commitment thereby demonstrating speaker performance preference influence word order dominant views grammar largely oriented towards competence many including chomsky argued complete model grammar able account performance data chomsky argues competence studied first thereby allowing study systems constraint grammars built performance starting point comprehension case constraint traditional models generative grammar great deal success describing structure languages less successful describing language interpreted real situations example traditional grammar describes sentence underlying structure different surface structure speakers actually produce real conversation however listener interprets meaning sentence real time surface structure goes kind online
