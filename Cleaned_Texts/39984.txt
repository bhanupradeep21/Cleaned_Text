vasoactive intestinal peptide also known vasoactive intestinal polypeptide vip peptide hormone vasoactive intestine vip peptide amino acid residues belongs glucagonsecretin superfamily ligand class ii g vip produced many tissues vertebrates including gut pancreas cortex suprachiasmatic nuclei hypothalamus vip stimulates contractility heart causes vasodilation increases glycogenolysis lowers
