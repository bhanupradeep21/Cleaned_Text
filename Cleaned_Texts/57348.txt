intelligence personality traditionally studied separate entities psychology recent work increasingly challenged view increasing number studies recently explored relationship intelligence personality particular big five personality traits intelligence personality common features example follow relatively stable pattern throughout whole one life degree genetically addition significant predictors various outcomes educational achievement occupational performance traditional view psychology personality intelligence studied strictly separate entities come scrutiny light modern personality historically psychologists drawn hard distinction intelligence personality arguing intelligence cognitive trait personality noncognitive however modern psychologists argue intelligence personality intertwined noting personality traits tend related specific cognitive patterns example neuroticism personality trait related rumination compulsive thinking possible similarly agreeableness personality trait related consideration others mental finding iq predicts work performance academic achievement health might also point link intelligence personality else grounds research considering ties intelligence personality may worth noting typically tested way intelligence assessed using ability tests iq tests whereas personality assessed using questionnaires suggested intelligence reflect individuals maximal performance personality reflect typical openness shows strongest positive relationship g general intelligence among big five personality traits main metaanalytic estimates correlations ranged individuals high level openness enjoy experience learning prefer intellectually stimulating environment metaanalytic research shows openness strongly related crystallized intelligence r fluid intelligence r psychologists recently pointed previous instruments used measure openness actually assessed two distinctive aspects first intellect reflects intellectual engagement perceived intelligence marked ideas second emotion reflects artistic contemplative qualities related engaged sensation perception marked fantasy aesthetics feelings intelligence strongly related intellectual engagement interest aesthetics basis intellect found associated neural system working memory related g whereas openness addition according study genetic behaviour intellect genetically closer intelligence neuroticism meaningful negative correlation intelligence main large metaanalyses obtained correlations around r debate exists extent correlation reflects substantive relationship issues measurement researchers noted neuroticism correlated test refers psychological distress experienced individuals prior evaluative researchers argued neuroticism leads test anxiety performance cognitive tests however others researchers argued test anxiety mostly incidental caused neuroticism contextual pressures lower cognitive according results longitudinal study conducted gow et al neuroticism influences agerelated decline intelligence small negative correlation neuroticism change level iq r although still debatable neuroticism reduces general intelligence study provided valuable evidence direction research addition interaction intelligence neuroticism found individuals high level neuroticism demonstrated poor performance health adjustment low level therefore intelligence may act buffer compensate neuroticism individuals association conscientiousness intelligence complex uncertain researchers theorize people lower levels intelligence compensate lower level cognitive ability structured studies obtained negative others particular metaanalysis studies n obtained correlation r metaanalysis facetlevel correlations suggested preference order selfdiscipline may small negative correlation whereas conscientiousness facets related competence small positive correlation furthermore interaction found conscientiousness intelligence conscientiousness found stronger predictor safety behaviour individuals low level intelligence high interaction may also found educational occupational settings future studies therefore relatively speaking increase either conscientiousness intelligence may compensate deficiency metaanalyses found correlation overall extraversion metaanalytic evidence suggest aspects extraversion related assertiveness may slightly positively related intelligence whereas aspects related sociability may slightly negatively related moderating variables relationship extraversion g including differences assessment instruments samples age sensory stimulation example meaningful correlation found extraversion intelligence samples furthermore bates rock used raven matrices found extraverts performed better introverts increasing auditory whereas introverts performed best silence result consistent revelle et al metaanalytic research suggests agreeableness intelligence however components agreeableness found related intelligence example aggression negatively associated intelligence r around unintelligent people may experience frustration may lead aggression intelligence may share biological addition emotional perception emotional facilitation also components agreeableness found significantly correlated may emotional perception emotional facilitation components emotional intelligence researchers found
