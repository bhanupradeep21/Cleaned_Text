cortex study analyzing visual working memory person aphantasia found mental imagery functional role areas visual cognition one highprecision working memory person aphantasia performed significantly worse controls visual working memory trials requiring highest degree precision lacked metacognitive insight study concluded experience aphantasia also experience reduced imagery senses less vivid
