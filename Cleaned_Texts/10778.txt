haemochromatosis type type iron overload disorder associated deficiencies transferrin receptor exhibits autosomal recessive inheritance first confirmed case diagnosed french doctor trousseau later german doctor von recklinghausen indicated liver contains iron due bleeding considered cause called pigment english doctor sheldons groundbreaking book titled haemochromatosis reviewed patient case reports presented idea haemochromatosis congenital metabolic hereditary haemochromatosis congenital disorder affects regulation iron metabolism thus causing increased gut absorption iron gradual buildup pathologic iron deposits liver internal organs joint capsules iron overload could potentially cause serious disease age years final stages disease major symptoms include liver cirrhosis diabetes bronzecolored skin four types hereditary hemochromatosis classified depending age onset factors genetic cause mode presence haemochromatosis type realized many signs symptoms throughout bodily systems systems affected haemochromatosis type include skeletal endocrine cardiovascular neurological genitourinary integumentary also implications associated persons hematology laboratory analysis results inherit haemochromatosis type asymptomatic common symptoms symptoms include severe fatigue impotence arthralgia hepatomegaly skin pigmentation specific diseases conditions show correlation haemochromatosis type following lymphopenia neutropenia thrombocytopenic purpura decreased libido hypogonadism fibrosis increased serum iron increased transferrin saturation increased liver transaminases disease haemochromatosis type inherited autosomal recessive manner individuals disease exhibit mutation either copies compound heterozygotes two mutations one mutation one hfe people one copy mutated mutations hfe labeled carriers carriers typically exhibit signs symptoms disease disease shown reduced penetrance thus people pathogenic variants gene may never present symptoms related gene involved patients diagnosed type hemochromatosis hfe often cause hereditary hfe gene provides instructions producing protein located surface cells primarily liver intestinal

called transferrin transferrin receptor bound transferrin iron enters liver cells likely hfe protein regulates iron levels liver cells preventing transferrin binding transferrin receptor hfe protein regulates production protein called hepcidin hepcidin produced liver determines much iron absorbed diet released storage sites body hfe protein bound transferrin receptor binds group proteins includes

chromosome mutation hemochromatosis type gene chromosome causes hemochromatosis type disease manifest without showing symptoms symptoms emerge time disease therefore become severe symptoms emerge early disease generally less severe may include conditions fatigue weakness skin discoloration loss sex drive joint pain late disease people may experience liver disease well disease major organs excess iron deposited time people also develop diabetes heart problems abdominal paincitation needed like many genetic rare diseases diagnosis haemochromatosis type challenging order formulate diagnosis healthcare professionals view medical history symptoms physical exam laboratory test genetic testing registry provides information genetic tests haemochromatosis type different clinical tests available including two biochemical genetics tests molecular genetics tests also one research test availablecitation needed treatment hemochromatosis type may include reducing iron levels removing blood phlebotomy iron chelation therapy diet changes treatment complications disease purpose treatment reduce amount iron body normal levels prevent delay organ damage excess iron maintain normal amounts iron throughout phlebotomy helps remove excess iron body treatment begins weekly therapeutic phlebotomy occasionally treatment initially twice week iron levels elevated maintenance phlebotomy usually involved treatment every months iron chelation therapy may recommended people health issues dietary recommendations may include avoiding alcohol red meat people hemochromatosis recommended take iron vitamin c prevalence ethnic norwegian population homozygous heterozygous inheritance respectively makes haemochromatosis one common hereditary diseases type hemochromatosis one
