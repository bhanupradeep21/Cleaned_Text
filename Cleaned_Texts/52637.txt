dubbed anthracotheriid unit commonplace libycosaurus petrochii averaging ages samples reported approximate date million years methods soon challenged beauvilain clarified toumaï found loose sediments surface rather unearthed probably exposed harsh sun wind time considering encrusted iron shell desert varnish would mean unsafe assume skull nearby sediments deposited time making radiometric dating sahelanthropus fossils lack white silaceous cement present every fossil site would mean date different time periods large mammal fossils scattered across area instead concentrated like sahelanthropus fossils discoverers originally believed sahelanthropus fossils dumped palaeontologist geologist later dismissed skull complete thrown away like alain beauvilain jeanpierre watté argued toumaï purposefully buried grave skull also found two parallel rows large mammal fossils seemingly forming cm cm ft ft box grave orientated direction towards mecca sides skull exposed wind eroded meaning skull somehow turned argued toumaï first buried nomads identified skull human collected nearby limb fossils believing belong skull buried reburied sometime century muslims reorientated grave towards mecca fossils describing species brunet et al noted combination features would considered archaic derived species human line subtribe hominina latter bipedal locomotion reduced canine teeth

sister group million year old ardipithecus later classification sahelanthropus hominina well ardipithecus million year old orrorin odds molecular analyses time placed chlca million years ago based high mutation rate mutations per generation genera anatomically derived represent basal hominin group containing chimps humans molecular data would permit classification ancient nowextinct lineages

gorillas represents earliest known member lineage tchadensis indicate last common ancestor humans chimpanzees unlikely closely resemble extant chimpanzees previously supposed significant sexual dimorphism known existed early hominins difference ardipithecus sahelanthropus may large enough warrant separate species existing fossils include relatively small cranium five pieces jaw teeth making head mixture derived primitive features virtual reconstruction interior braincase indicated cranial capacity similar extant chimpanzees approximately third size modern human teeth brow ridges facial structure differ markedly found modern humans cranial features show flatter face ushaped tooth rows small canines anterior foramen magnum heavy brow ridges known skull suffered large amount distortion time fossilisation discovery cranium dorsoventrally flattened right side original description brunet et al said would unreasonable speculate sahelanthropus capable maintaining upright posture walking bipedally reported limb bones postcranial material anything skull based reconstructed original orientation foramen magnum skull connects spine classification sahelanthropus hominina based facial comparisons one diagnostic characteristics hominina soon disputed orientation foramen magnum entirely conclusive piece evidence regard question habitual posture features used classify sahelanthropus hominina entirely unique femur formally described study concluded consistent habitual however recent postcranial evidence suggests characteristics consistent habitual bipedalism arboreal clambering ulnar morphologies including bone curvature crosssection orientation combine rule quadrupedalism femoral morphologies allowing higher compressive loads bipedalism strongly suggest hominin characteristics sahelanthropus however meyer colleagues examined ulna shaft argued sahelanthropus obligate biped based mathematical analysis locomotor behavior indicated forelimbs different functions compared modern humans hominins probably walked knuckles like modern gorillas chimpanzees examination required truly identify locomotor behavior ie whether exhibited facultative bipedalism
