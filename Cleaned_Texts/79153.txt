axis hpg axis also known axis refers hypothalamus pituitary gland gonadal glands individual endocrine glands single entity glands often act concert physiologists endocrinologists find convenient descriptive speak single system hpg axis plays critical part development regulation number bodys systems reproductive immune systems fluctuations axis cause changes hormones produced gland various local systemic effects body axis controls development reproduction aging animals gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh secreted hypothalamus gnrhexpressing neurons anterior portion pituitary gland produces luteinizing hormone lh folliclestimulating hormone fsh gonads produce estrogen testosterone oviparous organisms eg fish reptiles amphibians birds hpg axis commonly referred hypothalamuspituitarygonadalliver axis hpglaxis females many eggyolk chorionic proteins synthesized heterologously liver necessary ovocyte growth development examples necessary liver proteins vitellogenin choriogenin hpa hpg hpt axes three pathways hypothalamus pituitary direct neuroendocrine function hypothalamus located brain secretes gnrh travels anterior portion pituitary via hypophyseal portal system binds receptors secretory cells response gnrh stimulation cells produce lh fsh travel blood two hormones play important role communicating gonads females fsh lh act primarily activate ovaries produce estrogen inhibin regulate menstrual cycle ovarian cycle estrogen forms negative feedback loop inhibiting production gnrh hypothalamus inhibin acts inhibit activin peripherally produced hormone positively stimulates gnrhproducing cells follistatin also produced body tissue inhibits activin gives rest body control axis males lh stimulates interstitial cells located testicles produce testosterone fsh plays role spermatogenesis small amounts estrogen secreted males recent research shown neurosteroid axis exists helps cortex regulate hypothalamuss production addition leptin insulin stimulatory effects ghrelin inhibitory effects gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh secretion kisspeptin also influences gnrh one important functions hpg axis regulate reproduction controlling uterine ovarian females positive feedback loop estrogen luteinizing hormone help prepare follicle ovary uterus ovulation implantation egg released empty follicle sac begins produce progesterone inhibit hypothalamus anterior pituitary thus stopping estrogenlh positive feedback loop conception occurs placenta take secretion progesterone therefore mother ovulate conception occur decreasing excretion progesterone allow hypothalamus restart secretion gnrh hormone levels also control uterine menstrual cycle causing proliferation phase preparation ovulation secretory phase ovulation menstruation conception occur activation hpg axis males females puberty also causes individuals acquire secondary sex characteristicscitation needed males production gnrh lh fsh similar effects hormones fsh stimulates sustentacular cells release androgenbinding protein promotes testosterone binding lh binds interstitial cells causing secrete testosterone testosterone required normal spermatogenesis inhibits hypothalamus inhibin produced spermatogenic cells also inactivating activin inhibits hypothalamus puberty hormones levels remain relatively constantcitation needed activation deactivation hpg axis also helps regulate life birth fsh lh levels elevated females also lifetime supply primary oocytes levels decrease remain low childhood puberty hpg axis activated secretions estrogen ovaries testosterone testes activation estrogen testosterone causes physiological psychological changes activated hpg axis continues function men rest life becomes deregulated women leading menopause deregulation caused mainly lack oocytes normally produce estrogen create positive feedback loop several years activity hpg axis decreases women longer although males remain fertile death activity hpg axis decreases males age testes begin produce less testosterone leading condition known postpubertal cause decreased testosterone unclear current topic research postpubertal hypogonadism results progressive muscle mass decrease increase visceral fat mass loss libido impotence decreased attention increased risk fractures abnormal sperm productioncitation needed sex steroids also affect behavior sex steroids affect brains structure functioning development hormones help determine neurons synapse migrate result sexual physical differences lead differences behavior gnrh shown direct influence regulating brain structure function gonadotropins sex steroids activin shown effects thought fsh may important role brain development differentiation testosterone levels shown relate prosocial helps create synaptogenesis promoting neurite development migration activin promotes neural plasticity throughout lifespan regulates neurotransmitters peripheral neurons environment also affect hormones behavior disorders axis classified world health organization genetic mutations chromosomal abnormalities two sources hpg axis single mutations usually lead changes binding ability hormone receptor leading inactivation activation mutations occur genes coding gnrh lh fsh receptors depending hormone receptor unable bind different effects occur alter hpg axiscitation needed example male mutation gnrh coding gene could result hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism mutation cause gain function lh receptor result condition known testotoxicosis cause puberty occur ages years loss function lh receptors cause male pseudohermaphroditism females mutations would analogous effects hormone replacement used initiate puberty continue gene mutation occurs gene coding hormone chromosomal mutations tend affect androgen production rather hpg axiscitation needed hpg axis suppressed hormonal birth control administration although often described preventing pregnancy mimicking pregnancy state hormonal birth control effective works hpg axis mimic luteal phase womans cycle primary active ingredients synthetic progestins mimic biologically derived progesterone synthetic progestin prevents hypothalamus releasing gnrh pituitary releasing lh fsh therefore prevents ovarian cycle entering menstrual phase prevents follicle development ovulation also result many side effects similar symptoms pregnancy alzheimers shown hormonal component could possibly used method prevent male contraceptives utilizing sex hormones approach problem similar way hpg axis also suppressed gnrh antagonists continuous administration gnrh agonist following applications ovulation induction usually initially performed giving antiestrogen clomifene citrate letrozole order decrease negative feedback pituitary gland resulting increase fsh aim increasing folliculogenesis main initial medical treatment anovulation environment large impact hpg axis example women eating disorders tend oligomenorrhea secondary amenorrhea starvation anorexia nervosa bulimia causes hpg axis deactivate causing womens ovarian uterine cycles stop stress physical exercise weight loss correlated oligomenorrhea secondary similarly environmental factors also affect men stress causing impotence prenatal exposure alcohol affect hormones regulating fetal development resulting foetal alcohol spectrum hpg axis highly conserved animal reproductive patterns may vary physical components control mechanisms remain hormones used minor evolutionary modifications much research done animal models mimic well control mechanism humans important remember humans species hide fertile period effect difference effect hormones rather difference hpg axis
