active student response asr techniques strategies elicit observable responses students classroom grounded field behavioralism operate increasing opportunities reinforcement class time typically form instructor active student response techniques designed student behavior responding aloud question quickly followed reinforcement common form active student response techniques choral responding response cards guided notes clickers commonly used disabled populations strategies applied many different levels implementing active student response techniques shown increase learning may require extra supplies preparation active student response techniques grounded field behaviorism movement psychology believes behaviors responses stimuli motivated past reinforcement field origins experiments edward thorndike pioneered law effect known reinforcement punishment thorndike explained behaviors produce positive effect become likely reoccur given scenario conversely behaviors produce negative effect become less likely psychologist bf skinner applied principles behaviorism influence education skinner believed students must active classroom effective instruction based positive reinforcement according skinner teachers avoid punishment teaches students avoid punishment instead lessons broken small tasks clear instruction positive reinforcement beliefs led invent teaching active student response techniques use skinners model provide rapid reinforcement desired responses increases likelihood responses occur also techniques may give instructors opportunity embrace technology foundation active student response techniques behaviorisms stimulusresponsereinforcement paradigm stimulus environmental change may produce response academic setting stimulus often verbal cue response may change subject emotion behavior reinforcers either positive negative academic setting confirmation correct answer may positive reinforcer active student response techniques aim arrange paradigm response correct includes separating instruction small achievable steps providing clear quick feedback including many repetitions result correct response strong relationship stimulus creating choral responding lowtech highasr strategy paces instruction throughout class strategy students prompted respond orally unison questions posed instructor choral responding work questions must presented clearly able answered briefly one correct answer choral responding useful reviewing subject matter solving problems spelling words may used review previously covered content provide feedback throughout class choral responding effective small wholegroup instruction students preschool secondary grades general education special education measured learning instructional format choral responding following response cards cards signs objects held students unison response question posed instructor writeon response cards whiteboards allow students write answers spot erase learning trials preprinted response cards premade often truefalse colors indicate answers types response cards promote highasr allowing students respond questions instead one student responding instructors easily gauge learning using response instructional format response cards similar choral responding follows implementing response cards classroom may increase questions posed instructor increase academic performance favored students technique effective general education special education response cards may also increase ontask behavior classroom decrease disruptive response cards effective paired brisk instructional pacing instructors easily able implement response cards achieve response rate approximately one response per minute brisk instructional pace maximized responses class period without sacrificing accuracy minimizing problem notetaking serves process product function traditional notetaking dependent attendance criterion knowledge attention often students may inefficient note takers recording incomplete verbatim notes distributing instructors notes increases academic guided notes aims improve notetaking behavior ensuring complete accurate notes guided notes prepared handouts containing standard cues guide student lecture handouts often based instructors notes blank spaces throughout student fill blank spaces student complete information concept creating highasr strategy many response opportunities throughout lecture blank spaces varied may allow many different types responses drawing pictures mostly lowtech guided notes option use many hightech applications software makes guided notes completed guided notes used level college levels active student response technique improves assessment scores accuracy notes student responses lecture students prefer guided notes traditional instructional format guided notes follows example guided notes response strategies implemented using commercially available technologies clickers mobile phone apps similar response cards instructor would pose question ask response class process may automated software uses clear signal response collects student responses though hightech strategies well active student response techniques applied nearly levels education also techniques used multiple populations individuals disabilities education act idea prioritizes accessible general education includes individuals disabilities including autism spectrum disorder intellectual disabilities learning disabilities behavior disorders active student response benefits inclusion students disabilities classrooms facilitating students participation higher education may also benefit active student response techniques undergraduate classrooms would often benefit implementing techniques traditional lectures serve function higher education setting context synthesizing information reliance passive learning effective active student active student response strategies either low hightech hightech strategies use electrical devices may utilize mobile phones clickers devices lowtech strategies require electrical devices may require anything pencil paper examples include guided notes response range technology used broadens applications active student response traditional lecturing instructor speaks uninterrupted majority class often less effective active student response techniques without active participation students contingent positive reinforcement correct responses traditional lecturing reinforce desired behaviors traditional lecturing may allow disorganized delivery information implementing active student response techniques lectures ensures lectures function assess instruct plan evaluate active student response techniques shown increase learning compared traditional lecture lectures active student response students exhibited ontask behavior instructors received feedback frequency active student responses correlated performance instructors also remarked active student participation provides instructors clear feedback promotes inclusive nature however active student response also demands higher cost instructors must supply prepare necessary materials example implement guided notes instructors must write print notes distribute students similarly techniques demand time instructors may take added preparation plan questions throughout class instructor chooses use response cards instructor must prepare questions class respond httpsenwikipediaorgwikiactivestudentresponsetechniques
