reconciliation ecology branch ecology studies ways encourage biodiversity humandominated ecosystems anthropocene era michael rosenzweig first articulated concept book winwin based theory enough area earths biodiversity saved within designated nature preserves therefore humans increase biodiversity humandominated landscapes managing biodiversity ways decrease human utility system winwin situation human use native biodiversity science based ecological foundation human landuse trends speciesarea relationships many benefits beyond protection biodiversity numerous examples around globe aspects reconciliation ecology already found management legislation challenges public acceptance ecological success reconciliation attempts traditional conservation based reservation restoration reservation meaning setting pristine lands aside sole purpose maintaining biodiversity restoration meaning returning human impacted ecosystems natural state however reconciliation ecologists argue great proportion land already impacted humans techniques succeed difficult measure exactly much land transformed human use estimates range includes agricultural land pastureland urban areas heavily harvested forest estimated arable land already land transformation increased rapidly last fifty years likely continue beyond direct transformation land area humans impacted global biogeochemical cycles leading human caused change even remote include addition nutrients nitrogen phosphorus acid rain ocean acidification redistribution water resources increased carbon dioxide atmosphere humans also changed species compositions many landscapes dominate directly introducing new species harvesting native species new assemblage species compared previous mass extinctions speciation events caused formation land bridges colliding need reconciliation ecology derived patterns species distribution diversity relevant patterns speciesarea curve states larger geographic area contain higher species diversity relationship supported large body research scholars consider ecological two main reasons relationship number species area used argument conservation larger areas habitat heterogeneity hypothesis claims larger geographic area greater variety habitat types therefore species adapted unique habitat type setting aside small area encompass enough habitat variety contain large variety equilibrium hypothesis draws theory island biogeography described macarthur large areas large populations less likely go extinct stochastic processes theory assumes speciation rates constant area lower extinction rate coupled higher speciation leads species speciesarea relationship often applied conservation often quantitatively simplest commonly used formula first published frank w number species present given area increases relationship area relationship caz number species area c z constants vary system study equation frequently used designing reserve size placement see sloss common version equation used reserve design formula interisland diversity zvalue meaning protecting available habitat preserve species present however interprovincial species area relationships zvalues closer meaning protecting habitat protect species taken together proponents reconciliation ecology see speciesarea relationship human domination large percentage earths area sign able set aside enough land protect lifes biodiversity negative effects setting land aside means remaining land used example less land required crop production high levels inorganic fertilizer applied chemicals affect nearby land set aside natural ecosystems direct benefits land transformation growing world population often make ethically difficult justify tradeoff biodiversity human reconciled ecosystems ones humans dominate natural biodiversity encouraged persist within human landscape ideally creates sustainable socioecological system necessitate trade biodiversity human use understanding species natural history aid effective conservation humandominated ecosystems humans often conduct activities allow incorporation species whether byproduct result focus traditional natural history inform best certain degree landscapes changed dramatically however much learn direct study species ecology humandominated ecosystems known focused natural history rosenzweig cites four examples shrikes laniidae thrived altered landscapes wooden fence post perches allowed easy access pouncing prey inhospitable steel fence posts contributed decline replacing steel fence posts wood fence posts reverses shrikes decline allows humans determine reasons distribution abundance shrikes additionally cirl bunting emberiza cirlus thrived farms fields alternated harvests hay declined farmers began plant winter grain crops natterjack toads bufo calamatus declined reductions sheep grazing ceased alter ponds preferred shape depth longleaf pine pinus palustris declined southeastern united states lack wildfires prevented return thus applying focused natural history humandominated landscapes contribute conservation efforts emerging concept ecosystem services coined millennium ecosystem assessment changed way ecologists perceived socalled ordinary species abundant species represent bulk biomass biological processes even dont appear directly threatened conservation constitutes major concern maintaining services rely human societies rarer reconciliation ecology proposes take care species maintain restore ecological processes humandominated ecosystems hence creating ecological corridors preserving good functioning biological reconciliation ecologists believe increasing biodiversity within human dominated landscapes help save global biodiversity sometimes preferable traditional conservation impair human use landscape therefore may acceptable however encourage biodiversity areas takes place many scholars cite benefits including biodiversity human landscapes global conservation activities human wellbeing increasing wildlife habitat humandominated systems increases situ biodiversity also aids conservation surrounding protected areas increasing connectivity habitat may especially important agricultural systems buffers live fences small habitat areas serve stops major concept forms basis subdiscipline countryside studies potential matrix preserves provide habitat species moving preserve preserve placing importance native ecosystems biodiversity within human landscapes increases human exposure natural shown increase appreciation nature studies shown students participate outdoor education

invasive reconnecting people nature especially important conservation tendency people use biodiversity present landscape grew point comparison future trends see shifting results reconciliation ecology also improve human wellbeing e wilson hypothesized humans innate desire close nature see numerous studies linked natural settings decreased stress faster recovery hospital many examples native plants animals taking advantage human dominated landscapes unintentional may enhanced part reconciliation ecology others intentional redesigns human landscapes better accommodate native biodiversity going many hundreds years including examples within agricultural systems urban suburban systems marine systems even industrial areas rosenzweig formalized concept humans encouraging biodiversity within human landscapes millennia trebon biosphere reserve czech republic system humanengineered aquaculture ponds built provides profitable harvest fish also provides habitat hugely diverse wetland ecosystem many cities europe take pride local population storks nest roofs church towers replace trees would naturally nest records humans maintaining plants pleasure gardens early ancient mesopotamia especially strong tradition incorporating gardens architecture human landscapes agroforestry provides many examples reconciliation ecology work tropical agroforestry systems crops coffee fruit trees cultivated canopy shade trees providing habitat tropical forest species outside protected example shadegrown coffee plantations typically lower tree diversity unmanaged forests however much higher tree species diversity richness agricultural agriculture mimics nature encourages natural forest species along crops also takes pressure nearby uncultivated forest areas people allowed collect forest understory also managed reconciliation ecology allowing weeds grow among crops minimizing labor preventing invasion noxious weed species leaving fallowlands alongside farmed areas enhance understory plant richness associated benefits native insects birds compared agricultural oil palm elaeis guineensis provides another example potential reconciliation ecology one important rapidly expanding tropical lucrative used many products throughout world unfortunately oilpalm agriculture one main drivers forest conversion southeast asia devastating native biodiversity perhaps even however attempts made foster sustainability industry monoculture oil palm subject potentially devastating attacks insect many companies attempting integrated pest management approach encourages planting species support predators parasitoids insect pests well active native bird experiments shown functioning bird community especially higher densities serve reduce insect herbivory oil palms promoting increased crop yields thus oil palm plantation managers participate reconciliation ecology promoting local vegetation beneficial insectivorous birds including maintaining ground plants serve nesting sites thereby protecting natural communities additionally steps maintaining riparian buffer zones natural forest patches help slow loss biodiversity within oil palm plantation engaging environmentally friendly practices fewer chemicals less effort required maintain plantation productivity ecosystem many grazing practices also encourage native biodiversity rosenzweigs book uses example rancher arizona intentionally deepened cattle ponds order save population threatened leopard frogs rana chiricahuensis detriment use tanks similar situation occurred vulnerable california tiger salamander ambystoma californiense central valley california research shown without cattle grazing many remaining vernal pools would dry early salamanders complete life cycle global climate change central america large percentage pastureland fenced using live trees low maintenance farmer also provide habitat birds bats invertebrates persist open another example rosenzweig involves encouraging loggerhead shrikes lanius ludovicianus populate pastureland placing perches around simple lowcost ways encourage biodiversity without negatively impacting human uses landscape urban ecology included umbrella reconciliation ecology tackles biodiversity cities extreme humandominated landscapes cities occupy less global surface area responsible majority carbon emissions residential water use wood cities also unique climatic conditions urban heat island effect greatly affect growing trend among city managers take biodiversity account planning city development especially rapidly growing cities cities often surprisingly high plant biodiversity due normally high degree habitat heterogeneity high numbers gardens green spaces cultivated include large variety however species often native large part total urban biodiversity usually made exotic cities highly impacted human activities restoration pristine state possible however modifications made increase habitat without negatively impacting human needs urban rivers addition large woods floating islands provide habitat modifications walls structures mimic natural banks buffer areas reduce pollutants increase biodiversity without reducing flood control water supply urban green spaces redesigned encourage natural ecosystems rather manicured lawns seen national wildlife federation backyard wildlife habitat peregrine falcons falco peregrinus endangered pesticide use frequently seen nesting tall urban buildings throughout north america feeding chiefly introduced rock steep walls buildings mimic cliffs peregrines naturally nest rock doves replace native prey species driven urban areas florida florida manatee trichechus manatus latirostris uses warm water discharged power plants refuge temperature gulf mexico warm areas replace warm springs manatees naturally used winter springs drained cut open water human uses american crocodiles crocodylus acutus similar habitat cooling canals turkey point power plant estimated total north american population species wastewater treatment systems shown potential reconciliation ecology numerous occasions manmade wetlands designed remove nitrogen runoff agriculture enters everglades florida used breeding sites number birds including endangered wood stork mycteria stormwater treatment ponds provide important breeding habitat amphibians especially natural wetlands drained human coral reefs intensively impacted human use including overfishing mining reef one reconciliation approach problem building artificial reefs provide valuable habitat aquatic species also protect nearby islands storms natural structure mined even structures simple scrap metal automobiles used habitat providing added benefits freeing space governmental intervention aid encouraging private landowners create habitat otherwise increase biodiversity land united states endangered species act requires landowners halt activities negatively affecting endangered species land disincentive encourage endangered species settle land first help mediate problem us fish wildlife service instituted safe harbor agreements whereby landowner engages restoration land encourage endangered species government agrees place regulation activities want reverse restoration later practice already led increase aplomado falcons falco femoralis texas redcockaded woodpeckers picoides borealis southeastern us another example us department agriculture conservation reserve program crp crp originally put place protect soil erosion also major implications conservation biodiversity program landowners take land agricultural production plant trees shrubs permanent erosion controlling vegetation unintended ecologically significant consequences reduction runoff improved water quality creation wildlife habitat possible carbon reconciliation ecology attempts modify human world encourage biodiversity without negatively impacting human use many challenges obtaining broad acceptance idea example addition forest corridors urban river systems improves water quality enhances critical habitat structure aquatic invertebrates fish may seen wasting valuable real similarly many suburban areas allow native vegetation provides useful wildlife habitat perceived untidy reflects apathetic attitude may reduce property addition many humans negative feelings toward certain species especially predators coyotes wolves often based perceived risk actual risk loss injury resulting even cooperation human element equation reconciliation ecology help every species animals several species waterfowl show strong avoidance behaviors toward humans form human matter nice urban park built proximity humans scare away birds species must maintain large territories barriers abound human habitats roads stop coexisting animals require undisturbed land set aside hence double social challenge reconciliation ecology making peoples perception biodiversity evolve changing
