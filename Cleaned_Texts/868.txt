mongolian paleontologist rinchen barsbold noted inconsistencies regarding taxonomic placement oviraptor concluded taxon quite distinct ornithomimids based anatomical traits consideration erected

cavities augmented musculature tail greater size first manual conference abstract david k smith presented osteological reevaluation oviraptor rejected statements made barsbold found evidence indicating forelimb specialized aquatic locomotion jaws rather preserve crushing mechanism preserve shearing surfaces skull toothless lightly built lacks several strong muscle insertion areas smith suggested leaves may important part diet however norell colleagues reported fragmented remains lizard body cavity holotype specimen suggesting oviraptor partially stig olav k jansen compared skull several oviraptorid species birds turtles investigate properties predict rhamphotheca found lower jaws oviraptorids similar parrots upper jaws similar turtles based observations jansen suggested oviraptorids omnivorous sharplydeveloped rhamphotheca together prominent forelimbs would adapted catch tear small prey moreover pointed projections palate would contributed holding prey jansen pointed fully herbivorous diet oviraptorids seems unlikely lacked flat wide tomia cutting edges mandibles chew unable move lower jaws sideways however considered lower jaws strong enough least crushed elements like eggs nuts hard longrich colleagues also rejected durophagous animals practise shellcrushing hypothesis given animals typically develop teeth broad crushing surfaces pointed shape dentary bones lower jaws suggests oviraptorids sharpedged rhamphotheca used shearing food instead symphyseal bone union region front dentary may given ability crushing relatively small area probably main function jaws another argument eaters mollusks fact oviraptorids found sediments interpreted represent mostly arid semiarid environments oviraptor djadokhta formation team also found oviraptorids dicynodonts share cranial features short deep toothless mandibles elongated dentary symphyses elongated mandibular openings pointed palate modern animals jaws resemble oviraptorids include parrots tortoises latter group also toothlike projections palatal region longrich colleagues concluded due similarities oviraptorids herbivorous animals bulk diet would likely formed plant material jaws oviraptorids may specialised processing food xerophytic vegetation adapted environments little would grown arid environments possible demonstrate little known paleoflora gobi however funston colleagues supported crushing jaw hypothesis pointed stocky rostrum robust lower jaws oviraptorids suggest fact strong nipping bite rather similar parrots funston colleagues considered anatomical traits oviraptorids consistent frugivorous diet incorporated nuts since description embryonic citipati specimen oviraptorids became understood instead eggeating animals actually brooded cared nests

holotype specimen oviraptor association nest amnh pointed exact position holotype found nest unclear separated preparation nest appears entirely complete eggs preserved two damaged moreover semicircular arrangement nest indicates eggs laid pairs least three rings nest originally circular similar thomas p hopp mark j orsen analyzed brooding behavior extinct extant dinosaur species including oviraptorids order evaluate reason elongation development wing tail feathers given complete oviraptorid nesting time citipati nesting found avianlike posture forelimbs nearfolded posture pectoral region belly feet contact eggs hopp orsen indicated long pennaceous feathers feather covering likely present life wings tail oviraptorids would granted protection eggs hatchlings climate factors like sunlight wind rainfalls however arms specimen extremely folded modern birds instead extended resembling style large flightless birds like ostrich extended position arm also similar brooding behavior bird known nest large clutches like oviraptorids based forelimb position nesting oviraptorids hopp orsen proposed brooding ancestral reason behind wing tail feather elongation greater need provide optimal protection eggs tamaki sato team reported unusual oviraptorid specimen nanxiong formation new specimen found preserving mainly pelvic region two eggs inside thereby indicating female size position eggs suggest oviraptorids retained two functional oviducts reduced number eggs ovulated one per david j varricchio colleagues found relatively large egg clutchsize oviraptorids troodontids similar modern birds practice polygamous mating extensive male parental care ratite birds suggesting similar habits reproductive system likely represent ancestral condition modern birds biparental care parents participate later w scott persons colleagues suggested oviraptorosaurs secondarily flightless several traits tails may indicate propensity display behaviour courtship display tail several oviraptorosaurs oviraptorids ended pygostyles bony structure end tail least modern birds used support feather fan furthermore tail notably muscular pronounced flexibility may aided courtship tzuruei yang colleagues identified cuticle layers several eggshells maniraptoran dinosaurs including oviraptorids particular layers composed proteins polysaccharides pigments mainly lipids hydroxyapatite modern birds serve protect eggs dehydration invasion microorganisms oviraptorid specimens found formations calichebased sedimentation yang colleagues suggested cuticlecoated eggs would reproductive strategy adapted enhancing hatching success arid climates yang colleagues reevaluated hypothesis thermoregulatory contact incubation using complete oviraptorid nests nanxiong formation provided detailed reconstruction architecture oviraptorid clutch noted adult oviraptorid specimens association nest necessarily incubating eggs could represent female process laying eggs multiring clutch prevented sufficient heat transfer parent inner rings eggs average oviraptorid nest built gentlyinclined mound highly organized architecture eggs likely pigmented arranged pairs pair arranged three four elliptical rings parent likely operating nest center region devoid eggs yang colleagues concluded oviraptorid nesting style unique lack modern analogs therefore using oviraptorid reproduction may best example inform evolution bird reproductive strategies however team unable determinate juvenile oviraptor amnh hatched nest associated oviraptor known bayn dzak
