environment intelligence research investigates impact environment intelligence one important factors understanding human group differences iq test scores measures cognitive ability estimated genes contribute variance intelligence childhood adulthood thus environment interaction genes account high proportion variation intelligence seen groups young children small proportion variation observed groups mature adults historically great interest field intelligence research determine environmental influences development cognitive functioning particular fluid intelligence defined stabilization years age despite fact intelligence stabilizes early adulthood thought genetic factors come play role intelligence middle old age importance environment babies neuronal connections completely undifferentiated neurons make connections neighboring neurons become complex idiosyncratic child ages age process halts also time frame development defined psychometric studies general factor intelligence g measured iq tests persons iq supposed relatively stable reached likely growth neuronal connections largely due interaction environment even enough genetic material code possible neural

improve jr harris suggested nurture assumption individuals peer group influences intelligence greatly time different peer group characteristics may responsible blackwhite iq gap several longitudinal studies support conjecture peer groups significantly affect scholastic relatively studies examined effect tests cognitive ability peer group individual identifies also influence intelligence stereotypes associated group stereotype threat first introduced claude steele idea people belonging stereotyped group may perform poorly situation stereotype relevant shown factor differences intelligence test scores different ethnic groups men women people low high social status young old participants example females told women worse chess men performed worse game chess females told iq educational attainment strongly correlated estimates range form controversy however whether education affects intelligence may dependent independent variable regard study ceci illustrates numerous ways education affect intelligence found iq decreases summer breaks schooling children delayed school entry lower iqs drop education earlier lower iqs children age one years less schooling lower iq scores thus difficult unravel interconnected relationship iq education seem affect one better childhood intelligence tests tend lower drop rate complete years school predictive school instance one largest ever studies found correlation general intelligence gfactor gcse hand education shown improve performance intelligence research controlling childhood iq treating years education causal variable suggests education causes increase total iq score although general intelligence instance natural experiment norway school leaving age changed suggested iq raised additional year school may alter specific knowledge rather general biological terms matters school appears simple quantity yearsinschool may underpins linkage education performance iq tests research effectiveness interventions degree fluid intelligence increased especially age somewhat controversial fluid intelligence typically thought something innate defined immutable maturity one recent article however demonstrates least period time fluid intelligence increased training increasing adults working memory capacity working memory capacity defined ability remember something temporarily like remembering phone number long enough dial experiment groups adults first assessed using standard tests fluid trained groups four different numbers days half hour day using nback exercise worked improving ones working supposedly

theory entity theory supposes intelligence fixed altered working harder incremental theory hand assumes intelligence malleable developed improved effort course year found students taught incremental theory intelligence showed upward trajectory grades mathematics throughout year whereas taught entity theory showed improvement indicates teaching incremental theory may improve performance academic tasks though research needed investigate whether results found general studies looked improving intelligence preventing cognitive decline using cognition enhancing substances known nootropics one study gave participants number known nootropics combination hopes targeting numerous cellular mechanisms increasing effects cognition would administered individually conducted double blind test

limited stimulation home less interaction nutrition shown affect intelligence prenatally postnatally idea prenatal nutrition may affect intelligence comes barkers hypothesis fetal programming states critical stages development intrauterine environment affects programmes child develop barker cited nutrition one important intrauterine influences affecting development undernutrition could permanently change physiology development shown undernutrition particularly protein malnutrition lead irregular brain maturation learning prenatal nutrition difficult measure birth weight used surrogate marker nutrition many studies birth weight needs corrected gestational length ensure effects due nutrition first longitudinal study looking effects undernutrition measured birth weight intelligence focused males born dutch results indicated effects undernutrition intellectual development however many studies since found significant relationship metaanalysis shenkin colleagues indicates birth weight associated scores intelligence tests postnatal malnutrition also significant influence intellectual development relationship harder establish issue malnutrition often conflated socioeconomic issues however demonstrated studies preschoolers two guatemalan villages undernourishment common given protein nutrition supplements several years even lowest socioeconomic class children showed increase performance intelligence tests relative controls dietary malnutrition shown affect organizational processes brain neurogenesis synaptic pruning cell migration cellular differentiation thus results abnormalities formation neural circuits development neurotransmitter systems however effects malnutrition shown improved upon good diet early nutrition also affect brain structures actually correlated iq levels specifically caudate nucleus particularly affected early environmental factors volume correlates iq experiment isaacs et al infants born prematurely either assigned standard highnutrient diet weeks directly birth individuals assessed later adolescence found highnutrient group significantly larger caudate volumes scored significantly higher verbal iq tests study also found extent caudate volume size related selectively verbal iq much greater male participants significant females may help explain finding earlier research effects early diet intelligence predominant another study done lucas et al confirms conclusions importance nutrition cognitive development individuals born prematurely also found cognitive function males significantly impaired poorer postnatal unique finding however higher incidence cerebral palsy individuals fed nonnutrient enhanced breast feeding long purported supply important nutrients infants correlated increased cognitive gains later link intelligence breast feeding even shown persist however view challenged recent times studies found link breast feeding cognitive abilities metaanalysis der batty deary concluded link iq breastfeeding maternal intelligence accounted mothers intelligence likely link breastfeeding studies indicated breast feeding may particularly important children born small gestational age sga study slykerman et al found association breast feeding higher intelligence full sample looking sga babies significant increase intelligence breastfed study provides possible resolution different results found across studies investigating breastfeedings effect intelligence caspi et al found whether breast feeding increased iq linked whether infant certain variant gene children c variant gene showed iq advantage points breastfed whereas gg variant showed iq advantages however studies failed replicate maternal stress levels may affect developing childs intelligence timing duration stress greatly alter fetus brain development longterm effects intelligence maternal reactions stress increased heart rate dampened pregnancy order protect fetus impact stress seen across many different species indicator outside environment help fetus adapt surviving outside world however maternal stress perceived bad seen induce advantageous stress early childhood may also affect childs development negative consequences neural systems underlying fluid intelligence study found iq scores related number traumas symptoms post traumatic stress disorder ptsd children similarly another study found exposure violence community subsequent distress related significant decrease intelligence scores reading abilities children aged years exposure violence community similar
