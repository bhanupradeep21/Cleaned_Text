myotonic dystrophy affects number long estimated much lower often cited reflecting patients immediate symptoms symptoms long time typically takes get right common form muscular dystrophy begins first described underlying cause type determined dm causes muscle weakness early onset cataracts myotonia delayed relaxation muscles cataracts either cortical cataract blue dot appearance posterior subcapsular organs affected include heart lungs gastrointestinal tract skin insulin resistance also signs symptoms vary considerably severity unusual phenotype form needed differ regards muscles affect age onset severity disease extramuscular usually begins muscles hands feet neck one manifestation facial weakness drooping eyelid ptosiscitation needed slowly progresses involve muscle groups including heart myotonia tends prominent compared manifestations include problems executive function eg organization concentration wordfinding abnormalities electrical activity heart common manifesting arrhythmias conduction sometimes dilated cardiomyopathy symptoms onset time birth earlier disease onset greater variety possible signs symptomscitation needed thus various diagnostic classifications based age onsetseverity disease proposed although manifestations likely lie onsets birth called congenital manifestations present birth include hypotonia respiratory failure feeding difficulty club foot talipes equinovarus tend resolve several childhood intellectual impairment attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd autism spectrum disorders asd gastrointestinal issues

childhoodonset defined onset symptoms ages manifestations include intellectual gastrointestinal symptoms seen congenital generally milder generally fewer people requiring assistive devices preferentially affects muscles closer torso including neck flexors hip flexors hip muscle pain prominent heart issues still potentially fatal less common severe symptoms onset early late severe congenital onset occur observed myotonic dystrophy dm genetic condition inherited autosomal dominant pattern meaning child affected individual chance inheriting disease mutation involves satellite dna tandemly repeated sequences dna code protein repeats implicated myotonic dystrophy either nucleotides length classified microsatellites disease results abnormally increased number microsatellites termed microsatellite expansion microsatellite expansion responsible cytosinethymineguanine ctg triplet repeats termed trinucleotide repeat expansion classifying one several trinucleotide repeat disorders expansion occurs end dmpk gene untranslated region dmpk located long arm chromosome dmpk codes myotonic dystrophy protein protein expressed predominantly skeletal repeats considered normal repeats considered premutation although producing symptoms children repeat expansion symptomatic greater repeats almost invariably symptomatic noted exceptions longer repeats usually associated earlier onset severe dmpk alleles greater repeats unstable additional trinucleotide repeats may inserted cell division mitosis meiosis consequently children individuals premutations mutations inherit dmpk alleles longer parents therefore likely affected display earlier onset greater severity condition phenomenon known anticipation repeat expansion generally considered consequence incorporation additional bases result strand slippage either dna replication dna repair misalignments occurring homologous recombinational repair doublestrand break repair dna repair processes likely contribute trinucleotide repeat expansions paternal transmission congenital form uncommon possibly due selection pressures sperm expanded repeats juvenile adultonset equally transmitted either parent anticipation tends less severe cases maternal inheritancecitation needed rna expanded trinucleotide repeat region forms intranucleoplasmic hairpin loops due extensive hydrogen bonding cg base pairs demonstrated sequester splicing regulator form distinctive severe form congenital myotonic dystrophy may appear newborns mothers dm congenital myotonic dystrophy also inherited via paternal gene although said relatively rare congenital means condition present microsatellite expansion responsible cytosinecytosinethymineguanine cctg repeats classifying tetranucleotide repeat disorder expansion occurs first intron cnbp gene chromosome repeat expansion much larger ranging like size microsatellite repeat array lengthens generation unlike anticipation result degree repeat expansion beyond repeats affect age onset disease repeat expansion produces rna transcript binds rnabinding proteins also repeat expansion likely reduces expression cnbp loss causes muscle mutations cause production rna sequesters rnabinding proteins causing dysregulated rna dysregulated rna splicing particularly toxic skeletal cardiac smooth one example involves chloride channel mutated dmpk rna binds causing premrna spliced fetal form instead adult functional loss chloride channel causes increased central nuclei angular fibers fiber atrophy pyknotic selective atrophy type muscle muscle fibers show signs
