spinal epidural hematoma proximal diabetic neuropathy tarlov cysts rarely sarcoidosis arachnoiditis tethered spinal cord syndrome transverse needed repeated longer term exposure years certain workrelated activities may put people risk developing lumbosacral behaviours may include physically demanding work bending twisting trunk lifting carrying combination less common causes radiculopathy
