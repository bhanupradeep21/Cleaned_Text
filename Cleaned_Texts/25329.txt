progressively refined test development proceed theoretical statistical grounds three commonly used general strategies inductive deductive scales created today often incorporate elements three methods deductive assessment construction begins selecting domain construct construct thoroughly defined experts items created fully represent attributes construct test items selected eliminated based upon result strongest internal validity scale measures created deductive methodology equally valid take significantly less time construct compared inductive empirical measures clearly defined face valid questions result process make easy person taking assessment understand although subtle items created deductive measure often capable detecting lying methods personality assessment inductive assessment construction begins creation multitude diverse items items created inductive measure intended represent theory construct particular items created administered large group participants allows researchers analyze natural relationships among questions label components scale based upon questions group together several statistical techniques used determine constructs assessed measure exploratory factor analysis confirmatory factor analysis two common data reduction techniques allow researchers create scales responses initial itemscitation needed five factor model personality developed using advanced statistical methods include opportunity discover previously unidentified unexpected relationships items constructs also may allow development subtle items prevent test takers knowing measured may represent actual structure construct better predeveloped criticisms include vulnerability finding item relationships apply broader population difficulty identifying may measured component confusing item relationships constructs fully addressed originally created empirically derived personality assessments require statistical techniques one central goals empirical personality assessment create test validly discriminates two distinct dimensions personality empirical tests take great deal time construct order ensure test measuring purported measure psychologists first collect data self observer reports ideally large number participants personality test administered directly person evaluated observer selfreport individual responds personality items pertain person himselfherself selfreports commonly used observerreport person responds personality items items pertain someone else produce accurate results observer needs know individual evaluated combining scores selfreport observer report reduce error providing accurate depiction person evaluated self observerreports tend yield similar results supporting direct observation involves second party directly observing evaluating someone else second party observes target observation behaves certain situations eg child behaves schoolyard recess observations take place natural eg schoolyard artificial setting social psychology laboratory direct observation help identify job applicants eg work likely successful maternal attachment young children eg mary ainsworths strange situation object method directly observe genuine behaviors target limitation direct observation target persons may change behavior know second limitation behavioral traits difficult observe eg sincerity others eg sociability third limitation direct observation expensive timeconsuming number methods eg though personality tests date back early century became illegal united states employers use polygraphs began broadly

generally found summing unweighted item scores psychologists dismissed whole idea personality considering much behaviour idea supported fact personality often predict behaviour specific contexts however extensive research shown behaviour aggregated across contexts personality mostly good predictor behaviour almost psychologists acknowledge social individual difference factors ie personality influence behaviour debate currently around relative importance factors factors interact one problem selfreport measures personality respondents often able distort several metaanalyses show people

answers personality tests compared significant difference answers practice people significantly distort nevertheless researcher prepared possibilities also sometimes participants think tests results valid really like results get people want believe positive traits test results say possess fact present personality leads distorted results peoples sentiments validity tests several strategies adopted reducing respondent faking one strategy involves providing warning test methods exist detecting faking detection result negative consequences respondent eg considered job forced choice item formats ipsative testing adopted require respondents choose alternatives equal social desirability social desirability lie scales often included detect certain patterns responses although often confounded true variability social desirability recently item response theory approaches adopted success identifying item response profiles flag fakers researchers looking timing responses electronically
