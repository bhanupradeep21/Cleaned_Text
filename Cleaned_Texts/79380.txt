antimag peripheral neuropathy specific type peripheral neuropathy persons immune system attacks cells specific maintaining healthy nervous system cells destroyed antibodies nerve cells surrounding region begin lose function create many problems sensory motor function specifically antibodies myelinassociated glycoprotein mag damage schwann cells disorder occurs afflicted peripheral neuropathy people afflicted symptoms muscle weakness sensory problems motor deficits usually starting form tremor hands trouble however multiple treatments range simple exercises order build strength targeted drug treatments shown improve function people type peripheral myelin important part neuron cells provides insulation allowing neurons action potential travel faster consistently order provide insulation multiple layers closely opposing membrane wrapped around axon acting electrical insulator conduction ability axon sped considerably allowing action potentials travel much faster rate fifteen times faster certain cases ability allows nervous system send messages faster accurately disruption myelin sheath cells normally myelinated allows leakage action potential much like faulty wire allow leakage electricity circuit slows messages sent along nerves disrupts normal schwann cells cells peripheral nervous system create maintain myelin sheaths neurons glial cells peripheral nervous system located around axons serve damage cells result degeneration myelin sheath inevitably lead problems communication nervous myelinassociated glycoprotein mag glycoprotein specific schwann cells create myelin nerve cells peripheral nervous system research cloning rat mag gene shown type transmembrane protein meaning contains domains inside cell membrane outside cell membrane expression glycoprotein specific myelinforming cells begins early myelination process order function early development axons central nervous system expression continues relatively high even mature animals however suggesting associated formation maintenance research knockout mice mice mag gene removed shown glycoprotein serves heavily formation myelin also show early development peripheral nervous system relatively normal even without presence mag knockout mice generally show many motor deficits however age caused degeneration myelinated axons suggesting need glycoproteins maintenance still unclear exact mechanism pathway mag affects myelination studies suggest mag serves receptor role begin signaling cascade begun activation external source mag also shown bind ligand receptor axonal surface suggests external stimulus activating creation myelin comes nerve cell cells glycoproteins bound antibodies created body attack disrupt function myelin associated glycoproteins antibodies found bind external domain glycoproteins inhibit signaling occur proteins important various signal cascades eventually lead schwann cells creating myelin antibodies basically halt myelin creation leading neuropathy still however much debate actual cause antibodies created research suggest antibodies linked various forms amyloidosis patients amyloidosis experience elevated antimag antibodies usually leading form neuropathy however provide evidence mechanisms behind creation people disease shown many sensory muscular symptoms patients sensory ataxia sensory loss various extremities along mild moderate muscle weakness usually starting toes fingers moving inward patients also present mild moderate tremor extremities increases disease severe symptoms occur disease progresses much damage myelin sheaths peripheral nervous system present debilitating tremors prevent patients normal tasks complete sensory loss limbs cases extensive muscle detection type neuropathy concentrated mostly detecting presence antibodies antibodies main cause disease antimag antibodies readily detected patients sera using various types assays mainly elisa shown also various biological indicators elevated cerebral spinal fluid proteins elevated igm monoclonal levels also tested either drawing serum patient drawing spinal fluid spinal tap testing using assay drug therapeutic treatments exist order battle disease though many proven ineffectivecitation needed immunotherapy works patients relieving minor symptoms overall conventional therapies using steroids immunosuppressants chemotherapy intravenous immunoglobulin therapies helped patients created need newer novel therapies chlorambucil chemotherapy drug normally used treat leukemia often used immunosuppressant drug prednisone steroid also found particularly effective immunosuppressant combination drugs minimal benefits patients small number see small improvements decreased tremors combination effective severe cases though considered long term cyclophosphamide drug often used treatment lymphomas works slowing stopping cell growth also works immunosuppressant decreasing bodys immune response various diseases conditions drug found make significant improvements people antimag neuropathy relieving sensory loss helping improve quality life short months however risk cancer treatment therefore used regular fludarabine drug normally used treat hematological malignancies acts immunosuppressant shown significantly improve conditions neuropathy patients lack studies used regularly also danger potential toxicity treatment takes year stabilize intravenous immunoglobulin blood product administered iv used treat various immune deficiencies autoimmune diseases shown effective various types disorders studies show promise technique treating antimag neuropathiescitation needed rituximab considered one promising drugs treatment antimag peripheral neuropathy drug antibody protein primarily found surface b cells attached destroys b cells drug used treatment many autoimmune diseases well lymphomas transplant rejection ability suppress immune system used treat antimag neuropathy hopes destroy cells would target necessary glycoproteins schwann cells studies patients shown patients experience marked increase sensory motor abilities within first months however long term studies shown treatment rituximab create many immune problems immunosuppressant drugs risk infections diseases normally easily fought immune system allowed take foothold studies shown long term treatment patients experience many problems well decline neuropathy led studies conducted drugs safety profile overall effectiveness unfortunately recent studies concluded rituximab ineffective improving iss patients igm antimag demyelinating current research focused mostly determining treatment options studied clinical trials drugs listed previously new therapy techniques delay loss function drugs studied immunosuppressants attack antibodies aspects hope preventing damage schwann cells ideally prevent loss myelination peripheral nerve httpsenwikipediaorgwikiantimagperipheralneuropathy
