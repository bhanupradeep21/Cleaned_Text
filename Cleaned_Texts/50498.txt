species distribution species manner biological taxon spatially geographic limits particular taxons distribution range often represented shaded areas map patterns distribution change depending scale viewed arrangement individuals within small family unit patterns within population distribution entire species whole range species distribution confused dispersal movement individuals away region origin population center high density biology range species geographical area within species found within range distribution general structure species population dispersion variation population density range often described following qualities disjunct distribution occurs two areas range taxon considerably separated geographically distribution patterns may change season distribution humans response availability resources abiotic biotic factors three main types abiotic factors example effects abiotic factors species distribution seen drier areas individuals species gather around water sources forming clumped distribution researchers arctic ocean diversity arcod project documented rising numbers warmwater crustaceans seas around norways svalbard islands arcod part census marine life huge project involving researchers nations aims chart diversity distribution abundance life oceans marine life become largely affected increasing effects global climate change study shows ocean temperatures rise species beginning travel cold harsh arctic waters even snow crab extended range km north biotic factors predation disease inter intraspecific competition resources food water mates also affect species distributed example biotic factors quail environment would include prey insects seeds competition quail predators advantage herd community clumped distribution allows population detect predators earlier greater distance potentially mount effective defense due limited resources populations may evenly distributed minimize found forests competition sunlight produces even distribution humans one largest distributors due current trends globalization expanse transportation industry example large tankers often fill ballasts water one port empty another causing wider distribution aquatic large scales pattern distribution among individuals population one common example bird species ranges land mass areas bordering water bodies oceans rivers lakes called coastal strip second example species bird depend water usually river swamp etc water related forest live river corridor separate example river corridor would river corridor includes entire drainage edge range delimited mountains higher elevations river would smaller percentage entire wildlife corridor corridor created river example bird wildlife corridor would mountain range corridor us north america sierra nevada range west appalachian mountains east two examples habitat used summer winter separate species different reasons bird species corridors connected main range species contiguous range isolated geographic range disjunct range birds leaving area migrate would leave connected main range fly land connected wildlife corridor thus would passage migrants land stop intermittent hit miss visit large scales pattern distribution among individuals population clumped small scales pattern may clumped regular clumped distribution also called aggregated distribution clumped dispersion patchiness common type dispersion found nature clumped distribution distance neighboring individuals minimized type distribution found environments characterized patchy resources animals need certain resources survive resources become rare certain parts year animals tend clump together around crucial resources individuals might clustered together area due social factors selfish herds family groups organisms usually serve prey form clumped distributions areas hide detect predators easily causes clumped distributions inability offspring independently move habitat seen juvenile animals immobile strongly dependent upon parental care example bald eagles nest eaglets exhibits clumped species distribution offspring small subset survey area learn fly clumped distribution beneficial individuals group however herbivore cases cows wildebeests vegetation around suffer especially animals target one plant particular clumped distribution species acts mechanism predation well efficient mechanism trap corner prey african wild dogs lycaon pictus use technique communal hunting increase success rate catching prey studies shown larger packs african wild dogs tend greater number successful kills prime example clumped distribution due patchy resources wildlife africa dry season lions hyenas giraffes elephants gazelles many animals clumped small water sources present severe dry also observed extinct threatened species likely clumped distribution phylogeny reasoning behind share traits increase vulnerability extinction related taxa often located within broad geographical habitat types humaninduced threats concentrated using recently developed complete phylogenies mammalian carnivores primates shown majority instances threatened species far randomly distributed among taxa phylogenetic clades display clumped contiguous distribution one individuals closer together would randomly evenly distributed ie clumped distribution single less common clumped distribution uniform distribution also known even distribution evenly uniform distributions found populations distance neighboring individuals maximized need maximize space individuals generally arises competition resource moisture nutrients result direct social interactions individuals within population territoriality example penguins often exhibit uniform spacing aggressively defending territory among neighbors burrows great gerbils example also regularly seen satellite plants also exhibit uniform distributions like creosote bushes southwestern region united states salvia leucophylla species california naturally grows uniform spacing flower releases chemicals called terpenes inhibit growth plants around results uniform example allelopathy release chemicals plant parts leaching root exudation volatilization residue decomposition processes allelopathy beneficial harmful neutral effects surrounding organisms allelochemicals even selective effects surrounding organisms example tree species leucaena leucocephala exudes chemical inhibits growth plants species thus affect distribution specific rival species allelopathy usually results uniform distributions potential suppress weeds farming agricultural practices often create uniform distribution areas would previously exist example orange trees growing rows plantation random distribution also known unpredictable spacing least common form distribution nature occurs members given species found environments position individual independent individuals neither attract repel one another random distribution rare nature biotic factors interactions neighboring individuals abiotic factors climate soil conditions generally cause organisms either clustered spread random distribution usually occurs habitats environmental conditions resources consistent pattern dispersion characterized lack strong social interactions species example dandelion seeds dispersed wind random distribution often occur seedlings land random places determined uncontrollable factors oyster larvae also travel hundreds kilometers powered sea currents result random distribution random distributions exhibit chance clumps see poisson clumping various ways determine distribution pattern species nearest neighbor used determine distribution clumped uniform utilize nearest neighbor method researchers examine population single species distance

average distance nearest neighbors compared expected distance case random distribution give ratio ratio r equal population randomly dispersed r significantly greater population evenly dispersed lastly r significantly less population clumped statistical tests ttest chi squared etc used determine whether r significantly different variancemean ratio method focuses mainly determining whether species fits randomly spaced distribution also used evidence either even clumped utilize variancemean ratio method data collected several random samples given population analysis imperative data least sample
