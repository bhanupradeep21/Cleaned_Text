divinyl ether organic compound formula colorless volatile liquid mainly interest inhalation anesthetic prepared treating bischloroethyl ether analytical techniques used study pharmacology laid groundwork testing new anesthetic agents vinyl ether first prepared semmler sulfur substituted analogue divinyl sulfide obtained essential oil allium ursinum l reaction silver oxide knorr matthes obtained low yields vinyl ether exhaustive methylation cretcher et al reported would become foundation one industrial method used produce vinyl ether stated action heated sodium hydroxide upon ββdichlorodiethyl ether produced liquid boiling among identified however subtly modified process hibbert et al reported isolation product boiling divinyl ether finally patent issued merck co reported isolation vinyl ether boiling ca currently accepted boiling point vinyl ether merck patent therefore first report isolation pure product even isolation characterization application unsaturated ether anesthetic interested pharmacologists one pharmacologist chauncey leake particularly captivated theoretical vinyl ether leake predicted vinyl ether would combine properties two anesthetic agents ethyl ether anesthetic ethylene many favorable properties although low potency often requires hypoxic conditions achieve full anesthesia ethyl ether hand relatively potent anesthetic falls short ethylene respects comparison ether ethylene much lower occurrence post operative nausea additionally ethylene faster induction recovery times solely guided predictions based upon structure leake pursued usage vinyl ether inhalation vinyl ether unknown pure form leake approached organic chemists berkeley asking synthesize novel leakes colleagues however unable prepare vinyl ether later though leake received help two princeton chemists randolph major w ruigh using samples received princeton leake fellow researcher meiyu chen published brief study characterizing anesthetic effects vinyl ether upon mice conclusion study cordially invited research invitation accepted samuel gelfan irving bell university alberta published first human trials vinyl ether reported experience gelfan anesthetized vinyl ether via open drop although according leake anesthesiologist mary botsford university california first clinically administer vinyl ether hysterectomy early thenceforth vinyl ether studied extensively institutions though political climate berkeley hindered study leake vinyl ether success usage limited aforementioned concerns liver toxicity degradation upon long term vinyl ether rather unstable compound exposure light acid decomposes acetaldehyde polymerizes glassy solid like many ethers vinyl ether also liable form peroxides upon exposure air light reasons vinyl ether sold inhibitors polyphenols amines quell polymerization peroxide anesthetic product inhibited phenylαnapthylamine gave faint violet vinyl ether rapidly decolorizes solution bromine carbon tetrachloride also rapidly oxidized aqueous potassium permanganate sulfuric acid reacts vinyl ether producing black tarry resin united states vinyl ether sold trade name vinethene addition normal inhibitors vinyl ether intended anesthetic use contained ethanol prevent frosting anesthetic despite inhibitors manufacturers warned opened vinyl ether used vinyl ether rapid onset little excitement upon induction induction causes little coughing however produces increased anesthesia vinyl ether cause patients twitch rare cases twitching lead convulsions convulsions additionally morphineatropine premedication usually prevents recovery vinyl ether rapid rare cases post operative nausea vomiting although headache anesthesia sometimes short operations pose little danger patient longer operations use greater ml anesthetic dangerous due hepatic renal toxicity attempt circumvent toxicity vinyl ether maintaining favorable properties mixed ethyl ether producing vinethene anesthetic mixture vam vam shows smoother induction recovery ethyl ether alone yet relatively nontoxic longer though compared ethyl ether vam less suitable cases requiring deep vinyl ether potent anesthetic giving large safety margin ratio anesthetic lethal dose vinyl ether ethyl ether however potency hard control simplistic equipment anesthetic machines numerous years vinyl ethers popularity simplistic open drop technique also maintained prevalence anesthetic machines time could suitably contain vinyl ethers potency however via open drop technique smooth anesthesia long procedures hard aggravating problem warm temperatures increase volatility vinyl ether making even harder regulate via open drop overall vinyl ethers strengths compared ethyl ether favorable induction recovery anesthesia vinyl ether particularly wonderful properties harder control agents therefore vinyl ether commonly used preliminary anesthetic administration diethyl ether additionally vinyl ether used short operations analgesia eg dentistry obstetrics vinyl ether used infrequently long operations toxicity cost superior alternatives also experiments conducted ethyl vinyl ether compound one vinyl one ethyl group substance produced results placing diethyl ether divinyl ether terms toxicity speed induction recovery producing promising results similar despite much simpler synthesis vinylization ethanol acetylene ethyl vinyl ether didnt enter widespread use anesthetics superior halogenated ethers replaced shortly first trials many divinyl ether derivatives fatty acids exist httpsenwikipediaorgwikidivinylether
