veterinary dentistry addresses periodontal disease common dental condition dogs cats pets young three years old show early evidence periodontal disease worsen effective preventive measures taken early detection treatment critical advanced periodontal disease cause severe problems pain originating dental problems rarely recognized owners professionals seldom animal become anorexic due dental problem exception case severe soft tissue injury example chronic gingivostomatitis general dental pain chronic pain treatment owner reports much better pet pain often mistaken pet getting old clients examine pets teeth unless carrying daily home care actual dental problems often go unnoticed recognizing symptoms may link dental diseases nasal discharge external facial swellings often priority cases dental patients may present appear neurological horses continuous grazing leads dental attrition also due continuous development horse hypsodont teeth dental crown wear create jagged sharp edges attribute uneven wear dental care horses designed prevent quidding dropping food mouth eating ulcerations cheek tongue resistance unusual sensitivity bit root abscessation development mandibular fistulas infections lower cheek teeth difficulty flexing common significant oral disease inflammation deeper supporting structures tooth surrounding tissues periodontium also called periodontal disease begins formation plaque specifically subgingival plaque within gingival sulcus periodontal pocket allows proliferation bacteria subsequent inflammation animals immune response starts progression periodontal disease hallmark feature periodontitis attachment loss tooth alveolar bone periodontitis irreversible process unless animal treated advanced periodontal surgery periodontal disease eventually culminates tooth loss however significant health problems precede local consequences include development oronasal fistula periodontalendodontic lesion infections abscesses eye fractured jaw osteomyelitis oral systemic consequences affect multiple organs example bacteremia periodontal disease cause inflammation hepatic tissue portal vein fibrosis cholestasis chronic stimulation immune
