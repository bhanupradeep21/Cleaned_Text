stanislas leibler show one harness biophysical properties nucleic acids proteins create biological circuits used rewire reprogram living cells paper published collins designed constructed genetic toggle switch synthetic bistable gene regulatory network e coli toggle switch forms synthetic addressable cellular memory unit broad implications biophysics biomedicine biotechnology issue nature elowitz leibler showed one build synthetic genetic oscillator called repressilator e collins nature paper genetic toggle elowitzs leiblers nature repressilator considered landmark pieces ones marks beginnings synthetic building work collins showed synthetic gene networks used regulatory modules interfaced microbes genetic circuitry create programmable cells variety eg synthetic probiotics serve living diagnostics living therapeutics detect treat prevent infections cholera c also designed constructed engineered riboregulators rna switches sensing microbial kill switches genetic counters synthetic bacteriophage combat resistant bacterial genetic switchboards metabolic tunable genetic switches gene cell recently collins developed freezedried cellfree synthetic gene circuits innovative platform forms basis inexpensive paperbased diagnostic tests emerging pathogens eg zika ebola antibioticresistant wearable portable biomolecular manufacturing eg produce vaccine antigens developing

collins also demonstrated synthetic gene circuits used test validate improve qualitative quantitative models gene shown biophysical theory experiment coupled bottomup approaches gain biological insights intricate processes gene collins also one leading researchers systems biology use experimentalcomputational biophysical techniques reverse engineer analyze endogenous gene regulatory collins collaborators showed reverseengineered gene networks used identify drug targets biological mediators disease collins collaborators discovered using systems biology approaches classes bactericidal antibiotics induce common oxidative damage cellular death finding indicates targeting bacterials systems remediate oxidative damage including sos dna damage response viable means enhancing effectiveness major classes antibiotics limiting emergence antibiotic resistance work established mechanistic relationship bacterial metabolism antibiotic efficacy developed validated collins team series followon collins showed certain metabolites could used enable bactericidal antibiotics eradicate persistent tolerant additionally collins coworkers discovered sublethal levels antibiotics activate mutagenesis stimulating production reactive oxygen species leading multidrug collins colleagues using systems approaches also discovered populationbased resistance mechanism constituting form kin selection whereby small number resistant bacterial mutants face antibiotic stress cost provide protection vulnerable cells enhancing survival capacity overall population stressful collins part fellow mit jameel clinic faculty lead professor regina announced discovery deep learning halicin first new antibiotic compound years kills powerful bacteria including antimicrobialresistant tuberculosis superbug c difficile two world health organizations topthree deadly collins barzilay mit jameel clinic also awarded funding audacious project create antibioticsai project expand discovery halicin using ai respond antibiotic resistance crisis development new classes collins also pioneered development use nonlinear dynamical approaches study mimic improve biological expanding ability
