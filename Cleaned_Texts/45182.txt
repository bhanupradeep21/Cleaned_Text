developed gasteral constriction abdomen feature seen lesser degree haidomyrmodes mammuthus additionally linguamyrmex enlarged paddle shaped clypeus similar extremely modified clypeus ceratomyrmex smooth along stalk instead sporting setae trigger hairs placed base setae pad paddle instead base paddle haidomyrmecine members head structure linguamyrmex interpreted facilitate trapjaw behavior seen modern specialized genera formicinae myrmicinae ponerinae haidomyrmecines clypeus modified span near oral opening past mandibles near vertex head ant group modification along clypeal structuring pair long setae positioned path mandibles modern trapjaw ants setae used triggers initiate rapid closure mandibles often capture prey sometimes defensive action upper areas clypeus always coated brush stout setae region mandibles came rest triggered close based modification clypeus probable linguamyrmex would captured prey front strategies made improbable due upward motion mandibles haidomyrmecines highly modified cleypeal areas linguamyrmex ceratomyrmex horn probably served pinning trapping point mandibles captured hypothesis purpose clypeus linguamyrmex supported data obtained xray microcomputed tomography scans specimen scanning specimen shows density variation paddle outer edges less dense central core area paddles underside indicates paddle strengthened thickened cuticle metals sequestering cuticle latter likely distinct contrast shown location highest density near center paddle point impact mandibles closed likely help brace paddle misfires mandibles impact soft
