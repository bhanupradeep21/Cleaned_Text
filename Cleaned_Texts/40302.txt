land must first prepared special heavy machinery cut brush ground level paths must also cleared conventional metal detectors every intervals handlers safely walk rats wear harnesses connected rope suspended two handlers rats led search demarcated zone x sq ft indicate scent explosives usually scratching ground points indicated rats marked followed later technicians using metal detectors mines found excavated hand according ngo main advantage conventional methods speed point past studies show less percent landmine suspected land actually contains landmines animals dogs rats detect explosives ignore scrap metal old coins nuts bolts etc thus able check areas land faster conventional claim one rat check sq ft around field practical rate slower rats capable searching sq ft per day part team including conventional rats indigenous subsaharan africa suited tropical climates could resistant many endemic diseases resources needed train raise rat adulthood lifespan six eight years furthermore rats form bonds specific trainers like dogs rather motivated work food trained rats transferred handlers minefields rats light detonate pressureactivated mine walking small size also means rats easily transported sites noted rats search reliably areas thick vegetation often search erratically humans offering lower level assurance land minefree additionally work short periods heat limiting output manual demining teams still globally preferred method landmine clearance currently apopo organisation world use giant sputum samples already conventionally tested retested rats rats
