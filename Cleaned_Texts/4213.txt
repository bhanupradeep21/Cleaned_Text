gastrointestinal cancer refers malignant conditions gastrointestinal tract gi tract accessory organs digestion including esophagus stomach biliary system pancreas small intestine large intestine rectum anus symptoms relate organ affected include obstruction leading difficulty swallowing defecating abnormal bleeding associated problems diagnosis often requires endoscopy followed biopsy suspicious tissue treatment depends location tumor well type cancer cell whether invaded tissues spread elsewhere factors also determine prognosis overall gi tract accessory organs digestion pancreas liver gall bladder responsible cancers deaths cancer system significant geographic variation rates different gastrointestinal esophageal cancer sixthmostcommon cancer world incidence three five males affected esophageal cancer belt incidence esophageal squamous cell carcinoma scc hundred times adjacent areas extends northeastern china central asia northern ethiopia also notably high two main types esophageal squamous cell carcinoma worldwide incidence type developed countries like north america europe adenocarcinoma cancer esophagus often detected late inasmuch typically early symptoms nevertheless cancer caught soon enough patients fiveyear survival rate time esophageal cancer usually detected though might spread beyond esophageal wall survival rate drops significantly china overall fiveyear survival rate advanced esophageal cancer united states cancer stomach also called gastric cancer fourthmostcommon type cancer secondhighest cause cancer death eastern asia china japan

contribute development gastric cancer include diet smoking alcohol consumption genetic aspects including number heritable syndromes infections example helicobacter pylori epsteinbarr virus pernicious

called hepatocellular carcinoma hcc hepatoma typically prolonged hepatitis b c infection result cirrhosis chronic alcoholism liver cancer may bring yellowing skin eyes jaundice itching pruritus cause
