extinct genus sloths family mylodontidae widespread across northern south america early late miocene epoch around million years ago fossils animal found brazil venezuela peru pseudoprepotherium lived tropical climate waterrich environment known remains limited limb bones except skulls teeth based remains likely medium largesized mylodontid genus described currently contains three species originally assigned genus pseudoprepotherium medium largesized member family mylodontidae material documented far consists mainly limb bones includes individual skulls remains jaws body weight around reconstructed smaller relatives using thigh bone around long large molds femur lengths estimated weighed surviving skull length partly deformed laterally means features recognizable bent profile line

currently discussion relatively wide recognition usually finds late development lines mylodontinae lestodontinae several studies shown since sometimes also discussed negatively however lineages associated nematheriinae octomylodontinae urumacotheriinae depending author controversial latter particular summarizes late miocene representatives northern south america principle many researchers urge revision entire family since many higher taxonomic units formal diagnosis position pseudoprepotherium within mylodontidae therefore ambiguous since genus largely defined limb bones based characteristics phylogenetic analyzes indicate pseudoprepotherium closely related modern representatives thinobadistes form widely found central north america however limb bones usually offer limited selection features determining family relationships therefore investigations little skull material see pseudoprepotherium clearly basally embedded mylodonts move form partly closer urumacotherium also
