wildlife corridor habitat corridor green area habitat connecting wildlife populations separated human activities structures roads development logging allows exchange individuals populations may help prevent negative effects inbreeding reduced genetic diversity via genetic drift often occur within isolated populations corridors may also help facilitate reestablishment populations reduced eliminated due random events fires disease may potentially moderate worst effects habitat whereas urbanization split habitat areas causing animals lose natural habitat ability move regions access resources habitat fragmentation due human development everincreasing threat habitat corridors serve manage effects habitat corridors considered management tool places destruction natural area greatly affected native species whether result human development natural disasters areas land broken populations become unstable fragmented corridors reconnect fragmented populations reduce population fluctuations contributing three factors help stabilize population rosenberg et among first define constitutes wildlife corridor developing conceptual model emphasized role wildlife corridor facilitator movement restricted requirements native vegetation intermediate target patches wildlife corridors additionally strong indirect effects plant populations increasing pollen seed dispersal animals facilitating movement disparate taxa isolated corridors must large enough support minimum critical populations reduce migration barriers maximize connectivity wildlife corridors may also encompass aquatic habitats often called riparian usually come form rivers streams terrestrial corridors come form wooded strips connecting woodland areas urban species generally categorized one two groups passage users corridor dwellers passage users occupy corridors brief periods time animals use corridors events seasonal migration dispersal juvenile moving parts large home range animals large herbivores medium large carnivores migratory species passage corridor dwellers occupy passage anywhere several days several years species plants reptiles amphibians birds insects small mammals spend entire lives linear habitats case corridor must provide sufficient resources support habitat corridors categorized according width wider corridors generally encouraging however overall corridor quality depends design creating effective following three divisions corridor widths habitat corridors also divided according continuity continuous corridors strips broken stepping stone corridors small patches suitable habitat however stepping stone corridors may susceptible edge effects corridors also take form wildlife crossings underpasses overpasses used crossing manmade feature roads reducing humanwildlife conflict roadkill observations shown underpasses actually successful overpasses many times animals timid cross bridge front traffic would prefer researchers use markrecapture

via information migration patterns population wildlife corridors effective designed considering ecology target species addition factors like seasonal movement avoidance behavior dispersal habitat generally corridors best built certain degree randomness asymmetry oriented perpendicular wildlife corridors susceptible edge effects habitat quality along edge habitat fragment often much lower core

wildlife behavior frequently used overall success wildlife corridors yet definitively demonstrated corridors replacement preserving land fragmentation however help bolster populations increasing urbanization habitat destruction species likely utilize habitat corridors depending migration mating patterns making essential corridor design targeted towards specific plants may use road verges corridors however mammals may cross roads usually limited amount space available corridors buffers usually added without buffer zone corridors become affected disturbances human land use change possibility corridors could aid spread invasive species threatening multiple unfortunately another limiting factor implementation corridors often extremely expensive construct inconclusive data
