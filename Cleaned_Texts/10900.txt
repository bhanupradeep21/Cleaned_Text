papillary tumors pineal region first described jouvet et al introduced world health organization classification central nervous system papillary tumors pineal region located pineal gland located center brain pineal gland located roof diencephalon coneshaped structure dorsal midbrain tumor appears derived specialized ependymal cells subcommissural papillary tumors central nervous system particularly pineal region rare diagnosing extremely common symptom papillary tumor headaches common people think nothing brain tumors dangerousoriginal research lot symptoms go along people tend wait long time seeking medical help time people go see doctor headaches become consistent stop symptom however occurs secondary hydrocephalus result compression cerebral aqueduct cerebral aqueduct narrow channel midbrain connects third fourth ventricles tumor blocks pathway cerebrospinal fluid cause headaches often hydrocephalus occurs shunt put place order alleviate one case study endoscopic third ventriculostomy performed first line procedure treat hydrocephalus also diagnostic cases patients progressive diplopia double also although cases patients sometimes experience nausea pineal region tumors normally composed variety cells including astrocytes ganglion cells blood vessels pinealocytes cells organ pinealocytes specialized neurons rich monoaminergic neurotransmitters including serotonin norepinephrine specifically papillary tumors region made ependymal cells form papilla papilla meant surface cells ependymal cells line inside ventricles brain cells proteins make characteristics tumor proteins arise blood vessels nerve cells muscle tumors papillary tumors case known predisposing genetic characteristics stated dr janss interviewed said nothing links likelihood getting tumor type genetics meaning nothing inherited however technically speaking genetics involved sense inheritability tumor cells may differ structure function normal function directed deoxyribonucleic acid dna meant certain cells specific area pineal region ependymal cells cells divide millions cells divide genetic material copied tumor collection mutations typos genetic material disrupts function normal cell therefore cells differentiate meant abnormal cells continue grow divide produce abnormal cells mass abnormal cells may eventually become papillary tumors pineal region normally well circumscribed reported fairly large ranging centimeters tumors sometimes feature cystic critical diagnosis neoplasm often difficult similarity primary secondary papillary lesions pineal region including parenchymal pineal tumors papillary ependymoma papillary meningioma choroid plexus papilloma metastatic papillary papillary tumors characteristically show discrete compressive border adjacent pineal gland brain parenchyma nuclei tend regular roundtooval contain stippled chromatin cytoplasmic often nuclear expression protein present nearly tumor cells vimentin typically stains tumor cell cytoplasm adjacent vessel cells tumor usually show columnar cuboidal cytoplasm welldefined cytoplasmic membrane vacuolated clear cells necrosis cell death normally observed extent tumors

grade tumors biopsied defined either malignant meaning cancerous benign meaning cancer free seeing cases tumor determined either grade ii grade iii according mitotic activity varies tumors ranging mitoses per high power grade ii tumors relatively slow growing slightly abnormal microscopic appearance spread nearby normal tissue grade ii tumors also recur highergrade grade iii tumors malignant types tumors cells actively reproducing abnormal cells cells tumor often grow nearby normal brain tissue grade iii tumors tend recur highergrade papillary tumors pineal region extremely rare constituting central nervous system tumors commonly occur adults mean age cases reported people ages years slight predominance females rarity tumors still lot unknown information many case studies reported patients diagnosed specific type tumor information comes findings resulting case studies since papillary tumors pineal region first described seventy cases published english since small number cases reported treatment guidelines established larger number cases contain longer clinical followup needed optimize management patients rare even though general consensus morphology immunohistochemical characteristics required diagnosis histological grading criteria yet fully defined biological behavior appears specific type tumor appears high potential local recurrence high tumor bed recurrence rate five years initial surgery suggests need tumor bed boost radiotherapy surgical stated specific treatment guidelines yet established however gross total resection tumor clinical factor associated overall progressionfree value radiotherapy well chemotherapy disease progression need investigated future trials information provide important insight longterm management
