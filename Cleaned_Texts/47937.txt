base rate fallacy also called base rate base rate bias type fallacy people tend ignore base rate eg general prevalence favor individuating information ie information pertaining specific base rate neglect specific form general extension neglect also called prosecutors fallacy defense attorneys fallacy applied results statistical tests dna tests context law proceedings terms introduced william c thompson edward schumann although argued prosecutors fallacy definition extends many additional invalid imputations guilt liability analyzable errors base rates bayess example base rate fallacy false positive paradox also known accuracy paradox paradox describes situations false positive test results true positives means classifier low precision example facial recognition camera identify wanted criminals accurately analyzes people day high accuracy outweighed number tests programs list criminals likely far false positives true probability positive test result determined accuracy test also characteristics sampled prevalence proportion given condition lower tests false positive rate even tests low risk giving false positive individual case give false true positives especially counterintuitive interpreting positive result test lowprevalence population dealt positive results drawn highprevalence false positive rate test higher proportion new population condition test administrator whose experience drawn testing highprevalence population may conclude experience positive test result usually indicates positive subject fact false positive far likely occurred imagine running infectious disease test population persons infected test false positive rate false negative rate expected outcome tests population would population person receiving positive test could confident correctly indicates infection consider test applied population b infected expected outcome tests population b would population b total people positive test result actually infected probability actually infected one told one infected test otherwise appears accurate tester experience group might find paradox group b result usually correctly indicated infection usually false positive confusion posterior probability infection prior probability receiving false positive natural error receiving healththreatening test result many would answer high correct probability explanation follows average every drivers tested therefore probability given driver among positive test results really drunk displaystyle validity result however hinge validity initial assumption police officer stopped driver truly random bad driving another nonarbitrary reason stopping driver present calculation also involves probability drunk driver driving competently nondrunk driver driving incompetently formally probability roughly established using bayess theorem goal find probability driver drunk given breathalyzer indicated drunk represented means breathalyzer indicates driver drunk bayess theorem tells us told following first paragraph see formula one needs pd bayes theorem one compute preceding values using law total probability gives plugging numbers bayes theorem one finds precision test city million inhabitants let terrorists nonterrorists simplify example assumed people present city inhabitants thus base rate probability randomly selected inhabitant city terrorist base rate probability inhabitant nonterrorist attempt catch terrorists city installs alarm system surveillance camera automatic facial recognition software software two failure rates suppose inhabitant triggers alarm probability person terrorist words pt b probability terrorist detected given ringing bell someone making base rate fallacy would infer probability detected person terrorist although inference seems make sense actually bad reasoning calculation show probability terrorist actually near near fallacy arises confusing natures two different failure rates number nonbells per terrorists number nonterrorists per bells unrelated quantities one necessarily equal dont even almost equal show consider happens identical alarm system set second city terrorists first city alarm sounds every nonterrorist inhabitants detected unlike first city alarm never sounds terrorist therefore occasions alarm sounding nonterrorists false negative rate even calculated number nonterrorists per bells city yet pt b zero chance terrorist detected given ringing bell imagine first citys entire population one million people pass front camera terrorists trigger nonterrorists therefore people trigger alarm among terrorists probability person triggering alarm actually terrorist less far initial guess base rate fallacy misleading example many nonterrorists terrorists number false positives nonterrorists scanned terrorists much larger true positives terrorists scanned terrorists multiple practitioners argued base rate terrorism extremely low using data mining predictive algorithms identify terrorists feasibly work due false positive estimates number false positives accurate result vary ten one consequently investigating lead would cost time level accuracy required make models viable likely unachievable foremost low base rate terrorism also means lack data make accurate context detecting terrorism false negatives highly undesirable thus must minimised much possible however requires increasing sensitivity cost specificity increasing false also questionable whether use models law enforcement would meet requisite burden proof given results would false crime committed forensic analysis determines perpetrator certain blood type shared population suspect arrested found blood type prosecutor might charge suspect crime basis alone claim trial probability defendant guilty however conclusion close correct defendant selected main suspect based robust evidence discovered prior blood test unrelated otherwise reasoning presented flawed overlooks high prior probability prior blood test random innocent person assume instance people live town crime occurred means people live perpetrators blood type one true perpetrator therefore true probability defendant guilty based fact blood type matches killer far less argued prosecutor prosecutor fallacy involves assuming prior probability random match equal probability defendant innocent using prosecutor questioning expert witness may ask odds finding evidence innocent man small jury safely disregard possibility defendant innocent claim assumes probability evidence found innocent man probability man innocent given evidence found true whilst former usually small previous example due good forensic evidence procedures latter example directly relate often much higher since fact depends likely quite high prior odds defendant random innocent person j simpson tried acquitted murders exwife nicole brown simpson friend ronald goldman crime scene blood matched simpsons characteristics shared people however defense argued football stadium could filled angelenos matching sample figure would incorrect example prosecutor fallacy rely solely figure deduce given person matching sample would likely culprit trial prosecution presented evidence simpson violent toward wife defense argued one woman murdered every women subjected spousal abuse history simpson violent toward wife irrelevant trial however reasoning behind defenses calculation fallacious according author gerd gigerenzer correct probability requires additional context simpsons wife subjected domestic violence rather subjected domestic violence simpson killed someone gigerenzer writes chances batterer actually murdered partner given killed approximately cases spousal abuse end murder cases murder history spousal abuse committed spouse sally clark british woman accused killed first child weeks age second child weeks age prosecution expert witness sir roy meadow professor consultant testify probability two children family dying sids million much less frequent actual rate measured historical data meadow estimated singlesids death data assumption probability deaths uncorrelated meadow acknowledged million impossibility argued accidents would happen every hundred years country million families vastly likely doubledeaths due m√ºnchausen syndrome proxy rare accident however good reason suppose likelihood death sids family significantly greater previous child already died circumstances genetic predisposition sids likely invalidate assumed statistical making families susceptible sids error outcome ecological likelihood two sids deaths family soundly estimated squaring likelihood single death otherwise similar million greatly underestimated chance two successive accidents even assessment accurate court seems missed fact million number meant nothing priori probability weighed priori probabilities alternatives given two deaths occurred one following explanations must true priori extremely improbable unclear whether estimate probability second possibility ever proposed trial whether comparison first two probabilities understood key estimate make statistical analysis assessing prosecutions case case innocence clark convicted resulting press release royal statistical society pointed ray hill mathematics professor salford attempted accurately compare chances two possible explanations concluded successive accidents times likely successive murders priori odds clarks guilt court found forensic pathologist examined babies withheld exculpatory evidence higher court later quashed clarks conviction january experiments people found prefer individuating information general information former experiments students asked estimate grade point averages gpas hypothetical students given relevant statistics gpa distribution students tended ignore given descriptive information particular student even new descriptive information obviously little relevance school finding used argue interviews unnecessary part college admissions process interviewers unable pick successful candidates better basic statistics psychologists daniel kahneman amos tversky attempted explain finding terms simple rule heuristic called representativeness argued many judgments relating likelihood cause effect based representative one thing another kahneman considers base rate neglect specific form extension richard nisbett argued attributional biases like fundamental attribution error instances base rate fallacy people use consensus information base rate others behaved similar situations instead prefer simpler dispositional considerable debate psychology conditions people appreciate base rate researchers heuristicsandbiases program stressed empirical findings showing people tend ignore base rates make inferences violate certain norms probabilistic reasoning bayes theorem conclusion drawn line research human probabilistic thinking fundamentally flawed researchers emphasized link cognitive processes information formats arguing conclusions generally consider example required inference estimate posterior probability randomly picked driver drunk given breathalyzer test positive formally probability calculated using bayes theorem shown however different ways presenting relevant information consider following formally equivalent variant problem case relevant numerical pd drunk pd presented terms natural frequencies respect certain reference class see reference class problem empirical studies show peoples inferences correspond closely bayes rule information presented way helping overcome baserate neglect consequence organizations like cochrane collaboration recommend using kind format communicating health teaching people translate kinds bayesian reasoning problems natural frequency formats effective merely teaching plug probabilities percentages bayes also shown graphical representations natural frequencies eg icon arrays hypothetical outcome plots help people make better natural frequency formats helpful one important reason information format facilitates required inference simplifies necessary calculations seen using alternative way computing required probability pdrunkd ndrunk denotes number drivers drunk get positive breathalyzer result nd denotes total number cases positive breathalyzer result equivalence
