severity symptoms appear vary according amount agent absorbed rate entry body small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating tremors accompanied characteristically constricted pupils effects tabun half toxic sarin inhalation low concentrations irritating eyes sarin tabun also breaks slowly repeated exposure lead build effects tabun appear slowly tabun absorbed skin rather inhaled victim may absorb lethal dose quickly although death may delayed one two persons clothing release toxic chemical minutes inhaled lethal dosages kill one ten minutes liquid absorbed eyes kills almost quickly however people experience mild moderate exposure tabun recover completely treated almost soon exposure median lethal dose tabun lethal dose man mgkg median lethal dose respiration humans respiratory lethal doses kill anytime minutes liquid enters eye also kill quickly absorbed via skin death may occur minutes take hours treatment suspected tabun poisoning often three injections nerve agent
