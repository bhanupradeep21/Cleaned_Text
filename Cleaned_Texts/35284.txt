spirometry meaning measuring breath common pulmonary function tests pfts measures lung function specifically amount volume andor speed flow air inhaled exhaled spirometry helpful assessing breathing patterns identify conditions asthma pulmonary fibrosis cystic fibrosis copd also helpful part system health surveillance breathing patterns measured spirometry generates pneumotachographs charts plot volume flow air coming lungs one inhalation one exhalation spirometry test performed using device called comes several different varieties spirometers display following graphs called spirograms basic forced volume vital capacity fvc test varies slightly depending equipment used form either closed open circuit regardless differences testing procedure providers recommended follow atsers standardisation spirometry standard procedure ensures accurate objectively collected data based common reference reduce compatibility results shared across differing medical groups patient asked put
