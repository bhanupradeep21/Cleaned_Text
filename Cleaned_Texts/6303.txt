categorical perception phenomenon perception distinct categories gradual change variable along continuum originally observed auditory stimuli found applicable perceptual building blocks language use name categories speechsounds da ga learned first question must answer whether categorical categories merely arbitrary points along continuum turns one analyzes sound spectrogram ba pa example found

speech production according abandoned motor theory speech perception reason people perceive abrupt change ba pa way hear speech sounds influenced people produce speak varying along continuum
