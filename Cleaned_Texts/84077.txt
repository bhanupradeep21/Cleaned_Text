associated pairbonding activities increases links physiological indicators mate retention behaviors despite link maintaining pairbonded relationship difficult especially around alternative mates presented alternative mates high mate value humans tend view current relationship less favorably occurs males presented physically attractive females occurs females presented socially dominant however psychological countermeasures processes first individuals committed relationship tend devalue alternative mate options thus finding less second individuals always consider potential alternatives
