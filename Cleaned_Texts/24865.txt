camera trap camera automatically triggered change activity vicinity like presence animal human typically equipped motion sensor usually passive infrared pir sensor active infrared air sensor using infrared light camera trapping method capturing wild animals film researchers present used ecological research decades addition applications hunting wildlife viewing research applications include studies nest ecology detection rare species estimation population size species richness research habitat use occupation humanbuilt camera traps also known trail cameras used capture images wildlife little human interference since introduction commercial infraredtriggered cameras early use advancements quality camera equipment method field observation become popular among hunting played important role development camera traps since hunters use scout hunters opened commercial market devices leading many improvements time great advantage camera traps record accurate data without disturbing photographed animal data superior human observations reviewed minimally disturb wildlife replace use invasive survey monitoring techniques live trap release operate continually silently provide proof species present area reveal prints scats belong species provide evidence management policy decisions costeffective monitoring tool infrared flash cameras low disturbance besides olfactory acoustic cues camera flash may scare animals avoid destroy camera traps major alternative light source infrared usually detectable mammals camera traps also helpful quantifying number different species area effective method attempting count hand every individual organism field also useful identifying new rare species yet well documented key recent years rediscovery species blacknaped pheasantpigeon thought extinct years captured trail camera using camera traps wellbeing survival rate animals observed camera traps helpful determining behavioral activity patterns animals time day visit mineral camera traps also useful record animal earliest models used traditional film oneshot trigger function cameras contained film needed collected developed like standard camera today advanced cameras utilize digital photography sending photos directly computer even though method uncommon highly useful could future research method cameras even programmed take multiple pictures triggering nontriggered cameras either run continuously take pictures specific time intervals common ones advanced cameras triggered sensing movement andor heat signature increase chances capturing useful image infrared beams also used trigger camera video also emerging option camera traps allowing researchers record running streams video document animal behavior battery life cameras another important factor cameras used large batteries offer longer running time camera cumbersome set lugging equipment field site weather proof waterproof housing camera traps protect equipment damage disguise equipment noisereduction housing limits possibility disturbing scaring away animals sound recording another feature added camera record animal calls times specific animals wireless transmission allows images videos sent using cellular networks users view activity instantly without disturbing targets use invisible flash noglow ir leverages nm infrared waves illuminate night image without detected humans wildlife waves outside visible light spectrum subject doesnt know watched humidity highly negative effect camera traps result camera malfunction problematic since malfunction often immediately discovered large portion research time often researcher expecting experiment complete trek back site discover far less data expected even none best type weather work place low humidity stable moderate temperatures also possibility motion activated camera movement within sensitivity range camera sensor trigger picture camera might end numerous pictures anything wind moves plants far problems camera traps overlooked sometimes subjects negatively affect research one common things animals unknowingly topple camera splatter mud water ruining film lens one method animal tampering involves animals taking cameras uses examples animals actually taking cameras snapping pictures local people sometimes use game trails wildlife hence also photographed camera traps placed along trails make camera traps useful tool antipoaching law enforcement effort one important things consider setting camera traps choosing location order get best results camera traps near mineral licks along game trails likely animals visit frequently normally seen animals congregate around mineral licks consume water soil useful reducing toxin levels supplement mineral intake diet locations camera traps also allow variety animals show different times use licks different ways allowing study animal study specific behaviors particular species helpful identify target species runs dens beds latrines food caches favored hunting foraging grounds etc knowledge target species general habits seasonal variations behavior habitat use well tracks scat feeding sign spoor extremely helpful locating identifying sites strategy described great detail many bait may used attract desired species however type frequency method presentation require careful another major factor whether best technique use specific research type species one attempting observe camera species smallbodied birds insects may small trigger camera reptiles amphibians able trip infrared heat differentialbased sensors however methods developed detect species utilizing reflector based sensor system however medium largebodied terrestrial species camera traps proven successful tool httpsenwikipediaorgwikicameratrap
