jane shelby richardson born january american biophysicist best known developing richardson diagram ribbon diagram method representing structure ribbon diagrams become standard representation protein structures facilitated investigation protein structure function globally interests astronomy math physics botany philosophy richardson took unconventional route establishing science today richardson professor biochemistry duke richardson born january grew teaneck new jersey father electrical engineer mother english teacher parents encouraged interest science member local astronomy clubs early elementary attended teaneck high school third place westinghouse science talent search prestigious science fair united states calculations satellite sputniks orbit continued education intending study mathematics astronomy physics swarthmore college however richardson instead graduated phi beta kappa bachelors degree philosophy minor physics pursued graduate work philosophy harvard university meanwhile able enroll plant taxonomy evolution courses harvard would later contribute bigpicture approach studying protein structure since harvards philosophy focused modern philosophy instead richardsons interest classical philosophy richardson left masters degree harvard postgraduation richardson tried teaching high school soon realized career path subsequently rejoined scientific world working technician massachusetts institute technology laboratory husband david richardson met swarthmore mit david richardson pursuing doctorate al cottons lab using xray crystallography study structure staphylococcal nuclease jane richardson learned necessary technical skills scientific background biochemistry biophysics work lab worked alongside husband still works today richardson later began drawing eponymous diagrams method interpreting structures protein course career richardson recognized many prestigious institutions scientific community july awarded macarthur fellowship work elected national academy sciences american academy arts sciences institute medicine part role national academy sciences richardson serves panels advise white house pentagon regarding nationally important scientific matters year richardson elected president biophysical society became fellow american crystallographic association richardson currently james b duke professor biochemistry duke richardsons continue jointly head research group duke richardson contributor wikipedia prominent member wikiproject richardsons first forays science field astronomy observing position sputnik time artificial satellite two successive nights managed calculate predicted orbit submitted results westinghouse science talent search winning third place richardson joined husband david c richardson completing phd work mit studying structure staphylococcal nuclease protein xray crystallography doctoral staphylococcal nuclease among first dozen protein structures classes botany evolution taken pursuing degree shaped thinking work chemistry crystallographic studies jane richardson come realize general classification scheme developed recurring structural motifs meantime jane david richardson moved duke university solved first crystal structure superoxide dismutase published findings protein relatedness nature paper entitled Î²sheet topology relatedness richardson developed ribbon diagram illustrate findings course taxonomic research iconic images first appeared review journal advances protein chemistry article titled anatomy taxonomy protein structure early hallmark publication structural bioinformatics diagrams since become standard way visualizing protein structure specifically depicting betasheet topology connections amino acid sequences peptides make proteins protein folding process involves four levels primary structures secondary structures tertiary structures quaternary structures secondary structures result hydrogen bond interactions adjacent amino acids sequences form alpha helices tertiary structures higher order protein folding depict conformation connectivity alphahelices betasheets richardsons ribbon diagrams illustrate betasheet topology connectivity higherorder protein structures formalized general rules betasheets linkage via hairpin connections crossover connections hairpin connection peptide backbone stems loops around return betasheet end left crossover connection involves peptide backbone extending one betasheet looping around enter another betasheet opposite end initial drawings continual discoveries contribute broader understanding protein energetics evolution peter agre nobel laureate fellow duke professor said richardsons work jane david work allowed us reveal form proteins easier understand richardsons recent work diversified beyond classification crystallography stretched fields synthetic biochemistry computational biology pioneers de novo design proteins reverse engineering approach make test theoretical
