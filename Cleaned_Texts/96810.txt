hafniumiii iodide inorganic compound hafnium iodine formula hf black like group trihalides hafniumiii iodide prepared hafniumiv iodide hightemperature reduction hafnium metal although incomplete reaction contamination product excess metal often metals used reducing agent example aluminium product often nonstoichiometric compositions hf hf hafniumiii iodide adopts crystal structure zirconiumiii similar structure based hexagonal close packing iodide ions one third octahedral interstices occupied consists parallel chains facesharing hafniumiii iodide lower magnetic moment expected metal ion indicating nonnegligible separation originally reported subsequent study nonstoichiometric hafniumiii iodide indicated lower symmetry like chloride bromide hafniumiii iodide powerful enough reducing agent reduce water therefore aqueous
