pulse pressure difference systolic diastolic blood measured millimeters mercury mmhg represents force heart generates time contracts healthy pulse pressure around pulse pressure consistently mmhg greater likely associated disease pulse pressure mmhg increases risk cardiovascular pulse pressure considered low less systolic example systolic pressure mmhg pulse pressure would considered low less mmhg since low pulse pressure symptom disorders congestive heart pulse pressure calculated difference systolic blood pressure diastolic blood systemic pulse pressure approximately proportional stroke volume amount blood ejected left ventricle systole pump action inversely proportional compliance similar elasticity aorta highest compliance arterial system due part relatively greater proportion elastin fibers versus smooth muscle collagen serves dampen pulsatile maximum pumping pressure left ventricle thereby reducing initial systolic pulse pressure slightly raising subsequent diastolic phase aorta becomes rigid disorders arteriosclerosis atherosclerosis pulse pressure would high due less compliance aorta pulse pressure considered abnormally low less systolic pulse pressure extremely low ie mmhg less may indicate low stroke volume congestive heart common cause low narrow pulse pressure drop left ventricular stroke volume trauma low narrow pulse pressure suggests significant blood narrow pulse pressure also caused aortic due decreased stroke volume aortic conditions cause narrow pulse pressure include blood loss due decreased blood volume cardiac tamponade due decreased filling time majority conditions systolic pressure decreases diastolic pressure remains normal leading narrow pulse pulse pressures mmhg increase risk heart disease heart rhythm disorders stroke cardiovascular diseases events higher pulse pressures also thought play role eye kidney damage diseases currently drugs approved lower pulse pressure however antihypertensive drugs shown modestly lower pulse pressure drugs used hypertension actually counterproductive side effect increasing resting pulse hypertensive patients high pulse pressure often indicator conduit artery stiffness stiffness major arterial walls stiffer less compliant heart beat harder overcome resistance stiff arteries resulting increased pulse conditions lead high pulse pressure include aortic regurgitation aortic sclerosis severe irondeficiency anemia due decreased blood viscosity arteriosclerosis due loss arterial compliance hyperthyroidism due increased systolic pressure arteriovenous malformation among aortic regurgitation aortic valve insufficiency results backward flow blood regurgitation ejected systole return left ventricle aorta diastole increases systolic blood pressure decreases diastolic blood pressure leading widened pulse high pulse pressure combined bradycardia irregular breathing pattern associated increased intracranial pressure condition called cushings triad seen people head trauma increased intracranial common causes widening pulse pressure citation needed individuals aerobic exercise systolic pressure progressively increases diastolic pressure remains thereby widening pulse pressure pressure changes facilitate increase stroke volume cardiac output lower mean arterial pressure enabling greater aerobic capacity physical performance diastolic drop reflects reduced systemic vascular resistance muscle arterioles response source needed vast amount diagnostic prognostic prophylactic value derived proper monitoring interpretation pulse pressure pulse pressure implications cardiovascular disease well many noncardiovascular diseases even people without risk factors cardiovascular disease consistently wide pulse pressure remains significant independent predictor allcause cardiovascular particular coronary positive correlation high pulse pressure markers inflammation creactive awareness effects pulse pressure morbidity mortality lacking relative awareness effects elevated systolic diastolic blood pressure however pulse pressure consistently found stronger independent predictor cardiovascular events especially older populations systolic diastolic mean arterial increased risk exists men women even cardiovascular risk factors present increased risk also exists even cases high pulse pressure caused diastolic pressure decreasing time systolic remains steady even slightly metaanalysis showed mmhg increase pulse pressure associated increased risk cardiovascular mortality increase risk coronary end points study authors also noted risks cardiovascular end points increase higher systolic pressures given systolic blood pressure risk major cardiovascular end points increases rather decreases lower diastolic suggests interventions lower diastolic pressure without also lowering systolic pressure thus lowering pulse pressure could actually counterproductive increased pulse pressure also risk factor development atrial drugs currently approved lower pulse pressure although antihypertensive drugs currently market may effect modestly lowering pulse pressure others may actually counterproductive effect
