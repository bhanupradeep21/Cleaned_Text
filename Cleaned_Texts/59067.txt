fish slaughter process killing fish typically harvesting sea fish farms least one trillion fish slaughtered year human consumption relatively humane slaughter methods developed including percussive electric stunning however fish harvesting continues use methods like suffocation air carbondioxide stunning ice chilling may optimise fish welfare instances according food agriculture organization fao total million tons fish crustaceans molluscs aquatic animals captured sum million tons wild animals million tons farmed animals total freshwater fish diadromous fish marine fish remainder molluscs crustaceans number individual wild fish killed year estimated trillion based fao tonnage statistics combined estimated mean weights fish fao numbers include illegal unreported unregulated fishing discarded fish included overreporting china subtracted totals increase similar estimate number farmed fish slaughtered year midsized trout farms uk may process fish per hour often operated people may necessary kill trout short notice even research fish suffering slaughter relies measures indicate fish stressed indicators used welfare studies following electric stunning fish gradually resume consciousness begin make rhythmic gillcover movements based eeg correlations believed stunned fish remain insensible resumed rhythmic gill used convenient assessment tool effectiveness electric european food safety authority observed many existing commercial killing methods expose fish substantial suffering prolonged period aquatic animal health code world organisation animal health considers following slaughter methods ethicists gone argued available humane slaughter methods air asphyxiation oldest slaughter method fish considered inhumane take fish hour one dutch study found took minutes various species fish become insensible fish evolved lowoxygen environments take longer die higher temperatures fish lose consciousness meat quality shelflife also diminished method also called live chilling ice bath method involves putting fish baths ice water chill eventually die anoxia chilling slows metabolic rate oxygen needs may prolong duration death instances cold adapted species taking hour grounds farm animal welfare councils report farmedfish welfare stated cooling live trout ice removed water contrast later research suggested warm mediterranean species sea bream sea bass method might least preferable air asphyxiation fish showing lower levels stress research showed ice water faster less stressful anaesthetics killing tropical ornamental fishes like often applied salmon trout narcosis involves filling fish water produce acidic ph injures brain procedure apparently stressful evidenced fish swimming vigorously trying escape tank immobilizes fish within minutes fish remain conscious subsequent stunning salting involves application salt container holding fish salt applied enough weaken fish salting fish slaughtering killing method applicable freshwater species exsanguination process whereby animal cut bleeds death fish cut highly vascular body regions process stressful unless animals unconscious stunned according behavioral neural criteria fish may remain conscious minutes time major blood vessels cut lose eel brains may continue process information minutes decapitated fish may remain sensible minutes evisceration without stunning fish simply eviscerated alive without stunned fish instead restrained stops struggling also known knocking percussive stunning involves hitting fishs head wooden plastic club called priest one two appropriate blows disrupt brain sufficiently render fish insensible potentially even kill directly however applying method correctly requires training effort percussive stunning must applied one fish time typically used large fish salmon trout operator skilled percussive stunning among humane methods also yield high meat one comparison slaughter methods found percussive stunning best welfare performance measured low hematocrit low plasma glucose low lactate high muscle energy fish species automated percussive stunning tools pneumatic club however building automated machine process orient percussively stun bleed bulk quantities small fish would pithing also known ikejime ikijime involves sticking sharp spike brain fish done properly kill quickly however operator misses brain results may stressful fish resources ikijimecom developed define brain location many popular fish species percussive stunning spiking used kill one fish time mainly used large species tuna shooting large fish also electricity humane alternatives applied addition potentially producing unconsciousness quickly stunning reduces stress restraint removed electrical parameters optimized electrical stunning may produce immobility without loss consciousness little public data comparing optimal stun settings found researchers settings used commercial slaughter operations unknown effective realworld stunning addition proper stun parameters vary significantly electricity may introduce bleedspots proper settings systems developed slaughter large numbers fish whilst maintaining welfare
