developmental verbal dyspraxia dvd also known childhood apraxia speech cas developmental apraxia speech condition individual problems saying sounds syllables words muscle weakness paralysis brain problems planning move body parts eg lips jaw tongue needed speech individual knows want say brain difficulty coordinating muscle movements necessary say exact cause disorder usually many observations suggest genetic cause dvd many disorder family history communication gene implicated many studies condition cause condition inherited autosomal dominant manner however roughly cases de cure dvd appropriate intensive intervention people motor speech disorder improve childhood apraxia speech cas neurological childhood pediatric speech sound disorder precision consistency movements underlying speech impaired absence neuromuscular deficits eg abnormal reflexes abnormal tone cas may occur result known neurological impairment association complex neurobehavioral disorders known unknown origin idiopathic neurogenic speech sound disorder core impairment planning andor programming spatiotemporal parameters movement sequences results errors speech sound production prosody american speechlanguagehearing association asha ad hoc committee apraxia speech children three significant features differentiate dvdcas childhood speech sound disorders features even though dvdcas developmental disorder simply disappear children grow older children disorder follow typical patterns language acquisition need treatment order make dvdcas motor disorder means problem located brain signals cases cause unknown possible causes include genetic syndromes recent research focused significance species individual research regarding ke family half members extended family three generations exhibited heritable developmental verbal dyspraxia found defective copy studies suggest gene well genetic issues could explain including microdeletion new research suggests role sodium channel development perisylvian areas maintain key language circuits broca wernicke patients mutations oralmotor speech birthprenatal injuries well stroke also causes dvdcas furthermore dvdcas occur secondary characteristic variety conditions include forms fragile x syndrome chromosome involving duplications developmental verbal dyspraxia diagnosed speech language pathologist slp specific exams measure oral mechanisms speech oral mechanisms exam involves tasks pursing lips blowing licking lips elevating tongue also involves examination mouth complete exam also involves observation patient eating talking tests kaufman speech praxis formal examination also used differential diagnosis dvdcas often possible children age two years old even children years clear diagnosis always occur age may still unable focus cooperate diagnostic cure dvdcas appropriate intensive intervention people disorder improve dvdcas requires various forms therapy varies individual needs patient typically treatment involves oneonone therapy speech language pathologist children dvdcas consistency key element treatment consistency form communication well development use oral communication extremely important aiding childs speech learning processcitation needed many therapy approaches supported thorough evidence however aspects treatment seem agreed upon following although aspects treatment supported much clinical documentation lack evidence systematic research studies ashas position statement asha states critical need collaborative interdisciplinary programmatic research neural substrates behavioral correlates treatment options dvdcas one technique frequently used treat dvdcas integral stimulation integral stimulation based cognitive motor learning focusing cognitive motor planning needed complex motor task speech often referred watch listen approach founded multistep hierarchy strategies treatment hierarchy strategies allows clinician alter treatment depending upon needs child uses various modalities presentation emphasizing auditory visual modes experts suggest extensive practice experience new material key hundreds target stimuli elicited single session furthermore distributed shorter frequent random treatment mix target nontarget utterances produces greater overall learningcitation needed six steps hierarchy upon integral stimulation therapy children loosely organized another treatment strategy shown positive effects integrated phonological approach approach incorporates targeted speech production practice phonological awareness activities uses letters phonological cues prompt speech mcneill gillon dodd studied children ages dvdcas treated approach two times week two sixweek blocks time separated sixweek withdrawal block found positive effects children areas speech production phonological awareness word decoding letter knowledge spelling results show clinically productive target speech production phonological awareness letter knowledge spelling reading particularly important since children dvdcas often continuous problems reading spelling even production speech httpsenwikipediaorgwikidevelopmentalverbaldyspraxia
