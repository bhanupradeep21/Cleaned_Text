phantosmia phantom smell also called olfactory hallucination phantom smelling odor actually intrinsically suspicious formal evaluation detection relatively low levels odour particles tricky task air epistemology occur one nostril unpleasant phantosmia cacosmia common often described smelling something burned foul spoiled experiencing occasional phantom smells normal usually goes away hallucinations type seem go away keep coming back upsetting disrupt individuals quality olfactory hallucinations caused common medical conditions nasal infections nasal polyps dental problems result neurological conditions migraines head injuries strokes parkinsons disease seizures brain also symptom certain mental disorders depression bipolar disorder intoxication withdrawal drugs alcohol psychotic environmental exposures sometimes cause well smoking exposure certain types chemicals eg insecticides solvents radiation treatment head neck physician determine problem sense smell olfactory system taste gustatory system caused neurological psychiatric disorder phantosmia usually goes away though sometimes gradual occur several caused illness eg sinusitis go away illness problem persists causes significant discomfort doctor might recommend nasal saline drops antidepressant anticonvulsant medications anesthesia parts nose rare circumstances surgical procedures remove olfactory nerves olfactory disorders hyposmia anosmia found symptom mood disorders depression however known olfactory disorders occur indeed symptom depressive proposed phantosmia may early sign neurodegenerative disease parkinsons may also sign intracranial brain tumours studies also found symptoms phantosmia alleviated patient treated another case male reported first abnormal symptoms irregular bowel movements patient developed irregular eye movements developed sleep behavior disorder subsequently developed phantosmia smelled described stinky unpleasant patient display following symptoms loss awareness confusion automatisms convulsive seizures auditoryvisual phantosmia found coexist patients disorders schizophrenia epilepsy alcoholic psychosis depression also found many patients may begin experience depression occurrence phantosmia looked towards committing suicide occurrence depression resulted severe symptoms phantosmia everything even food smelled spoilt rotten burnt age individuals develop olfactory disorder well individuals also coleman grosberg robbins case study patients olfactory hallucinations primary headache disorders long study prevalence rates phantosmia turned low findings observed typical hallucination period minutes occurred either onset head pain typically consisted unpleasant odor also noted phantosmia occurs commonly among women migraine study prophylactic therapy headaches helped cure phantosmia patients finding consistent findings schreiber calvert also mentioned olfactory hallucinations occurrence migraine attack four cause phantosmia either peripheral central combination two peripheral explanation disorder rogue neurons malfunction transmit incorrect signals brain may due malfunction olfactory central explanation active incorrectly functioning cells brain cause perception disturbing odor another central cause perception phantom odor usually follows occurrence seizures time span symptoms usually lasts studies phantosmia patients found perception odor initiates sneeze thus avoid nasal activity also found perception odor worse nostril weaker olfaction ability also noted quarter patients phantosmia one nostril usually develop nostril well time period months several patients received surgical treatment stated feeling intuition phantom odor occur however sensation supported positron emission tomography found patients high level activity contralateral frontal insular temporal regions significance activity regions definitive significant number patients studied conclude relation activity symptoms however intensity activity regions reduced excising olfactory epithelium associated nasal causes phantosmia one common welldocumented involves brain injury seizures temporal lobe temporal lobe seizure patient rarely faints usually blacks remember anything happened seizure several people seizures however recollect phantosmia prior blacking epilepsy disease characterized seizures case phantosmia smelling something else become strongly linked action something else occurring induce activation olfactory bulb even though stimulus bulb present example plasticity gone awry lesions temporal lobe often brought stroke also trauma head also experience olfactory hallucinations leading causes phantosmia include neurological disorders schizophrenia alzheimers disease disorders well documented cases hallucinations commonly visual auditory also however instances phantosmia although frequently cases incidencesspelling olfactory delusions common especially alzheimers exceedingly difficult convince patient fact hallucinations real specifically alzheimers disease atrophy temporal lobe known occur evidenced trauma seizures phantosmia strongly associated area leading appearance alzheimers patients parkinsons disease patients also experience phantosmia well parosmia however appearance less common muscle tremors patients neuroblastoma rare form malignant cancer start olfactory nerve responsible smell sensation cancer become aggressive progress ethmoid sinuses brain cavity surrounds cribriform plate tumor tested performing surgical biopsy possible treatment options include surgical removal tumor radiation therapy chemotherapy cause damage olfactory system possibly result phantosmia complaints phantosmia involving perception unpleasant odors commonly include burnt foul rotten sewage metallic chemical sometimes odor described exhaust fumes odors may triggered strong odorants changes nasal airflow even loud sounds sometimes occur spontaneously patients complaints phantosmia might selfadmit poor quality life meal unpleasant odor well disorders first onset usually spontaneous may last minutes recurrences may gradually increase monthly weekly daily period six months year duration perceived odor may also increase time often lasting day one patients also state odor smell different known odor challenging task examiner determine obtain correct symptoms associate one olfactory disorders several related first step examiner usually takes investigate problem olfactory gustatory related may patient releases certain bodily odors causing examiner able confirm problem olfactory related next step determine olfactory disorder patient following list possible olfactory disorders second step difficult examiner patient patient difficulty describing perception phantom odor furthermore patient position stress anxiety thus crucial examiner patient determining nature disorder confirming phantosmia examiner must patient describe perception phantom odor many cases patients described odor something burning rotten described unpleasant foul third step examiner determine health history patient take note head trauma accidents upper respiratory infections allergic rhinitis chronic although may events resulted phantom odor studies conducted zilstrof found majority phantosmia patients previous history head trauma upper respiratory due rareness disorder welldefined treatment sometimes patients told live disorder patients end performing stereotypical methods might help reducing severity odor might include forced crying bending holding knees holding breath rinsing nose saline water gagging behaviours end fail resolve hallucination various treatments like prophylaxis suggested research needed confirmation also due poorly understood disorder analogies psychiatric conditions patients told mental illness one surgical treatments proposed included olfactory bulb ablation bifrontal craniotomy counterargument leopold loehrl schwob stated ablation process results bilateral permanent anosmia includes risks associated craniotomy according use transnasal endoscopic exhibition olfactory epithelium safe effective treatment patients unremitting phantosmia olfactory function potentially spared also cautioned surgery challenging one associated major risks restricted expertise hand many cases also reported strength symptoms decreased time duncan seidan case involving long term phantosmia treated use anti depressive medication common name venlafaxine effexor relation mood disorders phantosmia unknown widely researched area many cases symptoms phantosmia reduced use anticonvulsants antidepressants act central peripheral neurons commonly used treatment method removal olfactory epithelium bulb means surgery alleviate patient symptoms traditional methods include use topical anesthetics zilstorffpederson use many patients seeking quick form relief achieved rinsing nose saline solution treatment option easily available repeated several times throughout day obtain relief example nasal spray used alleviate symptoms oxymetazoline hcl seems provide relief longer time period relief achieved use nasal sprays seems results blockage nostril allow air enter olfactory another treatment option topical solution cocaine hcl also provides relief short time period acting anesthetic desensitizing nasal neurons topical solution applied nostril topical solution several side effects found patients troposmia started show symptoms phantosmia use patients lost complete function nostril drug antidepressant medication serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor snri case study female phantosmia years dose mg day relieved eliminated symptoms drug prescribed initially order treat phantosmia likely occur women ages years duration first hallucinations likely five twenty minutes also found second hallucination likely occur approximately month later manner first time length hallucinations may begin longitudinal study pregnant women found pregnant women experienced significant changes gustation olfaction perception found caused linked pregnancy study concluded pregnant women reported higher level sensitivity smell olfactory distortion phantosmia distortions minimal towards last stages pregnancy majority present post partum furthermore participants also claimed also experienced increased sensitivity foods bitter decreased sensitivity salt findings suggest pregnant women experience distorted smell taste perception also found women alter diets pregnancy research conducted determine mechanism behind food cravings woman diagnosed mononucleosis age diagnosis began experience headaches right side head phantosmia left nostril would often occur together olfactory hallucination reported woman unpleasant mixture vinegar fecal material rotten eggs would happen every day beginning morning symptoms would worsen days menstrual period symptoms occur morning would triggered strong olfactory stimuli loud noises occasionally could avoid phantosmia symptoms forcing sneezecitation needed woman consulted many medical practitioners could receive reliable diagnosis prescribed medications including nasal steroid sprays drugs would relieve headaches phantosmia symptoms chemosensory evaluation found senses smell taste working normally due phantosmias believed caused blockage causing odor molecules reach olfactory receptors doctors surgically widened olfactory cleft unfortunately phantosmia symptoms remained unsuccessful treatment included longterm disruption axonal projections primary olfactory sensory neurons onto olfactory bulb accomplished intranasal irrigation zinc sulfatecitation needed patient successfully treated surgical procedure involving permanent disruption olfactory epithelium accomplished surgical excision plug olfactory epithelium area cribriform plate excision meant sever fila olfactoria entering central nervous system left nostril five weeks surgery woman reported complete absence phantosmia symptoms olfactory ability maintained hornung et al woman phantosmia occurring fluctuating episodes occurred period years discernible reason onset symptoms could weaken symptoms rinsing nose saline solution going sleep smells would encounter often unpleasant resembling burnt rotten fruity odor family doctor prescribed antidepressant venlafaxine noticed drug resulted complete elimination phantosmia symptoms discovery caused scientists doctors research link phantosmia mild depressive disorders exists idea supported reported improvement phantosmia repeated transcranial stimulation used treat case woman strong olfactory sensations reported ranging odors perfume slightly unpleasant odors wet dog episodes experienced would last seconds hours would occur multiple times per day patient would report phantosmia symptoms would correctly identify known odors would claim symptoms smell loss history epilepsy electroencephalographic results normal later symptoms phantosmia decreasing developed severe symptoms parkinson disease patient treated tremors pramipexole amantadine hydrochloride levodopa carbidopa entacapone phantosmia symptoms disappeared completely case woman first symptoms phantosmia reported appeared woman increased sense smell believed ability detect odors people better accuracy later began experience typical symptoms phantosmia would smell things could recognize absence odor producing molecules reported smells perfumes candles fruits however woman could accurately identify type perfume fruit smelling phantosmia episodes would occur abruptly would last minutes half hour rhinologic examination came back normal results phantosmia symptoms began dissipate began complain clumsiness slowness problems left hand would alternate tremors rigidity neurologic examination
