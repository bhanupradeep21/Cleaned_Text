cell fusion important cellular process several uninucleate cells cells single nucleus combine form multinucleate cell known syncytium cell fusion occurs differentiation myoblasts osteoclasts trophoblasts embryogenesis cell fusion necessary event maturation cells maintain specific functions throughout growth theodore schwann expanded upon theory living organisms composed cells added discrete cells basis life schwann observed certain cells walls cavities cells coalesce together observation provided first hint cells fuse cell biologists deliberately fused cells first time fuse cells biologists combined isolated mouse cells induced fusion outer membrane using sendai virus respiratory virus mice fused hybrid cells contained single nucleus chromosomes fusion partners synkaryon became name type cell combined nucleus late biologists successfully fused cells different types different species hybrid products fusions heterokaryon hybrids maintained two separate nuclei work headed henry harris university oxford nils ringertz swedens karolinska institute two men responsible reviving interest cell fusion hybrid cells interested biologists area different kinds cytoplasm affect different kinds nuclei work conducted henry nils showed proteins one gene fusion affect gene expression partners nucleus vice versa hybrid cells created considered forced exceptions normal cellular integrity possibility cell fusion cells different types may real function homotypic cell fusion occurs cells type example would osteoclasts myofibers fusing together respective type cells two nuclei merge synkaryon produced cell fusion normally occurs nuclear fusion however absence nuclear fusion cell would described binucleated heterokaryon heterokaryon melding two cells one may reproduce several two type cells fuse nuclei fuse resulting cell called heterotypic cell fusion occurs cells different types result fusion also synkaryon produced merging nuclei binucleated heterokaryon absence nuclear fusion example would bone marrow derived cells bmdcs fused parenchymatous four methods cell biologists biophysicists use fuse cells four ways include electrical cell fusion polyethylene glycol cell fusion sendai virus induced cell fusion newly developed method termed optically controlled thermoplasmonics electrical cell fusion essential step innovative methods modern biology method begins two cells brought contact dielectrophoresis dielectrophoresis uses high frequency alternating current unlike electrophoresis direct current applied cells brought together pulsed voltage applied pulse voltage causes cell membrane permeate subsequent combining membranes cells fuse alternative voltage applied brief period time stabilize process result cytoplasm mixed together cell membrane completely fused remains separate nuclei fuse later time within cell making result heterokaryon polyethylene glycol cell fusion simplest toxic way fuse cells type cell fusion polyethylene glycol peg acts dehydrating agent fuses plasma membranes also intracellular membranes leads cell fusion since peg induces cell agglutination celltocell contact though type cell fusion widely used still downfalls oftentimes peg cause uncontrollable fusion multiple cells leading appearance giant polykaryons also standard peg cell fusion poorly reproducible different types cells various fusion susceptibilities type cell fusion widely used production somatic cell hybrids nuclear transfer mammalian sendai virus induced cell fusion occurs four different temperature stages first stage lasts longer minutes viral adsorption takes place adsorbed virus inhibited viral antibodies second stage minutes ph dependent addition viral antiserum still inhibit ultimate fusion third antibodyrefractory stage viral envelope constituents remain detectable surface cells fourth stage cell fusion becomes evident ha neuraminidase fusion factor begin disappear first second stages two ph thermoplasmonics induced cell fusion thermoplasmonics based near infrared nir laser plasmonic nanoparticle laser typically acts optical trap used heat nanoscopic plasmonic particle high extremely locally elevated temperatures optical trapping nanoheater interface two membrane vesicles two cells leads immediate fusion two verified content lipid mixing advantages include full flexibility cells fuse fusion performed buffer condition unlike electroformation affected salt alternative forms restoring organ function replacing damaged cells needed donor organs tissue transplantation scarce scarcity biologists begun considering potential therapeutic cell fusion biologists discussing implications observation cell fusion occur restorative effects following tissue damage cell transplantation though using cell fusion talked worked still many challenges wish implement cell fusion therapeutic tool face challenges include choosing best cells use reparative fusion determining best way introduce chosen cells desired tissue discovering methods increase incidence cell fusion ensuring resulting fusion products function properly challenges overcome cell fusion may therapeutic plants cell fusion happens far less frequently compared eukaryotic cells however occur situations plant cells evolved unique methods fuse cells largely part due cell wall surrounds plant cells cell wall plant cell become altered prior fusion usually becoming thinner even forming bridge cells fuse gamete fusion also occur plants cell fusion become area focus research cancer progression humans multiple types differentiated cells fuse resulting cell could potentially polyploid polyploid cells unstable due different genetic combinations often result cell becoming diseased polyploid cells also result unscheduled endoreplication process dna replicated within cell without cell dividing linked cancer development increase genetic instability within cell metastasis spreading cancer cells different areas body one leading causes
