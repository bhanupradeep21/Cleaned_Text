diabetic foot infection infection foot diabetic frequent cause hospitalization diabetic patients due foot symptoms may include pus wound redness swelling pain warmth tachycardia complications include infection bone tissue death amputation common occur equally frequently males females older people commonly affected often form following diabetic foot ulcer though foot ulcers become infected diabetic foot ulcers caused vascular disease neuropathy prevalence occurs approximately diabetics throughout risk factors developing diabetic foot infections include history repeated foot ulcers foot ulcers lasting longer days poor control blood glucose levels peripheral neuropathy renal impairment peripheral artery disease injury trauma foot walking barefoot frequently history amputation lower diabetic foot infections polymicrobial contain multiple infective organisms bacteria commonly involved include staphylococcus including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa streptococci pseudomonas gramnegative previously mrsa infections usually acquired hospital settings however recently mrsa infections acquired community becoming prevalent linked poor treatment outcomes diabetic risk factors developing mrsa infections include use antibiotics cover broad spectrum pathogens long duration time prolonged hospital stay certain surgical underlying mechanism diabetic foot infections often involves poor blood flow peripheral neuropathy diagnosis based symptoms may supported deep tissue treatment involves proper wound care antibiotics pseudomonas aeruginosa empiric therapy warranted unless patient previous infection culture identifying organism patient risk factors frequent use wet dressings living hot mrsa empiric therapy also warranted unless patient critical infection sepsis rate mrsa infections particularly high local area patient previous mrsa duration antibiotics depends severity infection ranging anywhere weeks treatment mildmoderate infections last weeks typically requires oral antibiotics cover staphylococci severe infections typically require iv antibiotics cover pathogens gram positive organisms gram negative organisms obligate anaerobes allow better treatment total antibiotic treatment severe infections approximately weeks depending extensive infection prevention includes wearing appropriate shoes regular foot examinations control risk factors neuropathy peripheral artery disease trauma contribute individually combination pathophysiology diabetic foot diabetes causes symmetric polyneuropathy may affect motor sensory intrinsic atrophy foot ankle muscles leads anatomic changes foot arch commonly depressing metatarsal heads creating high pressure neuropathy present approximately patients develop foot ulcers also neuropathy lead loss sensation diabetics feet therefore traumainjury foot ulcer present patients take awhile patients notice lead infection developing worsening patient unaware due loss sensation lack combination decreased sensation lower extremities repetitive trauma walking lead poor foot care including lack moisturizing frequent selfexamination feet exacerbate metabolic changes diabetes including hyperglycemia lead increased likelihood hyperlipidemia developing atherosclerosis diabetes atherosclerosis preferentially distributed posterior anterior tibial arteries decreasing perfusion lower may lead loss skin integrity ischemic ulcers gangrene infection may vary depth tissue extends foot infections range superficial cellulitis deeper soft tissue necrotizing fasciitis may necessitate limb amputations become infections may also extend bone termed osteomyelitis infections commonly polymicrobial involve antibioticresistant strains organisms eg mrsa methicillinresistant staphylococcus initial diagnosis diabetic foot infections made primarily via thorough history physical include visual inspection feet evaluation wounds distal pulses neurologic function history taken known recent foot trauma lower extremities inspected signs recent trauma including redness induration edema visible ulceration exudate pus bony ulcers occur absence pathological infection diagnosis infected wound classically made signs inflammation peripheral pulses also evaluated posterior tibial dorsal pedis palpable evaluated using patients nonpalpable pulses evaluation pad anklebrachial index also ulceration deeper wounds probed identify depth penetration determine involvement bone would indicate neurologic testing includes testing peripheral sensation vibratory stimuli temperature pain along deep tendon imaging may also used evaluation plain xray common initial imaging study may show fractures osteomyelitis gas collection gasproducing infective organisms calcification blood vessels foreign magnetic resonance imaging mri useful determine depth soft tissue infection evaluate presence osteomyelitis especially patients respond initial antibiotic finally patency lower extremity vasculature may evaluated magnetic resonance angiography patient experiencing diabetic foot infection first time plain radiograph conducted look bone mri sensitive specific radiograph typically done osteomyelitis suspected diagnosis unclear radiograph abscess suspected soft tissue acute management diabetic foot infections generally includes antibiotic therapy pressure offloading revascularization appropriate debridement infected tissues amputation necessary hospitalization likely needed lower extremity pulses absent infection penetrates level fascia infections skin gangrene may reflect deep space infection abscess tissue necrosis debridement necessary wounds left open serial debridements may performed course wound antibiotic choice guided deep tissue culture severity infection presence absence osteomyelitis prior antibiotic treatment previous current mrsa wounds without confirmed infection treated antibiotics sent cultures necessarily warranted patient mild infection antibiotics starting empiric therapy cultures obtained results come back lab appropriate antibiotic narrower spectrum length treatment depends primarily severity infection skin superficial soft tissue infections may require treatment weeks deeper infections including osteomyelitis may require weeks including undergo one crucial aspect prevention diabetic foot infections educating patients monitor follow healthcare patients regularly checking feet daily able view bottom feet use mirror aid prevention diabetic foot infections include regular foot examinations healthcare professional well maintenance cardiovascular comorbidities risk maintenance includes proper footwear regulating blood glucose hypertension limiting cardiovascular risk factors patients avoid exposing feet hot water harsh chemicals well avoid walking barefoot prevent development diabetic foot patients also educated importance regularly trimming toenails ensuring kept short avoid infection patients diabetes examined least yearly additional risk factors frequently present prior ulcer amputation examinations needed every httpsenwikipediaorgwikidiabeticfootinfection
