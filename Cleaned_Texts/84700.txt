immunology anergy lack reaction bodys defense mechanisms foreign substances consists direct induction peripheral lymphocyte tolerance individual state anergy often indicates immune system unable mount normal immune response specific antigen usually selfantigen lymphocytes said anergic fail respond specific antigen anergy one three processes induce tolerance modifying immune system prevent selfdestruction others clonal deletion phenomenon first described b lymphocytes gustav nossal termed clonal anergy clones b lymphocytes case still found alive circulation ineffective mounting immune responses later ronald schwartz marc jenkins described similar process operating lymphocyte many viruses hiv extreme example seem exploit immune systems use tolerance induction evade immune system though suppression specific antigens done fewer pathogens notably mycobacterium cellular level anergy inability immune cell mount complete response target immune system circulating cells called lymphocytes form primary army defends body pathogenic viruses bacteria parasites two major kinds lymphocytes lymphocyte b lymphocyte among millions lymphocytes human body actually specific particular infectious agent time infection cells must recruited allowed multiply rapidly process called clonal expansion allows body quickly mobilise army clones required immune response anticipatory specificity assured preexisting clones lymphocytes expand response specific antigen process called clonal selection specific clonal army combats pathogen body free infection following clearance infection clones longer needed die away naturally however small number bodys army lymphocytes able react proteins normally present healthy body clonal expansion cells lead autoimmune diseases wherein body attacks

grail protease caspase moreover expression levels also example tnfα ifnγ typical productive response actively decreased anergized anergized cells tend produce antiinflammatory nfat proteins tcell apparently redundant thus antigen properly presented lymphocytes antigen presenting cell apc displays antigen mhc ii complex activates costimulatory receptors lymphocytes undergo productive response however cells interacts antigen presented apcs probably antigen immune response held cell undergoes anergy also shown certain antigens properly presented apcs induce cell activation weakly weak stimuli still activates nfat sufficiently however thereby anergistic response takes place even strong stimulation tcells either tcrcostimulatory receptors break anergy may taken advantage therapeutic uses immune response grafting transplanted organs tissues could minimized without weakening entire immune side effect immunosuppressive drugs like cyclosporine anergy may also used induce activated lymphocytes become unresponsive autoimmune diseases like diabetes mellitus multiple sclerosis rheumatoid likewise preventing anergy response tumoral growth may help antitumor might also used immunotherapeutic treatment dominant recessive tolerance forms peripheral tolerance tolerance beside peripheral central tolerance called recessive tolerance associated anergized lymphocytes described dominant form tolerance specialized treg cells actively ablate immune response developed naive lymphocyte similarly recessive tolerance unopposed nfat signalling also important treg induction case
