situ ɪn ˈsɪtjuː ˈsaɪtjuː ˈsiː often italicized latin phrase translates literally mean locally site premises place describe event takes place used many different contexts example fields physics geology chemistry biology situ may describe way measurement taken place phenomenon occurring without isolating systems altering original conditions test opposite situ ex situ aerospace industry equipment onboard aircraft must tested situ place confirm everything functions properly system individually piece may work interference nearby equipment may create unanticipated problems special test equipment available situ testing also refer repairs made aircraft structure flight controls still place archaeology situ refers artifact moved original place deposition words stationary meaning still artifact situ critical interpretation artifact consequently culture formed artifacts findsite recorded artifact moved conservation interpretation display artifact discovered situ considered context providing accurate picture associated culture however outofcontext artifact provide scientists example types locations situ artifacts yet discovered excavating burial site surface deposit situ refers cataloging recording mapping photographing human remains position label situ indicates object newly moved thus archaeological situ find may object historically looted another place item booty past war traded item otherwise foreign origin consequently situ find site may still reveal provenance detective work may help uncover links otherwise would remain unknown also possible archaeological layers reworked purpose accident humans natural forces animals example tell mound layers typically uniform horizontal land cleared tilled farming term situ often used describe ancient sculpture carved place sphinx petra distinguishes statues carved moved like colossi memnon moved ancient times art situ refers work art made specifically host site work art takes account site installed exhibited detailed account

migrated different orbit referred ex situ biology biomedical engineering situ means examine phenomenon exactly place occurs ie without moving special medium case observations photographs living animals means organism observed photographed wild exactly found exactly found means taken area organism moved another perhaps convenient location aquarium phrase situ used laboratory science cell science mean something intermediate vivo vitro example examining cell within whole organ intact perfusion may situ investigation would vivo donor sacrificed experimentation would working cell alone common scenario vitro experiments instance example biomedical engineering situ involves procedures directly create implant patients tissue within confines operating vitro among first attempts qualitatively quantitatively analyze natural occurrences lab eventually limitation vitro experimentation conducted natural environments compensate problem vivo experimentation allowed testing occur original organism environment bridge dichotomy benefits associated methodologies situ experimentation allowed controlled aspects vitro become coalesced natural environmental compositions vivo experimentation conservation genetic resources situ conservation also onsite conservation process protecting endangered plant animal species natural habitat opposed ex situ conservation also offsite conservation chemistry situ typically means reaction mixture numerous situations chemical intermediates synthesized situ various processes may done species unstable isolated simply convenience examples former include coreychaykovsky reagent adrenochrome biomedical engineering protein nanogels made situ polymerization method provide versatile platform storage release therapeutic proteins tremendous applications cancer treatment vaccination diagnosis regenerative medicine therapies lossoffunction genetic chemical engineering situ often refers industrial plant operations procedures performed place example aged catalysts industrial reactors may regenerated place situ without removed reactors architecture building situ refers construction carried building site using raw materials compare prefabricated construction building components made factory transported building site assembly example concrete slabs may situ also castinplace prefabricated situ techniques often laborintensive take longer materials cheaper work versatile adaptable prefabricated techniques usually much quicker therefore saving money labour costs factorymade parts expensive also inflexible must often designed grid details fully calculated advance finished units may require special handling due excessive dimensions phrase may also refer assets present near project site case used designate state unmodified sample taken given stockpile site construction usually involves grading existing soil surface material cut one area filled another area creating flat pad existing slope term situ distinguishes soil still existing condition soil modified filled construction differences soil properties supporting building loads accepting underground utilities infiltrating water persist indefinitely computer science situ operation one occurs without interrupting normal state systemcitation needed example file backup may restored running system without needing take system perform restore context database restore would allow database system continue available users restore happened situ upgrade would allow operating system firmware application upgraded system still running perhaps without need reboot depending sophistication system another use term insitu appears computer science focuses primarily use technology user interfaces provide continuous access situationally relevant information various locations examples include athletes viewing biometric data smartwatches improve presenter looking tips smart glass reduce speaking rate technicians receiving online stepwise instructions repairing engine algorithm said situ algorithm inplace algorithm extra amount memory required execute algorithm exceed constant matter large input except space recursive calls call stack typically algorithm operates data objects directly place rather making copies example heapsort situ sorting algorithm sorts elements array place quicksort situ sorting algorithm worst case requires linear space call stack reduced log space merge sort generally written situ algorithm designing user interfaces term situ means particular user action performed without going another windowcitation needed example word processor displays image allows image edited without launching separate image editor called situ editing ajax partial page data updates another example situ web uiux context web included ajax concept asynchronous requests servers replace portion web page new data without reloading entire page early html model dictated arguably asynchronous data transfers background task situ normal state normally unaware background tasks usually notified completion callback mechanism big data situ data would mean bringing computation data located rather way like traditional rdbms systems data moved computational also known insitu processing design advertising term typically means superimposing theoretical design elements onto photographs real world locations previsualization tool aid illustrating proof concept physical geography earth sciences situ typically describes natural material processes prior transport example situ used relation distinction weathering erosion difference erosion requires transport medium wind ice water whereas weathering occurs situ geochemical processes also often described occurring material situ atmospheric sciences situ refers obtained direct contact respective subject radiosonde measuring parcel air anemometer measuring wind opposed remote sensing weather radar satellites economics situ used referring place storage product usually natural resource generally refers situation outofpocket cost store product storage cost opportunity cost waiting longer get money product eventually sold examples situ storage would oil gas wells types mineral gem mines stone quarries timber reached age could harvested agricultural products need physical storage facility hay electrochemistry phrase situ refers performing
