microvasculature damage lungs second neurological damage body already experiencing hypoxic conditions lead lung tissue damage second leading cause pulmonary signs dyspnea hypoxia without diffuse interstitial alveolar infiltrates imaging studies neurological signs visual changes headaches dizziness tinnitus gait instability confusion somnolence coma common symptom patient usually febrile often linked inflammation possible infection less common signs include myocardial ischemia right ventricular overload increased acute kidney injury priapism acute limb ischemia bowel infarction hyperleukocytosis common acutely ill patients occurs response wide variety conditions including viral bacterial fungal parasitic infection cancer hemorrhage exposure certain medications lung diseases pneumonia tuberculosis white blood cell count crucial diagnosis disease leukocytosis usually present specific medications including corticosteroids lithium betaagonists cause mechanism hyperleukocytosis leukostasis manifests disrupts homeostasis greatly associated leukemias multiple factors may cause leukocytosis major types leukocytosis mechanisms depend types leukemia cause white blood cell levels either rise distinct white blood levels unison others patient may neutrophilia lymphocytosis monocytosis eosinophilia basophilia rise immature blast acute myeloid leukemia percent patients newly diagnosed type leukemia hyperleukocytosis acute lymphoblastic leukemia percent patients newly diagnosed type leukemia hyperleukocytosis chronic lymphocytic leukemia exact percentage people diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia unknown significant number also hyperleukocytosis chronic myeloid leukemia majority patients chronic myeloid leukemia usually hyperleukocytosis primary pathophysiology leukostasis completely understood two possible theories increased blood viscosity due large leukemic blast populations less deformable mature leukocytes may lead leukostasis accumulation less malleable blast products bloodstream accumulate within microcirculation causing accumulation blockages leading leukostasiscitation needed hypoxic events body regions may increase high metabolic activity dividing blast cells lead increase cytokine production increasing levels cytokines within tissues may result endothelial damage subsequent hemorrhage therefore hypoxia addition various cytokine accumulations act unison damage tissue attract leukemic blast cells form triad damagecitation needed combination theories addition events may lead hyperleukocytosis white blood counts exceeding x l microl present symptoms tissue hypoxia may signal possible neurological respiratory distress ongoing research shown patients experienced hypoxia leukocyte levels x l microl therefore patients leukemia need regular neurological respiratory monitoring leukocyte counts approaching x l microl decrease chances tissue hypoxia acquired biopsies examined damage microvasculature serves evidence hypoxia identification leukocyte blockage within tissue due biopsys invasive nature risks associated procedure used deemed measurements arterial shown falsely decreased patients hyperleukocytosis white blood cells ability utilize oxygen pulse oximetry used accurately assess levels patient suspected leukocytosis automated blood cell counters may inaccurate due fragments blast cells labeled blood smears platelets accurate form confirming platelet counts using manual platelet count review peripheral smear serum potassium levels may also artificially elevated release leukemic blasts vitro clotting process therefore serum potassium levels monitored heparinized addition heparin prevents coagulation plasma samples order obtain accurate results potassium levels disseminated intravascular coagulation may occur significant number patients presentation various degrees thrombin generation followed decreased fibrinogen increased fibrinolysiscitation needed spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome present approximately percent patients leukostasis lab tests used measure potential elevated serum concentrations uric acid potassium phosphate hypocalcemia disseminated intravascular coagulation spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome develop chemotherapy treatment patients undergoing type therapy need closely monitored addition undergoing prophylactic measures prevent possible complications since leukostasis hyperleukostasis associated leukemia preventive treatments taken upon patients hyperleukocytosis associated leukemia always considered candidates tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis addition aggressive intravenous hydration allopurinol rasburicase decrease serum uric acid levels treatment includes utilization prophylactic methods patient diagnosed hyperleukocytosis usually combination treatments dependent type leukemia specific treatments include lysis syndrome treatment addition aggressive intravenous hydration allopurinol rasburicase decrease serum uric acid hematopoietic cell transplants critical correct leukostasis leukemia cytoreduction also critical course treatment order rapidly decrease white blood cell counts twenty forty percent patients diagnosed hyperleukocytosis die within first week symptom presentation patients best outcome none limited symptoms respiratory neurological distress accumulation symptoms lead decreased levels statistical survival compared patients diagnosed asymptomatic hyperleukocytosis alone cytoreduction methods include chemotherapy utilizing drug hydroxyurea hydroxyurea usually used asymptomatic hyperleukocytosis less common leukapheresis procedure procedure often utilized asymptomatic hyperleukocytosis patients induction chemotherapy postponed patientspecific factorscitation needed variants chemotherapy including induction chemotherapy used treat elevated white blood cells counts simultaneously targeting leukemia cells bone marrowcitation needed prognosis patients hyperleukocytosis dependent cause type leukemia patient patients diagnosed asymptomatic hyperleukocytosis significantly better survival rates symptomatic hyperleukocytosis leukostasis preventative measures contentious monitoring patients diagnosed leukemia critical receiving treatment early possible prevent treat hyperleukocytosiscitation needed recent continuing research shown patients hypoxia leukocyte levels x l microl therefore patients leukemia need regular neurological respiratory monitoring leukocyte counts approaching x l microl decrease chances leukemia population types also believed associated possible symptoms may require change results tumor lysis consumption coagulopathy patients acute leukemia much often patients chronic malignant hematological leukostasis also known symptomatic hyperleukocytosis lifethreatening complication various leukemias characterized excess white blood cells bloodstream hyperleukocytosis arbitrarily defined greater white blood cells per microliter blood condition characterized abnormal aggregation clumping white blood cells blood vessels resulting impaired blood flow delivery oxygen bodys cells brain lungs two commonly affected leukostasis commonly occurs acute myeloid leukemia hyperleukocytosisleukostasis occurs commonly lower white blood cell wbc counts acute myeloid leukemia acute lymphocytic leukemia cells acute myeloid leukemia larger
