evolutionary biology thomas cavaliersmith died march following development cancer cavaliersmith prolific taxonomist drawing nearunparalleled wealth information suggest novel relationships suggestions translated taxonomic concepts classifications associated new names cases reused old names cavaliersmith follow espouse explicit taxonomic philosophy approach closest evolutionary taxonomy several colleagues opposed cladistic approaches taxonomy arguing goals cladification classification approach similar many others broadbased treatments scope cavaliersmiths taxonomic propositions grand numbers composition components taxa often relations stable propositions often ambiguous shortlived frequently amended taxa without change name approach universally accepted others attempted underpin taxonomy protists nested series atomised falsifiable propositions following philosophy transformed however approach longer considered cavaliersmiths ideas led taxonomic structures usually first presented form tables complex annotated diagrams presented scientific meetings sometimes rich often written small ideas easily grasped diagrams made way publications careful scrutiny possible conjectural nature assertions evident richness ideas continuing evolution transition taxonomies gave cavaliersmiths investigations evolutionary paths phylogeny resulting classifications distinctive character cavaliersmith courageous adherence earlier traditionalist style characterized charles darwin relying narratives one example advocacy chromista united lineages plastids chlorophylls c primarily chrysophytes stramenopiles cryptophytes haptophytes despite clear evidence group corresponded clade cavaliersmiths claim single endosymbiotic event chlorophyll c containing plastids acquired common ancestor three groups differences cytological components arrangements among groups result subsequent evolutionary changes interpretation chromists monophyletic also required heterotrophic protozoan members three groups arisen ancestors plastids alternative hypothesis three chromophytic lineages closely related exclusion lineages ie polyphyletic likely ancestrally without plastids separate symbiotic events established chlorophyll ac plastids stramenopiles cryptomonads haptophytes polyphyly chromists reasserted subsequent cavaliersmiths lack objective reproducible methodology would translate evolutionary insights taxa hierarchical schemes often confusing follow publications closely many taxa requiring frequent adjustment illustrated turn led confusion scope taxa taxonomic name applied cavaliersmith also reused familiar names protozoa innovative taxonomic concepts created confusion protozoa still used old alongside use newer senses cavaliersmiths tendency publish rapidly change narratives taxonomic summaries frequently approach claims frequently debated palaeoscom described writing style follows prof cavaliersmith oxford university produced large body work well regarded still controversial way bit difficult describe issue may one writing style cavaliersmith tendency make pronouncements others would use declarative sentences use declarative sentences others would express opinion express opinions angels would fear tread addition sound arrogant reactionary even perverse hand long history right everyone else wrong way thinking overshadowed one incomparable virtue fact grapple details makes long complex papers causes manner dark murmuring tearing hair gnashing teeth among tasked trying explain views early life see example zrzavý patterson nevertheless deals relevant cavaliersmith wrote extensively taxonomy classification life forms especially protists one major contributions biology proposal new kingdom life chromista even though widely accepted monophyletic see also introduced new taxonomic groupings group eukaryotes chromalveolata opisthokonta rhizaria excavata though well known many claims controversial gained widespread acceptance scientific community taxonomic revisions often influenced overall classification life forms cavaliersmiths first major classification system division organisms eight kingdoms proposed completely revising robert whittakers five kingdom system could eight kingdoms bacteria eufungi ciliofungi animalia biliphyta viridiplantae cryptophyta revised system particularly light growing evidence archaebacteria separate group include array lineages excluded treatment deal issues polyphyly promote new ideas relationships addition protists lacking mitochondria mitochondria known result endosymbiosis proteobacterium thought amitochondriate eukaryotes primitively marking important step eukaryogenesis result amitochondriate protists given special status protozan subkingdom archezoa later elevated kingdom later referred archezoa eight kingdoms became eubacteria archaebacteria archezoa protozoa chromista plantae fungi kingdom archezoa went many compositional changes due evidence polyphyly paraphyly assigned former members kingdom archezoa phylum cavaliersmith reduced total number kingdoms eight six animalia protozoa fungi plantae including glaucophyte red green algae chromista nevertheless already presented simplified scheme first time endorsed five cavaliersmiths kingdoms classified eukaryotes shown following scheme kingdom animalia divided four subkingdoms radiata phyla porifera cnidaria placozoa ctenophora myxozoa mesozoa bilateria animal phyla created three new animal phyla acanthognatha rotifers acanthocephalans gastrotrichs gnathostomulids brachiozoa brachiopods phoronids lobopoda onychophorans tardigrades recognised total animal cavaliersmiths classification cavaliersmith collaborators revised classification published plos one scheme reintroduced division prokaryotes two kingdoms bacteria previously eubacteria archaea previously archebacteria based consensus taxonomic outline bacteria archaea toba catalogue cavaliersmith proposed
