yangtze yellow river basins china records specimens three metres ten feet possibly ft length one largest species freshwater fish species genus psephurus one two recent species paddlefish polyodontidae american paddlefish polyodon spathula anadromous species meaning spent part adult life sea migrating upriver spawn chinese paddlefish officially declared extinct estimated time extinction later although become functionally extinct main cause extinction construction gezhouba three gorges dams causing population fragmentation blocking anadromous spawning migration overfishing also played significant role demise fishing chinese paddlefish dates back centuries annual harvests reaching tons since species officially listed international union conservation nature iucn critically endangered last seen alive paper including scientists yangtze river fisheries research institute found species unanimously agreed extinct species survival commission sturgeon specialist group iucn september

forwards order seize paddlefish like acipenseriformes several groups vertebrates engage passive electroreception sensing external electric fields using structures called ampullae form extension lateral line system sensory organs passive electroreception electric fields sensed generated electric fish primarily used detecting weak electric fields generated head rostrum chinese paddlefish like

significant throughout primary range yangtze basin annual captures tonnes continued chinese government made fishing species illegal due decline species still found small numbers example caught young seen recently due rarity fish time realised peril fact adult fish difficult keep captivity attempts create captive breeding stock since two confirmed sightings fish alive yangtze basin first ft lb

conducted yangtze basin research team chinese academy fisheries science jingzhou failed catch two possible specimens recorded hydroacoustic comprehensive study published including scientists yangtze river fisheries research institute found species certainly extinct based absence extensive capture surveys yangtze paper estimated species went extinct became functionally extinct primary cause extinction overfishing construction dams along yangtze paddlefish heavily overfished stages growth fry easily captured traditional fishing methods adult combined long generation time due slow maturation led reduced sustainability viable populations dam construction notably gezhouba dam became operational three gorges dam landlocked divided populations prevented spawning paper thus recommended reclassification species extinct similar recommendation also made species survival commission sturgeon specialist group iucn september official iucn status species formally updated extinct
