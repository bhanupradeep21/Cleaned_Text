biophilic design concept used within building industry increase occupant connectivity natural environment use direct nature indirect nature space place conditions used building cityscale argued idea health environmental economic benefits building occupants urban environments drawbacks although name coined recent history indicators biophilic design seen architecture far back hanging gardens babylon word biophilia first introduced psychoanalyst named erich fromm stated biophilia passionate love life person plant idea social group book anatomy human destructiveness fromms approach psychoanalyst person studies unconscious mind presented broad spectrum called biophilia biologically normal instinct term used since many scientists philosophers overall adapted several different areas study notable mentions biophilia include edward wilsons book biophilia took biologists approach first coined biophilia hypothesis popularized notion wilson defined biophilia innate tendency focus life lifelike processes claiming link nature physiological fromm suggested genetic basis biophilia hypothesis idea humans inherited need connect nature biotic forms due evolutionary dependence survival personal idea relevant daily life humans travel spend money sightsee national parks nature preserves relax beaches hike mountains explore jungles many sports revolve around nature skiing mountain biking surfing home perspective people likely spend houses views nature buyers willing spend homes excellent landscaping properties look water humans also value companionship animals america million people dogs million biophilia refers inherent need experience love nature biophobia humans inherited fear nature animals case modern life humans urge separate nature move towards technology cultural drive people tend associate human artifacts interests managed anxieties natural environment inherited threats seen anthropocentric evolution includes fear snakes spiders relation buildings biophobia induced use bright colors heights enclosed spaces darkness large open spaces major contributors occupant considered one pioneers biophilic design stephen kellert created framework nature built environment used way satisfies human needs principles meant celebrate show respect nature provide enriching urban environment multisensory dimensions attributes define kellerts biophilic framework direct experience refers tangible contact natural features indirect experience refers contact images representations nature experience space place uses spatial relationships enhance wellbeing experiences meant considered individually using biophilia projects one right answer one building type buildings architects project owners must collaborate include biophilic principles believe fit within scope effectively reach occupants timothy beatley believes key objective biophilic cities create environment residents want actively participate preserve connect natural landscape surrounds established ways achieve framework infrastructure governance knowledge behavior dimensions also indicators existing biophilic attributes already exist current cities biophilic design argued wealth benefits building occupants urban environments improving connections nature cities many believe biggest proponent concept ability make city resilient environmental stressor may face catherine ryan et al found elements nature sounds improved mental health faster traditional urban noise stressor exposure study found surgery patients exposed aromatherapy used less morphine used fewer painkillers another study kaitlyn gillis birgitta gatersleben found inclusion plants interior environments reduce stress increase pain tolerance use water elements incorporating views nature also mentally restorative researching effects biophilia hospital patients peter newman jana soderlund found increasing vista quality hospital rooms depression pain patients reduced turn shortened hospital stays days biophilic cities andrew dannenberg et al indicated higher levels social connectivity better capability handle life crises resulted lower crime rate levels violence study found implementing outdoor facilities impromptu gymnasiums like green gym united kingdom allow people help clear overgrown vegetation build walking paths plant foliage readily exercise walking running climbing etc proven build social capital increase physical activity better mental health quality dannenberg et al also found children growing green neighborhoods seen lower levels asthma decreased mortality rates health disparities wealthy poor also observed greener highly prevalent nature fractal patterns biophilic patterns possess selfsimilar components repeat varying size scales perceptual experience humanmade environments impacted inclusion natural patterns previous work demonstrated consistent trends preference complexity estimates fractal patterns however limited information gathered impact

experiences utilized promote occupant wellbeing designs composite fractal patterns consisting individual fractal treeseeds combine create global fractal forest local treeseed patterns global configuration treeseed locations overall resulting globalforest patterns fractal qualities designs span multiple mediums yet intended lower occupant stress without detracting function overall design space series studies first establish divergent relationships various visual attributes pattern complexity preference engagement ratings increasing fractal complexity compared ratings refreshment relaxation stay decrease complexity subsequently determine local constituent fractal treeseed patterns contribute perception overall fractal design address balance aesthetic psychological effects individual experiences perceived engagement relaxation fractal design installations set studies demonstrates fractal preference driven balance increased arousal desire engagement complexity decreased tension desire relaxation refreshment installations composite midhigh complexity globalforest patterns consisting treeseed components balance contrasting needs serve practical implementation biophilic patterns humanmade environments promote occupant argue adding physical natural elements plants trees rain gardens green roofs built environment buildings cities manage stormwater runoff better fewer impervious surfaces better infiltration maintain natural systems costeffective way excess greywater reused water plants greenery vegetative walls roofs also decrease polluted water plants act adding greenery also reduces carbon emissions heat island effect increases biodiversity carbon reduced carbon sequestration plants roots photosynthesis green high albedo rooftops facades shading streets structures using vegetation reduce amount heat absorption normally found asphalt dark surfaces reduce heating cooling needs reduce temperature fluctuations adding green facades increase biodiversity area native species planted khoo teck puat hospital singapore seen resurgence species butterflies onsite thanks use vegetation throughout exterior biophilia may slightly higher costs due addition natural elements require maintenance higherpriced organic items etc however perceived health environmental benefits believed negate peter newman found adding biophilic design landscapes cities like new york city see savings nearing million due increased worker productivity billion reduced crime also found storefronts heavily vegetated streets increased foot traffic attracted consumers likely spend study showed increasing daylighting skylights store increase sales properties biophilic design also benefit higher selling prices many selling conventional urban scale timothy beatley believes biophilic design allow cities better adapt stresses occur changes climate thus local environments better show created biophilic cities framework pathways taken increase resilience sustainability cities includes three sections biophilic urbanism physical biophilic green measures taken increase resilience city adaptive capacity communitys behaviors adapt result physical changes resilient outcomes happen steps achieved biophilic urbanism section one ways city increase resilience pursuing biophysical pathway safeguarding promoting inclusion natural systems natural protective barrier city example new orleans city built natural wet plains exposed flooding estimated kept bayous intact city could save billion yearly storm adaptive capacity section beatley states commitment place home pathway creates stimulating interesting nature environments residents create stronger bonds home increase likelihood citizens take care goes saying times shock stress people likely rebuild support community instead may also increase governmental action protect city future disasters achieving biophilic urbanism adaptive capacity beatley believes one biggest resilient outcomes framework increased adaptability residents steps leading resilience encourage people outside walking participating activities citizens become healthier physically fit found take walks nature experience decreased depression anger increased vigor versus walk interior given increased information supporting benefits biophilic design organizations beginning incorporate concept standards rating systems encourage building professionals use biophilia projects prominent supporters biophilic design well building standard living building challenge international well building institute uses biophilic design well
