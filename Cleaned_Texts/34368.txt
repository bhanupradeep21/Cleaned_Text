fertility preservation effort help cancer patients retain fertility ability procreate research cancer ageing health conditions effect reproductive health preservation options growing specifically sparked part increase survival rate cancer fertility preservation procedures indicated predicted exposure cause infertility mainly cancer treatment also ageing sex reassignment surgery identify trans conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome pcos primary ovarian insufficiency poi chemotherapy radiation treatments cancer autoimmunity conditions like multiple ability affect reproductive health regimens threaten ovarian testicular function mainly radiation therapy pelvic area types chemotherapy chemotherapies high risk include procarbazine alkylating drugs cyclophosphamide ifosfamide busulfan melphalan chlorambucil drugs medium risk include doxorubicin platinum analogs cisplatin hand therapies low risk gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives vincristine vinblastine antibiotics bleomycin dactinomycin antimetabolites methotrexate mercaptopurine regimens attack rapidly dividing cells body including healthy cells like sperm belonging ovarian follicle egg depending dose duration administration therapies varying effects reproductive surgery involving reproductive tissue affects reproductive function fertility patients receiving chemotherapy radiotherapy decrease loss reproductive function temporary many men females however regain fertility treatment extent damage ovaries resulting diminished fertility associated chemotherapeutic regiment combination chemotherapy radiotherapy chemoradiation despite allowing effective treatment reducing risk cancer returning adjuvant extensive associations fertility damage receiving either treatment sometimes patients experience symptoms resembling menopause females andropause men indicate reproductive damage females premature menopause menopause premenopausal women state permanent reversible dependent many study indicated fewer oocytes recovered cancer patients wanting perform embryo preservation compared agematched control group mean number zygotes generated appears study found patients referred program declined undergo embryo oocyte tissue cryopreservation found eligible medical reasons remaining patients chose cryopreserve embryos chose cryopreserve oocytes chose undergo ovarian tissue serious clinical sequelae resulted prior females undergoing treatments testing level antim√ºllerian hormone amh useful predicting longterm postchemotherapy loss ovarian function turn predicting need fertility preservation strategies increasing age females directly associated decreasing reproductive potential result many factors amount eggs available overall reproductive fertility preservation ovarian tissue oocyte cryopreservation may also used prevent infertility well birth defects associated advanced maternal age males also decreasing fertility age however associated problem sperm quality opposed overall sperm count changes attributed reduction testosterone males experience polycystic ovarian syndrome prevalent endocrine disorder females experience prime reproductive age pcos direct relationship many health risks development type diabetes increasing insulin levels obesity increased waist size females pcos usually experience anovulation regularly release egg link infertility pcos well females may therefore seek fertility treatment like ovulation primary ovarian insufficiency defined ovarian function stopped prematurely age also known premature ovarian failure premature menopause ovarian deficiency causes reduction serum oestrogen levels lead infertility giving reason females seek fertility treatment poi result long term risk serious physical symptoms including bone fragility heart problems also linked psychological distress specifically regards fertility loss long term consequences main methods fertility preservation ovarian protection gnrh agonists cryopreservation ovarian tissue eggs sperm embryos vitro patient may also choose use egg sperm donor third party reproduction rather biological children men hoping preserve fertility undergoing treatment cancer another fertilitythreatening disease cryopreserve freeze sperm obtained masturbation postpubescent boys men established fertility preservation method males prepubescent boys sperm obtained testicular aspiration electrostimulation stored future use researchers also looking methods cryopreserving testicular tissue samples reimplanted body treatment oocyte cryopreservation involves extraction freezing females eggs preserve viability future use often due medical reasons females undergoing cancer treatment also increasingly used elective fertility preservation females ready become pregnant conscious agerelated decline process different embryo cryopreservation mature eggs fertilised vitro outside body sperm donor partner embryo frozen religious ethical concerns legislative restrictions surrounding embryo cryopreservation prompted significant technical advances oocyte cryopreservation techniques oocyte cryopreservation considered wellestablished technique fertility preservation female patients choose mature eggs extracted fertilized outside body sperm partner donor resulting embryo frozen females remission disease females ready initiate pregnancy embryo thawed implanted uterus maturation birth option common fertility preservation method females available prepubescent girls mature eggs fertilized females partner need use donor sperm additionally procedure requires twoweek period hormonal stimulation encourage egg maturation optimal female patients diagnosed hormonesensitive cancers breast cancer ovarian cancer etc delay cancer treatment alternative methods hormonal stimulation using letrozole tamoxifen may used females hormonesensitive cancers cryopreservation human ovarian tissue successfully carried around world preserve fertility female cancer patients pathologies patient increased risk primary ovarian insufficiency notably technique provide option fertility preservation prepubertal girls part ovary removed frozen stored treatment tissue thawed according metaanalysis performed success rate reestablishment ovarian activity restoring normal fertility endocrine function live births reported june strips cortical ovarian tissue also cryopreserved must reimplanted body allow encapsulated immature follicles complete maturation furthermore ovarian tissue fragile hard freezing conditions putting back body carries risk reintroducing cancerous cells vitro maturation achieved experimentally technique yet clinically technique cryopreserved ovarian tissue could possibly used make oocytes directly undergo vitro many patients diagnosed malignancy another disease requiring treatment may impair fertility consider alternatives bearing biological children assisted reproductive technology art using vitro fertilization ivf donor eggs donor sperm resulting embryo implanted femaless uterus endometrium lining uterus stimulated hormones prepare development embryo females requiring local pelvic radiation therapy may benefit surgical transposition ovaries site remote maximal radiation use gnrh agonists ovarian protection chemotherapy suggested benefit ability ovulate benefits terms eg pregnancy rate table main options fertility preservation compared general population people cancer higher risk arterial thrombotic events stroke myocardial infarction peripheral arterial embolism risk potential increased females undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation fertility preservation usually associated cases ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ohss hand venous thromboembolism rarely occurs unless pregnancy achieved therefore usually particularly relevant stage oocyte therefore recommended controlled ovarian hyperstimulation protocol females cancer antagonist protocol using gnrh agonist final maturation induction order decrease risk used conjunction oocyte embryo cryopreservation using gnrh agonist rather hcg final maturation induction evidence difference live birth rate contrast fresh cycles usage gnrh agonist lower live birth anticoagulant prophylaxis recommended administered selected subgroups females risk factors hypercoagulability develop early transgender men given opportunity counselling
