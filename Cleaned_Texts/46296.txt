ultrastenos extinct genus australian mekosuchine crocodilian first described type species ultrastenos willisi discovered riversleigh northwestern queensland australia lived late oligocene era following discovery speculated ultrastenos slendersnouted animal similar modern gharials freshwater crocodiles may inhabited forest pools fed small vertebrates like frogs lizards based peculiar shape mandible wide towards base head constricts rapidly leading narrow gracile rostrum assuming holotype skull belonged adult individual ultrastenos may rather small animal approximately size modern freshwater crocodile however ultrastenos known fragmentary remains thus among enigmatic mekosuchines study multiple authors argue fragmentary nature animal means studies required truly test hypothesis proposed original description especially following discovery thought close relative ultrastenos described based holotype specimen qm posterior cranium mandible found low lion site riversleigh world heritage area riversleigh known home variety mekosuchine genera discovery ultrastenos represented previously unknown morphology native oligocene miocene crocodilian fauna specifically ultrastenos first known riversleigh crocodilian display may highly elongated jaws similar modern gharials addition holotype material multiple fossil remains assigned paratypes remains cover various elements postcranial skeleton including multiple vertebrae neck tail osteoderms coracoid limb bones addition low lion material stein et al also suggests material previously collected described willis white hunter site could also belonged however contradicted adam yates assigns white hunter cranium baru many interpretations made type description later questioned study mekosuchines also involving stein makes mention reevaluation material preparation related form name derives latin ultra extreme greek stenos narrow chosen reflect morphology animals mandible species epithet honors dr paul willis prolific paleontologist especially involved mekosuchine research participated description dozen mekosuchine ultrastenos unique among mekosuchines thanks shallow lower jaw constricted snout wide back narrowed rapidly towards base rostrum back skull known certain snout ultrastenos really looked like one possibility snout relatively short stopping far beyond point preservation may indicate altirostral snout form akin mekosuchus modern dwarf caimans dwarf crocodiles however altirostral forms mandible generally displays deep mandibles clashes anatomy ultrastenos instead thought much likely two halves mandible fused form mandibular symphysis far beyond known likely continuing onward form longirostrine snout snout form seen variety modern crocodilians including gharials false gharial slender snouted crocodiles freshwater crocodiles shared traits animals ultrastenos include uniform dentition shallow mandible retroarticular process elongated gavialoids similar freshwater crocodiles however study authored multiple prolific mekosuchine researchers including stein argued fragmentary nature material means interpretations still top skull table known white hunter material referred cranial form willis uncertain affinities although stein et al refer ultrastenos base diagnosis partially adam yates would later argue fossil actually belonged baru whatever case white hunter cranium displays prominent teardropshaped supratemporal fenestra unlike mekosuchines fenestrae wider postorbital bone longer squamosal two bones forming outer margins opening overall skull table covered densely packed regular pits compose ornamentation back end element supraoccipital exposed thus visibly top view white hunter material seems suggest eyesockets directed laterally meaning eyes possibly faced towards sides upwards like typical semiaquatic crocodilians would similar mekosuchines like trilophosuchus mekosuchus quadrate quadratojugal curved inward medioventrally especially towards front contact jugal similarly constricted furthermore jugal whole gracile short jugal forms base postorbital bar bears foramen region occiput back head confidently assigned ultrastenos wide yet shallow forming concave surface runs perpendicular quadrates squamosals well expressed back head posterolateral processes weakly developed extending far back crocodilians something similar observed paroccipital process part exoccipital likewise poorly developed rounded still clearly set apart quadrate squamosal basioccipital forms base occiput tall element thats significantly wider top narrows towards bottom prominent keel running vertical surface foramen magnum spinal chord passes appears inverted triangle occipital condyle articulates first neck pterygoids large elements form part palate ultrastenos corners pterygoids extend beyond back choanae surrounded ridges towards front observed palatal fenestrae wide turn means palatines striking feature ultrastenos mandible incredibly gracile looked atop constricts rapidly creating pronounced curvature bone back lower jaw bulges outwards becomes slightly concave towards front following constriction looking lower jaw profile view also highlights shallow dentary tall angular surangular bone extend weakly dentary following region three bones come contact dentary grows slightly shallower towards front given lack material uncertain would continued thing really breaking low profile articular process connective element cranium lower jaw rather tall angular surangular become convex back lower jaw forming articular region elongated retroarticular process notably longer mekosuchine angular surangular display prominent ridges along lower upper ends respectively lower ridge developed forming buttress effectively enclosing ornamented outer surface lower jaw like skull table ornamentation mandible composed closely spaced pits although region much irregular external mandibular fenestra located meeting point three major lower jaw bones appears highly reduced given last four tooth socketss two teeth preserved little known dentition ultrastenos clear tooth row constricted like lower jaw whole rather narrow based anatomy sockets last four teeth appear similar size known teeth suggest low slightly compressed sidetoside cutting edges variety isolated bones postcranial skeleton ultrastenos known including

head elongated forming acute triangle glenoid facet coracoids contribution shoulder joint weakly displaced towards back element difference tibia ultrastenos modern crocodiles mekosuchine flattened front back shaft becomes square moves away skull ultrastenos approximately cm wide quadrates currently unknown material represents juvenile adult individual assuming latter would indicate ultrastenos relatively smallbodied animal similar size extant freshwater crocodile yet still larger known mekosuchine dwarf forms trilophosuchus stein et al recovered ultrastenos mekosuchine crocodilian sister taxa trilophosuchus rackhami shares vertical exoccipital based prior phylogenetic analysis would suggest placement within mekosuchini however stein et als analysis mekosuchini previously defined lost cohesion recovered results trilophosuchus recovered basal kambara platyrostral species eocene although ultrastenos fragmentary issues phylogeny caused instead result uncertain placement harpacochampsa according may another study discussing phylogenetic position ultrastenos rio mannion published study argued many previously established mekosuchines mekosuchines instead belonged different groups

mekosuchinae markedly different results stein et al rio similar results recovered ristevski et al although discussing ultrastenos include phylogeny ristevski colleagues make specific mention uncertain nature ultrastenos fact requires significant revisions mentioning material close relative narrow mandible possibly longirostrine nature ultrastenos suggests inhabited niche previously known riversleigh typically narrow elongated jaws crocodylomorphs associated diet heavily featuring fish examplified modern gharial however fish fossils commonly found oligocene riversleigh sites less common frogs snakes lizards subsequently stein et al suggest rather piscivore ultrastenos may fed small reptiles amphibians regardless prey preference shallow mandibles ultrastenos may served function modern longirostrine crocodilians streamline movement rostrum surrounding water uniform teeth would suited catch hold crush small prey furthermore inferred based gracile jaws ultrastenos incapable tackling large prey done late oligocene low lion site predominantly covered open forests presence longirostrine crocodilian would suggest presence bodies water stein et al argue evidence extensive riversystems wetlands region instead ultrastenos may home forest lakes ponds drained underlying karstic limestone may find support type environments nowadays inhabited freshwater crocodiles may persist bodies water temporary available year round following interpretation cranium described willis also belonged ultrastenos suggested stein et al genus would also inhabited white hunter site well known diverse crocodile fauna white hunter cranium truly belonged ultrastenos may lived alongside terrestrial mekosuchus whitehunterensis quinkana meboldi small bodied semiaquatic baru huberi much
