perfusion vivo sampling method commonly used measuring neurotransmitters brain developed jh gaddum technique replaced cortical cup technique observing neurotransmitters advent concentric microdialysis probes resulted pushpull sampling falling favor probes require less monitoring less invasive higher flow rate pushpull probes microlitermin could result lesions flow advent microfluidics miniaturized probes lowflow sampling developed using flow rates nlmin technique minimizes tissue damage providing finer spatial resolution microdialysis sampling
