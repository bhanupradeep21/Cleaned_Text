speech human vocal communication using language language uses phonetic combinations vowel consonant sounds form sound words english words sound different french words even word eg role hotel using words semantic character words lexicon language according syntactic constraints govern lexical words function sentence speaking speakers perform many different intentional speech acts eg informing declaring asking persuading directing use enunciation intonation degrees loudness tempo nonrepresentational paralinguistic aspects vocalization convey meaning speech speakers also unintentionally communicate many aspects social position sex age place origin accent physical states alertness sleepiness vigor weakness health illness psychological states emotions moods physicopsychological states sobriety drunkenness normal consciousness trance states education experience like although people ordinarily use speech dealing persons animals people swear always mean communicate anything anyone sometimes expressing urgent emotions desires use speech quasimagical cause encourage player game warn something also many situations people engage solitary speech people talk sometimes acts development psychologists eg lev vygotsky maintained use silent speech interior monologue vivify organize cognition sometimes momentary adoption dual persona self addressing self though addressing another person solo speech used memorize test ones memorization things prayer meditation eg use mantra researchers study many different aspects speech speech production speech perception sounds used language speech repetition speech errors ability map heard spoken words onto vocalizations needed recreate plays key role childrens enlargement vocabulary different areas human brain brocas area

may differ vocabulary syntax phonetics spoken language situation called diglossia evolutionary origins speech unknown subject much debate speculation animals also communicate using vocalizations trained apes washoe kanzi use simple sign language animals vocalizations articulated phonemically syntactically constitute speech although related general problem origin language evolution distinctively human speech capacities become distinct many ways separate area scientific topic separate one language necessarily spoken equally written signed speech sense optional although default modality language monkeys nonhuman apes humans like many animals evolved specialised mechanisms producing sound purposes social hand monkey ape uses tongue human species unprecedented use tongue lips moveable parts seems place speech quite separate category making evolutionary emergence intriguing theoretical challenge eyes many determining timeline human speech evolution made additionally challenging lack data fossil record human vocal tract fossilize indirect evidence vocal tract changes hominid fossils proven speech production unconscious multistep process thoughts generated spoken utterances production involves unconscious mind selecting appropriate words appropriate form words lexicon morphology organization words syntax phonetic properties words retrieved sentence articulated articulations associated phonetic linguistics articulatory phonetics study tongue lips jaw vocal cords speech organs used make sounds speech sounds categorized manner articulation place articulation place articulation refers neck mouth airstream constricted manner articulation refers manner speech organs interact closely air restricted form airstream used eg pulmonic implosive ejectives clicks whether vocal cords vibrating whether nasal cavity opened concept primarily used production consonants used vowels qualities voicing nasalization place articulation may several manners articulation therefore several homorganic consonants normal human speech pulmonic produced pressure lungs creates phonation glottis larynx modified vocal tract mouth different vowels consonants however humans pronounce words without use lungs glottis alaryngeal speech three types esophageal speech pharyngeal speech buccal speech better known donald duck talk speech production complex activity consequence errors common especially children speech errors come many forms used provide evidence support hypotheses nature result speech errors often used construction models language production child language acquisition example fact children often make error overregularizing ed past tense suffix english eg saying singed instead sang shows regular forms acquired speech errors associated certain kinds aphasia used map certain components speech onto brain see relation different aspects production example difficulty expressive aphasia patients producing regular pasttense verbs irregulars like singsang used demonstrate regular inflected forms word individually stored lexicon produced affixation base speech perception refers processes humans interpret understand sounds used language study speech perception closely linked fields phonetics phonology linguistics cognitive psychology perception psychology research speech perception seeks understand listeners recognize speech sounds use information understand spoken language research speech perception also applications building computer systems recognize speech well improving speech recognition hearing languageimpaired speech perception categorical people put sounds hear categories rather perceiving spectrum people likely able hear differences sounds across categorical boundaries within good example voice onset time vot

human children develop protospeech babbling behaviors four six months old begin saying first words point first year life typical children progress two three word phrases three years age followed short sentences four years speech repetition speech heard quickly turned sensory input motor instructions needed immediate delayed vocal imitation phonological memory type mapping plays key role enabling children expand spoken vocabulary masur found often children repeat novel words versus already lexicon related size lexicon later young children repeat novel words larger lexicon later development speech repetition could help facilitate acquisition larger several organic psychological factors affect speech among speech language disorders also result brain hearing developmental cleft cerebral
