properdin deficiency rare xlinked disease properdin important complement factor responsible stabilization alternative convertase three forms properdin deficiencies type identified total absence properdin protein plasma type ii low detectable amount properdin protein plasma type iii rare case normal levels properdin protein dysfunctional one first studied cases properdin deficiency davis families members partial deficiencies resulted lowered consumption properdin deficiency studied shortly sjoholm subjects deceased shortly study largest study properdin deficiency fijen included nine males across three family members fijens study affected found susceptible diseases neisseria protein involved function immune system external changes physiology aberrant physical characteristics expressed individuals possessing properdin deficiency however individuals properdin deficiency heightened susceptibility bacterial infections notably caused bacteria within neisseria genus though also studied cases individuals recurrent pneumococcus bacteremia result streptococcus pneumoniae another species bacteria entirely different due heightened susceptibility neisseria bacterium individuals properdin deficiency far likely succumb bacterial infection meningitis resulting inflammation brain spinal cord causes severe headaches fevers neck stiffness may result development meningococcal diseases extreme complications individuals properdin deficiency also likely catch sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea also caused neisseria bacterium resulting swelling itching pain formation pus mucous membranes including limited genitals mouth mentioned external indications properdin deficiency properdin deficiency reliably detected lab typical tests complement deficiencies measurement detect low levels absence pathways typically unaltered three types properdin deficiencies even affected typically within normal levels cause instead histories infection anything neisseria genus well family history indicators specialist centers screen properdin deficiencies using immunochemical particular use elisa proves one effective methods detecting properdin deficiency average healthy male expected show properdin antigen levels around elisa unitsml obligate carrier females recall properdin deficiency xlinked disease tend show average individual properdin deficiency definition show little properdin antigen levels possess requisite gene produce protein properdin deficiencies rare diagnosed caucasians pertaining complement deficiencies cure treatments complement deficiencies vary widely best course action management usually patient treat complement deficiency immune deficiency get immunized microbe associated deficiency best mentioned earlier individuals properdin deficiency increasingly susceptible neisseria bacterium recent studies indicated individuals properdin deficiency respond well immunized tetravalent polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine generates anti capsular antibodies bactericidal antimeningococcal activity serotypes covered given vaccine reported lower chances reinfection meningococci individuals undergone treatment however vaccine protect group b meningococci chemotherapy recommended full protection meningococci variants properdin deficiency caused xlinked recessive allele meaning gene responsible present x chromosome given recessive means condition inherited alleles xchromosomes deficiency patient female xx patient one x chromosome male patients xy means female could heterozygous allele xx express weakened immune system individuals partial properdin deficiency shown function effectively healthy also means male patient receives recessive allele mother inherit deficiency regardless genotype father father must passed chromosome plays part genes xlinked inheritance gene responsible production properdin complement factor properdin cfp lies xchromosome coordinates three types properdin deficiency caused different mutations exons cfp type properdin deficiency result nonsense mutation exon cdp gene caused ctot transition position results early termination sequence production immature properdin type also result gt transversion position exon causing amino acid substitution valine renders protein finally type alternatively caused ctog transversion exon position converting serine codon stop type ii properdin deficiency thought caused one two mutations cfp one mutations ctot transition position located exon converted arginine tryptophan resulting improper protein second mutation gtoa transition position intron hypothesized cause cryptic splice site resulting improper splicing type iii properdin deficiency caused ttog mutation exon resulting conversion aspartic acid resulting ineffective type type ii properdin deficiency result absence extremely low presence properdin whereas type iii results presence dysfunctional properdin protein ultimately three types basic effect reducing defensive capabilities bacteria especially previously mentioned complement deficiencies rare currently well characterized difficulty detecting currently complement deficiencies comprise approximately primary
