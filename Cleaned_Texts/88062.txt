lipoma benign tumor made fat generally soft touch movable usually occur skin occasionally may less cm common locations include upper back shoulders possible number cause generally risk factors include family history obesity lack diagnosis typically based physical occasionally medical imaging tissue biopsy used confirm treatment typically observation surgical rarely condition may recur following removal generally managed repeat generally associated future risk lipomas prevalence roughly every lipomas typically occur adults years males often affected common noncancerous softtissue first use term lipoma describe tumors fatty tumor plural lipomata medical latin greek lipos fat n pie root leip stick adhere also used form words fat oma many subtypes lipomas tendency develop lipoma necessarily hereditary although hereditary conditions familial multiple lipomatosis might include lipoma genetic studies mice shown correlation hmg ic gene previously identified gene related obesity
