vasopressin infusions use septic shock patients responding fluid resuscitation infusions catecholamines eg dopamine norepinephrine increase blood pressure sparing use catecholamines argipressins much shorter elimination halflife around minutes synthetic nonarginine vasopresines much longer elimination halflife many hours argipressins act receptors consequently lead higher egfr lower vascular resistance lungs number injectable arginine vasopressins clinical use united states european union pitressin among others medication commonly used treatment frequent urination increased thirst dehydration resulting diabetes insipidus causes increased diluted used treat abdominal distension following surgeries stomach vasopressin hormone affects kidneys reduces urine side effects may include stomach ache vertigo pale skin flatulence headache available generic vasopressin used manage antidiuretic hormone deficiency offlabel uses used treatment gastrointestinal bleeding ventricular tachycardia ventricular defibrillation vasopressin used treat diabetes insipidus related low levels antidiuretic hormone available vasopressin agonists used therapeutically various conditions longacting synthetic analogue desmopressin used conditions featuring low vasopressin secretion well control bleeding forms von willebrand disease mild haemophilia extreme cases bedwetting children terlipressin related analogues used vasoconstrictors certain conditions use vasopressin analogues esophageal varices commenced vasopressin infusions also used second line therapy septic shock patients

mostly canine studies performed anesthesiologists dr john w pearson dr joseph stafford redding demonstrated improved outcomes use adjunct intracardiac epinephrine injection resuscitation attempts induced cardiac also contributing idea vasopressors may useful treatments cardiac arrest studies performed early mid found significantly higher levels endogenous serum vasopressin adults successful resuscitation outofhospital cardiac arrest compared results animal models supported use either vasopressin epinephrine cardiac arrest resuscitation attempts showing improved coronary perfusion overall improvement shortterm survival well neurological although vasopressors vasopressin epinephrine differ vasopressin direct effects cardiac contractility epinephrine thus vasopressin theorized increased benefit epinephrine cardiac arrest due properties increasing myocardial cerebral oxygen idea led advent several studies searching presence clinical difference benefit two treatment choices initial small studies demonstrated improved outcomes vasopressin comparison however subsequent studies agreement several randomized controlled trials unable reproduce positive results vasopressin treatment

survival hospital discharge combination treatment unfortunately patients survived hospital discharge overall poor outcomes many sustained permanent severe neurological recently published clinical trial singapore shown similar results finding combination treatment improve rate survival hospital admission especially subgroup analysis patients longer collapse emergency department arrival times vasopressin used managing hemodynamic instability newborns older children recovering cardiac evidence children recovering cardiac surgery relative vasopressin deficiency endogenous plasma concentrations arginine vasopressin lower would expected clinical though low endogenous vasopressin concentrations cause hemodynamic instability neonates children recovering cardiac surgery develop hemodynamic instability low endogenous vasopressin concentrations optimal candidates surgery unfortunately measurement endogenous vasopressin concentration timeconsuming cumbersome practical bedside application copeptin stable easily measured product proavp processing may means identifying patients low endogenous vasopressin research needed also systemic corticosteroids shown suppress endogenous vasopressin production neonates children recovering cardiac surgery receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy may also optimal candidates vasopressin therapy hemodynamic instability present
