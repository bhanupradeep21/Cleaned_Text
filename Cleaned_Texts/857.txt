canadensis thinhorn sheep ovis dalli mouflons urials ovis usually higher ranking older male courts younger male using sequence stylized movements initiate homosexual courtship courting male approaches male head neck lowered extended far forward called lowstretch posture may combine twist courting male sharply rotates head points muzzle toward male often flicking tongue making grumbling sounds courting male also often performs foreleg kick snaps front leg males belly hind legs also occasionally sniffs nuzzles males genital area may perform flehmen response thinhorn rams additionally lick
