pet radiotracer type radioligand used diagnostic purposes via positron emission tomography imaging pet functional imaging technique produces threedimensional image functional processes body system detects pairs gamma rays emitted indirectly positronemitting radionuclide tracer introduced body biologically active vivo systems often used quantify binding test molecule binding site radioligand higher affinity molecule radioligand displaced binding site increasing radioactive decay measured scintillography assay commonly used calculate binding constant molecules receptors due probable injuries petradiotracers could administered normal doses medications therefore binding affinity pkd pettracers must high addition since via pet imaging technique desired investigate function accurately selectivity bindings specific targets httpsenwikipediaorgwikipetradiotracer
