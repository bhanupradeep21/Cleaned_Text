archelon extinct marine turtle late cretaceous largest turtle ever documented biggest specimen measuring ft head tail short tons body mass known pierre shale one species ischyros past genus also contained marshii copei though reassigned protostega kansastega respectively genus named american paleontologist george reber wieland based skeleton south dakota placed extinct family protostegidae leatherback sea turtle dermochelys coriacea thought closest living relative protostegidae thought completely separate lineage living sea turtle archelon leathery carapace instead hard shell seen sea turtles carapace may featured row small ridges peaking cm height especially hooked beak jaws adept crushing probably ate hardshelled crustaceans mollusks possibly even sponges slowly moving seafloor also potentially consumed animals whilst swimming closer surface like jellyfish squid nautiloids however beak may betteradapted shearing flesh fish another possible prey choice large strong foreflippers archelon likely able produce powerful strokes necessary openocean travel need escape fellow marine predators inhabited northern western interior seaway mild cool temperate area dominated plesiosaurs hesperornithiform seabirds mosasaurs may gone extinct due shrinking seaway increased infant mortality rates sea higher instances egg hatchling predation land rapidly cooling climate
