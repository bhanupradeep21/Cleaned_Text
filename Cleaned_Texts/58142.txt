latent learning subconscious retention information without reinforcement motivation latent learning one changes behavior sufficient motivation later subconsciously retained latent learning observation something rather experiencing something directly affect later behavior observational learning many things human observes behavior later repeats behavior another time direct imitation even though one rewarding behavior social learning theory humans observe others receiving rewards punishments invokes feelings observer motivates change behavior latent learning particularly observation reward punishment latent learning simply animals observing surroundings particular motivation learn geography however later date able exploit knowledge motivation biological need find food escape trouble lack reinforcement associations motivation stimulus differentiates type learning learning theories operant conditioning classical classical conditioning animal eventually subconsciously anticipates biological stimulus food experience seemingly random stimulus due repeated experience association one significant example classical conditioning ivan pavlovs experiment dogs showed conditioned response bell experimenters purposely tried associate feeding time dogs conditioned dogs longer salivated food biological need therefore unconditioned stimulus dogs began salivate sound bell bell conditioned stimulus salivating conditioned response salivated sound bell anticipating food hand latent learning animal learns something even though motivation stimulus associating reward learning animals therefore able simply exposed information sake information come brain one significant example latent learning rats subconsciously creating mental maps using information able find biological stimulus food faster later rats already knew map maze even though motivation learn maze food introduced operant conditioning ability tailor animals behavior using rewards punishments latent learning tailoring animals behavior giving time create mental map stimulus introduced social learning theory suggests behaviors learned observation actively cognizant observation theory observation leads change behavior often rewards punishments associated specific behaviors observed latent learning theory similar observation aspect different due lack reinforcement needed learning classic study edward c tolman three groups rats placed mazes behavior observed day two weeks rats group always found food end maze rats group never found food rats group found food days received food eleventh group rats quickly learned rush end maze group rats wandered maze preferentially go end group acted group rats food introduced day quickly learned run end maze well group rats next day showed group rats learned organisation maze without reinforcement food study largely believed reinforcement necessary animals learn experiments showed latent learning happen shorter durations time eg among early studies also found animals allowed explore maze detained one minute empty goal box learned maze much rapidly groups given goal needed john seward conducted studies rats placed tmaze one arm coloured white black one group rats mins explore maze food present rats removed soon reached end arm seward placed food one two arms rats exploratory group learned go rewarded arm much faster another group rats previously explored similar results obtained bendig rats trained escape water modified tmaze food present satiated food tested hungry upon returned maze food deprived rats learned food located rate increased number preexposures given rat training phase indicated varying levels latent early studies latent learning conducted rats study stevenson explored method learning stevenson required children explore series objects find key determined knowledge children various nonkey objects children found nonkey objects faster previously seen indicating using latent learning ability learn way increased became wirsig coresearchers used taste sodium chloride explore parts brain necessary latent learning rats decorticate rats able normal rats accomplish latent learning human ability perform latent learning seems major contributor infants use knowledge learned skills use example infants gain ability imitate months one experiment one group infants exposed hand puppets b simultaneously age threemonths another control group age presented puppet infants periodically presented puppet sixmonths age sixmonths age experimenters performed target behavior first puppet infants watched infants presented puppet b infants seen puppets age imitated target behavior puppet b significantly higher rate control group seen two puppets paired suggests preexposed infants formed association puppets without reinforcement exhibits latent learning infants showing infants learn observation even show indication learning many drugs abused humans imitate dopamine neurotransmitter gives humans motivation seek shown zebrafish still latently learn rewards lacking dopamine given caffeine given caffeine learning could use knowledge learned find reward given dopamine later alcohol may impede latent learning zebrafish exposed alcohol exploring maze continued exposed alcohol maze reward introduced took zebrafish much longer find reward maze control group exposed alcohol even though showed amount motivation however shown longer zebrafish exposed alcohol less effect latent learning another experiment group zebrafish representing alcohol withdrawal zebrafish performed worst exposed alcohol long period removed reward introduced fish lacked motivation motor dysfunction seemed latently learned though specific area brain responsible latent learning may pinpointed found patients medial temporal amnesia particular difficulty latent learning task required representational another study conducted mice found intriguing evidence absence prion protein disrupts latent learning memory functions water maze
