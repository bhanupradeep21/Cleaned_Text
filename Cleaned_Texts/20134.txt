isoniazid iproniazid substituted hydrazine isopropyl hydrazine moiety essential inhibition monoamine oxidase multiple routes synthesize iproniazid common precursor methyl isonicotinate formes isonicotinohydrazide reacts isonicotinohydrazide converted iproniazid via different pathways one synthesis pathway involves acme results formation subsequently cn linkage selectively hydrogenated

phosphate hydroxyl imidazole sulfhydryl groups formed isopropyl radical able form sisopropyl conjugates vitro diminishes covalent binding proteins however observed vitro vivo hepatotoxic doses isopropyl hydrazine precursor isopropyl radical deplete sulfhydrylgroup containing isopropyl radical formed result metabolism iproniazid able covalently bind proteins macromolecules liver interactions reason hepatotoxicity iproniazid covalent binding results liver necrosis presumably changing protein function leading organelle stress acute however exact mechanism binding iproniazid derivatives liver proteins would induce liver necrosis remains cytochrome enzymes present highest concentrations liver causing alkylating agents produced liver explains liver mostly damaged covalent binding alkylating agents isopropyl rat models animal models shown cytochrome enzymes convert isopropyl hydrazine alkylating compounds induce liver necrosis inducer class hepatic microsomal cytochrome enzymes phenobarbital highly increased chance necrosis contrast compounds cobalt chloride piperonyl butoxide alphanaphthylisothiocyanate inhibit microsomal enzymes resulted decreased chance necrosis due isopropyl iproniazid also metabolised odealkylation iproniazid acetone isoniazid isoniazid undergo metabolism via multiple metabolic pathways one eventually results alkylating agents well toxifying metabolic pathway includes nacetylation reactions involving acetylation influenced genetic variance acetylator phenotype toxicological response isoniazid thus iproniazid therefore subjected interindividual differences acetone also produced alternative pathway metabolite isopropyl hydrazine eventually converted isonicotinic acid formed hydrolysis iproniazid described moderately toxic
