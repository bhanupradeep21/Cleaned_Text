anal fissure break tear skin anal canal anal fissures may noticed bright red anal bleeding toilet paper undergarments sometimes toilet acute painful chronic fissures pain intensity often reduces anal fissures caused stretching anal mucous membrane beyond superficial shallow anal fissures look much like paper cut may hard detect upon visual inspection generally selfheal within couple weeks however anal fissures become chronic deep heal common cause nonhealing spasming internal anal sphincter muscle results impaired blood supply anal mucosa result nonhealing ulcer may become infected fecal bacteria adults fissures may caused constipation passing large hard stools prolonged diarrhea older adults anal fissures may caused decreased blood flow area fissures found laterally tuberculosis

prevent anal fissure constipation cause making sure infant drinking enough fluids ie breastmilk proper ratios mixing formulas beneficial infants anal fissure occurred addressing underlying causes usually enough ensure healing occurscitation needed nonsurgical treatments recommended initially acute chronic anal include topical nitroglycerin calcium channel blockers eg diltiazem injection botulinum toxin anal measures include warm sitz baths topical anesthetics highfiber diet stool local application medication relax sphincter muscle thus allowing healing proceed first proposed nitroglycerine calcium channel blockers nifedipine following year topical branded preparations available topical nitroglycerine ointment rectogesic rectiv australia uk topical nifedipine lidocaine ointment antrolin italy since april diltiazem anoheal uk although still phase iii development common side effect drawback nitroglycerine ointment headache caused systemic absorption drug limits patient acceptability combined surgical pharmacological treatment administered colorectal surgeons direct injection botulinum toxin botox anal sphincter relax treatment first investigated however many cases involving botox injections patients eventually choose another cure injections proved less less potent spending thousands dollars meantime partial cure lateral sphincterotomy gold standard curing combination medical therapies may offer cure surgical procedures generally reserved people anal fissure tried medical therapy least one three months healed first option treatment main concern surgery development anal incontinence anal incontinence include inability control gas mild fecal soiling loss solid stool degree incontinence occur percent patients immediate surgical recovery period however incontinence rarely permanent usually mild risk discussed ones surgeon surgical treatment general anaesthesia either anal stretch lords operation lateral sphincterotomy internal anal sphincter muscle incised operations aim decrease sphincter spasming thereby restore normal blood supply anal mucosa surgical operations involve general regional anaesthesia anal stretch also associated anal incontinence small proportion cases thus sphincterotomy operation choice lateral internal sphincterotomy lis surgical procedure choice anal fissures due simplicity high success rate procedure internal anal sphincter partially divided order reduce spasming thus improve blood supply perianal area improvement blood supply helps heal fissure weakening sphincter also believed reduce potential procedure generally performed day surgery patient given general anesthesia pain sphincterotomy usually mild often less pain fissure patients often return normal activity within one week lis however number potential side effects including problems incision site healing incontinence flatus faeces surveys surgical results suggest incontinence rates though lateral internal sphincterotomy lis considered safe shortterm basis concerns longterm safety pankaj garg et al published systematic review metaanalysis analyzed longterm continence disturbance two years lis procedure found incidence longterm
