movement articulatory emg recordings allows one monitor ideally reduce concurrent speaking tasks participants study asked complete activity specific experiment simultaneously repeating irrelevant example one may asked read paragraph reciting word cola speaking repeated irrelevant word thought preoccupy articulators used subvocalization therefore used mental processing activity studied participants undergone concurrent speaking task often compared participants study completed activity without subvocalization interference performance activity significantly less concurrent speaking task group noninterference group subvocalization believed play role mental processing participants noninterference comparison group usually also complete different yet equally distracting task involve articulator muscles tapping ensures difference performance two groups fact due subvocalization disturbances due considerations task difficulty divide shadowing conceptually similar concurrent speaking tasks instead repeating irrelevant word shadowing requires participants listen list words repeat words fast possible completing separate task studied techniques subvocalization interference may also include locking ones jaw placing tongue roof ones subvocal recognition involves monitoring actual movements tongue vocal cords interpreted electromagnetic sensors use electrodes nanocircuitry synthetic telepathy could achieved allowing people communicate exploration evolutionary background subvocalization currently limited little known predominantly language acquisition memory evolutionary

phonological loop interact nondependent manner demonstrated differential requirements different role subvocalization within workings memory processes heavily reliant involvement baddeleys proposed phonological loop findings support role subvocalization mechanisms underlying working memory holding information accessible malleable state forms internal speechlike processing may function holding mechanism immediate memory working memory span behavioural measure exceptional consistency positive function rate subvocalization experimental data shown span size increases rate subvocalization increases time needed subvocalize number items comprising span generally fmri data suggests sequence five letters approaches individual capacity immediate recall relies subvocal rehearsal role subvocal rehearsal also seen shortterm memory research confirmed form rehearsal benefits cognitive subvocal movements occur people listen rehearse series speech sounds help subject maintain phonemic representation sounds shortterm memory finding supported fact interfering overt production speech sound disrupt encoding sounds features shortterm suggests strong role played subvocalization encoding speech sounds shortterm memory also found language differences shortterm memory performance bilingual people mediated exclusively subvocal production acoustic errors shortterm memory also thought part due individuals stutter therefore slower rate subvocal also demonstrate shortterm reproduction serial material slower compared people subvocalization plays large role memory encoding subvocalization appears facilitate translating visual linguistic information acoustic vice example subvocalization occurs one sees word asked say seesay condition one hears word asked write hearwrite condition one asked see word write seewrite condition hear word say hearsay seesay condition converts visual information acoustic information hearwrite condition converts acoustic information visual information seewrite hearsay conditions however remain sensory domain require translation different type also supported findings suggest subvocalization required encoding words heard already acoustic form therefore enter shortterm memory directly without use subvocal furthermore subvocalization interference impedes reading comprehension listening subvocalizations role reading comprehension viewed function task complexity subvocalization involved minimally immediate example subvocalization used making homophone used comprehension sentences even still comprehension subvocalization translates visual reading information durable flexible acoustic thought allow integration past concepts currently advocates speed reading generally claim subvocalization places extra burden cognitive resources thus slowing reading speedreading courses often prescribe lengthy practices eliminate subvocalizing reading normal reading instructors often simply apply remedial teaching reader subvocalizes degree make visible movements lips jaw furthermore fmri studies comparing fast slow readers reading task indicate two groups significant differences brain areas activated particular found rapid readers show

sounds indeed carried phonological mechanisms previously mentioned even creation nonspeech sounds within mechanism two general types individuals comes subvocalization lowvocalizers using electromyography record muscle action potential larynx ie muscle movement larynx individual categorized high low vocalizer depending much muscle movement muscles larynx undergo silent reading often high low vocalizers rate speech constantly regulated depending intensityvolume words said affected long delays readings increasing delay speech hearing ones voice effect called delayed auditory feedback increasing voice intensity reading found higher lowvocalizers believed highvocalizers greater muscle movement larynx silent reading lowvocalizers read louder compensate lack movement understand individuals undergo feedback training conscious muscle movements difference articulation silent speech important though speech solely dependent articulation alone impairing articulation reduce sensory input muscle movements larynx brain understand information read also impairs ongoing speech production reading direct words high similarity minimize articulation causing interference may reduce subvocal articulation similar words affecting subvocalization increase acoustic errors shortterm memory impairing suppressing articulation causes greater impact example articulation suppression repeating word many times attempting memorise words shortterm memory even though primary cues may given words attempt retrieve words either recalled incorrect cue recalled people schizophrenia known experience auditory hallucinations could show result overactivation muscles using electromyography record muscle movement individuals experiencing hallucinations showed greater muscle activation hallucinations however muscle activation easily detected means muscle movement must measured wider though wider range needed detect muscle movement still considered subvocalization much research needed link subvocalization hallucination many schizophrenics report hearing voices hallucinations coming small fact could clue finding true link subvocalization hallucinations difficult
