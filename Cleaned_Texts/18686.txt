reptiles second stage omitted four fragmentary taxa prolacertoides trachelosaurus kadimakara malutinisuchus analyses recovered jesairosaurus prolacertiform archosauromorph due features skull neck although first stage analysis could determine specific lineages within prolacertiformes second stage clarified inner relations group second stage jesairosaurus found closely related malerisaurus due sharing thin scapula addition two grouped advanced prolacertiformes tanystropheids due lost quadratojugal jalils analysis among last find support group prolacertiformes practically every subsequent analysis starting dilkes found unnatural grouping various longnecked archosauromorphs since analyses placed majority prolacertiformes including tanystropheus macrocnemus protorosaurus group protorosauria resided base archosauromorpha prolacerta namesake prolacertiformes put derived position closer archosauriformes group advanced archosauromorphs including animals proterosuchus euparkeria crocodilians dinosaurs prolacertiformes abandoned paleontologists validity protorosauria also called question paleontologists martin ezcurra argued tanystropheids closely related advanced archosauromorphs protorosaurus thus rendering protorosauria paraphyletic grade early archosauromorphs ezcurras analysis supported interpretation also incorporated jesairosaurus variety largescale phylogenetic analyses found sister taxon tanystropheids regardless whether closer advanced archosauromorphs protorosaurus although jesairosaurus lacked many specific vertebral pelvic features tanystropheids mention long necks shared number features example premaxilla jesairosaurus tanystropheids five teeth parietal bones skull roof stretched forward far orbits interclavicle jesairosaurus tanystropheids small notch front tip feature acquired independently clade including prolacerta tasmaniosaurus archosauriformes lateral branch pterygoid bone roof mouth also toothless reptiles finally expanded entepicondyle portion distal part humerus faces backwards phylogenetic analysis performed deoliveira et al instead suggests jesairosaurus occupies clade dinocephalosaurus base
