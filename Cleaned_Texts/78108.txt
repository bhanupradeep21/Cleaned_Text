people living hivaids face increased challenges maintaining proper nutrition despite developments medical treatment nutrition remains key component managing condition challenges living hivaids face result viral infection effects antihiv therapy side effects haart may affect body absorbs utilizes nutrients include fatigue nausea poor nutritional needs people hivaids also greater due immune system fighting opportunistic infections normally cause disease people healthy immune medication along proper nutrition major component maintaining good health quality life people living hivaids monitoring caloric intake important ensuring energy needs met people hivaids energy requirements often increase order maintain regular body classification system revised centers disease control prevention cdc categorizes hivinfection three clinical stages addresses suggested caloric requirements world health organization issued consultative recommendations regarding nutrient requirements generally healthy diet promoted hivinfected adults recommended micronutrient intake comes good diet rda levels higher intake vitamin zinc iron produce adverse effects hiv positive adults recommended unless documented despite recommendations recent reviews highlighted absence simple consensus regarding effects multivitamins micronutrient nutrient supplementation hiv positive individuals partly due lack strong scientific studies looked use implementing daily multivitamins diet regimens hivaids patients one study done tanzania involved trial group one thousand hiv positive pregnant women findings showed daily multivitamins benefited mothers babies four years multivitamins found reduce womens risk aids death approximately another trial thailand revealed use multivitamins led fewer deaths among people advanced stages however studies provided positive correlation small trial done zambia found benefits multivitamins one month regarding individual vitamin mineral supplementation research shows mixed results vitamin supplementation shown reduce mortality morbidity rates among african children hiv recommends vitamin supplements young children months old high risk vitamin deficiency every contrast trial tanzania found use vitamin supplements increased risk mothertochild transmission inconsistency results scientists reached consensus regarding vitamin supplementation possible benefits hivaids patients vitamins taken hivinfected adults vitamins c ecitation needed evidence supplementation selenium mixed tentative evidence evidence vitamin supplementation children reduces mortality improves nutritionally compromised pregnant lactating women multivitamin supplementation improved outcomes mothers thus research required determine relationship supplements hivaids order develop effective nutritional interventionscitation needed statistics show hivaids prevalent subsaharan african according hunger map undernourishment prevalent asiapacific subsaharan africa reasons correlation malnutrition presence hivaids listed belowcitation needed food security present people times access sufficient safe nutritious food maintain healthy active life defined world food summit set basis food availability food access proper food difficulty people hiv aids involves must obtain food security virus increases fatigue compromising ability work order provide food food preparation impact even greater living poverty rural areas providing food largely based farming household malawi aids epidemic effect food security rural households studied findings revealed illness death result aids compromised household food security households negative food security indexes meaning enough flour andor corn meet daily caloric requirements sharing food resources substantially decreased families affected hivaids proved especially detrimental families longer prime adult removal prime adult families deprived productive labor resulting serious production deficiencies study concludes family members victimized aids led fracturing interpersonal ties families created food insecurity community based rural subsistence malnutrition used measure food insecurity impact living subsaharan africa asiapacific poverty malnutrition prevalent also subsaharan africa cases hivaids individual whose body already compromised hiv immune system even less effective defending infections body malnourished antiretroviral drugs distributed people areas given undernourished medicines effectiveness decreased toxicity increased malnutrition accelerates onset disease give rise repeated illnesses weakened immune systems consequently hiv malnutrition provide cyclic form feedback worsening conditions malnutrition linked rapid onset uses see food safety people living aids impaired immune systems therefore susceptible infections diseases due foodborne pathogens food safety includes food handling food preparation food storage dealt carefully ensure safety foodborne bacteria prevalent people aids include salmonella common cause illness times prevalent aids patients healthy another example listeriosis caused listeria monocytogenes severe often fatal consequences encountered person aids simple measures used increase food safety prevent foodborne illnesses affected hivaids washing hands food prepared kitchen utensils kitchen surfaces effective bacterial growth keeping raw meat cooked meat separate cooking foods thoroughly using food thermometer sure lastly storing leftover foods refrigerator within two hours ensure minimal risk foodborne areas research either explored researched indepth related area hivaids treatment food security also impact rural areas affected hivaids another area research involves agriculture subsistence economies specifically areas households affected hivaids may suffer food insecurity focuses future research may include looking ways improve agricultural practices order enhance household food production families one adults
