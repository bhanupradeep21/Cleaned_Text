wildernessacquired diarrhea variety travelers diarrhea backpackers outdoor enthusiasts affected potential sources contaminated food water handtomouth directly another person cases generally resolve spontaneously without treatment cause typically unknown national outdoor leadership school recorded one incident per personfield days following strict protocols hygiene water limited separate studies presented highly varied estimated rates affliction range percent percent wilderness one survey found longdistance appalachian trail hikers reported diarrhea common based reviews epidemiologic data literature researchers believe risks overstated poorly understood average incubation periods giardiasis cryptosporidiosis certain bacterial viral agents shorter incubation periods although hepatitis

agents may play larger role generally include campylobacter hepatitis virus hepatitis e virus enterotoxogenic e coli e coli shigella various viruses rarely yersinia enterocolitica aeromonas hydrophila cyanobacterium may also cause giardia lamblia cysts usually tolerate freezing although cysts survive single cysts remain viable nearly three months river water temperature one month lake water cryptosporidium may survive cold waters months even withstand freezing although viability thereby greatly many varieties diarrheacausing organisms including shigella salmonella typhi hepatitis virus
