germ theory disease currently accepted scientific theory many diseases states microorganisms known pathogens germs cause disease small organisms small seen without magnification invade humans animals living hosts growth reproduction within hosts cause disease germ refers bacterium type microorganism protists fungi even nonliving pathogens cause disease viruses prions diseases caused pathogens called infectious diseases even pathogen principal cause disease environmental hereditary factors often influence severity disease whether potential host individual becomes infected exposed pathogen pathogens diseasecarrying agents pass one individual another humans animals infectious diseases caused biological agents pathogenic microorganisms viruses bacteria fungi well parasites basic forms germ theory proposed girolamo fracastoro expanded upon marcus von plenciz however views held disdain europe galens miasma theory remained dominant among scientists doctors early century smallpox vaccination commonplace europe though doctors unaware worked extend principle diseases transitional period began late work louis pasteur work later extended robert koch end decade miasma theory
