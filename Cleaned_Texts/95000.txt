wolbachia genus intracellular bacteria infects mainly arthropod species including high proportion insects also one common parasitic microbes possibly common reproductive parasite interactions hosts often complex cases evolved mutualistic rather parasitic host species reproduce even survive without wolbachia colonisation one study concluded neotropical insect species carry bacteria many insect
