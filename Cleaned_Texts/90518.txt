stool guaiac test guaiac fecal occult blood test gfobt one several methods detects presence fecal occult blood invisible test involves placing fecal sample guaiac paper containing phenolic compound alphaguaiaconic acid extracted wood resin guaiacum trees applying hydrogen peroxide presence blood yields blue reaction product within seconds american college gastroenterology recommended abandoning gfobt testing colorectal cancer screening tool favor fecal immunochemical test though fit preferred even guaiac fob testing average risk populations may sufficient reduce mortality associated colon cancer lower efficacy always cost effective screen large population stool guaiac test involves fasting iron supplements red meat blood contains turn test positive certain vegetables contain chemical peroxidase properties turn test positive vitamin c citrus fruits turn test falsely negative period time test suggested cucumber cauliflower horseradish often vegetables avoided three days testing feces applied thick piece paper attached thin film coated guaiac either patient medical professional smears small fecal sample film fecal sample obtained catching stool transferring sample applicator digital rectal examination specimens also used method discouraged colorectal cancer screening due poor performance sides test card peeled open access inner guaiac paper one side card marked application stool developer fluidcitation needed applying feces one two drops hydrogen peroxide dripped side film observed rapid blue color changecitation needed hydrogen peroxide dripped guaiac paper oxidizes alphaguaiaconic acid blue colored normally blood peroxidases catalases vegetables present oxidation occurs slowly heme component hemoglobin found blood catalyzes reaction giving result two seconds therefore positive test result one quick intense blue color change film guaiac test often falsepositive positive test result fact source bleeding particularly common recommended dietary preparation followed heme red meat peroxidase catalase activity vegetables especially uncooked cause analytical false positives vitamin c cause analytical false negatives due antioxidant properties inhibiting color card promptly developed water content feces decreases reduce detection although rehydration stored samples reverse recommended test becomes unduly analytically sensitive thus much less stool specimens high bile content causes green color show applying developer drops entirely green samples negative questionably green blue samples designated package insert guidelines
