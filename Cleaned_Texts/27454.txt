scansoriopteryx climbing wing genus maniraptoran dinosaur described single juvenile fossil specimen found liaoning china scansoriopteryx sparrowsized animal shows adaptations foot indicating arboreal treedwelling lifestyle possessed unusual elongated third finger may supported membranous wing much like related yi qi type specimen scansoriopteryx also contains fossilized impression researchers regard genus synonym epidendrosaurus preferring treat scansoriopteryx junior though first name validly provenance scansoriopteryx type specimen uncertain obtained private fossil dealers record exact geologic data czerkas yuan initially reported likely come yixian formation though wang et al study age daohugou beds suggested probably hails beds thus likely synonym epidendrosaurus daohugou beds

hatchling maniraptoran dinosaur similar ways archaeopteryx second specimen holotype epidendrosaurus ninchengensis ivpp also shows features indicating juvenile specimen partially disarticulated bones preserved impressions rock slab rather threedimensional known specimens juvenile size fullgrown scansoriopteryx type specimen tiny sparrowsized gregroy paul estimated size cm ft length g oz body scansoriopteryx also notable wide rounded jaws lower jaw contained least twelve teeth larger front jaws back lower jaw bones may fused together feature otherwise known oviraptorosaurs one distinctive feature scansoriopteryx elongated third finger longest hand nearly twice long second finger unlike configuration seen theropods second finger longest long wing feathers remiges appear attach long digit instead middle digit birds maniraptorans shorter feathers preserved attached second relative scansoriopteryx yi suggests elongated third finger supported membranous wing kind alongside scansoriopteryx nonperforated hip socket open dinosaurs also pubis hip bone pointed forward primitive trait among theropods unlike maniraptorans closely related birds pubis points downward legs short preserve small pebbly scales along upper foot metatarsus well possible impressions long feathers area possibly similar hind wings microraptor basal also unusually large first toe hallux low foot may reversed allowing grasping tail long six seven times length femur ended fan describing scansoriopteryx czerkas yuan cited evidence arboreal treedwelling lifestyle noted unlike modern bird hatchlings forelimbs scansoriopteryx longer hind limbs authors argued anomaly indicates forelimbs played important role locomotion even extremely early developmental stage scansoriopteryx wellpreserved foot authors interpreted hallux reversed condition backwardpointing toe widespread among modern treedwelling birds furthermore authors pointed short stiffened tail scansoriopteryx specimen treeclimbing adaptation tail may used prop much like tails modern woodpeckers comparison hands modern climbing species elongated third digits like iguanid lizards also supports treeclimbing hypothesis indeed hands scansoriopteryx much better adapted climbing modern treeclimbing hatchling epidendrosaurus also interpreted arboreal based elongated hand specializations describing authors stated long hand strongly curved claws adaptations climbing moving around among tree branches viewed early stage evolution bird wing stating forelimbs became welldeveloped climbing development later lead evolution wing capable flight stated long grasping hands suited climbing flight since flying birds relatively short hands zhang et al also noted foot epidendrosaurus unique among nonavian theropods epidendrosaurus specimen preserve reversed hallux backwardfacing toe seen modern perching birds foot similar construction primitive perching birds like cathayornis longipteryx adaptations grasping ability four limbs makes likely epidendrosaurus spent significant amount time living trees scansoriopteryx fossils preserve impressions wispy downlike feathers around select parts body forming vshaped patterns similar seen modern feathers prominent feather impressions trail left forearm hand longer feathers region led czerkas yuan speculate adult scansoriopterygids may reasonably welldeveloped wing feathers could aided leaping rudimentary gliding though ruled possibility scansoriopteryx could achieved powered flight like maniraptorans scansoriopteryx semilunate halfmoon shaped bone wrist allowed birdlike folding motion hand even powered flight possible motion could aided maneuverability leaping branch reticulate scales preserved proximal portion second epidendrosaurus specimen also preserved faint feather impressions end tail similar pattern found holotype skeleton epidendrosaurus recovered daohugou fossil beds northeastern china past uncertainty regarding age beds various papers placed fossils anywhere middle jurassic period million years ago early cretaceous period age formation implications relationship epidendrosaurus similar dinosaurs well origin birds general middle jurassic age would mean birdlike dinosaurs daohugou beds older first bird archaeopteryx late jurassic age provenance scansoriopteryx uncertain though wang et al study age daohugou suggest probably hails beds thus likely
