voice analysis study speech sounds purposes linguistic content speech recognition studies include mostly medical analysis voice phoniatrics also speaker controversially believe truthfulness emotional state speakers determined using voice stress analysis layered voice analysis voice problems require voice analysis commonly originate vocal folds laryngeal musculature controls since folds subject collision forces vibratory cycle drying air forced small gap laryngeal musculature intensely active speech singing subject tiring however dynamic analysis vocal folds movement physically difficult location vocal folds effectively prohibits direct invasive measurement movement less invasive imaging methods xrays ultrasounds work vocal cords surrounded cartilage distorts image quality movements vocal cords rapid fundamental frequencies usually hz thus preventing usage ordinary video stroboscopic highspeed videos provide option see vocal folds fiberoptic probe leading camera must positioned throat makes speaking difficult addition placing objects pharynx usually triggers gag reflex stops voicing closes larynx addition stroboscopic imaging useful vocal fold vibratory pattern closely periodic importantaccording indirect methods currently inverse filtering either microphone oral airflow recordings electroglottography eggcitation needed inverse filtering speech sound radiated acoustic pressure waveform obtained microphone oral airflow waveform circumferentially vented cv mask recorded outside mouth filtered mathematical method remove effects vocal tract method estimates glottal input voice production recording output using computational model invert effects vocal tract kind noninvasive indirect indication vocal fold motion electroglottography electrodes placed either side subjects throat level vocal folds record changes conductivity throat according large portion vocal folds touching thus yields onedimensional information contact area neither inverse filtering egg sufficient completely describe complex pattern vocal fold movement provide useful indirect evidence movement another way conduct voice analysis look voice characteristics characteristics voice phonation pitch loudness rate characteristics used evaluate persons voice aid voice analysis process phonation typically tested looking different types data collected person words long vowels words many phonemes typical speech persons pitch evaluated making person produce highest lowest sounds well sounds keyboard used aid process loudness valuable look certain people loudness affects way produce certain sounds people need speak louder certain phonemes comparison others produce themcitation needed tested asking person use amount loudness singing scale rate also important looks fast slow person speaks medical study voice instance analysis voice patients polyp removed vocal cords operation computerized methods used assess issues objective experienced voice therapist quite reliably evaluate voice requires extensive training still subjective another active research topic medical voice analysis vocal loading evaluation vocal cords person speaks extended time suffer process speaking exerts load vocal cords tires tissue among professional voice users eg teachers sales people tiring cause voice failures sick leaves voice analysis studied objective means evaluate voice analysis important factor study vocal cord paralysis effects different functions vocal cords speech breathing voice analysis used study effectiveness thyroplasty medialization thyroplasty improvements vocal cords surgery traditional voice recording used preoperation record voices chosen patients compared postoperation usage along complex recordings using electroglottograpy videokymography medical professionals ability read understand results complex recordings knowledge voice professional needed within experiments accurate results voice experts important tie physical examination vocal cords neurological examination ensure success surgery trained ear perceptual evaluation voice heavily reliant voice quality factor assessed preferably voice specialists speech therapists professional voice analyzer trained ear block excess variants deceptive voice analysis used branch forensic science called audio forensics analyses generally performed evidence purposes evaluating authenticity audio question enhancing features audio may hidden beneath distracting background noise interpreting audio perspective forensic cases purposes speaker expert employ variety techniques analysis minimum procedures critical listening waveform analysis spectral critical listening involves thorough breakdown foreground background sounds repetitive waveform analysis visualizes audio examiner see irregularities may occur spectral analysis visualizes frequency audio examiner pick features one case audio played larger role trayvon martin case recording call made police analyzed determine background screams came george zimmerman martin experts forensic voice analyze recordings examining transmitted stored speech enhancing decoding criminal investigations court trials federal agencies utilize audio recordings court forensic phonetician must authenticate recording detect tampering enhance audio interpret speech first job ensure speech recording used comprehensible oftentimes samples poor sound quality due environmental factors wind movement times sound degradation due technological issues within recording device investigative work speaker identification done recording proper quality different solutions poor comprehensibility done using computer programs allow user filter eliminate noise computer software also able convert speech spectra waveforms useful forensic phonetician however work done recording done copy original recording made main part forensic phoneticians job speaker identification interpretation process might include piecing together timeline transcribing dialog identifying unknown unintelligible sounds audio recording court expert ultimately serves explain facts surrounding audio evidence providing explanation relevant acoustical physical principles explain evidenced recording reports made include detailed information section recording comprehensible inaudible explanation happening recording description missing recording voice analysis role speaker identification identity speaker unknown identify array voices suspects pertaining crime investigation court trial proper identification speaker voices particularly criminal cases depend list factors like familiarity exposure delay tone voice voice disguising accents familiarity speaker increases chances properly identifying voice distinguishing amount exposure voice also aids correctly identifying voice even unfamiliar one hearer listen longer utterance exposed voice often better recognizing voice someone perhaps able hear one word delay time hearing voice time identifying speaker also decreases prospect identifying correct speaker tone voice affects ability identify right speaker tone match speaker time comparison prove difficult analyse disguise voice example speaker whispering also hinder ability accurately match identify speaker cases individuals speak language speaker whose voice analysed easier time identifying accent stress voice speaker identification additionally complicated distortions technical method recording speaker based issues emotional states alternative motives causing discrepancy voice recording methods speaker identification forensics
