social cognitive theory sct used psychology education communication holds portions individuals knowledge acquisition directly related observing others within context social interactions experiences outside media influences theory advanced albert bandura extension social learning theory states people observe model performing behavior consequences behavior remember sequence events use information

bandura colleagues constructed series experiments using bobo doll first experiment children exposed either aggressive nonaggressive model either sex opposite sex child also control group aggressive models played bobo doll aggressive manner nonaggressive models played toys found children exposed aggressive models performed aggressive actions toward bobo doll afterward boys likely following study

demonstrations also verbal written behavior act indirect forms modeling modeling allows students learn behavior repeat also inhibit certain behavior instance teacher glares one student talking turn students may suppress behavior avoid similar reaction teachers model material objectives underlying curriculum virtuous living teachers also dedicated building high selfefficacy levels students recognizing accomplishments learn particular behavior people must understand potential outcome repeat behavior observer expect actual rewards punishments incurred model anticipates similar outcomes imitating behavior called outcome expectancies modeling impacts cognition reinforcements encompass internal external responses individuals behavior influencing probability either sustaining ceasing

competence involves ability perform moral behavior whereas moral performance indicates actually following ones idea moral behavior specific moral competencies include far individuals development concerned moral competence growth cognitivesensory processes simply put aware considered right wrong comparison moral performance influenced possible rewards incentives act certain example persons moral competence might tell stealing wrong frowned upon society however reward stealing substantial sum moral performance might indicate different line thought therein lies core social cognitive theory part social cognitive theory remains various cultures since concepts moral behavior vary much cultures crimes like murder theft unwarranted violence illegal virtually every society much room people different views morally right wrong main reason social cognitive theory applies nations say moral immoral simply states acknowledge two concepts actions reallife scenarios based whether believe
