boundary extension cognitive psychology phenomenon error commission people remember scene boundary originally present original boundary extension typically studied using recognition memory test participants shown series photos shown new photos either altered way asked different original photos example people typically presented either closeangle photo shows less picture scene wideangle photo shows picture scene study phase participant tries memorize picture close wideangle photo test phase participant tested original photos consequently four different viewing conditions people could experience photos closeclose widewide closewide wideclose participants respond new photos background original photos demonstrating boundary extension extending boundary original psychologists studied boundary extension evolved time example psychologists first studied phenomenon asking participants draw scenes many studies researchers moved studying boundary extension picture recognition memory task widely used way study boundary extension boundary extension occurs variety stimuli example boundary extension happens simple complex simple complex photos objects zoomed varying multimodal boundary extension also happens haptic auditory boundary extension occurs variety ages well example boundary extension apparent early life old infants college students susceptible boundary extension older boundary extension even happens people disorders boundary extension universal regarding different altered stimuli age groups many possible causes examples scenarios boundary extension example people tend draw entire scenes instead picture also people naturally add background scenes regardless whether looking scene drawing essentially beyond current boundaries becomes part internal representation recalled scene person addition many cognitive mechanisms influence boundary extension source monitoring perceptual source monitoring error defined inability recall information came especially trying recall source photos example participants boundary extension experiments often tend say boundaryextended test photos came study pictures rather recognizing altered photos minds cause boundary extension new photos trying remember perceptual schema cognitive phenomenon internal mental representation scene created oneself using prior knowledge details world perceptual schemas often form person sees new image way process image using prior knowledge images one viewed processed past perceptual schemas form picture viewed first time soon perceptual schemas applicable boundary extension one perceptual schema might add background boundary details original photo part one perceptual schema visual memory defined process one encodes remembers visual information pictures visual memory relevant boundary extension boundary extension visual memory phenomenon one rely visual aspects memory try recall pictures notice changes pictures many possible causes boundary extension example source monitoring perceptual visual partially contribute boundary extension related photos initially processed later remembered variety types objects scenes also help facilitate boundary extension example simple scenes picture one main object complex scenes picture one main object cause people boundary photos really similar either zoomed large amount small amount also elicit boundary furthermore wideangled scenes pictures show background closeangled scenes pictures show less background contribute boundary extension scenes animals landscapes people scenes rotated objects varying degrees also elicit boundary moreover models rooms furniture conducive boundary extension compared even neutral emotional photos help cause boundary boundary extension occurs scene pictures objects pictures blank backgrounds line outlinescenes outlineobjects elicit boundary variety different scene stimuli cause boundary extension average person first boundary extension studied participants draw scenes memory participants would presented photo photo would taken away participants would asked draw photo memory keeping mind proportions original photo inherent tediousness imprecision coding analyzing kind picture data psychologists transitioned studying boundary extension picture recognition memory tasks picture recognition memory task participants would shown photos study phase presented photos slightly altered test phase would asked photo camera angle seemed little away lot away little closer lot closer finally would rate confident answer ranging sure pretty sure sure see boundary extension occurs matter age one example boundary extension present children also boundary extension matter draw scenes memory complete picture recognition even college students boundary extension matter kind boundary extension finally adults older adults demonstrate boundary extension tendencies boundary extension persist occur throughout one life starting boundary extension explored incorporating haptic element boundary extension researchers college students either view touch sceneregions frame college students recalled stimuli interacted listing objects either felt saw boundary extension occurred visual haptic stimuli conditions researchers concluded boundary extension occurs across modalities people perceive remember scenes multimodally eyes boundary extension also studied adding auditory element see sound relates boundary extension picture researchers participants complete normal picture recognition memory task added auditory component participants one three conditions sound music sound effect viewing photos study phase participants either listened silence sound relevant photo unrelated music completed normal test phase structure picture recognition memory task boundary extension occurred three conditions differ across conditions type noise affect boundary extension indeed boundary extension auditory conditions control condition participants listened silence viewing photos auditory stimuli affect boundary extension children syndrome still experienced boundary extension picture recognition memory task drawing task scene memory task compared children without syndrome despite differences brains syndrome participants typically demonstrated boundary extension drawing among test subjects type brain damage leads form amnesia boundary extension error ranges significantly less erroneous nonexistent compared test subjects brain httpsenwikipediaorgwikiboundaryextension
