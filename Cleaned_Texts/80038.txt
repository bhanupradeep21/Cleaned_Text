simple eye sometimes called pigment refers form eye optical arrangement composed single lens without elaborate retina occurs vertebrates sense simple eye distinct multilensed compound eye necessarily simple usual sense word structure animals eye determined environment lives behavioural tasks must fulfill survive arthropods differ widely habitats live well visual requirements finding food conspecifics avoiding predators consequently enormous variety eye types found arthropods possess wide variety novel solutions overcome visual problems limitations use term simple eye flexible must interpreted proper context example eyes humans large animals cephalopods camera eyes usages classed simple single lens collects focuses light onto retina analogous film criteria presence complex retina distinguishes vertebrate camera eye simple stemma ommatidium additionally ocelli ocellus singular ommatidia invertebrates simple photoreceptors many including ommatidia insects central eyes solifugae various forms retinula salticidae predatory spiders seemingly simple eyes emulate retinal vision various ways many insects unambiguously compound eyes consisting multiple lenses tens thousands achieve effect similar camera eye ommatidium lens focuses light onto number neighbouring retinulae jellyfish sea stars flatworms simplest eyes pigment spot ocelli randomly distributed pigment structure cornea lens apparent eye color animals red however box jellyfish complex eyes including distinct retina lens many snails slugs gastropod mollusks also ocelli either tips bases however gastropods strombidae much sophisticated eyes giant clams tridacna ocelli allow light penetrate spiders compound eyes instead several pairs simple eyes pair adapted specific task tasks principal secondary eyes spiders arranged four occasionally fewer pairs principal eyes moveable retinas secondary eyes reflector back eyes lightsensitive part receptor cells next get direct reflected light hunting jumping spiders example forwardfacing pair possesses best resolution even telescopic components see often small prey large distance nighthunting spiders eyes sensitive low light levels large aperture term ocellus plural ocelli derived latin oculus eye literally means little eye insects two distinct ocellus types dorsal ocelli simply ocelli found insects lateral ocelli stemmata found larvae insect orders structurally functionally different simple eyes animals eg cnidarians may also referred ocelli structure anatomy eyes quite distinct dorsal ocelli insects dorsal ocelli lightsensitive organs found dorsal topmost surface frontal surface head many insects eg hymenoptera bees ants wasps sawflies diptera flies odonata dragonflies damselflies orthoptera grasshoppers locusts mantodea mantises ocelli coexist compound eyes thus insects possess two anatomically separate functionally different visual pathways number forms functions dorsal ocelli vary markedly throughout insect orders tend larger strongly expressed flying insects particularly wasps dragonflies locusts typically found triplet two ocelli directed left right head respectively central median ocellus directed frontally terrestrial insects eg ants cockroaches median ocellus absent sidewaysfacing ocelli unfortunately called lateral ocelli referring position even though dorsal type confused lateral ocelli insect larvae see stemmata dorsal ocellus consists lens element cornea layer photoreceptors rod cells ocellar lens may strongly curved eg bees locusts dragonflies flat eg cockroaches photoreceptor layer may eg locusts may eg blowflies dragonflies separated lens clear zone vitreous humour number photoreceptors also varies widely may number hundreds thousands welldeveloped ocelli two somewhat unusual features ocelli particularly notable generally well conserved insect orders two factors led conclusion dorsal ocelli incapable perceiving form thus solely suitable lightmetering functions given large aperture low fnumber lens well high convergence ratios synaptic gains ocelli generally considered far sensitive light compound eyes additionally given relatively simple neural arrangement eye small number synapses detector effector well extremely large diameter ocellar interneurons often largest diameter neurons animals nervous system ocelli typically considered faster compound one common theory ocellar function flying insects holds used assist maintaining flight stability given underfocused nature wide fields view high lightcollecting ability ocelli superbly adapted measuring changes perceived brightness external world insect rolls pitches around body axis flight corrective flight responses light demonstrated tethered flight theories ocellar function ranged roles light adaptors global excitatory organs polarization sensors circadian entrainers recent studies shown ocelli insects notably dragonfly also wasps capable form vision ocellar lens forms image within close photoreceptor dragonflies demonstrated receptive fields secondorder quite restricted research demonstrated eyes resolve spatial details world also perceive secondorder neurons dragonfly median ocellus respond strongly upwardsmoving bars gratings downwardsmoving bars gratings effect present ultraviolet light used stimulus ultraviolet light absent directional response observed dragonfly ocelli especially highly developed specialised visual organs may support exceptional acrobatic abilities animals research ocelli high interest designers small unmanned aerial vehicles designers craft face many challenges insects face maintaining stability threedimensional world engineers increasingly taking inspiration insects overcome stemmata singular stemma class simple eyes many kinds holometabolous larvae bear form eyes enter final stage growth adults several orders hexapods also stemmata never develop compound eyes examples include fleas springtails thysanura arthropoda myriapoda rarely eyes stemmata stage lives exceptions include large welldeveloped compound eyes behind lens typical functional stemma lies single cluster photoreceptor cells termed retinula lens biconvex body stemma vitreous crystalline core although stemmata simple eyes kinds larvae lepidoptera especially tenthredinidae family sawflies simple represent immature embryonic forms compound
