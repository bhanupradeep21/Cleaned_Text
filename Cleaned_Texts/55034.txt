chylothorax abnormal accumulation chyle type lipidrich lymph space surrounding lung lymphatics digestive system normally returns lipids absorbed small bowel via thoracic duct ascends behind esophagus drain left brachiocephalic vein normal thoracic duct drainage disrupted either due obstruction rupture chyle leak accumulate within negativepressured pleural space people normal diet fluid collection sometimes identified turbid milky white appearance since chyle contains emulsified triglycerides chylothorax rare serious condition signals leakage thoracic duct one tributaries many treatments surgical fluid collections surrounding lungs pleural effusions important distinguish chylothorax pseudochylothorax pleural effusion happens high cholesterol similar appearance visually caused chronic inflammatory processes requires different symptoms chylothorax depend size underlying cause small chylothorax may cause symptoms detected chest xray performed another reason large chylothorax may lead breathlessness feeling pressure chest caused fluid restricting expansion lungs although large chylothoraces may remain asymptomatic chylothorax accumulated slowly lungs may time become used pressure fever chest pain usually associated chylothorax chyle generate inflammation examination chylothorax may lead reduced breath sounds affected side associated dull sound chest tapped percussed cases postoperative chylothorax first sign may persistent drainage intercostal large chylothoraces may cause signs related loss nutrients including features malnutrition decreased ability fight rapidly accumulating chylothoraces cause sudden drop blood volume leading low blood three main types chylothorax traumatic nontraumatic idiopathic historically common form chylothorax nontraumatic traumatic chylothoraces represent majority cases arising postoperative complications common cause nontraumatic chylothoraces chylothoraces also classified low highoutput based rate chyle accumulation lowoutput chylothoraces accumulate ml per malignancies frequent cause nontraumatic chylothorax cancers like chronic lymphocytic leukemia lung cancer lymphoma kaposi sarcoma metastatic carcinoma esophageal cancer potential causes chylothorax infectious causes also observed often developing countries common cause infectious chylothorax complication tuberculous lymphadenitis possible causative infections include aortitis histoplasmosis filariasis chylothorax also congenital may cooccur lymphatic malformations like lymphangiectasis lymphangiomatosis conditions like tuberous sclerosis congenital heart disease trisomy syndrome noonan syndrome turner syndrome missing x chromosome also possible causes congenital chylothorax rare causes congenital chylothorax include castlemans disease yellow nail syndrome waldenstr√∂ms macroglobulinemia sarcoidosis venous thrombosis thoracic radiation macroglobulinemia amyloidosis goiter diseases cause chylothorax obstructing destroying thoracic duct also parenteral nutrition possible cause quick dose total parenteral nutrition overwhelm thoracic duct causing chyle leak surrounding pleural iatrogenic chylothorax surgery common variety common serious complication especially common surgeries requiring mediastinal probability chylothorax depends type surgery surgery highest risk chylothorax esophagostomy risk chylothorax lung resection mediastinal node dissection second highest risk risk operations like mediastinal tumor resection thoracic aneurysm repair sympathectomy surgeries take place lower neck mediastinum lead chylothorax chylotharax trauma surgery also described central line placement pacemaker implantation embolization pulmonary arteriovenous malformation blunt trauma chest region another cause chylothorax occurred blast injuries even simple injuries coughing main mechanism chylothorax leaking chyle thoracic duct usually caused disturbance affecting structural integrity thoracic example placement central venous catheter potentially disrupt drainage lymph subclavian veins followed thoracic duct resulting disturbances cause pressure thoracic duct increase soon collateral channels form eventually drain trauma affecting thoracic duct common disturbing mechanism whether chylothorax occurs left right pleural space consequence thoracic ducts anatomic location body depends level duct injured thoracic duct injured fifth thoracic vertebra leftsided chylothorax conversely thoracic duct injury level lead formation rightsided chylothoraces commonly occur right pleural space leftsided bilateral chylothoraces less common occur cases case cancer invasion thoracic duct collateral lymph channels obstruct lymph case mediastinal lymphadenopathy enlarged lymph node causes compression lymphatic channels thoracic duct impedes centripetal drainage flow lymph edges lung parenchyma pleural surfaces causes chyle ooze extensively pleural cavity leading chylothorax case yellow nail syndrome lymphedema chylothorax caused hypoplasia dilation lymph vessels rare cases like hepatic chylothorax chylous ascites crosses diaphragm pleural cavity idiopathic cases like genetic disorders mechanism three liters chyle easily drain pleural space chest xrays detect chylothorax appears dense homogeneous area obscures costophrenic cardiophrenic angles ultrasounds also detect chylothorax appears echoic region isodense septation loculation however neither normal chest xray ultrasound differentiate chylothorax type pleural cisterna chyli found thoracic mri making possible confirm chylothorax however mri ideal method scan thorax rarely used another diagnostic technique conventional lymphangiography rarely used since equally sensitive yet less invasive techniques available identify chylothorax lymphangiography procedures use contrast dye agent lipiodol injected lymphatic vessels chylothorax shows images identifies source leak thoracic another commonly used type lymphogram nuclear lymphoscintigraphy procedure requires human pentetic acid labeled injected subcutaneous lesions sides dorsum foot two images anterior posterior obtained using gammaray cameras test used integrated lowdose ctscan photon emission get images precise pleural effusion detected thoracentesis fluid chylothorax may appear milky serous serosanguineous appearance fluid milky exclude chylothorax consideration since chyle rich triglycerides pleural effusion rich triglycerides mgdl confirms presence chylothorax pleural effusion low triglyceride content mgdl virtually excludes pleural effusion contains triglycerides mgdl analysis lipoprotein content pleural effusion evaluate chylomicrons procedure detects chylomicrons fluid confirms chylothorax chylothoraces typically exudative often contain high number lymphocytes low levels enzyme lactate dehydrogenase however atypical chylothoraces occur transudative milky appearance pleural fluid insufficient confirm diagnosis chylothorax pseudochylothoraces empyemas mimic conversely absence milky appearance mean chylothorax present may instead appear serous treatment chylothorax depends underlying cause may include dietary modification medication prevent chyle formation including somatostatinoctreotide midodrine sirolimus pleurodesis surgical treatment including ligation thoracic duct pleurovenous pleuroperitoneal shunting thoracic duct initial treatment chylothorax usually drainage fluid pleural space may necessary restore lung function compromised pressure exerted chyle large chylothoraces may need nutritional support due nutrients lost primarily correct protein electrolyte losses affected person hemodynamically nutritionally stable specific treatment conservative treatment changing diet include fewer longchain fatty acids particular free fatty acids since chyle formed acids chyle formation reduce allowing defects heal spontaneously however lead fat deficiency malnutrition time possible response drawback venous fat hemorrhage small mediumchain fatty acids given diet longchain fatty acids given intravenously thoracentesis indwelling catheter use home generally used drain malignant neoplastic chylothorax present treatment radiotherapy andor chemotherapy warranted surgery indicated case posttraumatic iatrogenic refractory treatments cases surgery reduces mortality one invasive surgical intervention called thoracic duct ligation involves closing thoracic surgical pleurodesis another option undertaken affected person fails respond conservative treatment candidate surgical another treatment option pleuroperitoneal shunting creating communication channel pleural space peritoneal cavity since surgery close leak reliable talc pleurodesis recommended case study people refractory malignant chylothorax due lymphoma resulted success affected chemical pleurodesis option since leaking lymphatic fluids stopped irritating lungs chest wall resulting sterile inflammation causes lung chest wall fuse together thus preventing lymphatic fluids leaking pleural morbidity mortality rates associated chylothorax declined treatments improved malignant bilateral chronic chylothoraces inferior prognosis currently mortality morbidity rates treated cases postoperative treated conservatively mortality rates approach complications chylothorax include malnutrition immunosuppression dehydration respiratory severity
