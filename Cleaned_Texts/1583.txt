mary osborn born loréalunesco women science awardwinning english cell biologist stopped running active laboratory scientific staff max planck institute biophysical chemistry göttingen osborn established two techniques frequently used cell biologists pioneered molecular weight determination proteins using sds immunofluorescence osborn also used immunofluorescence microscopy method work details eukaryotic cytoskeleton small differences intermediate filament constituents helped distinguish differentiated cells also found intermediate filament immunofluorescence differences normal versus cancer mary osborn prominent spokesperson women osborn born darlington december osborn completed high school education cheltenham ladies college university education newnham college cambridge university graduated mathematics physics received masters biophysics pennsylvania state university phd mutagenesis nonsense mutations bacteria awarded pennsylvania state university mary osborn carried postdoctoral research laboratory james watson harvard conducted research laboratory molecular biology cambridge uk moving cold spring harbor laboratory osborn married husband klaus weber july weber osborn moved göttingen max planck institute biophysical chemistry weber director osborn received staff appointment appointed honorary professor university mary osborn klaus weber wrote classic paper biochemistry determination molecular weight protein via sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis published journal biological knew shapiro vinuela maisel shown electrophoresis proteins along sodium dodecyl sulfate sds polyacrylamide gels page could separate tested polypeptide chains molecular see method applied proteins various sizes shapes osborn weber took known proteins including globular filamentous proteins analyzed via sds page plotted logarithms molecular weights electrophoretic results showed convincingly good resolution fact estimate molecular weight obtained within day together small amount protein needed makes method strongly competitive others commonly method used extensively biochemists kinds studies involving protein purification identification part later osborn weber pioneered fluorescent antibody staining cellular substructures major technique called indirect immunofluorescence developing method tagged microtubules specific antibodies used fluorescentlytagged secondary antibodies antibodies first set antibodies light locations microtubules began work germany cytoskeleton heavily researched microtubules microfilaments known established microtubules always reacted antibodies tubulins microfilaments always reacted antibodies actin course studies also found intermediate filaments slightly thicker microfilaments unreactive actin developed new antibodies proteins microtubules intermediate filaments microfilaments use reagents examining many types many antibodies licensed companies commercial klaus osborn used method study elements cytoskeleton eukaryotic cells two dimensions three osborn extensively studied microtubules intermediate filaments microfilaments nuclear proteins well proteins associate structures osborn klaus shown conclusively intermediate filaments different types cells different related distinguished using soon thereafter laboratory showed many tumors differ matching normal tissue protein details intermediate filaments shown also found intermediate filament composition osborn weber pioneered diagnostic classification tumor types using specific cytoskeletal elements determined via immunofluorescence microscopy methods widely applied numerous clinical studies muscular dystrophy mary osborn returned europe years us surprised find european science technology engineering mathematics stem fields opened doors women experienced america quoted article science effect womens role germany still kinder kuche kirch children kitchen written protest letter response editorial nature claimed child care issues chiefly responsible leaky pipeline women science woman without children experienced gender discrimination early career seen differential treatment men women science later find argument convincing appalled find europe collected little data rates success women science partly osborn objected situation european commission ec appointed cochair working group investigate status european women scientists scientists training employment prepare outcome european technology assessment network etan report women science published identified number reasons women dropped science served blueprint europeans wished fix noted still leaky pipeline women scientists given great deal thought women taught act grow may impact career decisions interview osborn said deciding whether accept new challenges remark diane britten years ago times proved helpful asked something women tend say men say learned say summing advice charge sciences universities industry said one get argument across wasteful expensive unfair educate train large numbers female scientists use talents job market provide equal access top httpsenwikipediaorgwikimaryosborn
