preventing lessening hepatic injury administered within hours research suggests rate liver toxicity approximately acetylcysteine administered within hours although iv oral acetylcysteine equally effective indication oral administration generally poorly tolerated due higher dosing required overcome low oral foul taste odour higher incidence adverse effects taken mouth particularly nausea vomiting prior pharmacokinetic studies acetylcysteine consider acetylation reason low bioavailability oral acetylcysteine identical bioavailability cysteine however people given intravenous acetylcysteine show severe anaphylaxislike allergic reaction may include extreme breathing difficulty due bronchospasm decrease blood pressure rash angioedema sometimes also nausea repeated doses intravenous acetylcysteine cause allergic reactions progressively worsen people several studies found anaphylaxislike reaction occur often people given intravenous acetylcysteine despite serum levels
