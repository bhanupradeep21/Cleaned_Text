covert facial recognition unconscious recognition familiar faces people prosopagnosia individuals express phenomenon unaware recognizing faces people seen joachim bodamer created term prosopagnosia individuals disorder ability overtly recognize faces discoveries made showing people disorder ability covertly recognize faces two types prosopagnosia congenital acquired congenital prosopagnosia inability recognize faces without history brain damage acquired prosopagnosia caused damage right occipitaltemporal region brain theorized right cerebral hemisphere involved facial recognition theory supported many although ability overt facial recognition inhibited patients prosopagnosia many studies done show individuals may ability recognize familiar faces covertly experiments used behavioral physiological measures order demonstrate covert facial recognition common physiological measure used measure autonomic activity using skinconductance responses scr show larger response individuals prosopagnosia shown pictures familiar faces compared pictures unfamiliar many theories reside topic cognitive facial recognition first theory contradiction prosopagnosia covert recognition prosopagnosia inability recognize faces believed stem damage ventral route visual system whereas covert recognition shown people lost ability recognize faces implying intact ventral limbic structure projecting theory two states observed developmental cases prosopagnosia proposed grueter developmental prosopagnosia severe face processing impairment without brain damage visual thinking dysfunction sometimes run families indications may genetic reason disorder theory thought rely activation face representations created time normal contradicting last theory affective valence developmental prosopagnosia theory states individuals may processing faces affective dimensions feelings emotions rather familiarity dimensions previous occasions next dualroute models theory proposed bauer states covert recognition seen people endured time normal face processing actually getting condition two different types covert recognition behavioral physiological behavioral covert recognition measured reaction time occurs within cognitive pathway consisting face recognition units frus personality identity units pins semantic information units physiological covert recognition measured scr second route mediates reactions familiar faces theory explained disconnection frus may face recognition system intact disconnected higher system enabling conscious parallel distributing process theory proposes would easier relearn previous known faces rather learn new ones process three steps distributed information represented memory knowledge things stored explicitly connected nodes learning occur gradual changes connections damaged networks less effective zeroing weight connection connection embedded still faintly making easier theories include one proposed bauer states neurological routes mediate overt recognition theory went bruce youngs theory using three sequential stages order stage affect next overt mediation three stages familiarity occupation name one first studies diversion pathways overt covert facial processing done bauer study basis studies literature conducted topic prosopagnosia covert processing three larger studies performed eventrelated potential studies done subjects clear psychological disorders face study using faces string characters trial faces familiar novel faces shown faces shown subjects asked familiar faces shown first trial without string letters resulted higher load results overt recognition longer reaction time high load tasks led ability recall far fewer faces task second study directly covert facial recognition prosopagnosia study faces taken set faces hair background removed first task pictures shown half actors politicians face shown subject asked politician actor control prosopagnosia patients able identify faces therefore reaction time compared second task say faces famous set forty famous forty nonfamous prosopagnosia subjects little ability make distinction third task also showed forty famous faces instead random string written names used faces remained one decided upon match name covert recognition present two tasks first task meant prime lead fact prime may impairment scr tests often used test covert facial processing none experiments displayed significant several problems may damage ability properly perceive faces many dont effects covert overt recognition faces many problems effect overt recognition faces leave covert recognition intact prosopagnosia disorder causes inability use overt facial people suffering prosopagnosia often identify whose face looking usually show signs covert recognition seen ability accurately guess information forced choice patients unable identify faces people know still able accurately guess information owners faces professions asked confident answers patients would often give low ratings confidence despite high accuracy shows unable overtly recognize face still able recall information owners despite fact cant identify prosopagnosia patients unable overtly recognize faces patients capgras delusion unable covertly recognize faces people suffering capgras delusion able properly identify face lack covert recognition normally evoked familiar face delusion set patients would normally sensation familiarity heightened response faces recognize delusion set patients longer feel face looking familiar cant access feelings normally held owner face despite fact properly identify face belongs condition causes patients capgras delusion believe person replaced lookalike httpsenwikipediaorgwikicovertfacialrecognition
