subtypes hiv include two main subtypes known hiv type hiv type subtypes distinct genetic differences associated different epidemiological patterns clinical characteristics exhibits genetic relation viruses indigenous chimpanzees gorillas inhabit west africa viruses affiliated viruses present sooty mangabey vulnerable west african viruses stratified groups n p among group viruses prevalent infecting nearly people living hiv responsible global aids pandemic group subdivided subtypes based genetic sequence data certain subtypes known increased virulence drug resistance different medications used treat hiv viruses generally considered less virulent less transmissible group viruses although also known still cause aids one prevailing challenges pursuit effective management hiv viruss pronounced genetic variability rapid viral common pathogenic strain virus approximately million infections occur scientists divide major group group two minor groups namely groups n possibly group p group believed represent independent transmission simian immunodeficiency virus siv humans excluding subtypes within specific complete genome sequence contains total open reading frames orfs

kits also detect eight known groups designated h groups b pandemic group found mainly west africa also spread angola mozambique brazil india europe us despite presence globally group b mainly confined west closely related siv endemic sooty mangabeys cercocebus atys atys sivsmm monkey species inhabiting forests littoral west africa phylogenetic analyses show virus closely related two strains spread

living country human infection diagnosis made patient symptoms positive blood work indicating individual hiv multispot rapid test currently fda approved method differentiation two viruses recommendations screening diagnosis hiv always use enzyme immunoassays detect group screening combination test positive followed indeterminate western blot followup test amino acid testing must performed distinguish infection according nih differential diagnosis considered person west african descent sexual contact shared needles person west africa highest risk origin viruscitation needed found less pathogenic mechanism clearly defined difference however transmission rate much lower viruses lead aids infected individuals mutate develop drug disease monitoring patients includes clinical evaluation cell counts treatment includes antiretroviral therapy art nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nrtis protease inhibitors pi nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nnrtis addition coreceptor antagonists fusion choice initial andor secondline therapy yet defined appears resistant nnrtis intrinsically may sensitive nrtis though mechanism poorly understood protease inhibitors shown variable effect integrase inhibitors also evaluated combination regimens listed therapies looked well also showing variable effect depending types therapies combined mechanisms clearly understood known use different pathways patterns making algorithms used evaluate resistanceassociated mutations irrelevant virus contracted individually contracted together referred coinfection seems lower mortality rates less severe symptoms slower progression aids alone coinfection coinfection however largely dependent virus contracted first tends compete disease progression coinfection seems growing problem globally time progresses cases identified west african countries well cases study found individuals contract tend slower rate disease progression suggesting immune response may limit proliferation pregnant mother exposed screening performed normal present number perinatal art drugs may given prophylactic lower risk mothertochild transmission child born standard sixweek regimen prophylactics initiated breast milk may also contain viral particles therefore breastfeeding strictly advised rapid evolution hiv attributed high mutation rate early stages mutation evolution appears neutral due absence evolutionary response however examining virus several different individuals convergent mutations found appearing viral populations hiv evolution within host influences factors including virus setpoint viral load virus low setpoint viral load host live longer greater probability virus transmitted another individual virus high setpoint viral load host live shorter amount time lower probability virus transmitted another hiv evolved maximize number infections hosts tendency selection favor intermediate strains shows hiv undergoes stabilizing selectioncitation needed virus also evolved become infectious hosts three different mechanisms allow hiv evolve population one includes continuous battle evolve overcome immune system slows evolution hiv shifts virus focus towards population level another includes slow evolution viral load due viral load mutations neutral within host last mechanism focuses virus preference transmit founding viral strains stored early stages infection preference virus transmit stored genome copies explains hiv evolves quickly within host hiv evolving toward milder form still awfully long way longer severe variants still isolates resistance antiretroviral drugs arise natural selection genetic mutations tracked analyzed stanford hiv drug resistance database international aids society publish lists
