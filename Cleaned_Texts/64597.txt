zoo hypothesis speculates assumed behavior existence technologically advanced extraterrestrial life reasons refrain contacting earth one many theoretical explanations fermi paradox hypothesis states alien life intentionally avoids communication earth allow natural evolution sociocultural development avoiding interplanetary contamination similar people observing animals zoo hypothesis seeks explain apparent absence extraterrestrial life despite generally accepted plausibility hence reasonable expectation variant zoo hypothesis suggested former mit haystack observatory scientist john allen ball laboratory hypothesis humanity subjected experiments earth serving giant aliens might example choose allow contact human species passed certain technological political andor ethical standards alternatively aliens may withhold contact humans force contact upon possibly sending spacecraft alieninhabited planet regard reluctance initiate contact could reflect sensible desire minimize risk alien society advanced remotesensing technologies may conclude direct contact neighbors confers added risks without added benefit related laboratory hypothesis zoo hypothesis extended zoo keepers subjecting humanity experiments hypothesis ball describes morbid overlooking possibility experiments may altruistic ie designed accelerate pace civilization overcome tendency intelligent life destroy species sufficiently developed establish contact zoo zoo hypothesis assumes first whenever conditions life exist evolve secondly many places life exist large number extraterrestrial cultures also assumes extraterrestrials great reverence independent natural evolution development particular assuming intelligence physical process acts maximize diversity systems accessible fundamental motivation zoo hypothesis would premature contact would unintelligently reduce overall diversity paths universe could take ideas perhaps plausible relatively universal cultural legal policy among plurality extraterrestrial civilizations necessitating isolation respect civilizations earthlike stages development universe without hegemonic power random single civilizations independent principles would make contact makes crowded universe clearly defined rules seem plurality extraterrestrial cultures however theory may break uniformity motive concept would take single extraterrestrial civilization decide act contrary imperative within human range detection undone probability violation hegemony increases number idea however becomes plausible civilizations tend evolve similar cultural standards values regard contact much like convergent evolution earth independently evolved eyes numerous civilizations follow lead particularly distinguished civilization first civilization among hypothesis problem universal ethical homogeneity solved acquisition persistent advanced level civilization requires overcoming many problems selfdestruction war overpopulation pollution scarcity managing solve problems could guide civilization adopt responsible wise behavior otherwise would disappear involving solutions fermi paradox zoo hypothesis contact would possible humanity acquired certain level civilization maturity responsibility wisdom otherwise would become potential threatcitation needed modified zoo hypothesis possible solution fermi paradox time
