phobias natural environment phobias usually develop ages reflective normal development additionally specific phobias prevalent children ages situational phobias typically found older children various methods used treat phobias methods include systematic desensitization progressive relaxation virtual reality modeling medication hypnotherapy past several decades psychologists researchers developed effective behavioral pharmacological technological interventions treatment virtual reality treatments produce similar effects vivo exposure another efficacious therapy great treating phobias although virtual reality great treating phobias treatment work every phobia treatment positive effects depending phobia vivo would another ideal treatment use virtual reality vivo exposure great way reduce fear overtime actually preferred trying treat anxiety fear related problems cognitive behavioral therapy evidencebased treatment help phobias talk therapy used alone along therapies cbt help manage stressful situations respond better therapy requires person honest confront feelings cognitive behavioral therapy cbt beneficial allowing person challenge dysfunctional thoughts beliefs mindful feelings recognize fear irrational cbt may occur group setting gradual desensitization treatment cbt often successful provided person willing endure one clinical trial people longer phobic reaction successful cbt research uk suggested childhood phobias single session cbt evidence supports eye movement desensitization reprocessing emdr effective treating effectiveness treating complex traumarelated phobias empirically primarily used treat posttraumatic stress disorder emdr demonstrated ease phobia symptoms following specific trauma fear dogs following dog systematic desensitization process people seeking help slowly become accustomed phobia ultimately overcome traditional systematic desensitization involves person exposed object afraid time fear discomfort become overwhelming controlled exposure anxietyprovoking stimulus key effectiveness exposure therapy treatment specific phobias shown humor excellent alternative traditional systematic desensitization humor systematic desensitization involves series treatment activities elicit humor feared previously learned progressive muscle relaxation procedures used activities become difficult progressive muscle relaxation helps people relax exposure feared stimulus virtual reality therapy another technique helps phobic people confront feared object uses virtual reality generate scenes may possible ethical physical world equally effective traditional exposure offers additional advantages include controlling scenes phobic person endure exposure might handle medications treatment option often utilized combination cbt cbt tolerated effective medications help regulate apprehension fear particular fearful object situation various medication options available social anxiety disorder agoraphobia use medications specific phobias besides limited role benzodiazepines currently established guidelines due minimal supporting evidence antidepressant medications selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors snris monoamine oxidase inhibitors maois may helpful cases ssris snris act serotonin neurotransmitter brain serotonins positive impacts mood antidepressant may offered prescribed treatment option social anxiety ssris sertraline paroxetine fluvoxamine snri venlafaxine fda approval similar medications may offered sedatives benzodiazepines clonazepam alprazolam another therapeutic option help people relax reducing amount anxiety benzodiazepines may useful acute treatment severe symptoms riskbenefit ratio usually goes longterm use phobic class medication recently shown effective used negative behaviours excessive alcohol despite positive finding benzodiazepines used caution due side effects risk developing dependence withdrawal symptoms specific phobia example phobic stimulus one regularly encountered flying short course may provided beta blockers propranolol another therapeutic option particularly performance subtype social anxiety disorder may stop stimulating effects adrenaline sweating increased heart rate elevated blood pressure tremors feeling pounding taking betablockers phobic event symptoms decreased making event less frightening betablockers effective generalized social anxiety hypnotherapy another effective therapy uses hypnosis help manage anxiety stress therapy help people gain control hypnotherapy used alone conjunction systematic desensitization treat hypnotherapy underlying cause phobia may uncovered phobia may caused past event person remember phenomenon known repression mind represses traumatic memories conscious mind person ready deal hypnotherapy may also eliminate conditioned responses occur different situations people first placed hypnotic trance extremely relaxed unconscious retrieved state makes people open suggestion helps bring desired consciously addressing old memories helps individuals understand event see less threateninglycitation needed outcomes vary widely among phobic anxiety disorders possibility remission occurs without intervention relapses common response treatment well remission relapse rates impacted severity individuals disorder well long experiencing symptoms example social anxiety disorder social phobia majority individuals experience remission within first couple years symptom onset without specific treatment hand agoraphobia individuals seen reach complete remission without study looking year remission rates anxiety disorders found multiple anxieties less likely experience majority develop specific phobia first experience symptoms childhood often individuals experience symptoms periodically periods remission complete remission occurs however specific phobias continue adulthood likely experience chronic course specific phobias older adults linked decrease quality life specific phobias increased risk suicide greater impairment found multiple response treatment relatively high many seek treatment due lack access ability avoid

greek φόβος phóbos meaning aversion fear morbid fear regular system naming specific phobias uses prefixes based greek word object fear plus suffix phobia benjamin rushs satyrical text different
