approximately two thirds deficiency also evidence cognitive benefits deficiency patients ketogenic diet parents report improved energy alertness balance coordination especially diet started early childhood ketogenic diet diet high fat low protein carbohydrates calories obtained fat since diet low carbohydrates body gets little glucose normally main energy source fat diet converted liver ketone bodies causes build ketones blood stream called ketosis ketone bodies transported across bloodbrain barrier means protein thus serve alternative fuel brain glucose ketogenic diets proven effective control seizures relieve movement disorders many deficiency patients patients respond well others addition critical symptoms including cognitive deficits certain movement difficulties tend persist
