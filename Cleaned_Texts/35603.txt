lists categories hypoxia refers low oxygen conditions normally gas atmosphere oxygen partial pressure oxygen atmosphere total barometric water oxygen levels much lower approximately ppm good quality water fluctuate locally depending presence photosynthetic organisms relative distance surface oxygen air diffuse across partial pressure atmospheric hypoxia occurs naturally high altitudes total atmospheric pressure decreases altitude increases causing lower partial pressure oxygen defined hypobaric hypoxia oxygen remains total gas mixture differing hypoxic hypoxia percentage oxygen air blood
