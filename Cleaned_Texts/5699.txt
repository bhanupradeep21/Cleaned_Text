pubarche ˈpjuːˌbɑːrki refers first appearance pubic hair puberty also marks beginning one physical changes puberty occur independently complete puberty early stage sexual maturation also known adrenarche marked characteristics including development pubic hair axillary hair adult apocrine body odor acne increased oiliness hair skin encyclopedia child adolescent health corresponds sexual maturity rating pubarche defining development pubic hair occurs mean age years females range years years males range years describes pubarches physical manifestation vellus hair labia base see table entirety sexual maturity rating description study researched whether thelarche pathway beginning puberty breast development alone pubarche pathway beginning puberty pubic hair development alone represents true pubertal development study observational longitudinal cohort study study cohort limited group black white girls seen annually ten years concluded research pubarche may represent true pubertal tanner scale remains gold standard determining pubarche clinical settings scale primarily used physicians nurses trained healthcare providers part physical examination assess stage puberty children adolescents though cases stage puberty average beginning pubarche varies due many factors including environmental exposures nourishment weight race ethnicity geographical location first often transient pubic hair resulting adrenarche may appear ages beginning puberty chemical toxins environment one many factors influencing adolescent development early people accidentally exposed polybrominated biphenyls study conducted childbearing women exposed toxin baby girls reaching menarche age years compared girls low exposure reaching menarche age every day life people exposed various number pesticides large amount found disruptive endocrine system although dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt metabolite dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethane dde banned united states countries around world still using geographical location zones also plays part timing pubarche study done different zones nigeria found males northeast northwest southwest earlier timing pubarche compared males southeast whereas females delayed pubarche southeast regions within regions socioeconomic classes also taken consideration found households higher economic status posed increased risk premature early onset pubarche possibly related food easily accessible nutrition vital adolescent development failure meeting average nutritional needs calcium vitamin bone may result growth stunt overnourishment andor living sedentary lifestyle lead obesity also affect adolescent dietary guidelines americans declared females ages year meet caloric intake females ages years meet caloric intake calories premature pubarche precocious pubarche refers appearance pubic hair age females age premature pubarche one marker incomplete partial dissociated precocious puberty incomplete puberty refers premature development one secondary sexual characteristic premature thelarche premature premature indicated elevated levels steroids naturally produced body eg dheas common cause premature pubarche premature pubarche linked adrenarcheal androgen levels dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate dheas however premature pubarche may also arise independently adrenarche premature pubarche subset precocious puberty divide true precocious puberty includes complete central precocious puberty incomplete puberty subsets premature thelacrche premature pubarche isolated adrenarche increase adrenal androgen production central diseasecausing conditions excluded term isolated premature pubarche used describe unexplained development pubic hair early age people without hormonal physical changes puberty potential indicators premature puberty also considered diagonosing premature pubarche hyperandrogenemia high levels androgen blood virilization premature pubarche also symptom hormone pubertyrelated medical conditions including polycystic ovary syndrome classic nonclassic congenital adrenal premature pubarche identified clinical examination primarily involves assessment signs indicating elevation androgens body well overall body growth bone age factors appear normal considered simple premature pubarche recommended monitor progression distinguish central precious puberty adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome factors especially body growth bone age appear increase faster usual tests various hormones may ordered tests may include testosterone dheas synacthen scientists traditionally thought premature pubarche significant effect body reflected lack scientific consensus respect treatment premature pubarche however shown clinically could forerunner metabolic syndrome cause clinical ovarian androgen excess hyperinsulinemia adolescence studies shown females premature pubarche lower birth weight obtained reduced height adults early onset puberty shorter duration puberty ongoing study metformin therapy females goal improve final height use metformin shown clinically prevent ovarian hyperandrogenism development females premature pubarche randomized control trial studied effect metformin mg daily months compared placebo results show abnormalities regarding insulini sensitivity serum androgens lipids total truncal fat mass lean body mass reversed within months untreated group data continued deviate normal range later cohort study replicated delayed pubarche caused numerous aspects include insufficient hormones medical genetic conditions ie turner syndrome hypogonadotropic hypogonadism chemicals interfere hormones body young males genetic differences impacts function enzymes affect steroids eliminated urine influence development pubic hair impact physical appearance person young females development breasts pubic hair occur different times may experience breast development start pubic hair growth vice versa therefore order determine delayed pubarche health issue looking signs puberty happening specific timing important note determination underlying cause delayed pubarche done specific tests antibodies karyotype hormone levels ie cortisol thyroid stimulating adrenal insufficiency lifethreatening medical condition adrenal gland damaged leads enough hormones produced include glucocorticoids mineralcorticoids types hormones crucial regulation many functions body enough levels hormones produced adrenal glands lead primary adrenal insufficiency delayed pubarche expected young individuals medical condition due lack hormones aid pubic hair growth therefore signs symptoms adrenal insufficiency present fatigue weakness abdominal pain history autoimmune disease adrenal insufficiency taken consideration underlying cause delayed turner syndrome genetic condition affects nerves brain lead certain physical clinical features greater chance certain diseases shortness height abnormal heartbeat individuals turner syndrome sign growth pubic hair sometimes delayed even absent especially females turner syndrome premature ovarian failure one possible explanation ovaries important adrenal gland regulation dehydropiandrosterone role dhea transformed various androgens play crucial role pubarche therefore much high levels androgens may required order meet levels androgens comparison ovaries work properly another cause delayed puberty males females hypogonadotropic condition male female genitalia produce little none sex hormones temporary condition adolescents usually caused various stresses including disease states asthma ulcerative colitis sickle cell specifically males condition result low testosterone levels low levels testosterone cause levels hormones rise luteinizing hormone lh folliclestimulating hormone fsh gonadotropinreleasing hormone hypogonadotropic hypogonadism prevalent females usually develops conditions anorexia nervosa female individual participates abundant amount exercise situations decreasing body fat estrogen production secretion also decrease resulting delayed puberty delayed pubarche health conditions cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism include ovarian failure autoimmune diseases ovaries regardless whether hypogonadotropic hypogonadism acquired congenital males females always important providers conduct detailed family social histories lack secondary sources provide standardized procedures guidelines follow treating delayed pubarche many studies used find formulations work best males females males diagnosed constitutional delay puberty growth cdpg shortcourse testosterone low doses used initiate puberty females diagnosed cdpg shortcourse estrogen low doses used initiate testosterone available via oral route intramuscular injection im im preferred method administration oral testosterone shown liver toxicity side effects estrogen available via oral route im however oral estrogen preferred method upon initiation treatment thereafter adolescent must monitored pubertal development includes breast development females enlargement testicles provider make clinical judgment stop treatment monitor development adolescent therapy seems guideline standard treatment hypogonadotropic hypogonadism however table table shows different formulations treatments available well initial doses adult estrogen progesterone formulation also known oral contraceptive hormonal birth control used induce puberty transdermal oral formulation testosterone also preferred induce puberty males mg daily days month patients turner syndrome ts treatment formulations differ initiation dose fraction adult dose cases also differ different formulations available females doses started low slowly titrated oral formulations preferred pose risk firstpass metabolism affecting normal
