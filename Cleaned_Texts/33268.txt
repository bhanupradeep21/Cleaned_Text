nasal polyps np noncancerous growths within nose symptoms include trouble breathing nose loss smell decreased taste post nasal drip runny growths saclike movable nontender though face pain may occasionally typically occur nostrils complications may include sinusitis broadening exact cause may related chronic inflammation lining occur commonly among people allergies cystic fibrosis aspirin sensitivity certain polyp represents overgrowth mucous diagnosis may accomplished looking ct scan may used determine number polyps help plan treatment typically steroids often form nasal effective surgery may condition often recurs following surgery thus continued use steroid nasal spray often antihistamines may help symptoms change underlying antibiotics required treatment unless infection people currently nasal polyps people develop point often occur age frequent males nasal polyps described since time ancient symptoms polyps include nasal congestion sinusitis loss smell thick nasal discharge facial pressure nasal speech mouth recurrent sinusitis result longterm nasal polyps cause destruction nasal bones broadening polyps grow larger eventually prolapse nasal cavity resulting prominent symptoms nasal polyps blockage nasal people nasal polyps due aspirin intolerance often disease known aspirinexacerbated respiratory disease consists asthma chronic nasal polyps along hypersensitivity reaction exact cause nasal polyps however commonly associated conditions cause long term inflammation includes chronic rhinosinusitis asthma aspirin sensitivity cystic various additional diseases associated polyp formation chronic rhinosinusitis common medical condition characterized symptoms sinus inflammation lasting least weeks cause unknown role microorganisms remains unclear classified either without nasal cystic fibrosis cf common cause nasal polyps children therefore child years old nasal polyps tested half people cf experience extensive polyps leading nasal obstruction requiring aggressive true cause nasal polyps unknown thought due recurrent infection polyps arise lining sinuses nasal mucosa particularly region middle meatus becomes swollen due collection extracellular fluid extracellular fluid collection causes polyp formation protrusion nasal cavity sinuses polyps sessile beginning become pedunculated due people nasal polyps due aspirin nsaid sensitivity underlying mechanism due disorders metabolism arachidonic acid exposure cycloxygenase inhibitors aspirin nsaids leads shunting products lipoxygenase pathway leading increased production products cause inflammation airway inflammatory products lead symptoms asthma wheezing well nasal polyp nasal polyps seen physical examination inside nose often detected evaluation symptoms

camera light source nose image projected onto screen office doctor examine nasal passages sinuses greater detail procedure generally painful person given spray decongestant local anesthetic minimize attempts made develop scoring systems determine severity nasal polyps proposed staging systems take account extent polyps seen endoscopic exam number sinuses affected ct imaging staging system partially validated future may useful communicating severity disease assessing treatment response planning two primary types nasal polyps ethmoidal antrochoanal ethmoidal polyps arise ethmoid sinuses extend middle meatus nasal cavity antrochoanal polyps usually arise maxillary sinus extend nasopharynx represent nasal however antrochoanal polyps common children comprising onethird polyps population ethmoidal polyps usually smaller multiple antrochoanal polyps usually single ct scan show full extent polyp may fully appreciated physical examination alone imaging also required planning surgical ct scan nasal polyp generally attenuation hounsfield units similar mucus nasal polyps may histologic examination nasal polyps consist hyperplastic edematous excess fluid connective tissue seromucous glands cells representing inflammation mostly neutrophils eosinophils polyps virtually neurons therefore tissue makes polyp tissue sensation polyp early stages surface nasal polyp covered normal respiratory epithelium later undergoes metaplastic change squamous type epithelium constant irritation inflammation submucosa shows large intercellular spaces filled serous disorders mimic appearance nasal polyps considered mass seen exam examples include encephalocele glioma inverted papilloma early biopsy recommended unilateral nasal polyps rule serious conditions cancer inverted papilloma fungal benign mixed inflammation inflammatory nasal polyp extranodal nkt cell lymphoma nasal type lymphoma cells typically monotonous folded nuclei indistinct nucleoli moderate amount first line treatment nasal polyps topical steroids decrease inflammation sinus mucosa decrease size polyps improve topical preparations preferred form nasal spray often ineffective people many polyps steroids mouth often provide drastic symptom relief taken long periods time due side effects steroids shrink size swelling polyp people often recurrence symptoms steroids decongestants shrink polyps decrease swelling provide antibiotics recommended person cooccurring bacterial people nasal polyps caused aspirin nsaids avoidance medications help symptoms aspirin desensitization also shown endoscopic sinus surgery advocated popularized professor stammberger often effective people providing rapid symptom relief endoscopic sinus surgery minimallyinvasive done entirely nostril help camera surgery considered complete nasal obstruction uncontrolled runny nose nasal deformity caused polyps continued symptoms despite medical surgery serves remove polyps well surrounding inflamed mucosa open obstructed nasal passages clear sinuses removes obstruction caused polyps allows medications saline irrigations topical steroids become suggested one main objectives sinus surgery polyps allow delivery steroids areas sinuses polyps develop namely ethmoid sinuses specially designed long nozzles developed use postoperatively deliver steroids areas sinus surgery surgery lasts approximately minutes done general local people tolerate surgery without much pain though vary person person person expect discomfort congestion drainage nose first days surgery complications endoscopic sinus surgery rare include bleeding damage structures area including eye many physicians recommend course oral steroids prior surgery reduce mucosal inflammation decrease bleeding surgery help visualization nasal steroid sprays used preventatively surgery delay prevent people often recurrence polyps even following surgery therefore continued follow combination medical surgical management preferred treatment nasal nasal polyps resulting chronic rhinosinusitis affect approximately nasal polyps occur frequently men women common people get older increasing drastically age people chronic rhinosinusitis also allergies estimated people sensitivity aspirin develop nasal people cystic fibrosis nasal polyps noted httpsenwikipediaorgwikinasalpolyp
