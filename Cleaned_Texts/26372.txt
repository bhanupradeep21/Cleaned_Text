uterotonic also known oxytocic ecbolic type medication used induce contraction greater tonicity uterus uterotonics used induce labor reduce postpartum labor induction third trimester pregnancy may required due medical necessity may desired social reasons generally labor induction indicated risk carrying pregnancy outweighs risk delivering reason include limited pregnancies prolonged prelabor rupture fetal membranes concerns health safety mother andor child multiple techniques available stimulate uterine contractions including mechanical pharmacological alternative medicine methods initiate contractions prior spontaneous onset postpartum hemorrhage also known pph defined loss ml greater blood within hours giving birth one leading causes maternal mortality women adolescent girls worldwide mothers lowresource countries larger risk compared mothers higherresource countries occurring women giving birth situations considered emergencies require quick adequate response proper

stimulations uterine contractions among others roles uterine muscle contractions induced via gprotein pathway stemming oxytocin receptor oxtr binding activation site oxytocin binds associated receptors uterus cascade initiated results increase calcium subsequently increase muscle contractions release oxytocin helps facilitate stronger contractions labor aid delivery fetus additionally pregnancy uterine muscles increased concentration oxytocin receptors leading increased response oxytocin oxytocin commonly used agent labor induction given intravenously since easily degraded body given orally giving oxytocin important monitor mother fetus specifically mothers uterine activity fetal heart rate common side effects oxytocin include tachysystole hyponatremia hypotension tachysystole increased rate uterine contractions occurs managed lowering dosage oxytocin hyponatremia decreased concentration sodium body result increased fluids occurs due oxytocins similar structure vasopressin antidiuretic hormone acts retain water body hypotension low blood pressure also common side effect due oxytocins ability relax smooth muscle vessels comparison women spontaneous labor women induced labor oxytocin experience longer latent phase however duration labor reaching active labor cervix reached cm duration labor considered common cause postpartum hemorrhage loss muscle tone uterus normally uterus contract constrict blood vessels decrease flow blood prevent bleeding however loss muscle tone see uterine atony increased risk bleeding oxytocin firstline pharmacological step help prevent pph treat oxytocin plays integral role regulation many bodys biological processes especially labor regulation since structure revealed subject intensive analogs produced extensive modification chemical structure residues produced drugs therapies utilized uterotonics similar oxytocin analogues bind oxytocin receptors found along muscles uterus act agonist pregnancy number oxytocin receptors increase reaching peak near completion pregnancy important note analogs oxytocin work receptor agonist uterotonic may oppose uterine contractility carbetocin longacting synthetic analog halflife times longer natural oxytocin used control postpartum hemorrhaging bleeding giving birth heatstable carbetocin require refrigeration unlike oxytocin notable advantage use low medical resource approved use various countries around world approved united canadian german guidelines carbetocin recommended firstline therapy treatment postpartum hemorrhaging notable efficacy used cesarean section carbetocin shown effective oxytocin preventing postpartum hemorrhaging well common side effects carbetocin include vomiting fever hypertension similar side effect profile carbetocin oxytocin listed world health organizations essential medicines demoxytocin another analog oxytocin also used induce labor prostaglandins derived cell membrane phospholipids series enzymatic reactions phospholipase cleaves arachidonic acid membrane phospholipids eventually converted prostaglandins due mechanism prostaglandins presence many areas body allow diverse physiological pathological functions primarily known role mediating inflammation pain swelling redness warmth prostaglandin synthesis target many drugs inhibition aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs prevents inflammatory response also prevent homeostatic functions stomach gi system may lead ulcers prostaglandins pg attributed partaking mechanisms uterine activity labor presence prostaglandins pg receptors increases throughout pregnancy increase expression oxytocin receptors well along increase oxytocin receptors facilitate labor prostaglandins also increase intracellular concentration two pg subtypes e f play fundamental roles labor pg e receptors activated uteroselective stimulate contraction relaxation depending subtype pg f receptors stimulate myometrial contraction although stimulus pg f receptors inferior oxytocin reason injectable pgs used first line treatment adverse effects injectable pgs include hypotension pulmonary misoprostol analogue injectable pg popular choice pph prophylaxis treatment misoprostol easily administered considered safe low cost routes administration include sublingual oral vaginal rectal greatest efficacy sublingual vaginal administration vaginally administered misoprostol improved outcomes inducing labor within twenty four hours compared oxytocin associated uterine misoprostol agonist receptors cause greater stimulation lower concentrations higher concentrations medication suppress carboprost analogue pgf prostaglandin contains oxytocic properties permit longer duration action naturally occurring prostaglandins injectable prostaglandin administered via intramuscularly intramyometrial used clinical practice drug contraindicated reactive airway diseases side effects medication include hypertension hypotension pulmonary hypertension vomiting ergot alkaloids refer set medications derived rye ergot fungus mixed receptor activity work increase uterine muscle unlike oxytocinergic uterotonics ergot alkaloids work primarily agonistic activity serotonin receptors along smooth muscles uterine wall ergometrine also known ergonovine ergometrine first drug isolated rye ergot fungus ergometrine often used alongside oxytocin treat postpartum hemorrhaging found effective standard oxytocin treatment ergometrine relatively quick onset action following intravenous administration one minute duration action averaging minutes rhythmic contracts persist hours following methylergonovine synthetic analog ergometrine primarily used treat postpartum hemorrhaging due uterine similar ergometrine methylergonovine works agonism serotonin receptors found smooth muscles uterine wall partial agonist activity Î±adrenergic receptors well weak antagonistic activity dopamine methylergonovine intravenously administered onset duration action similar ergometrine common side effect hypertension methylergonovine recommended secondline therapy treating postpartum hemorrhaging due uterine atony according american college obstetricians gynecologists acog royal college obstetrics gynecology acog published warning regarding use methylergonovines usage people hypertension suspected caused myocardial infarction ischemia
