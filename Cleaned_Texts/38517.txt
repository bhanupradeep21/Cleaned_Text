aegirosaurus extinct genus platypterygiine ophthalmosaurid ichthyosaurs known late jurassic early cretaceous europe originally named species ichthyosaurus originally described wagner species genus ichthyosaurus leptospondylus species aegirosaurus leptospondylus unstable taxonomic history referred species ichthyosaurus trigonus posthumus later reclassified dubious genus macropterygius past sometimes identified brachypterygius extremus bardet fernández selected complete skeleton private collection neotype species leptospondylus described specimen destroyed world war ii second specimen munich collection referred taxon bardet fernández concluded neotype assigned new genus aegirosaurus name means aegir teutonic god ocean lizard slender within ophthalmosauridae scientists believed aegirosaurus closely related however many subsequent cladistic analyses found closely related sveltonectes probably undorosaurus aegirosaurus lineage found include brachypterygius maiaspondylus nest within platypterygiinae sister taxon aegirosaurus known lower tithonian upper jurassic bavaria germany remains discovered solnhofen limestone formations yielded numerous wellknown fossils

firmly rooted groove external nares nostril openings long thin twolobed one lobe protruding upwards orbits eye socket aegirosaurus medium size ichthyosaur contains ring bony plates known sclerotic ring supported eyeball occupies space within flange projects outwards orbit jugals bones beneath eye sockets short extends front region skull behind orbits extensive length region mandibles lower jaw length postorbitals lie top quadratojugals two pairs bones region almost completely hiding seen side aegirosaurus also bears pair bones known squamosals cheek region bones small triangular seen skull viewed side however two pairs bones skull roof postfrontals supratemporals block reaching temporal fenestrae openings located top skull mandible strongly built angulars one pair rear mandibular bones seen mandibles outer surface extend far forwards surangulars another pair bones aegirosaurus estimated around vertebrae presacral neck trunk vertebrae caudal tail vertebrae tail bent downwards roughly degree angle bend formed four vertebrae caudal vertebrae front behind vertebrae aegirosaurus small ends centra vertebral bodies concave centra twice wide case presacral vertebrae tall long diapophyses projections top part vertebrae flow smoothly neural arches form top part neural canal another set projections parapophyses located lower diapophyses positioned towards front slender scapulae shoulder

known puboischiatic complex lower end puboischiatic complex twice wide upper bone pierced short massively built humeri upper arm bones aegirosaurus lower ends wider upper humerus bears facets three bones lower end two larger ones radius ulna lower arm bones smaller one wedgeshaped intermedium one radius significantly smaller ulna intermedium longer lower upper end additional bone present front flipper located front slightly lower radius bone known extrazeugopodial element accessory digit attached total aegirosaurus six digits foreflipper five primary digits digits contact fourth digit contains individual bones longest hindflippers short femora thigh bones half length humeri smaller lower hip bones two bones tibia fibula shin bones contact lower end femur hind flippers bear four digits three primary digits contacting front hind flippers similar bone configuration bones angular tightly packed together towards flippers tip less tightly packed rounder except fibulae bones flippers lack soft tissue front flippers aegirosaurus closely follows shape bones front flippers elongate narrow strongly concave rear edges hind flippers however extensive soft tissue envelopes making wide caudal fin shape crescent moon present tail bardet fernández reported three types skin impressions neotype wavy texture running parallel body straight fibrous tissue right angle ripples appeared small scales last texture found upper lobe caudal fin would contradict idea ichthyosaurs lacked scales however authors cautioned specimen would studied using microscopes presence scales aegirosaurus could study aegirosaurus sp specimen lene delsett colleagues however found smooth scaleless skin typical tooth morphology wear pattern suggest aegirosaurus belonged pierce ii generalist
