overactive bladder oab common condition frequent feeling needing urinate degree negatively affects persons frequent need urinate may occur day night loss bladder control urge incontinence may occur overactive bladder affects approximately population people overactive bladder conversely urinary incontinence due overactive overactive bladder people condition problems cause overactive bladder risk factors include obesity caffeine poorly controlled diabetes poor functional mobility chronic pelvic pain may worsen people often symptoms long time seeking treatment condition sometimes identified diagnosis based persons signs symptoms requires problems urinary tract infections neurological conditions amount urine passed urination relatively pain urinating suggests problem overactive specific treatment always treatment desired pelvic floor exercises bladder training behavioral methods initially weight loss overweight decreasing caffeine consumption drinking moderate fluids also medications typically antimuscarinic type recommended measures effective behavioral methods however associated side effects particularly older noninvasive electrical stimulation methods appear effective injections botulinum toxin bladder another urinary catheters surgery generally diary track problems help determine whether treatments overactive bladder estimated occur men becomes common studies suggest condition common women especially associated loss bladder economic costs overactive bladder estimated united states billion billion euro overactive bladder characterized group four symptoms urgency urinary frequency nocturia urge incontinence urge incontinence present dry urgency considered hallmark symptom oab clear criteria constitutes urgency studies often use urgency currently defined international continence society ics sudden compelling desire pass urine difficult defer previous definition strong desire void accompanied fear leakage definition address immediacy urge void criticized urinary frequency considered abnormal person urinates eight times day frequency usually monitored person keep voiding diary record urination number episodes varies depending sleep fluid intake medications seven considered normal consistent factorscitation needed nocturia symptom person complains interrupted sleep urge void like urinary frequency component affected similar lifestyle medical factors individual waking events considered abnormal one study finland established two voids per night affecting quality urge incontinence form urinary incontinence characterized involuntary loss urine occurring apparent reason feeling urinary urgency discussed like frequency person track incontinence diary assist diagnosis management symptoms urge incontinence also measured pad tests often used research purposes people urge incontinence also stress incontinence complicate clinical important clinician person overactive bladder reach consensus term urgency common phrases used describe oab include ive got go ive got go go rush think wet hence term fear leakage important concept cause oab unclear indeed may multiple often associated overactivity detrusor urinae muscle pattern bladder muscle contraction observed also possible increased contractile nature originates within urothelium lamina propria abnormal contractions tissue could stimulate dysfunction detrusor whole bladder spasms occur urine drainage bag catheter place catheter may blocked blood thick sediment kink catheter drainage tubing sometimes spasms caused catheter irritating bladder prostate penis spasms controlled medication butylscopolamine although people eventually adjust irritation spasms go diagnosis oab made primarily persons signs symptoms ruling possible causes urodynamics bladder scope ultrasound generally additionally urine culture may done rule infection frequencyvolume chart may maintained cystourethroscopy may done exclude tumor kidney stones underlying metabolic pathologic condition explains symptoms symptoms may considered part disease oabcitation needed psychometrically robust selfcompletion questionnaires generally recognized valid way measuring persons signs symptoms exist single ideal surveys divided two groups general surveys lower urinary tract symptoms surveys specific overactive bladder general questionnaires include american urological association symptom index auasi urogenital distress inventory incontinence impact questionnaire bristol female lower urinary tract symptoms bfluts overactive bladder questionnaires include overactive bladder questionnaire urgency questionnaire uq primary oab symptom questionnaire posq international consultation incontinence questionnaire iciq oab causes similar symptoms conditions urinary tract infection uti bladder cancer benign prostatic hyperplasia bph urinary tract infections often involve pain hematuria blood urine typically absent oab bladder cancer usually includes hematuria include pain associated oab common symptoms oab urgency frequency nocturia may absent bph frequently includes symptoms time voiding well sometimes including pain hematuria usually present diabetes insipidus causes high frequency volume though necessarily urgency controversy classification diagnosis sources classify overactive bladder two different variants wet ie urgent need urinate involuntary leakage dry ie urgent need urinate involuntary leakage wet variants common dry distinction absolute one study suggested many classified dry actually wet people history leakage may oab distinct stress urinary incontinence occur together condition usually known mixed incontinencecitation needed usual first suggested treatment person overactive bladder combination lifestyle changes exercises strengthen persons pelvic floor manage much person drinks day fluid management also medications may helpful three first approaches effective relieving symptoms finally medications noninvasive bahaviourallifestyle strengthening approaches work surgical intervention procedures may nonpharmacologic methods lifestyle modification fluid restriction avoidance caffeine bladder retraining pelvic floor muscle pfm exercise often suggested first line therapy people overactive bladder syndrome bladder training involves teaching sessions person learns gradually increase time urinating safe person often encouraged keep track progress using chart people overactive bladder may see improvements bladder training alone however certainty evidence fewer side side effects associated bladder training compared using medications treatment timed voiding form bladder training uses biofeedback reduce frequency accidents resulting poor bladder control method aimed improving persons control time place frequency urination timed voiding programs involve establishing schedule urination person fills chart voiding leaking patterns appear chart person plan empty bladder would otherwise leak individuals find helpful use vibrating reminder watch help remember use bathroom vibrating watches set go certain intervals specific times throughout day depending bladder training exercise person alter bladders schedule storing emptying pelvic floor muscle training usually consist exercises suggested physiotherapists meant improve persons control pelvic floor muscles order decrease overactive bladder symptoms approach thought highly recommended people stress urinary incontinence rather treating overactive bladder behavioural therapy typically involves combination training exercises bladder training exercises combined biofeedback pelvic floor muscle training systematic review studies related urinary incontinence women found behavioral therapy alone combined treatments generally effective single treatment behavioral therapy treatment used improve cure urgency urinary incontinence including improving patient review focused effect bladder training treat oab however evidence low certainty based evidence bladder training may cure improve oab compared treatment bladder training may effective cure improve oab anticholinergics may fewer adverse events may difference efficacy safety bladder training pfmt trials needed reach firm conclusion medications common treatment option people overactive bladder syndrome number antimuscarinic drugs eg darifenacin hyoscyamine oxybutynin tolterodine solifenacin trospium fesoterodine frequently used treat overactive long term use however linked adrenergic receptor agonists eg mirabegron may used well however antimuscarinic drugs adrenergic receptor agonists constitute secondline treatment due risk side people get complete relief medications medications moderately typical person overactive bladder may urinate times per medication may reduce number reduce urinary incontinence events per noninvasive pharmacological approaches helpful people may eligible surgical procedure treat overactive surgical options may include urinary diversion sacral neuromodulation augmentation one surgical intervention involves enlargement bladder using bowel tissues although generally used last resort procedure greatly enlarge urine volume bladdercitation needed botulinum toxin botox approved food drug administration adults neurological conditions including multiple sclerosis spinal cord botulinum toxin injections bladder wall suppress involuntary bladder contractions blocking nerve signals may effective growing knowledge pathophysiology overactive bladder fuelled huge amount basic clinical research field oab may treated electrical stimulation aims reduce contractions muscle tenses around bladder causes urine pass invasive noninvasive electrical stimulation options noninvasive options include introduction probe vagina anus insertion electrical probe nerve near ankle fine needle noninvasive options appear reduce symptoms use better treatment treatment drugs pelvic floor muscle treatment quality evidence low unknown electrical stimulation option works best also unknown whether benefits last treatment lowquality evidence acupuncture may offer small improvement persons symptoms compared person seek treatment many people oab symptoms symptoms subside within year estimates high symptoms several earlier reports estimated one six adults united states europe number people affected oab increases thus expected oab become common future average age people living developed world increasing however recent finnish populationbased suggested number people affected largely overestimated due methodological shortcomings regarding age distribution low participation earlier reports suspected oab affects approximately half number individuals earlier american urological association reports studies showing rates low high men rates low urge incontinence reported higher older people likely affected number symptoms increases httpsenwikipediaorgwikioveractivebladder
