average ch bond length toluene reacts normal aromatic hydrocarbon electrophilic aromatic methyl group greater electronreleasing properties hydrogen atom position toluene reactive benzene toward electrophiles undergoes sulfonation give ptoluenesulfonic acid chlorination presence give ortho para isomers chlorotoluene nitration toluene gives mono di trinitrotoluene widely used dinitrotoluene precursor toluene diisocyanate precursor polyurethane foam trinitrotoluene tnt explosive complete hydrogenation toluene gives methylcyclohexane reaction requires high pressure hydrogen catalyst ch bonds methyl group toluene benzylic therefore weaker ch bonds simpler alkanes reflecting weakness methyl group toluene undergoes variety free radical reactions example heated nbromosuccinimide nbs presence aibn toluene converts benzyl bromide conversion effected elemental bromine presence uv light even sunlight toluene may also brominated treating hbr presence benzoic acid benzaldehyde produced commercially partial oxidation toluene oxygen typical catalysts include cobalt manganese related laboratoryscale oxidations involve use potassium permanganate yield benzoic acid chromyl chloride yield benzaldehyde étard reaction methyl group toluene undergoes deprotonation strong bases pka estimated approximately toluene miscible soluble proportions ethanol benzene diethyl ether acetone chloroform glacial acetic acid carbon disulfide immiscible toluene occurs naturally low levels crude oil byproduct production gasoline catalytic reformer ethylene cracker also byproduct production coke coal final separation purification done distillation solvent extraction processes used btx aromatics benzene toluene xylene toluene prepared variety methods example benzene reacts methanol presence solid acid give toluene one abundantly produced chemicals main uses precursor benzene xylenes solvent thinners paints lacquers adhesives additive toluene converted benzene via hydrodealkylation transalkylation gives mixture benzene xylenes widely used paint dye rubber chemical glue printing pharmaceutical industries nail polish paintbrush cleaners stain removers may contain toluene manufacturing explosives tnt uses well toluene also found cigarette smoke car exhaust contact air toluene remain unchanged soil water long toluene common solvent eg paints paint thinners silicone many chemical reactants rubber printing ink adhesives glues lacquers leather tanners toluene octane booster gasoline fuels internal combustion engines well jet fuel turbocharged engines formula australia toluene found illegally combined petrol fuel outlets sale standard vehicular fuel toluene incurs fuel excise tax fuels taxed providing greater profit margin fuel suppliers extent toluene substitution laboratory toluene used solvent carbon nanomaterials including nanotubes fullerenes also used fullerene indicator color toluene solution bright purple toluene used cement fine polystyrene kits dissolving fusing surfaces applied precisely brush contains none bulk adhesive toluene used break open red blood cells order extract hemoglobin biochemistry experiments toluene also used coolant good heat transfer capabilities sodium cold traps used nuclear reactor system loops toluene also used process removing cocaine coca leaves production cocacola environmental toxicological effects toluene extensively toluene irritating eyes skin respiratory tract absorbed slowly skin cause systemic toxicity inhalation ingestion inhalation common route exposure symptoms toluene poisoning include central nervous system effects headache dizziness drowsiness ataxia euphoria tremors hallucinations seizures coma chemical pneumonitis respiratory depression ventricular arrhythmias nausea vomiting electrolyte inhalation toluene low moderate levels cause tiredness confusion weakness drunkentype actions memory loss nausea loss appetite hearing colour vision symptoms usually disappear exposure stopped inhaling high levels toluene short time may cause lightheadedness nausea sleepiness unconsciousness even toluene however much less toxic benzene consequence largely replaced aromatic solvent chemical preparation us environmental protection agency epa states carcinogenic potential toluene evaluated due insufficient worldwide sales toluene amounted billion toluene occurs indoor air pollutant number processes including electrosurgery removed air activated carbon similarly many solvents alkylbenzenes toluene shown act noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonist gabaa receptor positive allosteric additionally toluene shown display antidepressantlike effects rodents forced swim test fst tail suspension test likely due nmda antagonist properties toluene sometimes used recreational inhalant glue sniffing likely account euphoric dissociative toluene inhibits excitatory ion channels nmda receptor nicotinic acetylcholine receptor serotonin receptor also potentiates function inhibitory ion channels gabaa glycine receptors addition toluene disrupts voltagegated calcium channels atpgated ion toluene used intoxicative inhalant manner unintended manufacturers people inhale toluenecontaining products eg paint thinner contact cement correction pens model glue etc intoxicating effect possession use toluene products containing regulated many jurisdictions supposed reason preventing minors obtaining products recreational drug purposes us states laws penalizing use possession intent use andor distribution european union banned general sale products consisting greater several types fungi including cladophialophora exophiala leptodontidium syn leptodontium pseudeurotium zonatum cladosporium sphaerospermum certain species bacteria degrade toluene using source carbon
