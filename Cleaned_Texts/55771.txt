ulnar collateral ligament injuries occur certain activities overhead baseball pitching acute chronic disruption ulnar collateral ligament result medial elbow pain valgus instability impaired throwing performance nonsurgical surgical treatment pain along inside elbow main symptom condition throwing athletes report occurs often acceleration phase throwing injury often associated experience sharp pop elbow followed pain single addition swelling bruising elbow loss elbow range motion sudden decrease throwing velocity common symptoms ucl injury injury less severe pain alleviate complete ucl stabilizes elbow abducted throwing motion intense repeated bouts valgus stress occur ucl injury may occur damage ucl common among baseball pitchers javelin throwers throwing motion similar physicians believe repetitive movements especially pitching baseball cause ucl injuries furthermore physicians stated adolescent throws throws months year throws exhausted adolescent significantly higher risk ucl gridiron football racquet sports ice hockey water polo players also treated damage specific overhead movements like occur baseball pitching tennis serving volleyball spiking increase risk ucl cocking phase pitching shoulder horizontally abducted externally rotated elbow flexed slight stress ucl position increases shoulder externally rotated throw greater stress ucl stretched causing strain overhead throwing motion valgus stress medial elbow occurs arm cocking acceleration initiation valgus stress occurs conclusion armcocking phase transitional moment arm cocking arm acceleration shoulder vigorously rotates internally forearm near full supination elbow flexes approximately late cocking ball release elbow rapidly extends approximately ball causes extreme valgus stress tensile strain ucl injuries ucl may result poor throwing mechanics overuse high throwing velocities throwing certain types pitches curveballscitation needed poor mechanics along high repetition overhead movements cause irritation microtears ruptures ucl kinetic chain dysfunction due poor lower extremity strength core strength stability associated ucl injuries well capsular stiffness glenohumeral internal rotation deficit gird scapular injuries ucl baseball players rarely due onetime traumatic events rather often occur due small chronic strains tears accumulating timecitation needed ulnar collateral ligament ucl also known medial collateral ligament located medial side elbow ucl complex comprises three ligaments anterior oblique posterior oblique transverse anterior oblique ligament aol attaches undersurface medial epicondyle medial ulnar surface slightly coronoid sturdiest three sections within ucl aol acts primary restraint valgus stress elbow flexion extension posterior oblique originates medial epicondyle inserts along midportion medial semilunar applies stability valgus stress elbow flexed rather extended transverse ligament connects inferior medial coronoid process ulna medial tip since connected bone across elbow joint transverse ligament contribution joint stability cases physician diagnose ulnar collateral ligament injury using patient medical history physical examination includes valgus stress test valgus stress test performed arms positive test indicated pain affected arm present uninvolved physicians often use imaging techniques ultrasound xrays magnetic resonance imaging arthroscopic surgery aid making proper diagnosiscitation needed slow chronic deterioration ulnar collateral ligament due repetitive stress acting ulna first pain bearable worsen extent terminate athlete career repetitive stress placed ulna causes microtears ligament resulting loss structural integrity acute rupture less common compared slow deterioration injury acute rupture occurs collisions elbow flexion wrestling match tackle football ulnar collateral ligament distributes fifty percent medial support result ucl injury dislocated elbow causing severe damage elbow radioulnar joints ucl injuries may may require surgery nonsurgical treatment primarily focus strengthening elbow joint regain strength first course rice rest ice compression elevation typically coupled nsaids nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs help alleviate pain swelling swelling subsided individual exercises physical therapy may prescribed strengthen muscles around elbow joint compensate tearing may include biceps curls non resistance resistance pronating supinating forearm grip strengthening exercises performed low resistance moderate repetitions three times surgical treatment may help restore ability perform overhand throwing motions commonly associated ucl injuries reconstructive surgery generally known tommy john surgery first performed dr frank jobe modified several times since surgery involves autograft palmaris longus tendon mostly considered accessory tendon allograft tissue cadaver donor replacement tendon attached drilling holes medial epicondyle humerus sublime tubercle ulna lacing tendon figure patient may begin physical therapy shortly usually takes months surgery standard rehabilitation tendon needs time convert rehabilitation following ucl injuries surgery follow sequential progressive multiphased approach involves gradual protected return rangeofmotion rehab program include proprioceptive exercises stimulate mechanoreceptors well arm strengthening emphasizing proximal scapular stabilization lowresistance highrepetition programs promote optimal return uncompensated postoperative treatment related restoration normal scapulohumeral rhythm begins establishing trunk stability elbow range motion strength well balance study conducted dr frederick azar tommy john surgeries performed analyzed surgeries patients reported complications
