genomic normal conditions lmna gene codes structural protein called prelamin undergoes series processing steps attaining final form called lamin prelamin contains caax c cysteine aliphatic amino acid x amino acid motif carboxyltermini proteins triggers three sequential enzymatic modifications first protein farnesyltransferase catalyzes addition farnesyl moiety cysteine second endoprotease
