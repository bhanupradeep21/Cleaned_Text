maternal physiological changes pregnancy adaptations take place pregnancy enable accommodation developing embryo fetus normal physiological adaptations cause changes behavior functioning heart blood vessels blood metabolism including increases blood sugar levels kidney function posture breathing pregnancy numerous hormones proteins secreted also broad range effects pregnant women experience numerous adjustments endocrine system help support developing fetus fetalplacental unit secretes steroid hormones proteins alter function various maternal endocrine glands sometimes changes certain hormone levels effects target organs lead gestational diabetes gestational hypertension estrogen progesterone human chorionic gonadotropin hcg levels throughout pregnancy estrogen progesterone levels pregnancy dashed vertical lines separate trimesters determinations via levels sex hormones shbg pregnancy dashed vertical lines separate trimesters determinations via levels progesterone estrogen rise continually throughout pregnancy suppressing hypothalamic axis subsequently menstrual cycle progesterone first produced corpus luteum placenta second trimester women also experience increased human chorionic gonadotropin Î²hcg produced placenta also produces human placental lactogen hpl stimulates maternal lipolysis fatty acid metabolism result conserves blood glucose use fetus also decrease maternal tissue sensitivity insulin resulting gestational pituitary gland grows onethird result hyperplasia lactrotrophs response high plasma prolactin produced lactrotrophs increases progressively throughout pregnancy prolactin mediates change structure breast mammary glands ductal lobularalveolar stimulates milk production fetal skeletal formation later lactation challenges maternal body maintain calcium fetal skeleton requires approximately grams calcium end mothers body adapts increasing parathyroid hormone leading increase calcium uptake within gut well increased calcium reabsorption kidneys maternal total serum calcium decreases due maternal hypoalbuminemia ionized calcium levels total cortisol increases three times nonpregnant levels third increased estrogen pregnancy leads increase corticosteroidbinding globulin production response adrenal gland produces net effect increase free cortisol contributes insulin resistance pregnancy possibly despite increase cortisol pregnant mom exhibit cushing syndrome symptoms high cortisol one theory high progesterone levels act antagonist cortisol adrenal gland also produces aldosterone leading eightfold increase women show signs hyperaldosterone hypokalemia hypernatremia high blood pressure adrenal gland also produces androgens testosterone buffered estrogens increase sexhormone binding globulin shbg binds avidly testosterone lesser degree thyroid enlarges may easily felt first trimester increase kidney clearance pregnancy causes iodide excreted causes relative iodine deficiency result increase thyroid
