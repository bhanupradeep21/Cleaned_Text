mission strategic bombing mission world war ii carried boeing flying fortress heavy bombers us army air forces august mission ambitious plan cripple german aircraft industry also known doublestrike mission entailed two large forces bombers attacking separate targets order disperse fighter reaction luftwaffe also first american shuttle mission part mission landed different field later bombed another target returning base postponed several times unfavorable weather operation known within eighth air force mission flown anniversary first daylight raid eighth air mission strike bombers bomb groups german heavy industry well beyond range escorting fighters mission inflicted heavy damage regensburg target catastrophic loss force bombers lost many damaged beyond economical repair result eighth air force unable follow immediately second attack might seriously crippled german industry schweinfurt finally attacked two months later lack longrange fighter escort still addressed losses even higher consequence deep penetration strategic bombing curtailed five months soon reconnaissance photographs received evening generals eaker anderson knew schweinfurt raid failure excellent
