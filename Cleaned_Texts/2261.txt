vibrissae vəˈbrɪsi sg vibrissa vəˈbrɪsə generally called whiskers type stiff functional hair used mammals sense hairs finely specialised purpose whereas types hair coarser tactile sensors although whiskers specifically found around face vibrissae known grow clusters various places around body mammals including nonhuman especially nocturnal mammals whiskers sensitive tactile hairs aid navigation

relatively consistent among land mammals land marine mammals less consistency though commonalities certainly present many land mammals like four typical whisker groups heads called cranial vibrissae
