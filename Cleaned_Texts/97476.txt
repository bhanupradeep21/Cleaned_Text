annakacygna genus flightless marine swan miocene japan named annakacygna displays series unique adaptations setting apart known swan including filter feeding lifestyle highly mobile tail wings likely formed cradle hatchlings fashion similar modern mute swans additionally may used wings tail form display traits combined led researchers working dub ultimate two species known hajimei approximately size black swan yoshiiensis exceeded mute swan size describing authors proposed vernacular name annaka shortwinged swan genus type specimen annakacygna nearly complete almost articulate skeleton discovered year hajime nakajima close usui river annaka gunma fossils found encased slab siltstone sediments haraichi formation miocene formation preserving marine environment early research believed relative megalodytes flightless bird miocene western north america preparation material however showed annakacygna distinct taxon described hiroshige matsuoka yoshikazu hasegawa second species known distal tibiotarsus unearthed collected riverbed kabura river km southeast remains type species fossil donated gunma museum natural history name annakacygna combination town annaka feminine form latin cygnus meaning swan hajimei named discoverer hajime nakajima yoshiiensis named town yoshiimachi near type skull holotype crushed missing rostrum however based preserved mandible length cm estimated upper beak head animal proportionally large described headheavy authors bony shelf extends posterior parts orbits meets postorbital process forms dorsal notch thought represent salt gland lacrimal bones vshaped highly unusual due fact fused together origin lower jaw depressor massive meet dorsally form false sagital crest seen known bird musculature lower jaw specifically adductor mandibulae externus profundus leaves wide deep impression bone indicating origin element quite thin single anteroposteriorly oriented condyle serves point articulation mandible unique annakacygna may tied retracting upper jaw mandible shows exceptionally long slender mandibular rami deeply bowed viewed side coronoid process set far back distance posterior articular surface fourth length mandibular rami tip mandible poorly preserved thin fragile based preserved elements lower jaw would somewhat spoonlike seventeen cervical thoracic vertebrae known although many distorted well enough preserved reveal position within skeleton subsequently matsuoka hasegawa managed determine presence twentythree neck seven thoracic vertebrae generally similar extant black swan cygnus atratus however notably wider heavier modern cygnus species despite robust shorter vertebrae neck annakacygna still long flexible sternum poorly preserved shows weak attachment coracobrachialis muscle coracoid resembles flightless sea duck chendytes pleistocene north america scapula much stronger extant flying anseriformes better developed scapulohumeralis caudalis muscle initially resemble flightless animal humerus preserved similar length black swans unusually straight shaft lacking pronounced sigmoid curve lateral medial view remnants curvature seen expressed Êƒshape proximal head large well developed proportionally absolutely larger whooper swan cygnus cygnus distal end much smaller entire bone thickened ulna straight incredibly short length humerus modern swans ulna humerus almost equal length radius highly unusual among birds also shortened shows round crosssection towards proximal end widening flatting moves away humerus articulation humerus reduced radiale proportionally large carpometacarpus reduced length retaining strong articular surfaces indicate element still used wing phalanges barely pelvis almost completely preserved would gently arched accounting preservation fossil three caudal vertebrae preserved much better developed caudals birds caudals contribution stiffened synsacrum short another highly unusual feature tarsometatarsus narrow eliptical crosssection adaptation observed grebes loons helps reduce drag moving second species yoshiiensis known distal end tibiotarsus stands apart type materiel due greater size bone times larger corresponding material haijimei lead authors believe represent species distinct although upper beak preserved based anatomy mandible likely long deep forward spreading form superficialy resembling modern shovelers unique jaw musculature indicated cranial mandibular bones suggests annakocygna moved jaws somewhat seesawlike motion unlike anything observed extant swans lower jaw moved back upper jaw would retracted time interpreted mean annakocygna highly derived filter feeder subsequently beak likely lined soft lamellae support planktivorous like geese coscoroba swan coscoroba coscoroba pelvis wide short resemble long narrow pelvis birds using feet swim however foot annakacygna show opposite resembling footpropelled seabirds matsuoka hasegawa suggest pelvis may specific adaptation stabilize bird sea strangely long robust caudals meanwhile together adaptations pubic area would likely given bird exceptionally strong mobile wings clearly show flightless arm bones shortened show kind reduction observed flightless birds instead rather show different specialisation shoulder joint highly mobile allowing wings move back great extent musculature supporting movement usually observed birds fold wings contrary wrist joint restrictive allowing phalanges fold position approximately flex position additionally ulnimetacarpalis ventralis muscle would allowed hands hyperpronate elevating primary feathers upward beyond wrist similar positioning wings observed several modern species swan carry young piggyback style elevating wings slighly juveniles rest adults three species displaying behavior also notably less vocal swan species instead using wings due combination skeletal elements corresponding musculature matsuoka hasegawa propose annakocygna used highly specialised wings cradle young fashion similar extant mute swans mobile tail could possibly served part cradle raised protect back additionally wings tail may utilized protect young also displays attract communicate feet annakacygna similar morphology modern diving birds like loons grebes showing narrowing tarsometatarsus lacking shortening femur although authors believe deep diver shows none less clear adaptation life ocean furthermore tibiotarsus appears similar variety marine diving birds including albatrosses anhingas sulids ankle joints strong dorsiflexion hypothesized webbed feet would passively folded life thickened bones likely helped birds lifestyle pachyostotic bones commonly associated diving make animal heavier case annakacygna likely helped stabilize animal sea species annakacygna found middle layers miocene haraichi formation preserves marine environment animals found formation include desmostylian paleoparadoxia sharks allodesmine seals variety cetaceans like joumocetus kentriodon httpsenwikipediaorgwikiannakacygna
