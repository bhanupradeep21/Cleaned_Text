cyclotron bombardment destroys organic molecules type usually used ligands particular would destroy glucose cyclotron production may accomplished bombardment deuterons usually done proton bombardment water causing pn reaction sometimes called knockout reaction common type nuclear reaction high probability incoming proton knocks neutron produces carrierfree dissolved ions water halflife makes rapid
