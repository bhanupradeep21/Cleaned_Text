echocardiography also known cardiac ultrasound use ultrasound examine heart type medical imaging using standard ultrasound doppler visual image formed using technique called echocardiogram cardiac echo simply echo echocardiography routinely used diagnosis management followup patients suspected known heart diseases one widely used diagnostic imaging modalities cardiology provide wealth helpful information including size shape heart internal chamber size quantification pumping capacity location extent tissue damage assessment valves echocardiogram also give physicians estimates heart function calculation cardiac output ejection fraction diastolic function well heart relaxes echocardiography important tool assessing wall motion abnormality patients suspected cardiac disease tool helps reaching early diagnosis myocardial infarction showing regional wall motion abnormality also important treatment followup patients heart failure assessing ejection echocardiography help detect cardiomyopathies hypertrophic cardiomyopathy dilated cardiomyopathy use stress echocardiography may also help determine whether chest pain associated symptoms related heart disease biggest advantage echocardiography invasive involve breaking skin entering body cavities known risks side echocardiogram create ultrasound images heart structures also produce accurate assessment blood flowing heart doppler echocardiography using pulsed continuouswave doppler ultrasound allows assessment normal abnormal blood flow heart color doppler well spectral doppler used visualize abnormal communications

unborn fetuscitation needed three primary types echocardiography transthoracic transesophageal intracardic stress testing utilizes tranthoracic echo combination exercise modality eg treadmill intravascular ultrasound included name indicates ultrasound echocardiography imaging walls vessel rather heart standard echocardiogram also known transthoracic echocardiogram tte cardiac ultrasound used rapid evaluation patient bedside case echocardiography transducer probe placed chest wall thorax subject images taken chest wall noninvasive highly accurate quick assessment overall function heart tte utilizes several windows image heart different perspectives window advantages disadvantages viewing specific structures within heart typically numerous windows utilized within study fully assess heart parasternal long parasternal short axis windows taken next sternum apical twothreefour chamber windows taken apex heart lower left side subcostal window taken underneath edge last rib tte utilizes one mode two threedimensional ultrasound time implicit included different windows combined pulse wave continuous wave doppler visualize velocity blood flow structure movements images enhanced contrast typically sort micro bubble suspension reflect ultrasound waves transesophageal echocardiogram alternative way perform echocardiogram specialized probe containing ultrasound transducer tip passed patients esophagus via mouth allowing image doppler evaluation location directly behind heart often used transthoracic images suboptimal clearer precise image needed assessment test performed presence cardiologist anesthesiologist registered nurse ultrasound technologist conscious sedation andor localized numbing medication may used make patient comfortable procedure tee unlike tte discrete windows view heart entire esophagus stomach utilized probe advanced removed along dimension alter perspective heart probes include ability deflect tip probe one two dimensions refine

dimensions needed tee used standalone procedures incorporated catheter surgicalbased procedures example valve replacement surgery tee used assess valve function immediately repairreplacement immediately permits revising valve midsurgery needed improve outcomes surgery stress echocardiogram also known stress echo uses ultrasound imaging heart assess wall motion response physical stress first images heart taken rest acquire baseline patients wall motion resting heart rate patient walks treadmill uses another exercise modality increase heart rate target heart rate agepredicted maximum heart rate patients age finally images heart taken stress assess wall motion peak heart rate stress echo assesses wall motion heart however create image coronary arteries directly ischemia one coronary arteries could cause wall motion abnormality could indicate coronary artery disease gold standard test directly create image coronary arteries directly assess stenosis occlusion cardiac
