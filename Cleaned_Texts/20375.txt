autoimmune pancreatitis aip increasingly recognized type chronic pancreatitis difficult distinguish pancreatic carcinoma responds treatment corticosteroids particularly although autoimmune pancreatitis quite rare constitutes important clinical problem patients clinicians disease commonly presents tumorous mass diagnostically indistinguishable pancreatic cancer disease much common
