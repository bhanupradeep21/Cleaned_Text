management observation determine whether spontaneous nerve recovery voice therapy speechlanguage pathologist suitable time help manage compensatory vocal behaviours may manifest response overall goal voice therapy narrow glottis without causing hyperfunction surrounding muscles past forced adduction exercises used push vocal folds together often resulted additional stress vocal folds current methods focus generally improving abdominal support muscle strength hard glottal attacks involve building subglottal pressure air pressure vocal folds letting vowel sound often method beneficial clients compensate use falsetto halfswallow boom allows repositioning vocal folds taking advantage laryngeal positioning swallowing client asked take breath initiate movement swallowing followed forcefully saying boom performed properly boom sounds loud clear eventually sound generalized words training breath support essential clients identify professional voice users shifting awareness breath belly diaphragmatic breathing aids efficient vocal function reducing risk hyperfunction muscular lip tongue trills aid balance resonance well coordinate muscles respiration phonation
