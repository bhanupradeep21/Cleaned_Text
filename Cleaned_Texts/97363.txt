aortic valve replacement procedure whereby failing aortic valve patients heart replaced artificial heart valve aortic valve may need replaced current methods aortic valve replacement include openheart surgery termed minimally invasive cardiac surgery mics surgical aortic valve replacement savr percutaneous transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr also pavr pavi tavi competent practising cardiologist evaluate whether patient could benefit heart valve late early first surgical approaches towards treating aortic valve stenosis limited success first attempts valvotomies ie cutting valve heart pumping ball valve prosthesis placed descending thoracic aorta heterotopically developed hufnagel harvey others address aortic stenosis disastrous complications later innovation cardiopulmonary bypass ball valve prosthesis placed orthotopically ie place original aortic valve first generation prosthetic valves durable needed intense anticoagulation cardiac hemodynamics compromised singleleaflet prosthesis developed bahnson et al early ross barrattboyes used allografts tissue prosthetic valves introduced binet paris degenerated quickly tissue insufficiently preserved carpentier solved problem introducing glutaraldehydepreserved stentmounted porcine aortic valve semilunar halfmoon shaped three cusps separates heart aorta cusp attached aortic wall creating sinus valsalva sinus origins two coronary arteries sited two valsalva sinuses named coronary artery supply leaflets separated commissures posterior leaflet continuation anterior leaflet mitral valve tissue called aortomitral aortic valve opened systole driving force open difference pressure contracting left ventricle heart aorta cardiac diastole heart chamber gets bigger aortic valve aortic stenosis commonly result calcification cusps reasons stenosis bicuspid valve patients two cusps aortic valve instead usual three rheumatic aortic stenosis rare west obstruction level aortic valve causes increased pressure within hearts left ventricle lead hypertrophy ultimately dysfunction heart xray ecg might indicate aortic stenosis echocardiography diagnostic procedure choice us findings also help grading severity disease cases symptomatic severe aortic stenosis avr warranted cases asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis factors taken aortic regurgitation hand many causes degeneration cusps endocarditis bicuspid aortic valve aortic root dilatation trauma connective tissue disorders marfan syndrome ehlersdanlos lead imperfect closure valve diastole hence blood returning aorta towards left ventricle heart acute aortic regurgitation caused endocarditis aortic dissection trauma ends pulmonary edema acute increase left ventricle lvedp time adjust regurgitation chronic regurgitation contrast gives heart time change shape resulting eccentric hypertrophy disastrous effects myocardium ultrasound also best diagnostic mobility either transthoracic transesophageal longterm data survival quality life people following valve replacement become available evidencebased guidelines aortic valve replacement developed help healthcare professionals decide aortic valve replacement best option patient two widely accepted sets guidelines used surgeons cardiologists american heart association american college cardiology guidelines management patients valvular heart european society cardiology european association surgery guidelines management valvular heart aortic stenosis treated aortic valve replacement order avoid angina syncope congestive heart failure individuals severe aortic stenosis candidates aortic valve replacement develop symptoms heart function impacted people asymptomatic aortic stenosis may also candidates aortic valve replacement especially symptoms appear exercise patients moderate aortic valve stenosis need another type cardiac surgery ie coronary artery bypass surgery also valve addressed surgical team echocardiography unveils significant heart low gradient aortic stenosis concomitant left ventricular dysfunction poses significant question anesthesiologist patient stress echocardiography ie dobutamine infusion help determine ventricle dysfunctional aortic stenosis myocardium lost ability many people aortic insufficiency often develop symptoms condition many aortic valve replacement indicated symptoms shortness breath cases heart begun enlarge dilate pumping increased volume blood leaks back two basic types replacement heart valve tissue bioprosthetic valves mechanical tissue heart valves usually made animal tissue heterografts mounted metal polymer bovine cow tissue commonly used made porcine pig tissue treated prevent rejection calcification calcium builds replacement valve stops working occasionally alternatives animal tissue valves used aortic homografts pulmonary autografts aortic homograft aortic valve human donor retrieved either death heart undergoing heart pulmonary autograft also known ross procedure aortic valve

primarily children allows patients pulmonary valve aortic position grow tissue valves last however tend deteriorate quickly younger new ways preserving tissue longer investigated one preservation treatment used commercially available tissue heart valve sheep rabbit studies tissue called resilia tissue less calcification control tissue however longterm durability data patients yet availablecitation needed stented stentless tissue valves available stented valves come sizes mm stentless valves directly sutured aortic root major advantage stentless valves limit mismatch area prosthetic valve small relation size patient increasing pressure inside helpful dealing small aortic root however stentless valves take time stented valves mechanical valves made synthetic materials titanium pyrolytic durable tissue valves typically lasting however risk blood clots forming higher mechanical valves tissue valves result people mechanical heart valves must take anticoagulant bloodthinning drugs warfarin rest lives making prone sound valve sometimes heard often clicks valve choice balance lower durability tissue valves increased risk blood clots bleeding mechanical valves guidelines suggest patient age lifestyle medical history considered choosing valve tissue valves deteriorate rapidly young patients pregnancy preferable women wish children pregnancy increases risk blood clots typically mechanical valve considered patients years old tissue valve considered patients age surgical aortic valve replacement conventionally done median sternotomy meaning incision made
