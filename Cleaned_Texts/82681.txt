sexual selection described natural selection arising preference one sex certain characteristics individuals sex sexual selection common concept animal evolution plants oftentimes overlooked many plants hermaphrodites flowering plants show many characteristics often sexually selected example flower symmetry nectar production floral structure inflorescences many secondary sex characteristics acted upon sexual selection sexual dimorphisms reproductive organs also affected sexual selection flowering two main mechanisms sexual selection flowering plants one intrasexual competition female mate choice intrasexual selection responsible much floral evolution diversification intrasexual selection help pollinators also led remarkable examples exaggerated traits among hermaphroditic plants similarly sexual dimorphism probably involved evolution sexual dimorphism floral traits dioecious plants likely also evolution secondary sexual dimorphism genetic correlations floral traits sexual selection female choice perhaps difficult concept apply plants evidence females female function hermaphrodites exercise choice especially two mechanisms main driving forces sexual selection flowering plants floral symmetry often acted sexual selection floral characters often subject strong directional selection pollinators may disrupt developmental homeostasis flowers develop large degrees fluctuating asymmetry fluctuating asymmetry floral traits may lead sexual selection plants pollinators visit symmetrical flowers assortative manner numerous studies shown pollinators preferentially visited symmetrical floral patterns flowers several believed reasons pollinator preference exists first preference may present due positive reinforcement experience pollinators may learn asymmetrical flowers provide lesser award symmetrical ones second sensory biases predisposed pollinators could cause select symmetrical flowers pollinator preference lead symmetrical flowers fertilized often increase fertilization frequency increases amount seeds produced results increased production offspring symmetrical attractive numerous examples sexual dimorphisms flowering plants sexual dimorphic differences include bud abortion flower size flower number per plant floral longevity nutrient content flowers nectar production flowering phenology periodicity floral fragrances floral defense herbivory various inflorescence characteristics including total flower number daily display size inflorescence architecture animalpollinated species differences affect pollinator visitation competition mates evolution sexual however constraints placed animalpollinated species much divergence could interfere mating success pollinators attracted one sex sexes attract different pollinators constraints absent windpollinated plants contrasting biophysical requirements pollen dispersal pollen capture led striking cases sexual dimorphism plant architecture flower production specific examples sexual dimorphisms flowering plants inflorescences acted sexual selection many ways commonly include arrangement number example male inflorescence plants often produce flowers females furthermore pollen export ultimately paternity often increases flower number even plants hermaphroditic flowers retention older flowers pollinator rewards lead increased pollinator visitation rate increased pollen removal studies suggest selection increased pollen delivery achieved greater inflorescence size seems probable malemale competition commonly part selection corollas petals flowers also face sexual selection traits color shape size symmetry often faced sexually selected pressure one example male flowers often larger female flowers least species although presumably achieved resource allocation mechanisms unlikely resource allocation lower cost androecium gynoecium leading higher expenditure corolla males general complete explanation size differences corolla enlargement may arise means selection correlated characters pollen production however likely male competition often contributes directly evolution large male corollas especially pollen availability nectar production different every flowering plant many different selective forces acting upon specific evolutionary force drives nectar production believed sexual selection plays major role studies supported idea sexual selection probable explanation least species genderbiased nectar production example genderbiased expression nectar often accompanied similarly biased expression floral characteristics specific example comes flowers impatiens capensis show increased longevity morerewarding male phase species petals seen wilt notably less rewarding female phase change color pass lessrewarding female phase evidence sexually selected nectar production relies specific behaviors pollinators sexual selection currently maintaining genderbiased nectar production pollinators must able distinguish male female phase flowers also must visit preferentially flowers morerewarding phase species discriminating pollinators increased rewards result increased mating success would allow nectar sexually selected androecium often faced pressures sexual selection particularly evident pollen produced may several sources sexual selection ways pollen presented pollen vectors pollen packaged units ensure several many pollen grains travel together pollinia polyads viscin threads etc pollen donors may able monopolize stigmas associated ovules blocking access males unless selection also favors compensating stigma enlargement furthermore pollen germination depends minimum number pollen grains overcome stigmatic inhibition mechanism heightens male competition may selection large pollen dispersal units certain pollendispensing mechanisms pollinator visits selection package pollen way removed one visit repeated pollinator visits typical may selection various temporal patterns pollen presentation various methods pollen dispensing variation stamen length within among flowers influences pollen dispersal potential male reproductive success increasing opportunity paternity distributing pollen among pollinators may take different routes different systems possibilities viewed sexual selection context gynoecium also affected sexual selection every part ovaries styles stigma carpels faced pressures sexual selection ovule packaging intensity pollen competition depends part number pollen grains relative number ovules although many factors may contribute determining ovule number one way females increase level pollen competition decrease ovule number maintaining stigma size evolution functional syncarpy assuming attendant changes presumably simultaneous increase number ovules accessible one stigma tended decrease intensity pollen competition concentration pollen deposition single stigma tends increase pollen competition increases pollen competition could brought increase pollen delivery change pollinator increased attractiveness floral display rewards decrease ovule number stigma size changes temporal patterns stigma receptivity changes competitive
