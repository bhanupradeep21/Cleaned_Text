glaciers loosely defined patches currently recently flowing ice thought present across large restricted areas modern martian surface inferred widely distributed times lobate convex features surface known viscous flow features lobate debris aprons show characteristics nonnewtonian flow almost unanimously regarded true however variety features surface also interpreted directly linked flowing ice fretted lineated valley concentric crater arcuate variety surface textures seen imagery midlatitudes polar regions also thought linked sublimation glacial today features interpreted glaciers largely restricted latitudes polewards around particular concentrations found ismenius lacus based current models martian atmosphere ice stable exposed surface midmartian thus thought glaciers must covered layer rubble dust preventing free transfer water vapor subliming ice also suggests recent geological past climate mars must different order allow glaciers grow stably provides good independent evidence obliquity mars changed significantly past independently indicated modelling orbit evidence past glaciation also appears peaks several martian volcanoes like glaciers earth glaciers mars pure water many thought contain substantial proportions debris substantial number probably better described rock many years largely modeled instability water ice midlatitudes putative glacial features concentrated argued almost glaciers rock glaciers however recent direct observations made sharad radar instrument mars reconnaissance orbiter satellite confirmed least features relatively pure ice thus true authors also made claims glaciers solid carbon dioxide formed mars certain rare landscapes look like glaciers moving mountain valleys earth appear hollowed center looking like glacier almost ice disappeared left dirt debris carried supposed alpine glaciers called glacierlike forms glf glacierlike flows glacierlike forms later maybe accurate term sure structure currently another general

covered thin layer rocks insulated ice found southern hemisphere northern researchers niels bohr institute combined radar observations ice flow modelling say ice martian glaciers equivalent could cover entire surface mars meters ice fact ice still suggests thick layer dust protecting ice current atmospheric conditions mars exposed water ice would thought ice accumulated mars orbital tilt different present axis planet spins considerable wobble meaning angle changes million years ago tilt axis mars degrees instead present degrees tilt also called obliquity varies greatly two tiny moons stabilize like moon stabilizes earth many features mars especially ismenius lacus quadrangle believed contain large amounts ice popular model origin ice climate change large changes tilt planets rotational axis times tilt even greater large changes tilt explains many icerich features mars studies shown tilt mars reaches degrees current degrees ice longer stable furthermore high tilt stores solid carbon dioxide dry ice sublimate thereby increasing atmospheric pressure increased pressure allows dust held atmosphere moisture atmosphere fall snow ice frozen onto dust grains calculations suggest material concentrate general circulation models martian atmosphere predict accumulations icerich dust areas icerich features tilt begins return lower values ice sublimates turns directly gas leaves behind lag lag deposit caps underlying material cycle high tilt levels icerich mantle remains smooth surface mantle layer probably represents relative recent material several types landforms
