beerbower revived hypothesis horns involved respiration description diploceraspis close relative diplocaulus argument relied possibility horns supported operculumlike vertical pouches protecting

cruickshank fluid dynamicist bw skews paper proposed tabular horns acted hydrofoil allowing animal easily control water flows head process investigation cruickshank skews developed fullscale model head portion body diplocaulus constructed balsa wood modelling clay model placed wind tunnel subjected several tests determine drag lift forces experienced head different results showed horns generated significant lift would allowed animal rise water column river stream quite quickly easily lift present head parallel flow water modeled air lift increasing higher attack angle angle horizontal dropping head reached high stall angle degrees lift pitching moment minimized degrees horizontal may natural resting angle mouth model opened lift barely affected pitching moment decreased drag slightly increased indicates diplocaulus would seriously disadvantaged chose attack prey items rising water cruickshank skews also glued numerous small spheres model order test irregular texture would affect mechanics head highly irregular spheres drastically reduced lift increased drag rubbed leaving slightly irregular glue layer major reduction aerodynamic quality compared smooth model stall angle decreased degrees study also inquired hydrodynamics diploceraspis lacked flange underside horns present diplocaulus flange removed smooth model resulting lift forces started generated lower angle degrees horizontal rather may indicate diploceraspis better adapted slower streams immediate lift prioritized gradual lift created diplocaulus model would able take advantage swifter trio
