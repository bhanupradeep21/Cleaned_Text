aquarium filters critical components freshwater marine aquarium filters remove physical soluble chemical waste products aquaria simplifying maintenance furthermore aquarium filters necessary support life aquaria relatively small closed volumes water compared natural environment animals typically fish kept fish tanks produce waste excrement respiration another source waste uneaten food plants fish died waste products collect tanks contaminate water degree contamination rises risk health aquaria increases removal contamination becomes critical filtration common method used maintenance healthy aquaria proper management nitrogen cycle vital element successful aquarium excretia decomposing organic matter produce ammonia highly toxic fish bacterial processes oxidize ammonia slightly less toxic nitrites turn oxidized form much less toxic nitrates natural environment nitrates subsequently taken plants fertilizer indeed happen extent aquarium planted real plants aquarium however imperfect microcosm natural world aquariums usually much densely stocked fish natural environment increases amount ammonia produced relatively small volume aquarium bacteria responsible breaking ammonia converting nitrite nitrosomonas colonize surface objects inside aquarium bacteria convert nitrite nitrate nitrospira cases biological filter nothing chemically inert porous sponge provides greatly enlarged surface area bacteria develop bacterial colonies take several weeks form time aquarium vulnerable condition commonly known new tank syndrome stocked fish quickly systems incorporate bacteria capable converting nitrates nitrogen accumulation toxic ammonia decomposing wastes largest cause fish mortality new poorly maintained overloaded artificial environment aquarium nitrogen cycle effectively ends production nitrates order nitrate level build harmful level regular partial water changes required remove nitrates introduce new uncontaminated process mechanical filtration removes particulate material water column particulate matter may include uneaten food feces plant algal debris mechanical filtration typically achieved passing water materials act sieve physically trapping particulate removal solid waste simple physical hand netting debris andor involve highly complex equipment removal solid wastes involve filtering water form mesh process known mechanical filtration solid wastes first collected must physically removed aquarium system mechanical filtration ultimately ineffective solid wastes removed filter allowed decay dissolve water dissolved wastes difficult remove water several techniques collectively known chemical filtration used removal dissolved wastes popular use activated carbon foam fractionation certain extent healthy plants extract dissolved chemical wastes water grow plants serve role containment dissolved wastes final less common situation requiring filtration involves desire sterilize waterborne pathogens sterilization accomplished passing aquarium water filtration devices expose water high intensity ultraviolet light andor exposing water dissolved ozone gas numerous materials suitable aquarium filtration media include synthetic wools known aquarium hobby filter wool made polyethylene terephthalate nylon synthetic sponges foams various ceramic sintered glass silicon products along igneous gravels also used mechanical filter materials materials greater surface area provide mechanical biological filtration filter materials plastic bioballs best used biological filtration notable exception diatom filters aquarium filters rarely purely mechanical action bacteria colonise filter materials effecting degree biological activated carbon zeolites also frequently added aquarium filters highly porous materials act adsorbates binding various chemicals large external also sites bacterial colonisation simplest type aquarium filter consists filter wool activated carbon filter wool traps large debris particles activated carbon adsorbs smaller impurities changed regularly suitable particularly important case activated carbon filters may rerelease adsorbed contents large therefore harmful doses allowed activated carbon adsorbs toxins extended porous surface carbon reactivated boiling water adsorption activated carbon restored thermal regeneration temperatures electrochemical regeneration ultrasound industrial processes aquarist replacing activated carbon fresh material simple inexpensive numerous types aquarium filters commercially including power hob hang back filters impeller powered remove water aquarium usually long siphoning tube pushed pulled series different filter media returned aquarium common type aquarium often suitable larger tanks types however necessarily best smaller tanks since tendency cause excess water flow smaller tanks types sponge filters ideal advantages type filter allow selection different types filter media depending tank needs easy clean without disturbing inhabitants tank sit outside fish tank disadvantages power filters include smaller capacity filter media compared canister filters aforementioned tendency create excessive flow rates tend noisy usually resulting compared filters hang back aquarium canisterstyle external filters offer greater quantity filter materials used along greater degree flexibility respect filter material water enters canister filled chosen filter material intake pipe bottom canister passes material fed back aquarium return pipe water forced circulate filter pump typically installed top canister important note canister filters sealed fully flooded systems meaning aquarium intake pipe filter interior return pipe form continuous body water configuration intake return path form two siphons precisely counterbalance circumstances filter pump spend effort lift water back aquarium regardless high latter installed canister pump powerful enough push water filtering material well overcome drag intake return pipes makes canister filter pumps virtually insensitive height difference aquarium filter although exceeding manufacturerspecified height limit lead leaks benefits type filter provide high volume filter material without reducing internal space aquarium disconnected tank cleaningmaintenance replaced without disturbing aquarium interior occupants also filter external plumbing supports inline installation aquarium equipment water heaters carbon dioxide diffusers equipment removed tank installed inline return pipe filter disadvantages canister filters include increased cost complexity relative internal filters difficulties cleaning tubes transfer water also risk leak naturally issue filter placed outside aquarium fall victim issue excess water flow canister filters initially designed filter drinking water low pressure canister filters use high water pressure properly powered pump force water dense filter media pump draw water undergravel filter run canister double filtration diatom filters used sporadic cleaning tanks continuously operated aquariums filters utilise diatomaceous earth create extremely fine filter Âµm removes particulate matter water trickle filters also known wetdry filters another water filtration systems marine freshwater filter comes two configurations one placed top aquarium rarely seen one placed aquarium common wetdry filter placed top aquarium water pumped number perforated trays containing filter wool filter material water trickles trays keeping filter wool wet completely submerged allowing aerobic bacteria grow
