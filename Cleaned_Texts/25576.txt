dizocilpine inn also known pore blocker nmethyldaspartate nmda receptor glutamate receptor discovered team merck glutamate brains primary excitatory neurotransmitter channel normally blocked magnesium ion requires depolarization neuron remove magnesium allow glutamate open channel causing influx calcium leads subsequent dizocilpine binds inside ion channel receptor several pcps binding sites thus preventing flow ions including calcium channel dizocilpine blocks nmda receptors use voltagedependent manner since channel must open drug bind inside drug acts potent anticonvulsant probably dissociative anesthetic properties used clinically purpose discovery brain lesions called olneys lesions see laboratory rats dizocilpine also associated number negative side effects including cognitive disruption psychoticspectrum reactions inhibits induction long term found impair acquisition difficult easy learning tasks effects dizocilpine nmda receptor pore blocker ketamine used instead dissociative anesthetic human medical procedures ketamine may also trigger temporary psychosis certain individuals short halflife lower potency make much safer clinical option however dizocilpine frequently used uncompetitive nmda receptor antagonist animal models mimic psychosis experimental purposes dizocilpine also found act nicotinic acetylcholine receptor shown bind inhibit

laboratory animals resulted similar neuropathological changes effects dizocilpine nmda receptors clear significant nmda receptors key progression excitotoxicity process excessive amount extracellular
