selfish herd theory states individuals within population attempt reduce predation risk putting conspecifics key element theory domain danger area ground every point nearer particular individual individual antipredator behavior inevitably results aggregations theory proposed w hamilton explain gregarious behavior variety contrasted popular hypothesis evolution social behavior based mutual benefits basic principle governing selfish herd theory aggregations predation risk greatest periphery decreases toward dominant animals within population proposed obtain lowrisk central positions whereas subordinate animals forced higher risk hypothesis used explain populations higher predation risk often form larger compact may also explain aggregations often sorted phenotypic characteristics w hamilton proposed theory article titled geometry selfish herd date article cited sources illustrate theory hamilton asked readers imagine circular lily pond sheltered population frogs water upon seeing water snake frogs scatter rim pond water snake attacks nearest hamilton proposed model frog better chance closest thus vulnerable attack water snake result modeled frogs jumped smaller gaps neighboring simple example based hamilton identified frogs domain danger area ground point nearer individual model assumed frogs attacked random points attack initiated within individuals domain danger would attacked likely killed risk predation individual therefore correlated size domain frog jumping response water snake attempt lower domain hamilton also went model predation twodimensions using lion example movements hamilton proposed would lower individuals domain danger largely based theory marginal predation theory states predators attack closest prey typically outside hamilton suggested face predation strong movement individuals toward center domain danger may measured constructing voronoi diagram around group construction forms series convex polygons surrounding individual points within polygon closer individual movements toward center aggregation based upon variety movement rules range identifying rules considered dilemma selfish main issue movement rules easy follow often unsuccessful forming compact aggregations form aggregations often considered complex biologically viscido miller wethey identified three factors govern good movement according factors plausible movement rule statistically likely benefit followers likely fit capabilities animal result compact aggregation desired central identified movement rules include research revealed variety factors may influence chosen movement rules factors include initial spatial population attack strategy individuals holding initially central positions likely successful remaining simpler movement strategies may sufficient low density populations fastacting predators higher densities slower predators complex strategies may lastly less vigilant members herd often less likely obtain smaller domains danger begin movement selfish herd theory may also applied group escape prey safest position relative predation risk central position rather front theory may useful explaining escape strategy chosen herd members back herd greatest domain danger suffer highest predation risk slow members must choose whether stay herd thus likely targets whether desert herd signal vulnerability latter may entice pursuit predator sole individual light decision escape route front members herd may greatly affected actions slowest leader chooses escape strategy promotes dispersal slowest member herd may endanger dissipation protective buffer five types herd leadership proposed based decisions leader although types escape seemingly altruistic promote stability herd thus decrease predation risk leader choice often affected terrain gregarious behavior occurs wide variety taxa thus likely evolved independently several dilution predation risk one many proposed benefits facilitated selection behavior much research devoted understanding possible evolution selfish herd thus plausibility theory order selfish herd evolved movement rules decreased domains danger within population must rules often complex unlikely would evolved single rather simple rules considered solely nearest neighbor guiding movement may given rise evolution complicated proposed succession would occur individuals moved toward nearest neighbor face predation showed higher survival furthermore individuals must benefited movements often harmed ie forced onto periphery idea fact gained study conducted reluga viscido found natural selection localized movement rules members within population could fact promote evolution selfish shown predator attacks plays crucial role whether selfish herd behavior although selfish herd promotes decreased predation risk many members variety risks associated aggregations groupings may make prey conspicuous may increase intraspecific competition furthermore individuals desired central positions may lower feeding may less extensively studied example fiddler crab exposed predator fiddler crabs move ways consistent selfish herd dispersed groups likely form aggregate subjected danger crabs attempt run toward center forming selfish herd behavior seen also although selfish herd theory widely accepted deemed implausible certain situations may fully account aggregations space predatory attacks may come means grouping behavior flying birds aquatic animals unlikely explained selfish herd theory theory may require complex movement rules difficult animal mechanisms proposed better explain grouping behavior animals confusion hypothesis research indicated hypothesis likely small groups members however increasing group size little httpsenwikipediaorgwikiselfishherdtheory
