chlamydia trachomatis kləˈmɪdiə trəˈkoʊmətɪs commonly known bacterium causes chlamydia manifest various ways including trachoma lymphogranuloma venereum nongonococcal urethritis cervicitis salpingitis pelvic inflammatory disease c trachomatis common infectious cause blindness common sexually transmitted different types c trachomatis cause different diseases common strains cause disease genital tract strains cause disease eye lymph nodes like chlamydia species c trachomatis life cycle consists two morphologically distinct life stages elementary bodies reticulate bodies elementary bodies sporelike infectious whereas reticulate bodies replicative stage seen within host cells chlamydia trachomatis gramnegative bacterium replicate within host course c trachomatis life cycle bacteria take two distinct forms elementary bodies nanometers across surrounded rigid cell wall allows survive outside host form initiate new infection comes contact susceptible host reticulate bodies nanometers across found within host neither form c trachomatis genome substantially smaller many bacteria approximately megabases encoding approximately several important metabolic functions encoded c trachomatis genome instead likely scavenged host addition chromosome contains genome nearly c trachomatis strains carry kilobase plasmid contains role plasmid unknown though strains without plasmid isolated suggesting required survival like chlamydia species c trachomatis life cycle consisting two morphologically distinct forms first c trachomatis attaches new host cell small sporelike form called elementary elementary body enters host cell surrounded host vacuole called within inclusion c trachomatis transforms larger metabolically active form called reticulate reticulate body substantially modifies inclusion making hospitable environment rapid replication bacteria occurs following massive number intracellular bacteria transition back resistant elementary bodies causing cell rupture released new elementary bodies shed semen released epithelial cells female genital tract attach new host c trachomatis bacteria genus chlamydia group obligate intracellular parasites eukaryotic chlamydial cells carry energy metabolism lack biosynthetic c trachomatis strains generally divided three biovars based type disease cause subdivided several serovars based surface antigens recognized immune serovars c cause trachoma worlds leading cause preventable infectious serovars k infect genital tract causing pelvic inflammatory disease ectopic pregnancies infertility serovars cause invasive infection lymph nodes near genitals called lymphogranuloma c trachomatis thought diverged chlamydia species around million years ago genus contains total nine species c trachomatis c muridarum c pneumoniae c pecorum c suis c abortus c felis c caviae c psittaci closest relative c trachomatis c muridarum infects c trachomatis along c pneumoniae found infect humans greater extent c trachomatis exclusively infects humans c pneumoniae found also infect horses marsupials frogs species considerable impact human health due known zoonotic transmissioncitation needed strains cause lymphogranuloma venereum serovars prevalent genital strains serovars df less prevalent genital strains serovars gk strains serovar ocular strains serovars ac clinical signs symptoms c trachomatis infection genitalia present chlamydia infection may asymptomatic may resemble gonorrhea common causes multiple conditions including pelvic inflammatory disease c trachomatis single important infectious agent associated blindness trachoma also affects eyes form inclusion conjunctivitis responsible adult cases c trachomatis lungs presents chlamydia pneumoniae respiratory infection affect elementary bodies generally present semen infected men vaginal secretions infected come contact new host cell elementary bodies bind cell via interaction adhesins surface several host receptor proteins heparan sulfate attached bacteria inject various effector proteins host cell using type three secretion effectors trigger host cell take elementary bodies prevent cell triggering within hours infection elementary bodies transition reticulate bodies number new effectors effectors include number proteins modify inclusion membrane called inc proteins well proteins redirect host vesicles hours infection another set effectors synthesized driving acquisition nutrients host stage reticulate bodies begin divide coinciding expansion several elementary bodies infected single cell inclusions fuse point create single large inclusion host hours infection reticulate bodies transition elementary bodies released either lysis host cell extrusion entire inclusion host genital people infected c trachomatis asymptomatic however bacteria present one three ways genitourinary genitals pulmonary lungs ocular genitourinary cases include genital discharge vaginal bleeding itchiness pruritus painful urination dysuria among often symptoms similar urinary tract infectioncitation needed c trachomatis presents eye form trachoma begins gradually thickening eyelids eventually begins pull eyelashes form inclusion conjunctivitis infection presents redness swelling mucopurulent discharge eye symptoms associated adult c trachomatis lungs form respiratory infection typically symptoms runny stuffy nose lowgrade fever hoarseness voice well symptoms associated general c trachomatis may latently infect chorionic villi tissues pregnant women thereby impacting pregnancy three times many women diagnosed genitourinary c trachomatis infections men women aged highest prevalence followed women aged although rate increase diagnosis greater men women risk factors genitourinary infections include unprotected sex multiple partners lack condom use low socioeconomic status living urban pulmonary infections occur infants born women active chlamydia infections although rate infection less ocular infections take form inclusion conjunctivitis trachoma adults children million worldwide develop c trachomatis eye infections million blinded result trachoma primary source infectious blindness parts rural africa neglected tropical disease targeted world health organization elimination inclusion conjunctivitis c trachomatis responsible adult cases treatment depends infection site age patient whether another infection present c trachomatis one sexually transmitted infections time possible treatment often done partners simultaneously prevent reinfection c trachomatis may treated several antibiotic medications including azithromycin erythromycin tetracycline tetracycline preferred antibiotic treat ctrachomatis highest success rate azithromycin doxycycline equal efficacy treat c trachomatis percent success respectively azithromycin dosed gram tablet taken mouth single dose primarily help concerns treatment generic doxycycline mg twice day days equal success expensive delayedrelease doxycycline mg day erythromycin less preferred may cause gastrointestinal side effects lead nonadherence levofloxacin ofloxacin generally better azithromycin doxycycline treatment necessary pregnancy levofloxacin ofloxacin tetracycline doxycycline prescribed case patient pregnant medications typically prescribed azithromycin amoxicillin erythromycin azithromycin recommended medication taken gram tablet taken mouth single despite amoxicillin fewer side effects medications treating antenatal c trachomatis infection concerns pregnant women take penicillinclass antibiotics develop chronic persistent chlamydia tetracycline used children even adults withstand drug causing harm mother retesting pregnancy performed three weeks treatment risk reinfection high screening repeated throughout infection progressed ascending reproductive tract pelvic inflammatory disease develops damage fallopian tubes may already occurred cases c trachomatis infection treated outpatient basis azithromycin doxycycline treating mother infant c trachomatis eye evolve pneumonia recommended treatment consists oral erythromycin base ethylsuccinate mgkgday divided doses daily two weeks monitoring symptoms infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis ihps infants less weeks reported cases ctrachomatis strains resistant multiple antibiotic treatments however major cause concern antibiotic resistance rare ctrachomatis compared infectious chlamydia species readily identified distinguished chlamydia species using dnabased tests tests chlamydia ordered doctor lab strains c trachomatis recognized monoclonal antibodies mabs epitopes region however mabs may also crossreact two chlamydia species c suis c muridarumcitation needed due significance human health c trachomatis subject research laboratories around world bacteria commonly grown immortalised cell lines mccoy cells see rpmi hela infectious particles quantified infecting cell layers counting number inclusions analogous
