autotroph organism produces complex organic compounds carbohydrates fats proteins using carbon simple substances carbon generally using energy light photosynthesis inorganic chemical reactions convert abiotic source energy eg light energy stored organic compounds used organisms eg heterotrophs autotrophs need living source carbon energy producers food chain plants land algae water contrast heterotrophs consumers autotrophs heterotrophs autotrophs reduce carbon dioxide make organic compounds biosynthesis stored chemical fuel autotrophs use water reducing agent use hydrogen compounds hydrogen sulfide primary producers convert energy light phototroph photoautotroph energy inorganic chemical compounds chemotrophs chemolithotrophs build organic molecules usually accumulated form
