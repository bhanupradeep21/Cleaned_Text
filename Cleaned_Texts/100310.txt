health affect intelligence various ways conversely intelligence affect health health effects intelligence described among important factors origins human group differences iq test scores measures cognitive several factors lead significant cognitive impairment particularly occur pregnancy childhood brain growing barrier child less effective impairment may sometimes permanent sometimes partially
