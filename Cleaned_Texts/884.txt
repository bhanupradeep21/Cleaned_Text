holotype new genus species name nochnitsa nochnitsa named nocnitsa nocturnal haglike creature slavic mythology name intended parallel gorgons similarly haglike creatures greek mythology namesake many genera within gorgonopsia clade whole name also reflects nocturnal habits inferred genus type species name geminidens means twin tooth refers one autapomorphies species postcanine teeth arranged nochnitsa small gorgonopsian skull millimetres long relatively long snout five incisors canine six postcanine teeth side postcanine teeth autapomorphic genus arranged three pairs closely placed teeth separated longer diastemata pair posterior tooth larger mandible relatively slender lacks strong chin unlike although incompletely known holotype specimen nochnitsa contains part postcranial elements skull including cervical vertebrae dorsal vertebrae associated ribs right forelimb also preserved partially cervical vertebrae axial spine broadly rounded similar morphology gorgonopsians dorsal vertebrae preserved central transverse process fragments interspersed ribs ribs also simple elongated scapula elongated narrow weakly curved comparable gorgonopsians similar size like cyonosaurus different anteroposteriorly broadened scapular spines humerus relatively slender short poorly developed deltopectoral ridge muscles attach upper arm radius ulna distinct distal curvature distal tip radius forms discrete differentiated rim shaft olecranon process visible ulna possible result lesiona preserved proximal carpal elements consist radial ulnar two smaller irregular elements would probably represent centralia ulnar longest carpus proximodistal side widened proximal distal ends radial shorter rounded element possible centralia although poorly preserved appear weakly curved concave surface centralia would presumably articulated radial based conditions gorgonopsiansb several small irregular bones proximal carpals metacarpals probably represent distal carpals elements poorly preserved identified based great length relative manual elements two best preserved elements probably represent third fourth metacarpals longest gorgonopsians manus known shorter still elongated element may represent fifth metacarpal semiarticulated set poorly preserved bones appear represent fingers one potentially ending ungual based size phalanxlike elements probably correspond

mainly dominated large therocephalians specifically gorynychus viatkosuchus two taxa much larger nochnitsa viatkogorgon indicates gorgonopsians occupied smaller predatory roles large therocephalians confirmed fact several gorgonopsians appeared extinction end guadalupian reach considerably larger sizes two previously mentioned type ecological niche also similar seen pristerognathus assemblage zone karoo basin south africa prior main round gorgonopsian diversification however noted guadalupian gorgonopsians notably phorcys already larger size indicating genera shared similar
