anaerobic organism anaerobe organism require molecular oxygen growth may react negatively even die free oxygen present contrast aerobic organism aerobe organism requires oxygenated environment anaerobes may unicellular eg fungi obligate aerobes requiring oxygen survive however species chytridiomycota reside rumen cattle obligate anaerobes species anaerobic respiration used oxygen disrupt metabolism kill deep waters ocean common anoxic june letter royal society antonie van leeuwenhoek described experiment carried filling two identical glass tubes halfway crushed pepper powder clean rain water added van leeuwenhoek sealed one glass tubes using flame left glass tube open several days later discovered open glass tube great many little animalcules divers sort particular motion expecting see life sealed glass tube van leeuwenhoek saw surprise kind living animalcules round bigger biggest sort said water conditions sealed tube become quite anaerobic due consumption oxygen aerobic martinus beijerinck repeated van leeuwenhoeks experiment identified clostridium butyricum prominent anaerobic bacterium sealed pepper infusion tube liquid beijerinck commented thus come remarkable conclusion beyond doubt van leeuwenhoek experiment fully closed tube cultivated seen genuine anaerobic bacteria would happen years namely pasteur leeuwenhoek one hundred years discovery oxygen composition air aware meaning observations understandable fact closed tube observed increased gas pressure caused fermentative bacteria addition saw bacteria prove case good observer also able design experiment conclusion could practical purposes three categories anaerobe however classification questioned recent research showed human obligate anaerobes finegoldia magna methanogenic archaea methanobrevibacter smithii grown aerobic atmosphere culture medium supplemented antioxidants ascorbic acid glutathione uric obligate anaerobes use fermentation others use anaerobic aerotolerant organisms strictly presence oxygen facultative anaerobes use aerobic absence oxygen facultative anaerobes use fermentation others may use anaerobic many anaerobic fermentative reactions fermentative anaerobic organisms typically use lactic acid fermentation pathway energy released reaction without adp phosphate approximately kj per mol conserved generating two atp adp per glucose energy per sugar molecule typical aerobic reaction generates plants fungi eg yeasts general use alcohol ethanol fermentation oxygen becomes limiting energy released kj per mol conserved generating two atp adp per glucose anaerobic bacteria archaea use many fermentative pathways eg propionic acid butyric acid solvent fermentation mixed acid fermentation butanediol fermentation stickland fermentation acetogenesis methanogenesiscitation needed creatine organic compound found animals provides way atp utilized muscle phosphorylation creatine allows storage readily available phosphate supplied creatine atp phosphocreatine adp h reaction reversible well allowing cellular atp levels maintained anoxic process animals seen coupled metabolic suppression allow certain fish goldfish survive environmental anoxic conditions short since normal microbial culturing occurs atmospheric air contains molecular oxygen culturing anaerobes requires special techniques number techniques employed microbiologists culturing anaerobic organisms example handling bacteria glovebox filled nitrogen use specially sealed containers techniques injection bacteria dicot plant environment limited oxygen gaspak system isolated container achieves anaerobic environment reaction water sodium borohydride sodium bicarbonate tablets produce hydrogen gas carbon dioxide hydrogen reacts oxygen gas palladium catalyst produce water thereby removing oxygen gas issue gaspak method adverse reaction take place bacteria may die thioglycollate medium used thioglycollate supplies medium mimicking dicot plant thus providing anaerobic environment nutrients needed bacteria recently french team evidenced link redox gut anaerobes based clinical studies severe acute findings led development aerobic culture anaerobes addition antioxidants culture multicellular life forms anaerobic since aerobic respiration provide enough energy complex metabolism exceptions include three species loricifera mm size henneguya three species anaerobic loricifera discovered hypersaline anoxic latalante basin bottom mediterranean sea lack mitochondria contain oxidative phosphorylation pathway animals combines oxygen glucose produce metabolic energy thus consume oxygen instead loricifera derive energy hydrogen using henneguya zschokkei also lack mitochondria mitochondrial dna oxidative pathways microscopic parasitic cnidarian
