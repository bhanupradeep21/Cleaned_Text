mid late nineteenth century scientific patterns emerged contradicted widely held miasma theory disease findings led medical science know germ theory germ theory disease proposes invisible microorganisms bacteria viruses cause particular illnesses humans prior medicine becoming hard science many philosophical theories disease originated transmitted though early thinkers described possibility microorganisms mid late nineteenth century several noteworthy figures made discoveries would provide efficient practices tools prevent treat century figures set foundation change century figures solidified florence nightingale florence nightingale like majority people living victorian time period believed miasma theory though mathematician statistician asked british secretary war join nursing service crimean nightingale arrived scutari turkey conditions british army hospital gruesome noticed leading cause mortality soldiers battle rather infection though still believed time foul air caused disease miasma theory began cleaning protocol improve air men areas hospital covered feces plumbing sewer system broken water supply hospital mixed sewer infestation vermin nightingale reported concerns british sanitary commission could help large items agenda nightingale also implemented laundry service bedsheets clothing proposed handwashing procedures nurses patient bathing practices introduced clean bandages obtained healthy meals florence nightingale first came hospital doctors staff interested hearing ideas also disinterested use female nurses however hospital became understaffed overpopulated nightingale women came serve allowed make prior nightingale team mortality rate hospital roughly however new practices place number fell became public printed british news nightingale wandered hospital night checking patients became known lady lamp acquired new found prominence within nightingale wrote experience hospital returned notes matters affecting health efficiency hospital administration british army written sent queen work outlined horrific issues witnessed british army hospital nightingale lobbied hospital reform worked epidemiologist william farr gather data leading cause mortality british created visual representation data people could interpret next book titled notes hospitals written like textbook multiple editions book served hospital manual patient care work included optimal way physically build hospital contained statistics william farr helped provide supported statistician able compile describe empirical evidence written works justified hospital reform changes deemed proposed changes like quarantined wards certain illnesses strict hygienic procedures decreased high rate infection within hospitals reformed even evidence proposed reforms widely accepted years initial lobbying though nightingale first believed bad air cause disease used term germ contribution dr richard quains medical dictionary published always chlorinated soda nurses wash hands especially dressing handling suspicious case may destroy germs expense cuticle takes cuticle must bad germs ignaz semmelweis ignaz semmelweis hungarian obstetrician began assisting johann klein vienna general hospitals first two maternity clinics also called lyingin wards semmelweis became concerned number women dying febrile illness called puerperal fever colloquially referred childbed childbed fever often occurred first days giving birth condition caused fever intense abdominal pains profound weakness ultimately death many acquired ignaz semmelweis began career obstetrics expectant mother entering maternity ward chance dying particular areas europe figure greater estimated death rate high childbed fever epidemic time made labor delivery major cause distress one clinics oversaw run physicians medical students operated midwives semmelweis noticed midwife clinic significantly lower mortality compelled semmelweis study techniques practices clinics great detail find distinguishing factors detailed autopsies women died ward performed mornings clinic despite attempts find major difference clinics semmelweis concluded procedures practices used first clue came form tragedy semmelweis friend clinic died performing autopsy cut hand cut sustained medical student accidentally silting hand scalpel procedure friend similar symptoms postmortem pathology mothers died childbed medical students performed autopsies prior delivering babies midwives participated labor delivery ignaz semmelweis made connection left pieces dead body could transmitted via physicians hands live body cause bacteria caused childbed fever semmelweiss medical clinic streptococcus though knowledge specific microorganisms like bacteria understood disease could transferred one body another like nightingale semmelweis also advocated changing bedsheets semmelweis required strict handwashing regimen clinic ran physicians medical students using chlorinated water brushes remove cadaver particles decreased death rate clinic mothers died march august introduction handwashing semmelweis published book titled etiology concept prevention puerperal fever met backlash medical community deemed offensive since doctors considered high status therefore dirty carriers semmelweis live see findings contribute germ theory disease began become obsessed speaking puerperal fever developed alzheimerstype symptoms led placed mental institution year semmelweis died sepsis sustaining wounds asylum wounds believed attempted escape caused beatingsabuse endured germ theory widely accepted semmelweis became celebrated figure several hospitals institutions named roughly years death scientists began support ideas became known father hand hygiene savior john snow england multiple cholera epidemics century earliest outbreak britain occurred year people died cholera within outbreaks first blamed poor said smell bad immoral population believed cause bad air foul urban air time prevailing theory disease transmitted miasma physician john snow anesthesiologist became well respected anesthetizing queen victoria using chloroform birth one children deadly cholera outbreak occurred close home london priorities changed snow became concerned determined discover origin cholera even though germ theory established yet felt outbreaks caused bad air infecting blood something entering persons gut snow determined inhaling bad air would result intestinal outbreak centralized suburb london called soho number deaths concerning enough families fled homes find new location live john snow theorized late cholera transmitted water essay titled mode communication specifically believed contamination water spread cholera time londons sewage system rudimentary unmaintained cesspools dumping waste river snow decided start investigation plotting public water pump located within soho district asked recent death records walked area find homes families victims victims families asked questions loved ones routines marked death map map revealed broad street area near mortalities street broad street water pump houses nearest pump affected however snow noted two places nearby affected pump explored one places workhouse walking distance pump workhouse saw deaths cholera yet workers discovered workhouse private water well employees drank instead broad street pump another nearby brewery deaths men given free beer drink throughout work outlier deaths snow decided investigate deaths occurred outside typical pattern map snow discovered woman niece though lived miles away pump died cholera interviewing surviving family member found lived area particularly liked broad street water sent servant particular pump get water niece house consumed water another outlier case involved two young school children died lived different street source water however two girls used broad street travel school back known drink well john snow already postulated nearly decade earlier water blame cholera epidemics investigation strengthened claim contemporary nightingale done also made connections events used visual empirical evidence support claims took sample water broad street pump studied microscope unlike water sources pumps water contained unknown microbe resembled white later bacteria given name vibrio cholerae recognized bacteria infects person though city fully convinced john snows theory cholera removed handle pump snow asked decreased death rate cholera rather quickly even though mortality rates already later discovered cracks nearby cesspool leaked fecal matter water broad modern medical science labeled transmission disease fecal oral time route disease unknown physicians public baby named frances lewis believed first case caused outbreak birth death certificate match time outbreak doctor listed cause death diarrheal attack mother cleaned diapers buckets threw water cesspool leaked water diligent investigation cholera outbreak john snow became member london epidemiological snow published second edition prior book mode communication cholera snow live see establishment germ theory disease late died stroke age joseph lister surgical techniques advanced century chances patient dying postoperative infection prior discovery germ theory disease surgeons clean surgical instruments operating table patients semmelweiss work hand hygiene either ignored unknown sawdust covered floor operative theater soak bodily fluids laudable puss draining surgical incision considered normal postoperative phenomena physicians special tools drain green liquid incision site tools touched infection sanitized surgeons believed long wasnt bad air operating room properly cared patient joseph lister british surgeon chosen regius professor surgical department glasgow lister worked wound dresser surgeon sir john eric erichsen told lister wound created miasmas air wound miasmas could spread patients surgical ward explanation gangrene within surgical lister observed wound kept clean patient less likely develop infections wound could lister read french chemists louis pasteurs work fermentation distilling process winery france wine contaminated pasteur used heat destroy responsible pasteur also noted absence air fermentation wine impossible microbes yeast reacted air spontaneously generated air miasma theory taught lister found inspiration pasteurs fermentation work wondered microbes within wound needed destroyed covered wouldnt react however unlike pasteur lister could use heat destroy microbes wound instead decided use chemical called carbolic acid heard use creosote sanitize standard treatment compression fractures time amputation limb lister noted patients received amputation hospital died august boy brought hospital compression fracture left tibia instead amputating leg advised team thoroughly clean wound carbolic acid set leg wooden boards place cloth soaked carbolic acid top injury lister hoped would allow child keep leg also prevent fatal sepsis wound boy hospital days signs infection fracture site bones began fuse child made full recovery successful treatment lister continued treat compression fractures lister noticed key difference compression fractures regular fractures compression fractures caused exposed wound new treatment protocols reduced death rate accident ward lister decided treat wounds also limit chances postoperative infection new surgical practices cleaned patients bodies carbolic acid along tools hands operation however glasgow infirmary believe new methods wards cleaned professorship position opened university edinburgh medical students urged administration appoint lister position lister gained large following medical students appointed edinburghunlike time glasgow facility significantly larger population medical students respected followed spite great success preventing infection medical community large accept new lister would gain notoriety performing procedure queen victoria abscess drained puss operation quick develop specialized tubing soaked carbolic acid drain abscess queen recovered praised listers work became known listerism germany first country enact antiseptic principles within many hospitals united states placed ban antiseptic techniques great success england spoke international conference philadelphia convinced several hospitals revoke germ theory denialism contagion theory rejection major hindrances medical progress century since lister queens blessing antiseptic policies became accepted medical practice semmelweis gain type support chlorinated lime handwashing protocol public eye side medical community lister however able persuade medical students clinicians joseph lister see work contribute medical science germ theory celebrated life instead death granted title baron lister lyme regis given place order merit news queens survival due antiseptics became widespread england became intrigued bodily cleanliness companies profited selling carbolic acid soaps fumigators oral antiseptic named lister notably acclaim marked shift away miasma theory medicine pasteurs influence lister demonstrates union scientific research informed medical practice listers claim bacteria causes wound infection wounds must kept clean still important principles modern medical care louis pasteur though nurses doctors beginning become skeptical miasma theory century prevailing explanations epidemics infections florence nightingale ignaz semmelweis john snow understood people could get sick objects water hands contaminated bodily fluids substances however answer case remained unknown louis pasteur french chemist discovered chirality studying crystals discovery became basis new form chemistry called pasteur studying paratartrate crystals discovered calcium paratartaric acid solutions growing fungi left right sides crystal split apart left side turned tartaric acid fermented microscope tartaric acid optically active polarized light alive substances rotated polarized light many contemporaries believed fermentation lifeless decomposing pasteur realized small alive substance may caused fermentation led examine process fermentation closely book researches molecular asymmetry natural organic products published work stated asymmetric molecules distinguished organic substances nonorganic ones pasteur asked napoleon iii study french wineries large portion french wine pasteur believed heating wine could destroy microorganisms contaminated process became known pasteur became curious contaminants came began study spontaneous generation time believed organisms could selfgenerate within rotting piece food stated previously listers segment doctors also believed wounds spontaneously generated miasmas within air hospital wards pasteur ran experiment boiled broth flasks long strawlike curved necks thin neck allowed small amount air flask without exposing contents particulates air around flask one flasks left flask thin neck allowed broth become exposed particles around bacteria quickly grew within flask another flask left tilted broth nearly pouring strawlike curved top liquid became cloudy bacteria also grew within broth protected particles took significantly longer amount time signs bacterial growth occurred within able disprove spontaneous generation broth exposed particles microbes around grew bacteria quick pasteur named theory contamination germ theory stated opposite miasma theory microbe carried air reacted live substances causing contamination microbes generate within pasteur stated microbes present considered major opposition predominant miasma theory like wine silk industry also important part frances economy however large numbers silkworms began dying diseases french government asked pasteur investigate pasture connected disease silk worms known pébrine parasite nosema bombycis disease called flacherie caused silkworms become dark brown pébrine thought form flacherie since caused brown dots pasteur discovered pébrine flacherie separate diseases pasteur claimed bacteria within silkworms intestinal track caused flacherie used microscope sort eggs infected effective way discarding diseased eggs worms would enter population pasteur able distinguish diseases specific microorganisms present silkworms began path germ specificity within louis pasteurs contemporary robert koch devoted much scientific study discovering certain pathogens connecting specific diseases scientists often competition one another kochpasteur rivalry wellknown part germ theorys history louis pasteur became chemistry professor sorbonne though continued study silkworms became curious could cure pasteur wanted discover work greater applications improving alcohol production diagnosing silkworms large numbers chickens dying cholera cultured bacteria chickens left cultures air long periods time happenchance bacteria reproduced yet became weaker considerably less used edward jenners early vaccination concept improved upon injecting chickens less virulent strain disease vaccinated chickens survived however still bacteria feces pasteur believed might explain asymptomatic carriers disease louis pasteur made presentation french academy sciences title presentation germ theory applications medicine science within presentation stated health mankind depended upon unseen organisms terrifying thought life mercy multiplication minute bodies consoling hope science always remain powerless pasteur also mentioned joseph lister successful using science medical practice theory would found new begun celebrated english surgeon dr lister among first understand next french academy sciences conference stopped scientists presentation childbed fever presenter said puerperal miasmas blame death mothers pasteur openly blamed clinicians hands conditions ward ignaz semmelweis discovered scientist said proof microbes pasture walked drew picture streptococcus bacteria responsible puerperal fever blackboard year pasteur examined blood cultures taken wombs women died child bed pasteur would develop vaccine anthrax discovering lower bacterias virality experiment groups livestock control group received injection group inoculated anthrax bacteria low virulence twelve days later injected fully virulent form anthrax groups within days control group died ill inoculated group survived symptoms twohundred people showed observe success pasteurs vaccination gave fame many domains among crowd politicians veterinarians agriculturists popularity would lead pasteur institute system brazils emperor dom pedro ii intellectual followed pasteurs work first institute open paris institute instead one located rio de janeiro facility dedicated study louis pasteurs final contribution vaccination rabies unlike bacteria viruses less understood time pasteur could observe microscope however understood virus attacking nervous system failed attempts attenuating virus extracted spinal fluid rabbits rabies left flasks open air dry method finally decreased virulence rabies dom pedro iii wanted pasteur test successful vaccine human subjects specifically convicts sentenced death pasteur wrote letter back hand trembled thought injecting though pasteur fearful faced choice child brought hôpital des enfantsmalades multiple bites rabid dog childs doctor joseph grancher asked pasteur treat boy even though pasteur unsure vaccines affect human dr grancher reminded pasteur would die since louis pasteur physician dr grancher injected boy first injection july child given injections span days never contracted rabies first human get louis pasteur known pioneer microbiology father people world wanted get vaccinated rabies l institut pasteur constructed pasteurs health declined last birthday widely celebrated scientific community died buried within mausoleum inside pasteur institute scientists continued research institutes discovered pathogens important prophylactic robert koch pasteur proved microscopic organisms cause disease biological processes like fermentation robert koch german physician contemporary louis pasteur also interested research however koch instrumental discovery observation illnesscausing bacteria koch contributed greatly science related specificity bacteria discovered confirmed specific bacteria causes specific anthrax major cause concern farmers people living area outbreak within fouryear time span animals nearly people died devastating koch worked home laboratory unravel mystery caused anthrax microscope lab gift despite limitations koch ran experiment injecting mice anthrax infected blood also injected mice blood healthy livestock mice received anthrax infected blood died next examining mice died discovered rod shaped organisms within blood tissues continued inject mice recirculating diseased blood dead mice ones alive koch continued mice still died anthrax rods changed shape upon evaluation elongated rods appeared process koch took eye ox placed anthrax bacteria within predicted bacteria alive proven true bacteria multiplied kept track reproduction noted bacteria would create spores reproducing within since living kept spores years could still infect organism even dried predicted spores resilient remained fields pastures even fields hadnt used animal husbandry long koch suggested farmers cremate animal died anthrax prevent spore generation occurring experiment first prove specific bacteria caused specific illness specific published paper titled etiology anthrax disease based evolutionary history bacillus anthracis written german included drawing bacteria would become first scientist produce photograph bacteria staining first time anyone seen actual photograph microbe even though would discovered later bacillus anthracis cause anthrax monumental experiment laid foundation field koch felt limited technique using liquid create cultures liquid base could lead contamination uncertainty proper bacterial assistants wife suggested use agar took longer time melt julius petri another assistant koch created circular dish lit could hold agar solution prevent impurities ruining starting koch wanted discover cause one deadliest illnesses europe time people understood transmitted contagious substance didnt know contagion bacteria difficult see several tried view without success koch first took tubercules lungs animals allowed dry turned powders method failed create proper staining method successful revealing bacillus anthracis microscope successfully reveal tuberculosis bacteria dye methylene blue took full day stain animal tissue koch used heat speed process staining tubercle bacilli approach lowered staining period hours hour dye stained tissue stained secondary dye called vesuvine used reveal secondary dye added koch discovered animals tissue stained brown tuberculosis bacteria rods bright blue kochs work finished though still needed make sure seeing caused tuberculosis went become first person successfully create pure tuberculosis culture injected animals bacteria found tuberculosis rods tissues also discovered noninfected animal housed infected animal would also die tuberculosis bacteria also found tissue koch stated tuberculosis could spread human discovering tuberculosis culturing proving caused tuberculosis robert koch awarded nobel prize gave lecture findings berlin physiological society presentation considered one groundbreaking presentations ever witnessed field koch created called four postulates determining microorganism causse disease four original criteria microorganism must present every case disease microorganism must isolated diseased host grown pure culture laboratory microorganism must cause disease introduced new host microorganism recovered new host postulates created foundation medical bacteriology koch understanding viruses second postulate impossible viral bodies however postulates causal claims reformed many years knowledge certain germ cause particular like louis pasteur robert koch opened institute scientists could continue work remains location germany street called nordufer robert koch died heart attack placed inside mausoleum within robert koch institute building houses items related robert koch including various writings scientific materials prepared microscope institute still active research public health facility facility helped awareness response training public health intelligence team aided countries
