vagus nerve also known tenth cranial nerve cranial nerve x simply cn x cranial nerve carries sensory fibers create pathway interfaces parasympathetic control heart lungs digestive comprises two left right vagus typically referred collectively single subsystem vagus longest nerve autonomic nervous system human body comprises sensory motor fibers sensory fibers originate neurons nodose ganglion whereas motor fibers come neurons dorsal motor nucleus vagus nucleus vagus also historically called pneumogastric nerve upon leaving medulla oblongata olive inferior cerebellar peduncle vagus nerve
