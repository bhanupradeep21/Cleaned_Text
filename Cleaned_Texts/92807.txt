dialigntx multiple sequence alignment program written amarendran r subramanian substantial improvement dialignt combining greedy progressive alignment strategies new algorithm original dialignt reimplementation multiplealignment program dialign due several algorithmic improvements produces significantly better alignments locally globally related sequence sets previous versions dialign however like original implementation program dialignt uses straightforward greedy approach assemble multiple alignments local pairwise sequence similarities greedy approaches may vulnerable spurious random similarities therefore lead suboptimal results dialigntx substantial improvement dialignt combines previous greedy algorithm progressive alignment approach httpsenwikipediaorgwikidialigntx
