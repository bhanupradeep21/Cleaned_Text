gauchers disease gaucher disease ɡoʊˈʃeɪ gd genetic disorder glucocerebroside sphingolipid also known glucosylceramide accumulates cells certain organs disorder characterized bruising fatigue anemia low blood platelet count enlargement liver spleen caused hereditary deficiency enzyme glucocerebrosidase also known glucosylceramidase acts glucocerebroside enzyme defective glucocerebroside accumulates particularly white blood cells especially macrophages mononuclear leukocytes often target intracellular parasites glucocerebroside collect spleen liver kidneys lungs brain bone marrow manifestations may include enlarged spleen liver liver malfunction skeletal disorders bone lesions may painful severe neurological complications swelling lymph nodes occasionally adjacent joints distended abdomen brownish tint skin anemia low blood platelet count yellow fatty deposits white eye sclera persons seriously affected may also susceptible infection forms gauchers disease may treated enzyme replacement therapy disease caused recessive mutation gba gene located chromosome affects males females one people united states carriers common type gaucher disease carrier rate among ashkenazi jews birth incidence gauchers disease common lysosomal storage form sphingolipidosis subgroup lysosomal storage diseases involves dysfunctional metabolism disease named french physician philippe gaucher originally described three types gauchers disease autosomal recessive parents must carriers child affected parents carriers chance disease one four pregnancy affected child type linked particular mutations known gba gene mutations grouped three main gauchercausing mutations may entered ashkenazi jewish gene pool early middle ages generations disease caused defect housekeeping gene lysosomal glucocerebrosidase also known betaglucosidase ec pdb first chromosome enzyme acidlong protein catalyses breakdown glucocerebroside cell membrane constituent red white blood cells gaucher disease enzyme unable function correctly glucocerebroside accumulates macrophages clear cells unable eliminate waste product accumulates fibrils turn gaucher cells appear light microscopy resemble crumpledup exact mechanism neurotoxicity understood thought involve reaction different mutations gba betaglucosidase gene determine remaining activity enzyme type residual activity enzyme accounting lack neuropathology although correlation genotype phenotype neither amount stored lipids residual enzyme activity correlates well disease circumstance called alternative explanations accounting disease symptoms including heterozygotes particular acid betaglucosidase mutations carry fivefold risk developing parkinsons disease making common known genetic risk factor cancer risk may increased particularly thought due accumulation glucosylceramide complex role inflammatory processes gaucher disease poorly elucidated however sphingolipids known participate inflammation apoptosis markers macrophage activation elevated people gaucher disease markers include angiotensinconverting enzyme cathepsin chitotriosidase blood plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha splenic gaucher cells engorged gaucher disease suggested based overall clinical picture initial laboratory testing may include enzyme testing result lower mean normal activity considered decreased enzyme levels often confirmed genetic testing numerous different mutations occur sequencing betaglucosidase gene sometimes necessary confirm diagnosis prenatal diagnosis available useful known genetic risk factor presentcitation needed diagnosis also implied biochemical abnormalities high alkaline phosphatase angiotensinconverting enzyme immunoglobulin levels cell analysis showing crinkled paper cytoplasm glycolipidladen macrophagescitation needed lysosomal enzymes elevated including tartrateresistant acid phosphatase hexosaminidase human chitinase chitotriosidase latter enzyme proved useful monitoring gauchers disease activity response treatment may reflect severity gauchers disease gd three common clinical subtypes come criticism taking account full spectrum observable symptoms also compound heterozygous variations occur considerably increase complexity predicting disease course gd type nonneuropathic common least severe form disease symptoms may begin early life adulthood mainly affect liver spleen bone enlarged liver grossly enlarged spleen together hepatosplenomegaly spleen rupture cause additional complications skeletal weakness bone disease may spleen enlargement bone marrow replacement cause anemia thrombocytopenia leukopenia brain nervous system affected lung rarely kidney impairment may occur patients group usually bruise easily due low levels platelets experience fatigue due low numbers red blood cells depending disease onset severity type patients may live well adulthood range severity symptoms vary dramatically patientscitation needed gd type ii acute infantile neuropathic typically begins within six months birth incidence rate around live births symptoms include enlarged liver spleen extensive progressive brain damage eye movement disorders spasticity seizures limb rigidity poor ability suck swallow affected children usually die age two gd type iii chronic neuropathic begin time childhood even adulthood occurs live births characterized slowly progressive milder neurologic symptoms compared acute type ii version major symptoms include enlarged spleen andor liver seizures poor coordination skeletal irregularities eye movement disorders blood disorders including anemia respiratory problems patients often live early teen years typei typeiii enzyme replacement treatment intravenous recombinant glucocerebrosidase decrease liver spleen size reduce skeletal abnormalities reverse treatment costs annually single person continued life rarity disease means dosefinding studies difficult conduct controversy remains optimal dose dosing due low incidence become orphan drug many countries meaning government recognizes accommodates financial constraints limit research drugs address small populationcitation needed first drug gauchers alglucerase ceredase version glucocerebrosidase harvested human placental tissue modified approved fda withdrawn due approval similar drugs made recombinant dna technology instead harvested tissue drugs made recombinantly preferable since concern diseases transmitted tissue used harvesting fewer risks variations enzyme structure batch batch less expensive available recombinant glucocerebrosidases miglustat small molecule orally available drug first approved gauchers disease europe works preventing formation glucocerebroside substance builds causes harm gauchers approach called substrate reduction eliglustat cerdelga approved also small molecule compound believed work inhibition glucosylceramide synthase national gaucher foundation united states states incidence gauchers disease one live around one people general us population carrier type gauchers disease giving prevalence one among ashkenazi jews rate carriers considerably higher roughly one type ii
