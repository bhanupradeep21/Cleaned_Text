cholinesterase inhibitors cause nightmares due enhanced activation visual association cortex rem dosing donepezil morning reduce frequency donepezil used caution people heart disease cardiac conduction disturbances chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma severe cardiac arrhythmia sick sinus people peptic ulcer disease taking nsaids use caution increased risk gastrointestinal bleeding slow heart beat fainting people heart problems also seen symptoms may appear frequent initiating treatment increasing donepezil dose although occurrence seizures rare people predisposition seizures treated daily donepezil suspended days less restarting dose recommended suspension lasts longer days retitrate mg daily donepezil binds reversibly inactivates cholinesterases thus inhibiting hydrolysis acetylcholine increases acetylcholine concentrations cholinergic precise mechanism action donepezil patients alzheimers disease fully understood certainly alzheimers disease involves substantial loss elements cholinergic system generally accepted symptoms alzheimers disease related cholinergic deficit particularly cerebral cortex areas addition actions acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil found act potent agonist receptor ki nm shown produce specific antiamnestic effects animals mainly via noncholinergic mechanisms also donepezil upregulates nicotinic receptors cortical neurons adding neuroprotective inhibits voltageactivated sodium currents reversibly delays rectifier potassium currents fast transient potassium currents although action unlikely contribute
