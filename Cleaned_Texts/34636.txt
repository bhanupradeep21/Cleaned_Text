iris cysts hollow cavities eye filled secretion come various sizes numbers shapes pigments freefloating attached pupillary margin within posterior frequently iris cysts dont cause issues cause problems like fly biting behavior corneal endothelial pigment lens capsular pigmentation altered iris movement decreased aqueous outflow subsequent glaucoma block vision grown acquired innate possible causes inflammation druginduced uveitis trauma tumorinduced parasitic frequently iris cysts benign need treatment sometimes iris cysts causing problems need deflated iris cysts treated trans corneal diode laser treatment fineneedle aspiration surgical treatment iris cysts conservative approach mackenzie diagnosed first iris cyst posttraumatic iris cyst anterior wide variety iris cysts categorization needed categorization proposed shields based main groups primary secondary cyst primary cysts origin neuroepithelial rarely causes issue primary cysts subcategorized based location eye however secondary cysts cause problems like decreased vision secondary glaucoma uveitis corneal edema origin implantation metastasis miotics parasites secondary cysts categorized based iris thin circular structure eye consists two layers top stroma underneath pigmented epithelial cells separates eye anterior posterior chamber responsible eyes color function regulate size pupil controlling size pupil regulates amount light reaching retina depending amount light iris opens high intensity light closes low intensity iris able control size pupil due radial circular muscles attach stroma circular muscle sphincter muscle contracts circular motion making pupil smaller contracting radial muscles dilator muscles pupil classification primary cysts according categorization shields origin primary cysts neuroepithelial primary cysts rarely causing problems fluidfilled smooth surfaces subcategorized according location eye pupillary cysts also central cysts located pupillary margin iris root midzonal cysts located iris root ciliary body peripheral cysts located iridociliary sulcus freefloating cysts occur anterior vitreous chamber usually dislodged epithelium cysts iris stroma anteriorly located develop usually cause deformation iris need treatment especially congenital secondary cysts require often treatment usually unilateral solitary acquired secondary cysts hand require rarely treatment often occur later age secondary cysts usually unilateral solitary smooth surface secondary cysts may obstruct eyes vision cause intraocular pressure iris displacement categorization secondary cysts categorized according shields secondary cysts classified subcategories iris cyst must differentiated kinds possible bodies eye body established iris cyst must categorized primary secondary necessary differentiate secondary cysts even clinical examination achieve differentiation use multimodal imaging techniques like ubm ultrasound bscan usb anterior segment optical coherence tomography asoct magnetic resonance primary cysts come various sizes number usually fluidfilled regular borders smooth surface iris could slightly displaced anteriorly primary cyst normally problems occur primary cysts secondary cysts cause times problems thus also need treatment secondary cysts usually rough surface irregular borders solitary unilateral possible problems could displacement iris iritis raised intraocular clinician also able tell difference cyst tumor main differences cysts usually cause displacement iris whereas tumor arises grows iris stroma presence intrinsic sentinel vessel probably deal tumor last main difference shown transillumination since transillumination always creates shadow tumor almost never ultrasound bscan usb uses wavelengths mhz form image eye usb used identify extension iris cyst either anterior posterior chamber also used identify midzonal cysts behind iris determine whether ciliary body involvement preferred method determine ciliary body involvement however usb ultrasound ultrasound biomicroscopy ubm higher resolution usb also uses soundwaves higher frequency mhz ubm used identification thin ultrastructures internal echogenicity cysts due high resolution small cysts easily distinguished multilocated cysts easy find easier determine whether cyst bilateral disadvantage ubm limited penetration despite disadvantage ubm still golden standard diagnosis iris asoct highest resolution diagnosis methods major disadvantage asoct creates heavy shadowing caused iris pigment epithelium regarding iris lesions asoct used show anterior border iris lesion internal structure cyst behind cyst however clear due heavy shadowing ubm preferred asoct borders less visible ubm whole structure cyst surrounding tissues fineneedle aspiration fna used every method failed establish kind cyst presumably solid tumor fna used last diagnosis method invasive method since eye penetrated needle fna successful differentiating tumors cystic spaces like melanomas adenomas metastatic tumors fna also used mri used diagnosis method used method gain extra information cyst magnetic resonance imaging establish well whether cyst contact attached sclera whether cyst primary tumor preferred treatment option observation since iris cysts hurt cause pressure veterinarian however prefers check cyst time time make sure cyst grow cause problems pain cyst growing causing pain issues time cyst need another fineneedle aspiration fna discussed earlier also diagnosis method also used treatment fna fine needle inserted eye cyst purpose needle penetrate membrane cyst cyst deflate method proven successful possibility cyst disappear fully shrink cyst shrunk enough causing pain trouble anymore second treatment might necessary cyst still causing issue treatment treatment must repeated another method intracystic injection absolute alcohol proven effective method alcohol gets injected cyst needle penetrating eye outside cyst injection alcohol regresses cyst least stabilize take weeks cyst disappeared fully common side effect method inflammation anterior chamber easily treated topical steroids cream gel antiinflammatory antimitotic agents used mainly cyst resistant treatments apart surgery since surgery last resort antimitotic agents injected cyst left inside minutes minutes agents rinsed antimitotic agents side effect creating small inflammation easily treated topical steroids antimitotic agents stop mitose cells cyst interfering particular phase cell cycle stops cyst growing eventually kill cells thus laser therapy treatment repeated several times treatment gets repeated every week cyst gone despite highest success rate nowadays preferred treatment iris cyst least invasive method since eye doesnt need punctured cut two kinds laser beams used laser therapy thermal diode argon laser ndyag laser sometimes methods combined better result since thermal laser harden cyst stop intracystic fluid production ndyag perforate cyst membrane drain surgery considered last resort surgery highest chance complications surgical approach depends cyst located big cyst number cysts many options treating iris cyst mentioned used treatments past methods havent successful enough still used today clinician consider lot things choosing treatment golden rule treating iris cysts however choose least invasive method means cysts causing problems treated observed least invasive treatment laser therapy therefore also preferred method treat iris cyst depending kind cyst clinician choose either antimitotic agents asoct laser failed laser possible unlike fna used due low potential removing cyst surgery invasive method one highest chance complications surgery last httpsenwikipediaorgwikiiriscyst
