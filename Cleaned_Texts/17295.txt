effects include movement problems sleepiness dry mouth low blood pressure upon standing increased serious side effects may include potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia neuroleptic malignant syndrome severe lowering seizure threshold low white blood cell older people psychosis result dementia may increase risk unclear safe use chlorpromazine developed first antipsychotic world health organizations list essential introduction labeled one great advances history available generic chlorpromazine used treatment acute chronic psychoses including schizophrenia

schizophrenia compared placebo group patients chlorpromazine experienced less relapse months years followup difference found two groups beyond two years followup patients chlorpromazine showed global improvement symptoms functioning systematic review also highlighted fact side effects drug severe debilitating including sedation considerable weight gain lowering blood pressure increased risk acute movement disorders also noted quality evidence included trials low trials could included systematic review due poor quality called research subject chlorpromazine cheap benchmark drug one used

evidence suggests conservative dosing incidence effects chlorpromazine may comparable newer agents risperidone chlorpromazine may deposit ocular tissues taken high dosages long periods time absolute contraindications relative contraindications rarely elongation qt interval may occur increasing risk potentially fatal consuming food prior taking chlorpromazine orally limits absorption likewise cotreatment benztropine also reduce chlorpromazine alcohol also reduce chlorpromazine antacids slow chlorpromazine lithium chronic treatment barbiturates increase chlorpromazine clearance tricyclic antidepressants tcas decrease chlorpromazine clearance hence increase chlorpromazine cotreatment inhibitors like ciprofloxacin fluvoxamine vemurafenib reduce chlorpromazine clearance hence increase exposure potentially also adverse chlorpromazine also potentiate cns depressant effects drugs like barbiturates benzodiazepines opioids lithium anesthetics hence increase potential adverse effects respiratory depression chlorprozamine also moderate inhibitor substrate hence inhibit also inhibit clearance substrates dextromethorphan potentiating drugs like codeine tamoxifen require activation respective active metabolites may therapeutic effects likewise inhibitors paroxetine fluoxetine reduce chlorpromazine clearance increasing serum levels chlorpromazine potentially adverse chlorpromazine also reduces phenytoin levels increases valproic acid also reduces propranolol clearance antagonizes therapeutic effects antidiabetic agents levodopa parkinsons medication likely due fact chlorpromazine antagonizes receptor one receptors dopamine levodopa metabolite activates amphetamines may also interact anticholinergic drugs orphenadrine produce hypoglycaemia low blood chlorpromazine may also interact epinephrine adrenaline produce paradoxical fall blood monoamine oxidase inhibitors maois thiazide diuretics may also accentuate orthostatic hypotension experienced receiving chlorpromazine quinidine may interact chlorpromazine increase myocardial likewise may also antagonize effects clonidine also may reduce seizure threshold hence corresponding titration anticonvulsant treatments prochlorperazine desferrioxamine may also interact chlorpromazine produce transient metabolic drugs prolong qt interval quinidine verapamil amiodarone sotalol methadone may also interact chlorpromazine produce additive qt interval british national formulary recommends gradual withdrawal discontinuing antipsychotics avoid acute withdrawal syndrome rapid symptoms withdrawal commonly include nausea vomiting loss symptoms may include restlessness increased sweating trouble less commonly may feeling world spinning numbness muscle symptoms generally resolve short
