dinoseb common industry name herbicide dinitrophenol family crystalline orange solid readily dissolve water dinoseb banned herbicide european union eu united states toxicity also finds use polymerisation inhibitor often referred dnbp used prevent thermally induced polymerisation styrene unsaturated monomers purified distillation dinitroorthocresol chemical compound closely related dinoseb discovered germany first used insecticide later also used herbicide also fungicide characteristics discovered orthomethyl group replaced secbutyl group producing dinoseb compound superior contact stomach activity insects dinoseb became commercially available approved use united states based safety data industrial biotest january danish ship dana optima lost drums dinoseb trip north shields england esbjerg denmark four months drums found dinoseb withdrawn market due increased threat birth defects female field workers exposed chemical could also cause sterility men exposed dinoseb herbicide widely used weedcontrol producing crops like soybeans vegetables fruits nuts citrus present dinoseb banned eu united states due high toxicity however dinoseb still used china example evidenced fact found rain drinking water nowadays safer herbicides dinoseb also used insecticide protect grapes internet dinoseb dinitrophenols bought weightloss pills dangerous however many people died accidental dinoseb uncoupler oxidative phosphorylation weak acid pass lipid membranes undissociated form uses property transport protons inner mitochondrial membrane protons taken intermembrane space transport imm released mitochondrial matrix dinoseb dissociated form negatively charged causes move intermembrane space electrochemical gradient exists across imm negative charge delocalized ring increasing anions membrane permeability lowering proton gradient dinoseb removes cells ability produce atp resulting death cell dinoseb also weak inhibitor mitochondrial complex complex ii repiratory plants dinoseb also inhibits photosynthesis inhibiting electron flow photocomplex ii result plastoquinone cant create proton gradient atp produced atp synthase also nadp cant reduced form nadph removes ability create glucose carbon dioxide also leads cell death oral administration dinoseb tagged rats mice turned excreted urine ended feces tlc data showed presence different metabolites dinoseb although finding confirmed different vitro vivo studies one study administered pregnant mice data showed rate absorption intraperitoneal administration much higher oral administration furthermore molecules containing found tissues mother embryo although embryonic tissues contained lower concentration three hours oral intraperitoneal administration kidneys liver mother dinoseb metabolites however kidneys liver embryo dinoseb oral administration intraperitoneal administration dinoseb highly toxic ingesting inhaling skin contact symptoms include fatigue sweating headaches nausea stomach aches also irritant eyes skin contact causes burns turns yellow pregnant women substance especially dangerous cause growth defects unborn children teratogenic dinoseb interferes oxidative phosphorylation acting uncoupler production atp mitochondria done making inner membrane mitochondria permeable protons protons return mitochondrial matrix easily results lower difference proton concentration either side inner mitochondrial membrane words proton gradient lower membrane potential lower membrane potential driving force production atp cell unable produce exposure dinoseb also induces ermediated calcium release resulting increased intracellular calcium levels followed activation caspase protease involved cell apoptosis surviving cells increase alphasynuclein levels leads dopaminergic dinoseb cross biological membranes like bloodbrain barrier placental barrier explains dinoseb particularly dangerous pregnant women compound pass placental barrier unborn child exposed dinoseb via blood oral values dinoseb range mgkg rats mice rabbits guinea humans dinoseb toxic compound human also animals rats fish birds rats dinoseb causes acute toxicity rats single dose circa fourteen days rats die given mgkg dinoseb orally much needed rats exposed dinoseb via skin case dies rats exposed mgkg dinoseb injected dose mgkg cause death also rats turned dinoseb capable go placenta therefore causes embryotoxic teratogenic fish dinoseb also highly toxic fish fish able take dinoseb quickly small fish like goldfish ppm needed kill fish water fish lives acidic water environment dinoseb toxic fish lives neutral alkaline water environment dinoseb slightly birds found dinoseb also highly toxic birds birds given single dose mgkg around birds dies birds exposed dinoseb via small streams research also shown dinoseb carcinogenic female mice male nowadays dinoseb banned lot places world due high incidences birth defects ban lot people exposed dinoseb anymore someone exposed things done first aid victim exposed via four ways inhalation skin eyes ingestion first aid measures four ways exposure inhalation victim get fresh air needed victim administered oxygen assisted ventilation bronchospasm treated agonist corticosteroid aerosols skin contaminated clothing jewellery removed victim victims skin hair nails washed thoroughly soap several times eyes victims eyes immediately rinsed running water needed least minutes contact lenses removed possible ingestion victims mouth rinsed first victim given charcoal slurry ml g charcoal possible victim conscious four cases victim see first step synthesis dinoseb synthesis first protonated secondary carbocation formed happen acidic conditions formed carbocation undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution phenol product reaction second step synthesis dinoseb nitration first nitronium ion formed nitric acid sulfuric takes nitronium ion form arenium ion three resonance structures water cleave additional proton form neutral product reaction undergo second nitration form dinoseb dinoseb racemic mixture two enantiomers httpsenwikipediaorgwikidinoseb
