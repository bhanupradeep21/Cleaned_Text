nosebleed also known epistaxis instance bleeding blood flow stomach cause nausea severe cases blood may come rarely bleeding may significant low blood pressure blood may also come nasolacrimal duct risk factors include trauma including putting finger nose blood thinners high blood pressure alcoholism seasonal allergies dry weather inhaled two types anterior common posterior less common anterior nosebleeds generally occur kiesselbachs plexus posterior bleeds generally occur sphenopalatine artery woodruffs diagnosis direct prevention may include use petroleum jelly initially treatment generally application pressure least five minutes lower half sufficient nasal packing may tranexamic acid may also bleeding episodes continue endoscopy people nosebleed point nosebleeds nosebleeds rarely fatal accounting million deaths us nosebleeds commonly affect younger older nosebleeds occur due variety reasons common causes include trauma nose picking blunt trauma motor vehicle accident insertion foreign object likely relative humidity including centrally heated buildings respiratory tract infections chronic sinusitis rhinitis environmental irritants cause inflammation thinning tissue nose leading greater likelihood bleeding causes nose bleeding selflimiting require medical attention however nosebleeds recurrent respond home therapies underlying cause may need investigated rarer causes listed coagulopathy dietary inflammatory medicationsdrugs neoplastic traumatic vascular nasal mucosa contains rich blood supply easily ruptured cause bleeding rupture may spontaneous initiated trauma nosebleeds reported population peak incidences age ten age appear occur males increase blood pressure eg due general hypertension tends increase duration spontaneous anticoagulant medication disorders blood clotting promote prolong bleeding spontaneous epistaxis common elderly nasal mucosa lining becomes dry thin blood pressure tends higher elderly also prone prolonged nosebleeds blood vessels less able constrict control bleeding vast majority nosebleeds occur front anterior front part nose nasal septum area richly endowed blood vessels kiesselbachs plexus region also known littles area bleeding farther back nose known posterior bleed usually due bleeding woodruffs plexus venous plexus situated posterior part inferior posterior bleeds often prolonged difficult control associated bleeding nostrils greater flow blood sometimes blood flowing sources bleeding passes nasal cavity exits nostrils thus blood coming nose true nosebleed truly originating nasal cavity bleeding called pseudoepistaxis pseudo epistaxis examples include blood coughed airway ending nasal cavity dripping people uncomplicated nosebleeds use conservative methods prevent future nosebleeds sleeping humidified environment applying petroleum jelly nasal anterior nosebleeds stopped applying direct pressure helps promoting blood nosebleed first attempt blow blood clots apply pressure soft anterior part nose pinching nasal ala bony nasal bridge least five minutes pressure firm tilting head forward helps decrease chance nausea airway obstruction due blood dripping attempting stop nosebleed home head tilted swallowing excess blood irritate stomach cause vomiting vasoconstrictive medications oxymetazoline afrin phenylephrine widely available counter treatment allergic rhinitis may also used control benign cases example sprays oxymetazoline may applied bleeding sides nose followed application direct pressure nosebleeds last longer minutes despite use direct pressure vasoconstrictive medications oxymetazoline seek medical method involves applying chemical silver nitrate nasal mucosa burns seals eventually nasal tissue chemical applied undergo form treatment best mild bleeds especially children clearly topical anesthetic lidocaine usually applied prior cauterization silver nitrate cause blackening skin due silver sulfide deposit though fade silver nitrate deposited saline may used neutralize excess silver nitrate via formation silver chloride precipitate pressure chemical cauterization stop bleeding nasal packing mainstay nasal packing typically categorized anterior nasal packing posterior nasal nasal packing may also categorized dissolvable nondissolvable types dissolvable nasal packing materials stop bleeding use thrombotic agents promote blood clots surgicel thrombogenic foams gels require removal dissolve days typically dissolvable nasal packing first attempted bleeding persists nondissolvable nasal packing next option traditionally nasal packing accomplished packing gauze nose thereby placing pressure vessels nose stopping bleeding traditional gauze packing replaced nondissolvable nasal packing products merocel rapid merocel nasal tampon similar gauze packing except synthetic foam polymer made polyvinyl alcohol expands nose application water provides less hospitable medium rapid rhino stops nosebleeds using balloon catheter made carboxymethylcellulose cuff inflated air stop bleeding extra pressure nasal systematic review articles demonstrated efficacy stopping nosebleeds similar rapid rhino merocel packs however rapid rhino shown greater ease insertion reduced posterior nasal packing achieved using foley catheter blowing balloon back throat applying anterior traction inflated balloon occludes patients receive nondissolvable nasal packing need return medical professional hours order packing complications nondissolvable nasal packing include abscesses septal hematomas sinusitis pressure rare cases toxic shock syndrome occur prolonged nasal packing result patient nondissolvable nasal packing given prophylactic antibiotic medication taken long nasal packing remains ongoing bleeding despite good nasal packing surgical emergency treated endoscopic evaluation nasal cavity general anesthesia identify elusive bleeding point directly ligate tie blood vessels supplying nose blood vessels include sphenopalatine anterior posterior ethmoidal arteries rarely maxillary branch external carotid artery ligated bleeding also stopped intraarterial embolization using catheter placed groin threaded aorta bleeding vessel interventional difference outcomes embolization ligation treatment options embolization considerably continued bleeding may indication serious underlying tranexamic acid helps promote
