hormone greek participle ὁρμῶν setting motion class signaling molecules multicellular organisms sent distant organs complex biological processes regulate physiology hormones required correct development animals plants fungi due broad definition hormone signaling molecule exerts effects far site production numerous kinds molecules classified hormones among substances considered hormones eicosanoids eg prostaglandins thromboxanes steroids eg oestrogen brassinosteroid amino acid derivatives eg epinephrine auxin protein peptides eg insulin cle peptides gases eg ethylene nitric oxide hormones used communicate organs tissues vertebrates hormones responsible regulating wide range processes including physiological processes behavioral activities digestion metabolism respiration sensory perception sleep excretion lactation stress induction growth development movement reproduction mood plants hormones modulate almost aspects development germination hormones affect distant cells binding specific receptor proteins target cell resulting change cell function hormone binds receptor results activation signal transduction pathway typically activates gene transcription resulting increased expression target proteins hormones also act nongenomic pathways synergize genomic watersoluble hormones peptides amines generally act surface target cells via second messengers lipid soluble hormones steroids generally pass plasma membranes target cells cytoplasmic nuclear act within nuclei brassinosteroids type polyhydroxysteroids sixth class plant hormones may useful anticancer drug endocrineresponsive tumors cause apoptosis limit plant growth despite lipid soluble nevertheless attach receptor cell vertebrates endocrine glands specialized organs secrete hormones endocrine signaling system hormone secretion occurs response specific biochemical signals often subject negative feedback regulation instance high blood sugar serum glucose concentration promotes insulin synthesis insulin acts reduce glucose levels maintain homeostasis leading reduced insulin levels upon secretion watersoluble hormones readily transported circulatory system lipidsoluble hormones must bond carrier plasma glycoproteins eg thyroxinebinding globulin tbg form ligandprotein complexes hormones insulin growth hormones released bloodstream already fully active hormones called prohormones must activated certain cells series steps usually tightly endocrine system secretes hormones directly bloodstream typically via fenestrated capillaries whereas exocrine system secretes hormones indirectly using ducts hormones paracrine function diffuse interstitial spaces nearby target tissue plants lack specialized organs secretion hormones although spatial distribution hormone production example hormone auxin produced mainly tips young leaves shoot apical meristem lack specialised glands means main site hormone production change throughout life plant site production dependent plants age hormone producing cells found endocrine glands thyroid gland ovaries hormonal signaling involves following exocytosis methods membrane transport used secrete hormones endocrine glands signaled hierarchical model oversimplification hormonal signaling process cellular recipients particular hormonal signal may one several cell types reside within number different tissues case

hormones defined functionally structurally may diverse chemical structures hormones occur multicellular organisms plants animals fungi brown algae red algae compounds occur also unicellular organisms may act signaling molecules however agreement molecules called peptides derivatives compared vertebrates insects crustaceans possess number structurally unusual hormones juvenile hormone examples include abscisic acid auxin cytokinin ethylene hormones initiate cellular response initially binding either cell surface receptors intracellular receptors cell may several different receptors recognize hormone activate different signal transduction pathways cell may several different receptors recognize different hormones activate biochemical receptors peptide well many eicosanoid hormones embedded cell membrane cell surface receptors majority belong g proteincoupled receptor gpcr class seven alpha helix transmembrane proteins interaction hormone receptor typically triggers cascade secondary effects within cytoplasm cell described signal transduction often involving phosphorylation dephosphorylation various cytoplasmic proteins changes ion channel permeability increased concentrations intracellular molecules may act secondary messengers eg cyclic amp protein hormones also interact intracellular receptors located cytoplasm nucleus intracrine steroid thyroid hormones receptors located inside cell within cytoplasm target cell receptors belong nuclear receptor family ligandactivated transcription factors bind receptors hormones must first cross cell membrane lipidsoluble combined hormonereceptor complex moves across nuclear membrane nucleus cell binds specific dna sequences regulating expression certain genes thereby increasing levels proteins encoded however shown steroid receptors located inside cell associated plasma hormones following effects hormone may also regulate production release hormones hormone signals control internal environment body homeostasis rate hormone biosynthesis secretion often regulated homeostatic negative feedback control mechanism mechanism depends factors influence metabolism excretion hormones thus higher hormone concentration alone trigger negative feedback mechanism negative feedback must triggered overproduction effect hormone secretion stimulated inhibited one special group hormones tropic hormones stimulate hormone production endocrine glands example thyroidstimulating hormone tsh causes growth increased activity another endocrine gland thyroid increases output thyroid release active hormones quickly circulation hormone biosynthetic cells may produce store biologically inactive hormones form pre prohormones quickly converted active hormone form response particular eicosanoids considered act local hormones considered local possess specific effects target cells close site formation also rapid degradation cycle making sure reach distant sites within hormones also regulated receptor agonists hormones ligands kinds molecules produce signal binding receptor site protein hormone effects inhibited thus regulated competing ligands bind target receptor hormone question competing ligand bound receptor site hormone unable bind site unable elicit response target cell competing ligands called antagonists many hormones structural functional analogs used medication commonly prescribed hormones estrogens progestogens methods hormonal contraception thyroxine levothyroxine hypothyroidism steroids autoimmune diseases several respiratory disorders insulin used many diabetics local
