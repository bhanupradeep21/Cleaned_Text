changes menstruation disturbances experienced women commonly manifests amenorrhea oligomenorrhea latter case irregular menstrual flow may result abnormally heavy prolonged bleeding women pregnant nursing may also unexpectedly begin producing breast milk galactorrhea condition always associated high prolactin levels instance many premenopausal women experiencing hyperprolactinemia experience galactorrhea women experience galactorrhea diagnosed hyperprolactinemia thus galactorrhea may observed individuals normal prolactin levels necessarily indicate phenomenon likely due galactorrhea requiring adequate levels progesterone estrogen prepare breast tissue additionally women may also experience loss libido breast pain particularly prolactin levels rise initially hormone promotes
