neuroscientist neurobiologist scientist specialised knowledge neuroscience branch deals physiology biochemistry psychology anatomy molecular biology neurons neural circuits glial cells especially behavioral biological psychological aspect health disease neuroscientists generally work researchers within college university government agency private industry researchoriented careers neuroscientists typically spend time designing carrying scientific experiments contribute understanding nervous system function engage basic applied research basic research seeks add information current understanding nervous system whereas applied research seeks address specific problem developing treatment neurological disorder biomedicallyoriented neuroscientists typically engage applied research neuroscientists also number career opportunities outside realm research including careers industry science writing government program management science advocacy individuals commonly hold doctorate degrees sciences may also hold masters degree neuroscientists focus primarily study research nervous system nervous system composed brain spinal cord nerve cells studies nervous system may focus cellular level studies ion channels instead may focus systemic level behavioural cognitive studies significant portion nervous system studies devoted understanding diseases affect nervous system like multiple sclerosis alzheimers parkinsons lou gehrigs research commonly occurs private government public research institutions common tasks neuroscientists overall median salary neuroscientists united states may neuroscientists usually fulltime employees median salaries common work places united states shown neuroscientists research study biological psychological aspects nervous neuroscientists finish post doctoral programs go perform doctoral work take faculty neuroscientists use wide range mathematical methods computer programs biochemical approaches imaging techniques magnetic resonance imaging computed tomography angiography diffusion tensor imaging techniques allow scientists observe physical changes brain spinal cord signals occur neuroscientists also part several different neuroscience organizations publish read different research topics neuroscience expecting job growth considerably average job growth rate compared professions factors leading growth include aging population new discoveries leading new areas research increasing utilization medications government funding research also continue influence demand neuroscientists typically enroll fouryear undergraduate program move phd program graduate studies finished graduate studies neuroscientists may continue postdoctoral work gain lab experience explore new laboratory methods undergraduate years neuroscientists typically take physical life science courses gain foundation field research typical undergraduate majors include biology behavioral neuroscience cognitive many colleges universities phd training programs neurosciences often divisions cognitive cellular molecular computational systems neuroscience neuroscience unique perspective applied broad range disciplines thus fields neuroscientists work vary neuroscientists may study topics large hemispheres brain neurotransmitters synapses occurring neurons microlevel fields combine psychology neurobiology include cognitive neuroscience behavioural neuroscience cognitive neuroscientists study human consciousness specifically brain seen lens biochemical biophysical behavioral neuroscience encompasses whole nervous system environment brain areas show us aspects motivation learning motor skills along many computational neuroscience uses mathematical models understand brain processes first writings brain come egyptians bc first known written description brain also indicated location brain injuries may related specific symptoms document contrasted common theory time egyptians writings spiritual describing thought feelings responsibilities heart idea widely accepted found century plato believed brain locus mental processes however aristotle believed instead heart source mental processes brain acted cooling system cardiovascular middle ages galen made considerable impact human anatomy terms neuroscience galen described seven cranial nerves functions along giving foundational understanding spinal cord came brain believed sensory sensation caused middle brain motor sensations produced anterior portion brain galen imparted ideas mental health disorders caused disorders arise believed cause backedup black bile epilepsy caused phlegm galens observations neuroscience challenged many medieval beliefs generally held true proposals galen including attribution mental processes specific ventricles brain functions regions brain defined based texture composition memory function attributed posterior ventricle harder region brain thus good place memory andreas vesalius redirected study neuroscience away anatomical focus considered attribution functions based location crude pushing away superficial proposals made galen medieval beliefs vesalius believe studying anatomy would lead significant advances understanding thinking research neuroscience expanding becoming increasingly interdisciplinary many current research projects involve integration computer programs mapping human nervous system national institutes health nih sponsored human connectome project launched hopes establish highly detailed map human nervous system millions connections detailed neural mapping could lead way advances diagnosis treatment neurological disorders neuroscientists also work studying epigenetics study certain factors face everyday lives affect us genes also affect children change genes adapt environments faced neuroscientists working show brain far elastic able change thought using work psychologists previously reported show observations work give model one recent behavioral study phenylketonuria pku disorder heavily damages brain due toxic levels amino acid phenylalanine neuroscientists studied disorder psychologists mechanistic understanding disorder caused high levels amino acid thus treatment well understood oftentimes inadequate neuroscientists studied disorder used previous observations psychologists propose mechanistic model gave better understanding disorder molecular level turn led better understanding disorder whole greatly changed treatment led better lives patients another recent study mirror neurons neurons fire mimicking observing another animal person making sort expression movement gesture study one neuroscientists used observations psychologists create model observation worked initial observation newborn infants mimicked facial expressions expressed scientists certain newborn infants developed enough complex neurons allowed mimic different people something else allowed mimic expressions neuroscientists provided model occurring concluded infants fact neurons fired watching mimicking facial neuroscientists also studied effects nurture developing brain saul schanberg neuroscientists study important nurturing touch developing brains rats found rats deprived nurture mother one hour reduced functions processes like dna synthesis hormone michael meaney colleagues found offspring mother rats provided significant nurture attention tended show less fear responded positively stress functioned higher levels longer times fully mature also found rats given much attention adolescents also gave offspring amount attention thus showed rats raised offspring similar raised studies also seen microscopic level different genes expressed rats given high amounts nurture genes expressed rats received less effects nurture touch studied rats also newborn humans many neuroscientists performed studies importance touch shown newborn humans results shown rats also held true humans babies received less touch nurture developed slower babies received lot attention nurture stress levels also lower babies nurtured regularly cognitive development also higher due increased human offspring much like rat offspring thrive nurture shown various studies neuroscientists httpsenwikipediaorgwikineuroscientist
