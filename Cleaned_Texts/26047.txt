aldrin organochlorine insecticide widely used banned countries aldrin member socalled classic organochlorines coc group pesticides cocs enjoyed sharp rise popularity world war ii noteworthy examples cocs include dieldrin research showed organochlorines highly toxic ecosystem bioaccumulation banned use ban heavily used pesticide treat seed soil aldrin related cyclodiene pesticides term pesticides derived hexachlorocyclopentadiene became notorious persistent organic pure aldrin takes form white crystalline powder though soluble water solubility aldrin dissolves well organic solvents ketones aldrin decays slowly released environment though rapidly converted dieldrin plants bacteria dieldrin maintains toxic effects slow decay aldrin easily transported air dust particles aldrin react mild acids bases stable environment ph highly flammable exposed temperatures presence oxidizing agents aldrin reacts concentrated acids phenols aldrin formed nature named german chemist kurt alder one coinventors kind reaction aldrin synthesized combining hexachlorocyclopentadiene norbornadiene dielsalder reaction give composition technicalgrade aldrin reported consist hexachlorohexahydrodimethanonaphthalene similarly isomer aldrin known isodrin produced reaction hexachloronobornadiene isodrin also produced byproduct aldrin synthesis technicalgrade aldrin containing estimated million kilograms aldrin related cyclodiene pesticides produced estimated production volume aldrin us peaked million pounds year multiple available forms aldrin one isomer isodrin found nature needs synthesized like aldrin aldrin enters human body environment rapidly converted dieldrin degradation ultraviolet radiation microbes convert dieldrin photodieldrin aldrin even though many toxic effects aldrin discovered exact mechanisms underlying toxicity yet determined toxic aldrin induced process largely understood neurotoxicity one effects intoxication aldrin gives rise neurotoxicity studies shown aldrin stimulates central nervous system cns may cause hyperexcitation phenomenon exerts effect two different mechanisms one mechanisms uses ability aldrin inhibit brain calcium ion pumps relieve nerve terminal calcium actively pumping however aldrin inhibits pumps intracellular calcium levels rise results enhanced neurotransmitter release second mechanism makes use aldrins ability block gammaaminobutyric acid gaba gaba major inhibitory neurotransmitter central nervous system aldrin induces neurotoxic effects blocking gabaa receptorchloride channel complex blocking receptor chloride unable move synapse prevents hyperpolarization neuronal synapses therefore synapses likely generate action potentials metabolism oral aldrin exposure studied humans however animal studies able provide extensive overview metabolism aldrin data related humans biotransformation aldrin starts epoxidation aldrin mixedfunction oxidases forms dieldrin conversion happens mainly liver tissues low expression use prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase pes oxidative pathway bisdioxygenises arachidonic acid prostaglandin subsequently reduced prostaglandin hydroperoxidase dieldrin directly oxidized cytochrome oxidases forms alternative oxidation involves opening epoxied ring epoxied hydrases forms product products conjugated form glucuronide glucuronide respectively also oxidized form aldrin dicarboxylic considering toxicokinetics aldrin environment efficacy compound determined addition adverse effects exposure aldrin demonstrated indicating risk regarding compound ability aldrin use control termites examined order determine maximum response applied us researchers tested aldrin dieldrin terrains rats known carry chiggers rate pounds per acre kgha aldrin dieldrin treatment demonstrated decrease times less chiggers rats dieldrin treated terrains times less chiggers rats treated aldrin aldrin treatment indicate high productivity especially comparison insecticide used like ddt sulfur exposure aldrin environment leads localization chemical compound air soil aldrin gets changed quickly dieldrin compound degrades slowly accounts aldrin concentrations environment around primary exposure concentrations also found animals eat contaminated plants animals reside contaminated water biomagnification lead high concentrations fat reported cases workers developed anemia multiple dieldrin exposures however main adverse effect aldrin dieldrin relationship central nervous accumulated levels dieldrin body believed lead besides symptoms also reported like headaches nausea vomiting anorexia muscle twitching myoclonic jerking eeg distortions cases removal source exposure aldrindieldrin led rapid toxicity aldrin dieldrin determined results several animal studies reports significant increase workers death relation aldrin found although death anemia reported cases multiple exposure aldrin immunological tests linked antigenic response erythrocytes coated dieldrin direct doseresponse relations cause death yet examined noael derived rat addition studies breast cancer risk studies performed demonstrating significant increased breast cancer risk comparing blood concentrations number lymph nodes tumor size higher risk death determined comparing highest quartile range research lower quartile animal studies done aldrin dieldrin used rats high doses aldrin dieldrin demonstrated neurotoxicity multiple rat studies also showed unique sensitivity mouse liver dieldrin induced furthermore aldrin treated rats demonstrated increased postnatal mortality adults showed increased susceptibility compounds compared children like related polychlorinated pesticides aldrin highly lipophilic solubility water mgl exacerbates persistence environment banned stockholm
