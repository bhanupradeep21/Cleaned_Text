cortical remapping also referred cortical reorganization process existing cortical map affected stimulus resulting creating new cortical map every part body connected corresponding area brain creates cortical map something happens disrupt cortical maps amputation change neuronal characteristics map longer relevant part brain charge amputated limb neuronal change dominated adjacent cortical regions still receiving input thus creating remapped remapping occur sensory motor system mechanism system may quite cortical remapping somatosensory system happens decrease sensory input brain due deafferentation amputation well sensory input increase area motor system remapping receives limited feedback difficult interpret wilder penfield neurosurgeon one first map cortical maps human performing brain surgeries conscious patients penfield would touch either patients sensory motor brain map located cerebral cortex electric probe determine patient could notice either specific sensation movement particular area body penfield also discovered sensory motor maps topographical areas body adjacent one another would likely adjacent cortical due penfields work scientific community concluded brain must fixed unchangeable specific area brain corresponds particular point body however conclusion challenged michael merzenich many call worlds leading researcher brain merzenich two neurosurgeons ron paul herbert goodman conducted experiment determine effects brain large bundle peripheral nerves adolescent monkeys hands cut began regenerate knew peripheral nervous system could regenerate sometimes process neurons would rewire accident wires would accidentally connect different axon stimulating wrong nerve resulted false localization sensation patient touched specific area body touch actually felt different part body expected better understand phenomenon brain used microelectrodes micromap monkeys cortical map hand peripheral nerves cut sewn close together observe evidence axon wires crossing regeneration seven months cortical map monkeys hands remapped found map appeared essentially normal wire crossing expected concluded cortical map able normalize stimulated irregular input adult brain must plastic experiment helped inspire questioning scientific truth adult brain fixed continue change outside critical period especially merzenich later career merzenich conducted experiment highlighted existence cortical remapping neuroplasticity merzenich fellow neuroscientist jon kaas cut median nerve monkeys hand delivers sensation middle hand see median nerve map would look like input cut period two hand remapped found middle hand touched activity occurred median nerve location sides monkeys hand touched activity found median nerve location map meant cortical remapping occurred median nerve nerves correlated outsides monkeys hand remapped take cortical real estate available due median nerve sensory system remapping potentially selforganize due spatiotemporal structure means location timing input critical remapping sensory system study gregg recanzone demonstrates seeing monkey could distinguish stimulus high low frequency vibrations delivered tip finger fixed location time monkey got better identifying differences vibration frequency finger mapped map found degraded unrefined stimuli done fixed location everything excited therefore selected resulting crude map experiment conducted except location high low vibrations varied different parts monkeys fingertip monkey improved time monkeys finger remapped found crude map replaced elegant map fingertip showing different places stimulation occurred different locations study showed period time map could created localized stimulus altered location variable stimulus motor system remapping compared sensory system remapping receives limited feedback difficult looking motor system maps find last pathway movement occur motor cortex actually activate muscles directly causes decreased motor neuron activity means possibility remapping motor cortex come changes brainstem spinal cord locations difficult experiment due challenging study done anke karl helps demonstrate motor

reorganization affect plasticity motor system stimulation somatosensory cortex prompts long term potentiation motor cortex study concluded reorganization motor cortex may subsidiary cortical changes somatosensory helps support feedback motor system limited difficult determine cortical remapping cortical remapping helps individuals regain function injury phantom limbs sensations felt amputees make feel like amputated extremity still sometimes amputees experience pain phantom limbs called phantom limb pain plp phantom limb pain considered caused functional cortical reorganization sometimes called maladaptive plasticity primary sensorimotor cortex adjustment cortical reorganization potential help alleviate one study taught amputees twoweek period identify different patterns electrical stimuli applied stump help reduce plp found training reduced plp patients reversed cortical reorganization previously however recent study tamar r makin suggests instead plp caused maladaptive plasticity may actually pain maladaptive plasticity hypothesis suggests afferent input lost amputation cortical areas bordering amputation area begin invade take area affecting primary sensorimotor cortex seeming cause plp makin argues chronic plp may actually triggered bottomup nociceptive inputs topdown inputs painrelated brain areas cortical maps amputation remain intact interregional
