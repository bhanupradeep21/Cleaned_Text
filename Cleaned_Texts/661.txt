evolution modern discoveries genetics could help find solution book covers chromosomal basis mendelian inheritance effects changes chromosomes greater gene mutations common acceptable mutations form racial specific dobzhansky explained three levels could describe processes evolutionary population genetics origin raw materials mutations genes chromosomes changes populations changes frequencies combinations mutations fixation changes reproductive support writing research bibliography twentyeight pages long around six hundred dobzhanskys second edition genetics origin species four years gone able add research advancements made genetics around half new research found added last two chapters book patterns evolution species natural units second last chapter patterns evolution dobzhansky explained path new adaptation method could used species could go less adaptive stage last chapter species natural units dobzhansky explained contributions made genetics called new systematics
