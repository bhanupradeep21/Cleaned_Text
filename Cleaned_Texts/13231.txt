landing spot indian ocean pacific ocean freereturn transfer orbit mars also possible moon option mostly considered crewed missions robert zubrin book case mars discusses various trajectories mars mission design mars direct hohmann transfer orbit made freereturn takes days years transit mars case freereturn style abort without use propulsion mars years get back earth total deltav requirement kms zubrin advocates slightly faster transfer takes days mars years back earth case abort route comes also cost higher deltav kms zubrin writes faster routes significantly higher deltav cost freereturn duration eg transfer mars days takes kms deltav years free return advocates free return also part various mission designs mars semidirect inspiration mars also exists option two threeyear freereturns rely gravity mars simply transfer orbits periods years respectively twoyear free return means earth mars aborted back earth entry corridor range permissible path angles landing mars limited experience shown path angle hard fix eg deg limits entry atmosphere less kms assumption twoyear return possible years years deltav kick kms mars may needed get back nasa published design
