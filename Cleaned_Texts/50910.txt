arrhythmias also known cardiac arrhythmias heart arrhythmias dysrhythmias irregularities heartbeat including fast resting heart rate fast beats per minute adults called tachycardia resting heart rate slow beats per minute called types arrhythmias symptoms present may include palpitations feeling pause serious cases may lightheadedness passing shortness breath chest pain decreased level cases arrhythmia serious predispose person complications stroke heart others may result sudden arrhythmias often categorized four groups extra beats supraventricular tachycardias ventricular arrhythmias extra beats include premature atrial contractions premature ventricular contractions premature junctional supraventricular tachycardias include atrial fibrillation atrial flutter paroxysmal supraventricular ventricular arrhythmias include ventricular fibrillation ventricular bradyarrhythmias due sinus node dysfunction atrioventricular conduction arrhythmias due problems electrical conduction system number tests help diagnosis including electrocardiogram ecg holter many arrhythmias effectively treatments may include medications medical procedures inserting pacemaker medications fast heart rate may include beta blockers antiarrhythmic agents procainamide attempt restore normal heart latter group may significant side effects especially taken long period pacemakers often used slow heart irregular heartbeat often treated blood thinners reduce risk severe symptoms arrhythmia medically unstable may receive urgent treatment controlled electric shock form cardioversion arrhythmia affects millions europe north america atrial fibrillation affects atrial fibrillation atrial flutter resulted deaths however recent cases concerning pandemic cardiac arrhythmias commonly developed associated high morbidity mortality among patients hospitalized infection due infections ability cause myocardial sudden cardiac death cause half deaths due cardiovascular disease deaths sudden cardiac death result ventricular arrhythmias may occur age common among older arrhythmias may also occur children however normal range heart rate varies arrhythmia may classified rate tachycardia bradycardia mechanism automaticity reentry triggered duration isolated premature beats couplets runs beats nonsustained less seconds sustained secondscitation needed arrhythmias also

sinoatrial junction referred sinoatrial block typically manifesting various degrees patterns sinus bradycardiacitation needed sudden arrhythmic death syndrome sads term used part sudden unexpected death syndrome describe sudden death cardiac arrest occasioned arrhythmia presence absence structural heart disease autopsy common cause sudden death us coronary artery disease specifically poor oxygenation heart muscle myocardial ischemia heart approximately people die suddenly cause every year us sads may occur causes many inherited conditions heart diseases affect young people subsequently cause sudden death without advance causes sads young people include viral myocarditis long qt syndrome brugada syndrome catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia hypertrophic cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic right ventricular arrhythmias may also occur normal heart rate fetus beats per minute rhythm beyond limits abnormal classed fetal arrhythmia mainly result premature atrial contractions usually give symptoms little consequence however around one percent result significant structural damage term cardiac arrhythmia covers large number different conditionscitation needed common symptom arrhythmia awareness abnormal heartbeat called palpitations may infrequent frequent continuous arrhythmias harmless though distracting patients predispose adverse outcomescitation needed arrhythmias cause symptoms associated increased mortality however asymptomatic arrhythmias associated adverse events examples include higher risk blood clotting within heart higher risk insufficient blood transported heart weak heartbeat increased risks embolization stroke heart failure sudden cardiac deathcitation needed arrhythmia results heartbeat fast slow weak supply bodys needs manifests lower blood pressure may cause lightheadedness dizziness syncope loss consciousness brain death due insufficient supply blood oxygen types arrhythmia result cardiac arrest sudden

arrhythmia result enhanced abnormal impulse formation originating pacemaker hispurkinje network second due reentry conduction cardiac arrhythmia often first detected simple nonspecific means auscultation heartbeat stethoscope feeling peripheral pulses usually diagnose specific arrhythmia give general indication heart rate whether regular irregular electrical impulses heart produce audible palpable beats many cardiac arrhythmias premature abnormal beats produce effective pumping action experienced skipped beatscitation needed simplest specific diagnostic test assessment heart rhythm electrocardiogram abbreviated ecg ekg holter monitor ekg recorded period detect arrhythmias may happen briefly unpredictably throughout daycitation needed advanced study hearts electrical activity performed assess source aberrant heart beats accomplished electrophysiology study endovascular procedure uses catheter listen electrical activity within heart additionally source arrhythmias found often abnormal cells ablated arrhythmia permanently corrected transesophageal atrial stimulation tas instead uses electrode inserted esophagus part distance posterior wall left atrium approximately mm remaining constant people different age transesophageal atrial stimulation differentiate atrial flutter av nodal reentrant tachycardia orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant also evaluate risk people syndrome well terminate supraventricular tachycardia caused heartbeat originates electrical impulse small area tissue right atrium heart called sinus node sinoatrial node sa node impulse initially causes atria contract activates atrioventricular node av node normally electrical connection atria ventricles main pumping chambers impulse spreads ventricles via bundle purkinje fibers causing synchronized contraction heart muscle thus pulsecitation needed adults normal resting heart rate ranges beats per minute resting heart rate children much faster athletes however resting heart rate slow beats per minute considered normalcitation needed term sinus refers normal phenomenon alternating mild acceleration slowing heart rate occurs breathing respectively usually quite pronounced

rate normal response physical exercise emotional stress mediated sympathetic nervous system sinus node called sinus tachycardia conditions increase sympathetic nervous system activity heart include ingested injected substances caffeine amphetamines overactive thyroid gland hyperthyroidism anemiacitation needed tachycardia sinus tachycardia usually results addition abnormal impulses normal cardiac cycle abnormal impulses begin one three mechanisms automaticity reentry triggered activity specialized form reentry common problematic termed fibrillationcitation needed although term tachycardia known years bases classification arrhythmias still discussedcitation needed congenital heart defects structural electrical pathway problems heart present birth anyone affected overall

heartbeat happen rapidly right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia common type ventricular tachycardia otherwise healthy individuals defect due electrical node right ventricle pulmonary artery node stimulated patient go ventricular tachycardia allow heart fill blood beating long qt syndrome another complex problem heart labeled independent factor mortality multiple methods treatment including cardiac ablations medication treatment lifestyle changes less stress exercisecitation needed automaticity refers cardiac muscle cell firing impulse cells heart ability initiate action potential however cells designed routinely trigger heartbeats cells found conduction system heart include sa node av node bundle purkinje fibers sinoatrial node single specialized location atrium higher automaticity faster pacemaker rest heart therefore usually responsible setting heart rate initiating heartbeatcitation needed part heart initiates impulse without waiting sinoatrial node called ectopic focus definition pathological phenomenon may cause single premature beat ectopic focus fires often sinoatrial node produce sustained abnormal rhythm rhythms produced ectopic focus atria atrioventricular node least dangerous dysrhythmias still produce decrease hearts pumping efficiency signal reaches various parts heart muscle different timing usual responsible poorly coordinated
