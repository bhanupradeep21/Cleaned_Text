genetic test family medical history includes multiple family members cancer someone family got cancer particularly young age part certain ethnic process genetic screening simple noninvasive procedure however genes tested mutations patient usually must go health care provider go oneonone consultation discuss personal family history cancer medical professional assess likelihood patient mutation guide process genetic important consultation takes place ensures person gives informed consent engage genetic testing aware understands steps benefits limitations procedure knowledgeable consequences hearing test test done using body fluids cells patient includes blood common saliva amniotic fluid even cells interior mouth gotten buccal swab material sent specialized genetics lab technicians examine test results sent back health provider requested analysis results discussed direct consumer testing obtained without medical professional recommended consumer loses opportunity discuss decision educated according national library medicine us genetic testing america costs price range depending type intricacy genetic testing important test comes positive aware personal health health immediate family help advice medical professional take steps reduce elevated risk cancer development forms preventive actions example hereditary breast ovarian cancer would go surgery hysterectomy removal uterus whereas mastectomy removing breast double mastectomy meaning breasts removed often add years onto life another preventive measure regular cancer screening checkups person lynchs syndrome regular colonoscopy examine change cells lining intestinal wall regular checkups associated additional years onto life expectancy average person lynchs syndrome early detection means correct preventive actions surgery taken regular breast screening also recommended women diagnosed brca mutations well recent studies show men increased risks developing prostate cancer due brca mutations decrease risk taking aspirin hugely beneficial lowering cancer prevalence however must taken regularly least fiveyear period often genetic mutations common certain ethnic groups race track ancestors
