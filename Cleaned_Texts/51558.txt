turntaking type organization conversation discourse participants speak one time alternating turns practice involves processes constructing contributions responding previous comments transitioning different speaker using variety linguistic nonlinguistic structure generally overlapping talk generally avoided silence turns minimized turntaking conventions vary culture conventions vary many ways turns distributed transitions signaled long average gap turns many contexts conversation turns valuable means participate social life subject often thought turntaking strategies differ gender consequently turntaking topic intense examination gender studies early studies supported gendered stereotypes men interrupting women women talking recent research found mixed evidence genderspecific conversational strategies overarching patterns conversation analysis turntaking organization describes sets practices speakers use construct allocate organization turntaking first explored part conversation analysis harvey sacks emanuel schegloff gail jefferson late model still generally accepted turntaking structure within conversation three order steps serves maintain two important elements conversation one person speaking time minimized space one person stops talking another system optimized fairness efficiency turntaking reliant set number type many variations turntaking another cue associated turntaking timing within turntaking timing may cue hearer know turn speak make utterance due nature turntaking dependent context timing varies within turn may subjective within conversation vocal patterns pitch specific individual also cue hearer know timing play deborah tannen also shows timing differences relation turntaking particular study used recording conversation group friends dinner group included men women across united states mixed ethnicities concluded amount space left speakers may differ differs dramatically people different regions instance new yorkers tend overlap conversation californians tend leave space turns kobin h kendrick argues rules constraints established within turntaking system done minimize amount time spent transitioning transitions minimal schlegloff found transitions turns incorporate otherinitiations repair oirs eg found longer one person engaging conversation potential overlapping interruption many parties speaking time overlapping turntaking problematic people involved four types overlap including terminal overlaps continuers conditional access turn chordal terminal overlaps occur speaker assumes speaker finish turn begins speak thus creating overlap continuers way hearer acknowledging understanding speaker saying noted schegloff examples continuers phrases mm hm uh huh conditional access turn implies current speaker yields turn invites another speaker interject conversation usually collaborative another example schegloff illustrates speaker invited another speak turn finding word word search chordal consists nonserial occurrence turns meaning speakers turns occurring laughter types overlap considered noncompetitive overlap schegloff suggested overlap resolution device consists three gail jefferson proposed categorization overlaps conversation three types overlap onsets transitional overlap recognitional overlap progressional sacks one first study conversation found correlation keeping one person speaking time controlling amount silences although limit specific requirement number speakers given conversation number conversations rise number participants rise overlaps often seen problematic terms turntaking majority research cooperative versus competitive overlap one theory goldberg argues dynamic relationship overlap power conversation suggesting two types overlap power interruptions displays rapport conversation listener obligation support speaker interruption impedes upon obligation infringing upon wishes speaker heard difference power interruption rapport degree speakers wishes impeded upon rapport interruptions contribute conversation ultimately cooperate collaborate speaker order reach mutual goal understanding power interruptions generally hostile cooperate speaker goals power interruptor divergent regardless goals speaker power interruptions categorized two types process control interruptions content control interruptions process control interruptions involve attempts change topic utilizing questions requests return control original speaker generally seen less threatening two content control interruptions involve attempts change topic utilizing assertions statements unrelated current topic content control interruptions viewed problematic threatening since seize control topic attention away speaker however overlaps potential competitive many overlaps cooperative concludes majority overlaps nonproblematic konakahara et explores cooperative overlap observing graduate students different linguacultural backgrounds elf english lingua franca conversation englishbased conversation among individuals multiple native languages two types overlap observed overlaps continuers assessments substantially contribute conversation demand attention away speaker overlaps questions statements moved conversation forwards majority overlap study consisted continuers assessments noninterruptive overlapping questions interactional environment

gaze important signal participants conversation pay attention usually whoever speaking shift gaze away participants involved conversation finished finished speaking speaker revert gaze back participant speak turntaking developed socialized early first instances interactions parent child still thought learned skill rather innate conversational turntaking greatly affected culture instance japanese culture social structure norms interaction reflected negotiation turns japanese discourse specifically use backchannel reactive tokens backchannel refers listener responses mostly phatic expressions made support speakers flow speech right maintain floor conversation aizuchi simply japanese term backchannel linguists make distinction since importance aizuchi japanese conversation considered higher english conversationcitation needed japanese speakers make use backchannel far american english speakers recorded conversations pairs samesex collegeage friends maynard found englishspeaking students used backchannel expressions uhhuh right mainly grammatical completion points less frequently english speakers moved head laughed speaker paused utterance b yeah think know mean contrast japanese speakers often produced backchannel expressions un s≈ç partner speaking also tended mark end utterances sentencefinal particles produced vertical head movements near end partners demonstrates culturally different floor management strategies form backchannels similar japanese american subjects used brief utterances head movements signal involvement japanese interlocutors however produced backchannels earlier often throughout conversation americans limited responses mainly pauses additionally turntaking vary aspects time overlap perception silence different cultures universal similarities well stivers et al crossexamined ten various indigenous languages across globe see similar underlying foundation turntaking analyzing languages discovered ten languages avoidance wanting overlap conversation wanting minimize silence turntaking however depending culture variation amount time taken turns stivers claims evidence examining languages suggests underlying universal aspect research shown gender one many factors influence turntaking strategies conversation participants studies turntaking malefemale interactions yielded mixed results exact role gender predicting conversational patterns analyses turntaking analyzed conversations various contexts ranging verbal exchange two romantic partners scripted dialogue american sitcoms rates interruption widely researched area turntaking elicited various results conflict one another reflecting inconsistencies across studies gender turntaking one study reports male interlocutors systematically interrupt females tend dominate conversations women frequently treated much way children interruption however due female interlocutors lack desire initiative speak heard conversation deep interruption interruption least two syllables potential utterance boundary perpetuated frequently men towards women regardless ways women negotiate studies suggest certain situational contexts dominant participants conversation interrupt others regardless gender speakers study various romantic relationships dominant partners ones interrupted neither gender interrupter interrupted partner correlated interruption rates language conversation primary ways social interaction organized unequal conversational patterns therefore reflective larger power disparities men women one study zimmerman west found samesex pair conversations overlap interruption tend equally distributed two interlocutors interruptions clustered pairs interrupting oppositesex pairs male interlocutors interrupt much interruptions much widely distributed men gender differences turntaking invariable however related conditions context gendered aspects speech turntaking must recognized reflective cultures questions raised correlation interruption dominance importance gender opposed social categories studies done beattie find status difference important gender difference predicting speakers
