preserved hardened via skin cardabiodon covered teardropshaped enameloid placoid scales clad parallel grooves possessed kneels individual measuring metres ft length scales would range millimetres maximum dimensions scales grooves kneels efficient hydrodynamic dragreduction correlated swimming ability shark possessing common fastswimming sharks like lamnids means likely cardabiodon capable fast swimming thus pursuit lively vertebrae robust corpus calcareum radial lamellae two outermost layers mackerel shark vertebra associated relationship length weight thicker large predatory mackerel sharks suggesting cardabiodon significantly heavier stockier although estimation weight attempted yet vertebral column rigid spindleshaped would poorly flexible efficient fast cardabiodon also larger body relative cardabiodon possessed basic dental characteristics mackerel dental structure heterodontic meaning many tooth morphologies diagnostic features cardabiodon teeth include strongly bilabial roots robust crowns either nearsymmetrically erect distally curved visible large tooth necks bourlette nonserrated cutting edges lateral lingual side side faces towards mouth shows massively convex root small nutritive crown labial side faces outwards shows cardabiodon teeth moderately largest tooth examples c ricki come holotypea anterior teeth measure centimetres maximum slant height first lower lateroposteriors larger measure centimetres maximum slant height c venator teeth slightly smaller largest known tooth discovered anterior measuring centimetres maximum slant height much bulky thicker instead c venator also significantly shorter lateral cusplets compared c siverson reconstructed artificial dental formula based teeth c ricki revised paper concluding overestimated number missing teeth lower dental formula based studies means cardabiodon mainly four types teeth dentition ordered front back symphysial anteriors intermediates lateroposteriors dental structure cardabiodon unique incomparable known extant extinct shark lower jaw tooth size abruptly increases peaks first lateroposterior tooth contrary generic mackerel shark dental structures tooth size gradually decreases transitions anterior posterior exception smaller symphysial intermediate lower teeth also wider teeth upper jaw whereas upper teeth wider generic mackerel lower jaw bite circumference c ricki holotype measured millimetres alternative dental formula reconstructed associated disarticulated tooth set identified cardabiodon sp carlile shale kansas study created formula aimed consistent generic structure mackerel sharks unlike one reconstructed siverson scientists made reconstruction expressed caution due inconsistencies towards generic mackerel shark dental structure however still hypothetical due disarticulated nature fossil teeth cardabiodon unique shark set apart due unique dental structure nevertheless still placed within order lamniformes mackerel shark due possession mackerel sharkexclusive vertebral basic dental features reflect unique dental structure cardabiodon siverson erected family cardabiodontidae placed taxon along extinct cenozoic shark parotodus however would later express weakening rationale placing parotodus family mainly citing millionyear fossil gap another late cretaceous shark dwardius whose teeth similar cardabiodon would also placed within family proposal close relationship possibility synonymous genera raised study led paleontologist todd cook however siverson expressed unlikeliness latter proposal noting contradictory evolutionary trends gradual decrease lateral cusplets cardabiodon time comparison gradual increase dwardius agreed two genera still closely phylogenetic placement cardabiodontidae uncertain yet c ricki tooth recovered alberta deposits dating discovered contain features usually found c venator suggesting chronospecific relationship two species tooth representing transitional although cardabiodontidae contains two genera cardabiodon several fossils undescribed cardabiodonts earlier periods known notable includes associated set teeth large vertebrae dated albian age toolebuc formation queensland belonged individual estimated measure metres ft blog discussion siverson noted albian specimens teeth less robust cretaceous apex sharks cretoxyrhina suggested evolutionary trend cardabiodontidae marked reduction body size length reduction number teeth per jawline increase robustness teeth including increased robustness root widening crown reduction lateral cusplets small enameled cusps appear base tooths main like mackerel sharks cardabiodon grew growth ring vertebrae every year aged measuring band however cardabiodon individuals aged due rarity wellpreserved vertebrae ontogenetics c ricki calculated using vertebrae three different preadult individuals well isolated tooth compared ontogenetic records cretoxyrhina mantelli archaeolamna kopingensis vertebrae c ricki suggested total length birth smaller two sharks centimetres grew average rate centimetres per year compared much quicker average growth rate c mantelli centimetres per year slower rate kopingensis centimetres per three vertebral specimens showed thirteen growth rings meaning individuals lived around years age however growth rate slower c mantelli suggested indeterminable maximum lifespan greater years ages found specimens result premature death around growth ring three specimens exists change growth suggesting c ricki reached sexual maturity around years cardabiodon fossils found canada midwestern united states england west implied past cardabiodon may antitropical distribution localities paleolatitude mimicking range confirmed antitropical porbeagle shark exists latitude confirmed study found latitudinal sea surface temperature ranges two nearly study also found highest latitudinal fossils cardabiodon dated warmest period late cretaceous known cenomanianturonian thermal optimum suggesting shift distribution farther north due increasing temperatures tropical environments determined cardabiodons sea surface temperature range proposed cardabiodon may able move one hemisphere crossing deeper thus cooler waters observed modern basking sharks another antitropical shark migrates hemispheres following cooler isothermic paths deep tropical waters temperatures similar basking sharks normal range although cardabiodon fossils found outside inferred range proposal supported occurrence cardabiodon teeth deepwater deposits around lowest paleolatitudinal antitropical distribution cardabiodon suggests lived mainly temperate offshore moderately deep inner midneritic waters majority fossils north north america c venator fossils found mostly southern half western interior seaway warmer temperate climate seldom found northern although lived colder sea temperatures cardabiodon contemporaneous cenomanianturonian thermal led change biodiversity appearance radiation new fauna like mosasaurs cenomanian localities western interior seaway yielded several marine vertebrates coexisted cardabiodon shark presumably apex predator may preyed upon include many sharks including mackerel

mainly dominated cretalamna sharks squalicorax archaeolamna paraisurus notorhynchus leptostyrax carcharias fragmentary remains pliosaurs also known formation parts west australia also inhabited cenomanian ichthyosaurs like benthic faunae rare around time especially northern waters cardabiodon inhabited due mostly lower oxygen caused cenomanianturonian anoxic event led extinction much marine
