iron law prohibition term coined richard cowan posits law enforcement becomes intense potency prohibited substances cowan put way harder enforcement harder law application effect libertarian judge jim gray calls law cardinal rule prohibition notes powerful argument legalization based premise drugs alcohol prohibited produced black markets concentrated powerful forms potent forms offer better efficiency business take less space storage less weight transportation sell money economist mark thornton writes iron law prohibition undermines argument favor prohibition higher potency forms less safe thornton published research showing potency marijuana increased response higher enforcement budgets later expanded research dissertation include illegal drugs alcohol prohibition united states basic approach based alchian allen theorem argument says fixed cost eg transportation fee added price two varieties product eg high quality red apple low quality red apple results greater sales expensive variety applied rumrunning drug smuggling blockade running potent products become sole focus suppliers thornton notes greatest added cost illegal sales avoidance thornton says drugs legalized consumers begin wean higher potency forms instance cocaine users buying coca leaves heroin users switching popular shift beer wine hard liquor us prohibition parallel narcotics trade late century bulky opium illegal refined heroin became prevalent albeit significant risk bloodborne disease injection needle far greater risk death overdose marijuana also found bulky troublesome smuggle across borders smugglers turned refined cocaine much higher potency profit per cowan wrote crack cocaine entirely product prohibition clinical psychiatrist michael j reznicek adds crystal meth iron law invoked explain heroin displaced fentanyl even stronger synthetic underage drinking teens us one impacts laws possession alcohol minors teens tend prefer distilled spirits easier conceal
