cooperative breeding social system characterized alloparental care offspring receive care parents also additional group members often called cooperative breeding encompasses wide variety group structures breeding pair helpers offspring previous groups multiple breeding males females polygynandry helpers adult offspring breeders groups helpers sometimes achieve cobreeding status producing offspring part groups cooperative breeding occurs across taxonomic groups including costs helpers include fitness reduction increased territory defense offspring guarding increased cost growth benefits helpers include reduced chance predation increased foraging time territory inheritance increased environmental conditions inclusive fitness inclusive fitness sum direct indirect fitness direct fitness defined amount fitness gained producing offspring indirect fitness defined amount fitness gained aiding offspring related individuals relatives able indirectly pass genes increasing fitness related also called kin breeding pair costs include increased mate guarding suppression subordinate mating breeders receive benefits reductions offspring care territory maintenance primary benefit increased reproductive rate survival cooperative breeding causes reproductive success sexually mature adults skewed towards one mating pair means reproductive fitness group held within select breeding members helpers little reproductive system breeders gain increased reproductive fitness helpers gain increased inclusive many hypotheses presented explain evolution cooperative breeding concept behind cooperative breeding forfeiting individuals reproductive fitness aid reproductive success others concept hard understand evolution cooperative breeding important difficult explain hypotheses aim determine reason helpers selectively reduce fitness take alloparental role kin selection evolutionary strategy aiding reproductive success related organisms even cost individuals direct fitness hamiltons rule explains kin selection exist genetic relatedness r aided recipient aiding individual times benefit aid recipient b greater cost aiding individual example chestnutcrowned babbler pomatostomus ruficeps found high rates kin selection helpers predominantly found aiding closely related broods nonrelated additional species neolamprologus pulcher shown kin selection dominant driving force cooperative group augmentation presents second hypothesis towards evolution cooperative breeding hypothesis suggests increasing size group addition helpers aids individual survival may increase helpers future breeding group augmentation favored grouping provides passive benefits helpers addition inclusive group augmenting individual member reduces chances becoming victim predation additionally increase members reduces helpers duration sentinel standing upon high surface survey predators babysitting guarding offspring den reduction guarding behaviors enables helpers forage longer lukas et al proposed evolutionary model cooperative breeding linked coevolution polytocy production multiple offspring monotocy production single offspring evolution cooperative breeding model based evolution larger litters forcing need helpers maintain high reproductive costs thus leading cooperative breeding lukas et al suggests polytocy may encouraged evolution cooperative breeding proposed model suggests transition monotocy polytocy favorable additionally found transition polytocy without cooperative breeding polytocy cooperative breeding highly favorable suggests cooperative breeding evolved noncooperative breeding monotocy cooperative breeding today growing support theory cooperative breeding evolved means form mutualism reciprocity mutualism form symbiosis beneficial involved organisms mutualism many forms occur benefits immediate deferred individuals exchange beneficial behaviors turn group individuals contribute common good may advantageous group members help raise young group raises young together may advantageous maintains increases size greatest amount research invested reciprocal exchanges beneficial behavior iterated prisoners dilemma model two partners either cooperate exchange beneficial behavior defect refuse help environmental conditions govern whether offspring disperse natal group remain helpers food territory availability encourage individuals disperse establish new breeding territories unfavorable conditions promote offspring remain natal territory become helpers obtain inclusive additionally remaining natal territory enables offspring possibly inherit breeding role andor territory final factor influencing cooperative breeding sexual dispersal sexual dispersal movement one sex male female natal territory establish new breeding grounds highly regulated reproductive costs producing male versus female offspring maternal investment within female offspring may considerably higher male offspring one species vice versa another unfavorable conditions cheaper sex produced higher second factor affecting sexual dispersal difference ability sex establish new breeding territory carrion crow corvus corone found produce female offspring favorable environmental conditions female corvus corone found establish successful breeding territories higher rate males male corvus corone produced higher rate unfavorable conditions males found remain natal territory become thus environmental conditions favor dispersal specific sex considered dispersal sex environmental conditions unfavorable females may produce philopatric sex therefore generating helpers increasing occurrence cooperative breeder costs consist prenatal care postnatal care maintenance breeding status prenatal care amount maternal investment fetus gestation postnatal care investment following birth examples prenatal care fetal placentae uterus mammary tissue development postnatal examples lactation food provisions guarding dominant males females exhibit suppressive behaviors towards subordinates maintain breeding status suppressive acts dependent upon sex ratio helpers therefore costs altered depending upon helpers example male helpers compared females dominant male suppress subordinate males experience higher cost opposite true females breeders even suppress subordinates mating cost helpers varies depending upon presence absence related offspring presence offspring found increase helpers cost helper contributing guard guarding behaviors babysitting cause individuals experience weight loss exponential scale depending upon duration activity activities sentinel behavior bipedal surveillance cause helpers reduced foraging intervals inhibiting weight gains reduced foraging behavior increased weight loss reduces chance breed successfully increases inclusive fitness increasing survival related helpers contribute depending upon cost act helping requires allocation energy towards actually performing behavior prolonged allocation energy may greatly impact helpers banded mongoose mungos mungo juvenile male helpers contribute far less females due difference age sexual female banded mongooses reach sexual maturity one year age males reach sexual maturity two years age difference age causes prolonged energy allocation detrimental specific male juvenile mungos mungo may reduce helping behaviors sexual maturity reached similarly lack food due environmental conditions reduced rainfall degree helper input may reduced greatly within juveniles adults may maintain full activity sexually additionally costs helper detrimental one sex example territorial defense costs generally male dependent lactation female dependent meerkats suricata suricatta exhibited male territory defense strategies male helpers fend intruding males prevent intruders mating subordinates dominant additionally subordinate female pregnant helpers sometimes exiled group dominant female eviction causes subordinate female abortion frees resources lactation energy used help dominant female rarely female helper breeder defend territory males present suggests specific helping costs territory defense rooted one cooperative breeding reduces costs many maternal investments breeding members helpers aid breeding females provisioning lactation stress guarding offspring prenatal increasing number helpers enables breeding female male maintain healthier physique higher fitness increased lifespan brood female helpers aid lactation helpers male female aid food helper food provisioning reduces need dominant breeding pair return den thus allowing forage longer periods dominant female male adjust care input food provisioning depending degree activity presence helpers allows breeding female reduce prenatal investment offspring may lead altricial births altricial production young dependent upon adult aid survive enables breeding female retain energy used within new breeding overall addition helpers breeding pair encourages multiple reproductions per year increases rate successful male breeders benefit directly reproducing subordinate females aiding raising young allows male obtain repayment investment within subordinate offspring offspring higher chance become helpers sexual maturity reached thus paying care increase dominant males overall fitness future act ensures dominant male subordinate helpers future helpers primarily benefit inclusive helpers maintain inclusive fitness aiding related breeders type kinship may lead inheritance quality foraging breeding territories increase future fitness additional helpers experience increased chance helped helpers may also benefit group interactions huddling thermodynamic benefits interactions provide necessary elements may also benefit increased group interaction level cognitive concern one another increasing overall life span finally helpers may derive inclusive fitness benefits influencing extrapair behaviour example preventing mothers engaging extrapair matings help biological fathers protect paternity increase relatedness future members cooperatively breeding approximately eight percent bird species known regularly engage cooperative breeding mainly among coraciiformes piciformes basal passeri small fraction instance australian mudnesters australopapuan babblers ground hornbills however absolutely obligately cooperative fledge young without benefits cooperative breeding birds welldocumented one example azurewinged magpie cyanopica cyanus studies found offsprings cellmediated immune response positively correlated increase number helpers studies cooperative breeding birds also shown high levels cooperative breeding strongly associated low annual adult mortality small clutch sizes though remains unclear whether cooperative breeding cause originally suggested cooperative breeding developed among bird species low mortality rates consequence overcrowding thus fewer opportunities claim territory breed however many observers today believe cooperative breeding arose need helpers rear young extremely infertile unpredictable australia subsaharan africa rare favourable across mammalian species less exhibit cooperative breeding phylogenetic analysis shows evidence fourteen discrete evolutionary transitions cooperative breeding within class lineages nine genera rodents cryptomys heterocephalus microtus

evolutionary events provide framework understanding origins evolutionary pressures cooperative breeding evolutionary transitions occurred lineages socially monogamous solitary breeding system suggesting strong kinship ties essential factor evolutionary history cooperative additionally polytocy birth multiple offspring per birthing episode highly correlated evolutionary determinant cooperative breeding two factors social monogamy polytocy evolutionary associated suggesting independent mechanisms leading evolution cooperative breeding global distribution mammals cooperative breeding systems widespread across various climatic regions evidence shows initial transitions cooperative breeding associated species regions high meerkats become reproductively active one year age four litters per year however usually alpha pair reserves right mate usually kill young alpha female away group females never reproduced lactate hunt order feed pups well watch protect defend predators although previously thought meerkats contribution pups diet depended degree relatedness found helpers vary number food items give pups variation food offering due variation foraging success sex research additionally found level help correlated kinship litters cooperative breeding described several canid including red arctic ethiopian cooperative breeding increases rate reproduction females decreases litter cooperative breeding entails one individuals usually females acting helpers one dominant female breeders usually helpers kin sociosexual system rare primates far demonstrated among neotropical callitricids including marmosets cooperative breeding requires repression helpers reproduction pheromones emitted breeder coercion selfrestraint sarah blaffer hrdy believes cooperative breeding ancestral trait humans controversial propositioncitation needed nonhuman primates reproductive success survival offspring highly dependent mothers ability produce food therefore one component cooperative breeding delegation offspring holding allows mother forage without added costs holding additionally primate species cooperative breeding systems females shorter interbirth intervals female grey mouse lemurs microcebus murinus form social groups cooperatively breed closely related female kin females benefit sharing limited nesting spaces increased nest defense exhibit food provisioning behaviors solitary direct expression cooperative breeding includes facultative parental care including alloparenting extended postmenopausal lifespan females forms basis grandmother cooperative breeding humans theorized optimal solution high energetic costs survival due nature human diet involved highquality foods often need processing additionally food provisioning cooperate breeding societies may explain relatively short period weaning humans typically two three years compared nonhuman apes wean offspring upwards six human offspring fall neatly dichotomous categorization precocial versus altricial instead portmann proposes secondarily altricial birth due underdevelopment neurological cognitive therefore human offspring highly dependent caregiver investment necessity serves precursor theories development pairbonding alloparenting cooperative breeding evolution cooperative breeding early homo species also promoted prosocial behaviors social learning increased social tolerance shared intentionality especially food additionally prosocial behaviors cooperative breeding humans byproduct effect enhancing cognitive capabilities especially social tasks involving human mothers tend overlapping dependent offspring due shorter interbirth intervals high fertility rates low infant mortality rates thus imposing high energetic unlike species cooperative breeding
