psychology stroop effect delay reaction time congruent incongruent stimuli effect used create psychological test stroop test widely used clinical practice investigationcitation needed basic task demonstrates effect occurs mismatch name color eg blue green red color printed ie word red printed blue ink instead red ink asked name color word takes longer prone errors color ink match name color effect named john ridley stroop first published effect english effect previously published germany original paper stroop one cited papers history experimental psychology leading strooprelated articles effect named john ridley stroop published effect english article journal experimental psychology entitled studies interference serial verbal reactions includes three different however effect first published germany erich rudolf roots followed back works james mckeen cattell wilhelm maximilian wundt nineteenth experiments stroop administered several variations test three different kinds stimuli created names colors appeared black ink names colors different ink color named squares given first experiment words conflictwords used task required participants read written color names words independently color ink example would read purple matter color font experiment stimulus conflictwords color patches used participants required say inkcolor letters independently written word second kind stimulus also name color patches word purple written red font would say red rather purple squares shown participant spoke name color stroop third experiment tested participants different stages practice tasks stimuli used first second experiments examining learning unlike researchers using test psychological stroop used three basic scores rather complex derivative scoring procedures stroop noted participants took significantly longer complete color reading second task taken name colors squares experiment delay appeared first experiment interference explained automation reading mind automatically determines semantic meaning word reads word red thinks color red must intentionally check identify instead color word ink color red process stimuli stroop paradigms divided three groups neutral congruent incongruent neutral stimuli stimuli text similarly stimuli stroops experiment color similarly stimuli stroops experiment congruent stimuli ink color word refer color example word pink written pink incongruent stimuli ink color word three experimental findings recurrently found stroop first finding semantic interference states naming ink color neutral stimuli eg ink color word interfere faster incongruent conditions called semantic interference since usually accepted relationship meaning ink color word root second finding semantic facilitation explains finding naming ink congruent stimuli faster eg ink color word match neutral stimuli present eg stimulus colored square shown third finding semantic interference facilitation disappear task consists reading word instead naming ink color sometimes called stroop asynchrony explained reduced automatization naming colors compared reading study interference theory commonly used procedure similar stroops second experiment subjects tested naming colors incompatible words control patches first experiment stroops study reading words black versus incongruent colors discussed less cases interference score expressed difference times needed read two types instead naming stimuli subjects also asked sort stimuli different characteristics stimulus ink colors direction words also systematically none modifications eliminates effect brain imaging techniques including magnetic resonance imaging mri functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri positron emission tomography pet shown two main areas brain involved processing stroop anterior cingulate cortex dorsolateral prefrontal specifically activated resolving conflicts catching errors dorsolateral prefrontal cortex assists memory executive functions anterior cingulate cortex used select appropriate response allocate attentional posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex creates appropriate rules brain accomplish current stroop effect involves activating areas brain involved color perception involved word counteracts biases irrelevant information instance fact semantic perception word striking color printed next middorsolateral prefrontal cortex selects representation fulfill goal relevant information must separated irrelevant information task thus focus placed ink color furthermore research suggested left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation stroop task related individuals expectation regarding conflicting nature upcoming trial much conflict conversely right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex aims reduce attentional conflict activated conflict moreover posterior dorsal anterior cingulate cortex responsible decision made ie whether someone say written word ink following response anterior dorsal anterior cingulate cortex involved response whether answer correct incorrect activity region increases probability error several theories used explain stroop effect commonly known race models based underlying notion relevant irrelevant information processed parallel race enter single central processor response theory also called relative speed processing theory suggests lag brains ability recognize color word since brain reads words faster recognizes based idea word processing significantly faster color processing condition conflict regarding words colors eg stroop test task report color word information arrives decisionmaking stage color information presents processing confusion conversely task report word color information lags word information decision made ahead conflicting selective attention theory suggests color recognition opposed reading word requires attention brain needs use attention recognize color encode word takes little responses lend much interference noted stroop task may result either allocation attention responses greater inhibition distractors appropriate responsescitation needed theory common theory stroop verification suggests since recognizing colors automatic process hesitancy respond whereas contrast brain automatically understands meanings words result habitual reading idea based premise automatic reading need controlled attention still uses enough attentional resources reduce amount attention accessible color information stirling introduced concept response automaticity demonstrated changing responses colored words letters part colored words increased reaction time reducing stroop theory suggests brain analyzes information different specific pathways developed different pathways reading stronger others therefore strength pathway speed pathway addition automaticity function strength pathway hence two pathways activated simultaneously stroop effect interference occurs stronger word reading path weaker color naming path specifically pathway leads response weaker neopiagetian theories cognitive development several variations stroop task used study relations speed processing executive functions working memory cognitive development various domains research shows reaction time stroop tasks decreases systematically early childhood early adulthood changes suggest speed processing increases age cognitive control becomes increasingly efficient moreover research strongly suggests changes processes age closely associated development working memory various aspects stroop task also shows ability control behavior asked state color ink rather word participant must overcome initial stronger stimuli read word inhibitions show ability brain regulate stroop effect widely used psychology among important uses creation validated psychological tests based stroop effect permit measure persons selective attention capacity skills well processing speed also used conjunction neuropsychological assessments examine persons executive processing help diagnosis characterization different psychiatric neurological disorders researchers also use stroop effect brain imaging studies investigate regions brain involved planning
