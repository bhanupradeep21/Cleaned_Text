remains unmethylated paternal pwsic suspected controlling expression lncat mice pwsic deleted expression central neural system preferentially expressed paternal allele pwsic hand maternal allele pwsic methylated expressed suggesting methylation pwsic somehow prevents expression supported several studies preventing methylation pwsic knocking methyl transferases embryonic stem cells results biallelic expression silencing maternal however methylation process involved preventing expression maternal expected imprinting domains interact proteins contribute silencing lncat maternal allele example knocked rett syndrome patients biallelically expressed decreasing expression maternal currently three models explain lncat silences paternal collision model rnadna interaction model double stranded rna interference models demonstrated directly considered plausible based evidence silencing natural antisense transcripts methods however collision model due recent supporting studies appears collision model thought road wide enough one car smart car traveling one direction plough direction eventually colliding collision plough pushes smart car backwards continues travel forward collision model rna polymerases rnaps travel towards along sense antisense templates transcription sense antisense templates overlap two transcription bubbles collide headon rnap transcribing plough push rnap transcribing smart car backwards eventually template prevents complete transcription support model comes two recent studies first study looked transcription genes sense strands overlapped genes expressed antisense strand longer region overlap less efficient transcription sense strand indicating transcription one strand interferes transcription another study directly monitored collisions rnaps transcribing template using atomic force microscopy rnaps stalled dna fragments collided elongating rnaps images showed stalling two rnaps immediately collision addition backtracking one studies performed use atomic force microscopy monitor transcription locus might provide insight actually silenced via studies still much necessary confirm models needed several studies support idea might involved paternal silencing studies contradict one study particular argues cis silencing study maternal allele deleted increase paternal expression seen suggests rather paternal controlling paternal maternal somehow suppresses expression paternal possibly trans rather cis interaction maternal paternal homologous regions genes fact observed human mouse cells one mechanism explain trans silencing includes interaction paternal rna maternal mrna possible maternal mrna interacts paternal rna decreases stability transcripts made without becomes another study suggested expression occur imprinted regions situ hybridizations reveal purkinje cells hippocampal neurons however upstream exons correspond snurfsnrpn indicating collision model could still occurring thus research still required several studies attempted utilize possibility controlling expression paternal pwsic methylated supposedly allowing expression therefore methylation pwsic possible transcription could prohibited allowing expression paternal allele make lack expression maternal allele one year study performed several patients patients put methylation promoting diets consisted betaine metafolin creatine vitamin supplements however one year methylation patterns patients another study tested large library different drugs identified several topoisomerase ii inhibitors increased expression paternal mouse neurons mice topoisomerase inhibitors widely used chemotherapeutics cause replicating cells undergo apoptosis inducing double strand breaks stall replication fork however mechanism action activating paternal
