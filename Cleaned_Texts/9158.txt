final solution nazi human experimentation series medical experiments prisoners nazi germany concentration camps mainly documented victims various nationalities age groups although true number believed extensive many survived quarter documented victims killed survivors generally experienced severe permanent auschwitz camps direction eduard wirths selected inmates subjected various experiments designed help german military personnel combat situations develop new weapons aid recovery military personnel injured advance nazi racial ideology including twin experiments josef aribert heim conducted similar medical experiments war crimes tried became known doctors trial revulsion abuses perpetrated led development nuremberg code medical ethics nazi physicians doctors trial argued military necessity justified experiments compared victims collateral damage allied bombings table contents document subsequent nuremberg trials prosecution includes titles sections document medical experiments revolving around food seawater epidemic jaundice sulfanilamide blood coagulation according indictments subsequent nuremberg experiments included following sigmund rascher experimented effects polygal substance made beet apple pectin aided blood clotting predicted preventive use polygal tablets would reduce bleeding gunshot wounds sustained combat surgery subjects given polygal tablet shot neck chest limbs amputated without anesthesia rascher published article experience using polygal without detailing nature human trials set company staffed prisoners manufacture bruno weber

major blood september december experiments conducted ravensbrück concentration camp benefit german armed forces study bone muscle nerve regeneration bone transplantation one person experiments subjects bones muscles nerves removed without anesthesia result operations many victims suffered intense agony mutilation permanent august survivor named jadwiga gave deposition time ravensbrück concentration camp describing operated twice operations involved one legs although never describes knowledge exactly procedure explained times extreme pain developed fever post surgery given little aftercare kamińska describes told operated simply young girl polish patriot describes leg oozed pus months prisoners also experimented bone marrow injected bacteria study effectiveness new drugs developed use battle fields survived remained permanently headed josef mengele twin experiments particular interest one twin could serve subject research also hoped gain insight germans could reproduce experiments included amputating healthy limbs deliberately infecting diseases typhus blood transfusions one twin sewing twins together create conjoined evamozes kor survivor also claimed mengele crosstransfused blood opposite sex twins change respective sexes experimented twins genitals attempted attach urinary tract year old girl twins died one survived would killed dissected comparative postmortem however killed without experimental purpose twins hearts injected chloroform one twins subject experiments luftwaffe conducted experiments intent discovering means prevent treat hypothermia experiments victims indicating victims suffered one another study placed prisoners naked open air several hours temperatures low besides studying physical effects cold exposure experimenters also assessed different methods rewarming one assistant later testified victims thrown boiling water beginning august dachau camp prisoners forced sit tanks freezing water three hours subjects frozen underwent different methods rewarming many subjects died process others also forced stand naked outside freezing temperatures many screaming pain bodies letter september rascher describes experiment intense cooling performed dachau people dressed fighter pilot uniforms submerged freezing water rascher victims completely underwater others submerged freezing hypothermia experiments conducted nazi high command simulate conditions armies suffered eastern front german forces illprepared cold weather encountered many experiments conducted captured soviet troops nazis wondered whether genetics gave superior resistance cold principal locales dachau auschwitz sigmund rascher ss doctor based dachau reported directly reichsführerss heinrich himmler publicised results freezing experiments medical conference entitled medical problems arising sea himmler suggested victims could warmed forcing engage sexual contact victims example included hypothermic victim placed two naked romani early prisoners dachau concentration camp used sigmund rascher experiments aid german pilots eject high altitudes lowpressure chamber containing prisoners used simulate conditions altitudes feet rumored rascher performed vivisections brains victims survived initial subjects died outright others letter april rascher heinrich himmler rascher explains results lowpressure experiment performed people dachau concentration camp victim suffocated rascher another unnamed doctor took note reactions person described years old good health murdered rascher described victims actions began lose oxygen timed changes behavior began wiggle head four minutes minute later rascher observed suffering cramps falling unconscious describes victim lay unconscious breathing three times per minute stopped breathing minutes deprived oxygen victim turned blue began foaming mouth autopsy followed hour letter himmler rascher april himmler ordered rascher continue high altitude experiments continue experimenting prisoners condemned death determine whether men could recalled life victim could successfully resuscitated himmler ordered pardoned concentration camp july september experiments conducted dachau concentration camp study various methods making seawater drinkable victims subject deprivation food given filtered one point group roughly roma deprived food given nothing seawater drink hans eppinger leaving gravely dehydrated others observed licking freshly mopped floors attempt get drinkable holocaust survivor named joseph tschofenig wrote statement seawater experiments dachau tschofenig explained working medical experimentation stations gained insight experiments performed prisoners namely forced drink salt water tschofenig also described victims experiments trouble eating would desperately seek source water including old floor rags tschofenig responsible using xray machine infirmary describes even though insight going powerless stop gives example patient infirmary sent gas chambers sigmund rascher simply witnessed one lowpressure march january sterilization experiments conducted auschwitz ravensbrück purpose experiments develop method sterilization would suitable sterilizing millions people minimum time effort targets sterilization included jewish roma experiments conducted means xray surgery various drugs thousands victims sterilized sterilization limited experiments nazi government already sterilizing people part compulsory sterilization one prominent scientist domain carl clauberg initially xrayed women make sure obstruction ovaries next three five sessions injected caustic substances uteruses without many died others suffered permanent injuries infections successfully women stood experiments deemed unfit test subjects sent gas intravenous injections solutions speculated contain iodine silver nitrate similarly successful unwanted side effects vaginal bleeding severe abdominal pain cervical cancer received cancer vivisected cervixes wombs therefore radiation treatment became favored choice sterilization specific amounts exposure radiation destroyed persons ability produce ova sperm sometimes administered deception many suffered severe radiation nazis also implemented xray radiation treatment search mass sterilization gave women abdomen xrays men received genitalia abnormal periods time attempt invoke infertility experiment complete surgically removed reproductive organs without anesthesia lab md william e seidelman professor university toronto collaboration dr howard israel columbia

danish endocrinologist carl vaernet developed artificial male sex gland capsule slowly released testosterone implanted vaernet proposed deputy reich ss physician ernstrobert grawitz capsule could convert homosexual men heterosexuals buchenwald concentration camp encouragement heinrich himmler support camp doctor gerhard schiedlausky de vaernet implanted capsules least ten homosexual vaernet claimed successes implants presumably due positive reports prisoners hoping receive release knowing would increase odds according notes written senior doctor buchenwald dated january least one man died experiment december heart failure associated infectious enteritis general bodily eugen kogon reported second man died result operations due festering inflammation cell tissue presumably january little known fate victims none known applied financial compensation hypothesis circulating hormones determined cured homosexuality discredited later scientific research hormonal exposure prior birth became far influential castration homosexual men also commonly performed nazi began voluntary castrations later performed concentration camps prisons believed castration reduces male sex drive would prevent men infected homosexuality gay idea influential nazi beliefs homosexuality rather biological genetic prenatal environmental theories homosexual jewish prisoners also given experimental

experiments heavily documented well photographed various times september april many experiments conducted sachsenhausen natzweiler camps investigate effective treatment wounds caused mustard gas test subjects deliberately exposed mustard gas vesicants eg lewisite inflicted severe chemical burns victims wounds tested find effective treatment mustard gas around november around january experiments conducted buchenwald test effect various pharmaceutical preparations phosphorus burns burns inflicted prisoners using phosphorus material extracted incendiary female prisoners block also subject electroshock therapy women often sick underwent experimentation sent gas chambers documented transcriptions heinrich himmler include phrases performed us particular efficiency personally assumed responsibility supplying asocial individuals criminals deserve die concentration camps many subjects died result experiments conducted nazis many others murdered tests completed study effects post survived often left mutilated permanent disability weakened bodies mental august doctors captured allied forces put trial usa vs karl brandt et al commonly known doctors trial trial several doctors argued defense international law regarding medical experimentationcitation needed doctors also claimed world favor ss doctor quoted saying jews festering appendix body europe went argue world favor eliminating issue informed consent previously controversial german medicine albert neisser infected patients mainly prostitutes syphilis without consent despite neissers support academic community public opinion led psychiatrist albert moll neisser neisser went fined royal disciplinary court moll developed legally based positivistic contract theory patientdoctor relationship adopted german

representatives doctors trial drafted tenpoint memorandum entitled permissible medical experiment went known nuremberg code calls standards voluntary consent patients avoidance unnecessary pain suffering must belief experimentation end death code cited findings defendants never made either german american medical code comes nuremberg trials heinous nazi leaders put trial war andrew conway ivy stated nazi experiments medical data obtained experiments however used considered use multiple fields often causing controversy object datas use purely ethical grounds disagreeing methods used obtain others rejected research scientific grounds criticizing methodological favor using data argue practical value save lives would equally unethical use arnold relman editor new england journal medicine refused allow journal publish article cited nazi dont want use nazi data ethical world use would equally bad im trying make something constructive dr john hayward justifying citing dachau freezing experiments results dachau freezing experiments used late century research treatment hypothermia least publications referenced experiments though majority publications field cite argued favor using research include robert pozos university minnesota john hayward university review dachau experiments robert berger concludes study ingredients scientific fraud data advance science save human united states environmental protection agency epa considered using data nazi research effects phosgene gas believing data could help us soldiers stationed persian gulf time eventually decided using
