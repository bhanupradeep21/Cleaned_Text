retinopathy prematurity rop also called retrolental fibroplasia rlf terry syndrome disease eye affecting prematurely born babies generally received neonatal intensive care oxygen therapy used premature development thought caused disorganized growth retinal blood vessels may result scarring retinal detachment rop mild may resolve spontaneously may lead blindness serious cases thus preterm babies risk rop low birthweight additional risk factor oxygen toxicity relative hypoxia contribute development rop fourth month pregnancy fetal retina begun develop vascularization formation blood vessels appears sensitive amount oxygen supplied either naturally artificially rare cases rop found patients mutation ndp gene normally associated damaging norrie various risk factors contribute development rop development blood vessels grow central part retina outwards process completed weeks normal time delivery however premature babies incomplete blood vessels grow normally rop occur vessels grow branch abnormally baby develops rop abnormal blood vessels may grow plane retina may bleed inside eye blood abnormal vessels reabsorbed may give rise multiple band like membranes pull

neonatal intensive care settings bigger mature babies also risk severe rop neonatal care may suboptimal findings two main implications firstly much done countries moderate development indices improve neonatal care reduce risk severe rop bigger babies increase survival extremely preterm infants secondly settings bigger mature babies need included rop programs examined regularly detect babies
