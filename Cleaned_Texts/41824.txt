bulbasaurus meaning bulbous reptile extinct genus dicynodont known lopingian epoch late permian period south africa containing type species b phylloxyron formerly considered belonging tropidostoma

close aulacephalodon although basal position implausible bulbasaurus ostensibly directly named pokémon bulbasaur rather nasal bosses unusually bulbous among geikiids however describers noted

kammerer et al found closest relative aulacephalodon basis lacking ridge behind tusk ontogenetically influenced however assignment somewhat questionable forcing bulbasaurus basal geikiid outside

robust morph short snout large tusks gracile morph long snout small tusks probably represents sexual dimorphism however bulbasaurus matches neither morphologies differs genus tropidostoma whole many
