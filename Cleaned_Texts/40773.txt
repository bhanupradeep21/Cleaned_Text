luskhan meaning water spirit chief extinct genus brachauchenine pliosaur cretaceous russia type species luskhan itilensis named valentin fischer colleagues wellpreserved nearly complete skeleton earlydiverging brachauchenine luskhan consequently exhibits intermediate combination traits seen basal less specialized derived specialized pliosaurs however luskhan departs significantly pliosaurs exhibits lack adaptations skull feeding large prey slender snout small teeth short tooth rows instead indicate skull adapted feeding small soft prey features pliosaur approaches closest

luskhan measures ft long end relatively short neck long skull tapers elongate snout longer region skull behind eyes members brachaucheninae lower jaw ft long additional characteristics typical brachauchenines include parietal bone extending forward position nostrils snout unconstricted bearing expansion bottom surface like megacephalosaurus retroarticular process back lower jaw inturned teeth upper jaw equallysized facets articulate cervical ribs cervical vertebrae placed relatively high similar kronosaurus brachauchenius unlike jurassic pliosaurs plesiosaurs transverse processes attaching dorsal vertebrae level neural canals long coracoid measuring times length scapula luskhan also exhibits primitive traits resemble nonbrachauchenine thalassophoneans consistent among earliest brachauchenines like pliosaurus squamosal bones overlap rear processes jugal also excludes plesiosaurs border temporal fenestrae also bulb squamosal well ridge extending upwards rear surface pliosaurus westburyensis processes pterygoid bones articulate quadrate bone thick ushaped notch bottom supraoccipital bone flanges bottom pterygoids come contact midline skull bottom cervicals large foramina pits number cervical vertebrae luskhan seen intermediate pliosaurus brachauchenius unusually luskhan also lacks many adaptations hunting large prey seen brachauchenines snout thin keel bottom fused symphysis lower jaw diastema gap tooth row bones upper jaw premaxilla maxilla expanded outwards caniniform caninelike teeth length symphysis proportion overall length lower jaw also longer brachauchenines thalassophoneans instead within range symphyses distantlyrelated polycotylidae also like teeth widely spaced terminate forward jaw midpoint eye socket arch squamosal angled forwards

opening epipodial foramen two bones meet fibula much longer tibia intermedium tarsus contacts fibula lacks articulation tibia unlike thalassophoneans following cladogram follows analysis fischer colleagues based dataset published benson druckenmiller previously modified description makhaira due completeness luskhan position based scorings characteristics listed dataset strict consensus parsimonious phylogenetic trees recovered makhaira forms polytomy pliosaurus species instead forming clade brachauchenines however consensus parsimonious trees basal brachauchenine luskhan next basal stratesaurus rhomaleosauridae plesiosauroidea thalassiodracon hauffiosaurus attenborosaurus anguanax marmornectes peloneustes pliosaurus andrewsi simolestes liopleurodon pliosaurus makhaira luskhan stenorhynchosaurus kronosaurus megacephalosaurus brachauchenius along makhaira stenorhynchosaurus luskhan forms evolutionary grade fills critical gap million years berriasian barremian epochs early cretaceous evolution maría páramofonseca colleagues describers stenorhynchosaurus indicated including brachaucheninae would necessitate redefinition fischer colleagues see thalassophonean pliosaurids robust skulls short necks welladapted apex predator although serrated teeth spatulashaped snouts stronglydeveloped crests skull roof lost large size teeth still indicate predatory lifestyles meanwhile slimmer body proportions polycotylids likely fastswimming principal component ecomorphological analyses place luskhan significantly closer polycotylids thalassophoneans terms skull traits terms rest body thus luskhan polycotylidlike pliosaurid early thalassophonean peloneustes also polycotylidlike less ecologically speaking luskhan probably preyed small soft animals suggested slender snout long symphysis relatively short tooth row compared thalassophoneans traits luskhan shared typical thalassophoneans presence serrations rearmost teeth presence weakly trihedral triangular crosssection teeth however probably vestigial traits retained pliosauruslike thus luskhan departed typical apex predator niche thalassophoneans order colonize lower trophic level done independently million years polycotylids makhaira contrast retained bauplan bettersuited apex predator instance teeth larger based presence ammonite speetoniceras versicolor several meters north site luskhan discovered horizon
