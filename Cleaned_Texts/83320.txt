cause irritation skin exposed stressors initially develops harder surface protect skin continually dealing pressure gets irritated forms rash point gets qualified acne mechanica hot climate working body temperature rises heat causes pores skin open dilation pores makes easier bacteria oil dead skin cells collect pores clog every pore body tiny hair follicle blockage causes hair follicle become irritated inflamed ends forming pimples specifically acne mechanica white blood cells flood area inflammation die accumulate surface pore causing known whitehead people pop pimples pus comes dead white blood cells originally came diffuse inflammation depending continuation stressors inflammatory pimples also known papules pustules develop nodules cysts severe forms acne rooted deeper within acne mechanica diagnosed dermatologist via physical examination extreme cases skin biopsy performed examine pathology family medical history also looked see patient hereditary tendency certain conditions cause different types acne may play role acne mechanica development example patients parents acne strong probability also similar issues issues range things like overproducing dead skin cells pores higher tendency acne mechanica direct cure however preventive measures taken minimize breakouts obvious solution prevent extra rubbing heat entrapment surface skin wear either loosefitting
