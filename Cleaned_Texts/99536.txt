savannah hypothesis savanna hypothesis hypothesis human bipedalism evolved direct result human ancestors transition arboreal lifestyle one savannas according hypothesis hominins left woodlands previously natural habitat millions years ago adapted new habitat walking upright idea climatedriven retraction tropical forests forced early hominini bipedalism around long time often implicitly early authors saw savannahs open grasslands others saw mosaic environments woodlands grasslands hypothesis seen rising criticism since least late open grasslands version mostly dismissed contrast mosaic version still relatively wide support however transition forest savanna probably gradual previously thought fundamental ideas behind date back lamarck darwin also gustav steinmann saw reducing
