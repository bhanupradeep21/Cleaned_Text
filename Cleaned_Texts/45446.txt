nonverbal autism subset autism spectrum person learn speak estimated children diagnosed autism spectrum never develop spoken language beyond words existing body research nonspeaking autism focuses early interventions predict successful language outcomes research suggests acquiring language age five good indicator positive child likelihood acquiring functional language future past age early language development crucial educational achievement employment independence adulthood social obvious signs autism atypical social language development restricted repetitive behaviors interests often present ages two three children asd diagnosed early childhood disorders epilepsy adhd gastrointestinal problems sleep disorders depression anxiety often accompany causes nonspeaking autism unknown however appears relationship joint attention verbal communication joint attention occurs two individuals one draws others attention object gesturing ie eye gazing ability achieve joint attention early age plays significant role language development studies indicate severe lapses joint attention children one study researchers suggest displayed pattern delays absences general impaired response stimuli hyporesponsiveness fascination intense repetitive stimulation sensory seeking likely nonspeaking children autism suggesting hyporesponsiveness sensory seeking related poor communication outcomes children growing body tentative evidence indicating amygdalas involvement development autism amygdala theory autism focuses importance amygdala relation social functioning observes autism largely severe impairment social functioning amygdala thought associated fightorflight response animals activity heavily correlated fear humans additionally heavily implicated relation social functioning various animal studies evidence suggests amygdala hyperactivity model may accurate one comparing lesion studies shown amygdala damage results severe social impairment among animal models vervet monkey mothers amygdala lesions shown much less caring young neglecting even abusing rats amygdala ablations become much monkeys lesions anterior temporal lobe develop disorder known syndrome characterized loss fear hypersexuality hyperorality inability recognize visual objects often evidence shows amygdala accounts emotional oral sexual abnormalities listed abnormalities coincide several characteristics diagnostic guidelines autism least passably animal model postmortem analysis humans shows increased neuronal density amygdala autism compared controls indicating potential linkage supporting hyperactivity several studies presented subjects asd photographs human eyes report emotional state person picture smaller amygdala associated increased response time decreased also significantly less amygdaloid activation brains asd controls subjects compensated lack amygdaloid activity increased activation temporal lobe associated verbally labeling activity thought imply less usage emotionalsocial cues identify objects rather objective factually based processing one may extrapolate model patients autism may learn specific facial configuration represents emotional state emotional state implies socially may come truly understand person feels supports theory mind deficit studies conducted specifically nonspeaking autistic individualswhich provide similar evidence brain studies shown several amygdaloid impairments among asd amygdala nonspeaking autism less volume compared controls contain higher density neurons suggesting hyperconnection show negative correlation amygdala size impairment severity among infantile autism actually associated oversized amygdala developmental theories may occur research major depressive disorder shown excessive activation stress fear leads allostasis degeneration neurons involved creating phenomenon initial hypertrophy results atrophy reduction brain size given time occurs patients severe depression develop decreased amygdala size scientistswho theorize happening early infancy autistic brain accounting initial overgrowth later observed size eye tracking software employed record subjects focus visual attention images human faces small amygdala volume associated decreased eye eyes considered especially important establishing human connection conveying emotion thus fixation considered crucial part identifying people emotions social setting addition negative correlation eye fixation studies showed smaller amygdala associated impairment nonverbal communication skills suggests amygdala critical developing types communicative abilities verbal suggests amygdala may play crucial role relating humans way allows behavioral mimicry among patients nonspeaking asd researchers could predict symptom severity based amygdala activity least amygdala activity impaired nonspeaking communication abilities activity strongest communication development language similar development physical skills relies heavily mimicry asds known impair ones ability focus relate people possibly result damaged amygdala nonspeaking autistics often able learn basic communicative skills pointing objects selecting picture list skills far simple require degree personal connection needed language development important note studies must considered great caution crosssectional study suggest much pathology disorder study particular longitudinal study needed gain complete also important recognize disorders arise complex interworking entire brain restricting theory one subsystem would mistake theory merely suggests amygdala may involved develop asd provides evidence support association nonspeaking grade school children adolescents autism communication systems interventions implemented enhance language communication outcomes
