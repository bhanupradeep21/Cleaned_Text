xxyy syndrome sex chromosome anomaly males extra chromosomes one x one chromosome human cells usually contain two sex chromosomes one mother one father usually females two x chromosomes xx males one x one chromosome xy appearance least one chromosome properly functioning sry gene makes male therefore humans xxyy genotypically male males xxyy syndrome chromosomes instead typical xxyy syndrome sometimes written xxyy syndrome xxyy affects estimated one every male frequent signs symptoms condition include frequent signs condition include symptoms may include following syndrome condition related x chromosomes sex chromosomes people normally chromosomes cell two chromosomes known x called sex chromosomes help determine whether person develop male female sex characteristics females typically two x chromosomes males one x chromosome one chromosome syndrome results presence extra copy sex chromosomes males cells extra copies genes x chromosome interfere male sexual development preventing testes functioning normally reducing levels testosterone many genes found x chromosome genes areas known pseudoautosomal regions present sex chromosomes extra copies genes pseudoautosomal regions extra x chromosome contribute signs symptoms syndrome however specific genes yet condition inherited usually occurs random event formation reproductive cells eggs sperm error cell division called nondisjunction results reproductive cell abnormal number chromosomes syndrome extra sex chromosomes almost always comes sperm cell nondisjunction may cause sperm cell gain two extra sex chromosomes resulting sperm cell three sex chromosomes one x two chromosomes sperm cell fertilizes normal egg cell one x chromosome resulting child two x chromosomes two chromosomes bodys cellscitation needed small percentage cases syndrome results nondisjunction sex chromosomes embryo soon fertilization occurred means normal sperm cell one chromosome fertilized normal egg cell one x chromosome right fertilization nondisjunction sex chromosomes caused embryo gain two extra sex chromosomes resulting karyotype done diagnose xxyy syndrome treatment consists medications behavioral
