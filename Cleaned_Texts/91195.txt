rhythmic movement disorder rmd neurological disorder characterized repetitive movements large muscle groups immediately sleep often involving head neck independently described first zappert jactatio capitis nocturna cruchet rhythmie du majority rmd episodes occur nrem sleep although rem movements reported rmd often associated psychiatric conditions mental disabilities disorder often leads bodily injury unwanted movements incessant muscle contractions patients sleep patterns often disrupted differs restless legs syndrome rmd involves involuntary muscle contractions sleep restless legs syndrome urge move sleep rmd occurs males females often early childhood symptoms diminishing age many affected individuals also sleep related disorders like sleep apnea disorder differentially diagnosed small subcategories including sleep related bruxism thumb sucking hypnagogic foot tremor rhythmic sucking name order considered pathological icsdii requires sleeprelated rhythmic movements markedly interfere normal sleep cause significant impairment daytime function result selfinflicted bodily injury requires medical treatment would result injury preventive measures used rmd symptoms relatively passive cause pain many patients often unaware episode occurring occurred rhythmic movements may produce bodily injury via falls muscle strains reported unique cases rmd hum moan asleep episode patients describe repetitive movements relaxing occasionally awakened rmd episode often partner parent first notes symptoms additionally often partner parent led patients seek medical attentioncitation needed symptoms rhythmic movement disorder vary share common large muscle movement patterns many show consistent symptoms includingcitation needed less common muscle movements include majority affected individuals symptoms involve head common symptom head banging usually head strikes pillow mattress near frontalparietal region little cause alarm movements injury brain damage result movements rare infants diagnosed costello syndrome observed unique rmd episodes affecting tongue facial muscles uncommonly affected episodes usually last less fifteen minutes produce movements vary hz muscle movements rem sleep often twitches occur simultaneously normal sleep position body sleep may determine motor symptom displayed example anderson et al reported one individual showed entire body rolling movements sleeping side displaying head rolling movements sleeping abnormal writhing movements often patients sleep patterns disrupted may due rmds comorbidity sleep apnea observed many find sleep refreshing tired stressed following day despite getting full nights rest however patients report sleep patterns infrequently interrupted due rmd episodes report excessively sleepy next day scored epworth sleepiness thus seen effects severity rmd vary person personcitation needed rhythmic movement disorder observed using standard procedure polysomnography includes video recording eeg sleep emg ecg aforementioned brain monitoring devices eliminate possibility epilepsy cause sleep related disorders like sleep apnea ruled examining patients respiratory effort air flow oxygen saturation rmd patients often show abnormal activity directly result disorder mri rmd episodes strongly associated stage nrem sleep specifically k additionally close association alpha waves contain mixture k complexes arousals regardless nrem stage rmd occurred occurrence two sequences brain waves suggests disorder linked unstable vigilance level throughout nrem noted complete absence eeg signs immediately intense rhythmic episode normal eeg patterns return functional mri scans shown mesencephalon pons may involved loss motor control seen rmd episode similar movement episodes rmd short lasting seconds rare cases constant rmd last hours majority rmd episodes usually occur sleep cases reported rhythmic movements wakeful activities like driving occurring sleep rmd episodes likely onset nonrem stage sleep roughly sleeprmd episodes occur nonrem sleep nonrem rem strictly rem patients unresponsive episode unlikely remember movements occurring upon awakening patients also experience sleep apnea episodes apnea followed immediately rmdlike symptoms suggesting apnea episodes may trigger rmd episode similarly current studies suggest external stimuli cause rmd disorder closely associated developmental disabilities autism recent studies shown strong link prolonged rmd direct cause pathophysiological basis rmd still unknown occur children adults perfect nonperfect health rare cases adult rmd developed due head trauma stress herpes familial cases reported suggesting may genetic aspect disorder however date explanation directly tested familial incidence rate still relatively low believed behavioral aspects may play larger role rmd family history many condition report family history disorder another theory suggests rmd learned selfstimulating behavior alleviate tension induce relaxation similar tic alternative theory suggests rhythmic movements help develop vestibular system young children partially explain high prevalence rmd infants seen children underdeveloped vestibular systems benefit performing rmdlike movements stimulate vestibular diagnosis rhythmic movement disorder done exclusionary basis closely related movement disorders systematically ruled thorough clinical evaluation necessary often impairments severe enough warrant process rmd often diagnosed unless extremely interfering disabling symptoms many patients seek treatment rmd directly seek professional help alleviate sleepaffecting symptoms compound issue many often misdiagnosed restless legs syndrome sleep apnea combination rhythmic movement disorder differs restless legs syndrome rmd involves involuntary contractions muscles urge uncomfortable sensation provoke movement additionally individuals restless legs syndrome show periodic limb movements observed polysomnogram common rmd patients rhythmic movement disorder also symptoms overlap epilepsy however use polysomnogram help distinguish one disorder rmd involves movements rem nrem sleep unusual additionally patients usually stop movements upon request unlike movements observed epilepsy movement disorders like parkinsons disease huntingtons disease ataxia dystonia differ rmd occur primarily wakefulness reduced sleep whereas rmd episodes occur around medication often necessary children symptoms usually alleviate spontaneously child ages however disorder may affect wakeful behavior many adults continue rmd may seek treatment benzodiazepines tricyclic antidepressants considered therapeutic options managing disorder infantile adolescent rmd respond well low doses prescription medications ropinirole pramipexole given restless legs syndrome patients show clinical improvement many patients treatment sleep apnea via continuous positive airway pressure cpap device shown dramatic improvement apnea nearly complete resolution rmd behavioral interventions may alleviate rmd symptoms movements therapy affected individuals asked perform rmdlike motions day slow methodic manner patients come short full rhythmic movements experience sleep behavioral training shown carry sleep forcefulness rmd movements reduced hypnosis sleep restriction used cases good sleeprelated movements commonly seen children especially infants however majority movements stop child ages infants show rmdlike symptoms compared year httpsenwikipediaorgwikirhythmicmovementdisorder
