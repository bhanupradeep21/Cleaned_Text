hearing loss due noise underestimate hearing loss due noise may temporary called temporary threshold shift reduced sensitivity sound wide frequency range resulting exposure brief loud noise like gunshot firecracker jet engine jackhammer etc exposure loud sound hours pop concert nightclub recovery hearing usually within hours may take constant exposure loud sounds dba onetime exposure
