injuries arm forearm wrist area lead various nerve disorders one disorder median nerve palsy median nerve controls majority muscles forearm controls abduction thumb flexion hand wrist flexion digital phalanx fingers sensory nerve first three fingers etc major role median nerve also called eye median nerve damaged ability abduct oppose thumb may lost due paralysis thenar muscles various symptoms occur may repaired surgery tendon transfers tendon transfers successful restoring motor function improving functional outcomes patients median nerve median nerve palsy often caused deep penetrating injuries arm forearm wrist may also occur blunt force trauma median nerve palsy separated low median nerve palsy high mnp involves lesions elbow forearm areas low median nerve palsy results lesions wrist compression different levels median nerve produce variable symptoms andor syndromescitation needed areas median nerve receives fibers roots sometimes formed axilla branch medial lateral chords brachial plexus either side axillary artery fuse together create nerve anterior arterycitation needed median nerve closely related brachial artery within arm nerve enters cubital fossa medial

eminence palmar digital branch supplies sensation palmar aspect lateral digits lateral two lesions different areas median nerve produce similar symptoms clinicians perform complete motor sensory diagnosis along nerve course decreased values nerve conduction studies used indicators nerve compression may aid determining localization compressioncitation needed palpation elbow joint may reveal bony consistency radiography images may show abnormal bony spur outgrowth supracondyloid process proximal elbow joint attached fibrous tissue struthers ligament may compress median nerve passes underneath also known supracondylar process syndrome compression point may also occur without bony spur case aponeurotic tissue found location struthers ligament responsible patients mention reproduction symptoms forearm elbow flexion degrees forearm maximal supination lesion may localized area underneath lacertus fibrosus also known bicipital sometimes misdiagnosed elbow strain medial lateral lesion upper arm area proximal motor branches forearm flexors originate diagnosed patient unable make fist specifically patients index middle finger flex mcp joint thumb usually unable oppose known hand benediction popes blessing hand another test bottle patient unable close fingers around cylindrical carpal tunnel syndrome cts caused compression median nerve passes carpal nerve conduction velocity tests hand used diagnosis cts physical diagnostic tests include phalen maneuver phalen test tinels sign relieve symptoms patients may describe motion similar shaking thermometer another indication pronator teres syndrome also known pronator syndrome compression median nerve two heads pronator teres pronator teres test indication patient reports pain attempting pronate forearm resistance extending elbow simultaneously physician may notice enlarged pronator teres muscle tinels sign area around pronator teres heads positiveclarification needed key discerning syndrome carpal tunnel syndrome absence pain recent literature collectively diagnose median nerve palsy occurring elbow forearm pronator teres uncooperative patients skin wrinkle test offers painfree way identify denervation fingers submersion water minutes normal fingers become wrinkled whereas denervated fingers ape hand deformity thenar muscles become paralyzed due impingement subsequently hand deformity individual diagnosis seen thenar muscles atrophied adductor pollicis remains intact flattening muscles causes thumb become adducted laterally rotated opponens pollicis causes thumb flex rotate medially leaving thumb unable oppose carpal tunnel syndrome result thenar muscle paralysis lead ape hand deformity left ape hand deformity also seen hand benediction deformitycitation needed anterior interosseus nerve branch median nerve accounts movement fingers hand sensory capabilities therefore syndrome purely neuropathic ains considered extremely rare condition accounts less neuropathies upper limb patients syndrome impaired distal interphalangeal joint unable pinch anything make ok sign index finger thumb syndrome either happen pinched nerve even dislocation one way prevent injury occurring informed educated risks involved hurting wrist hand patients median nerve palsy occupational therapy wearing splint help reduce pain damage wearing dynamic splint pulls thumb opposition help prevent excess deformity splint also assist function help fingers flex towards thumb stretching use csplints also assist prevention damage deformity two methods help degree movement thumb impossible prevent trauma arms wrist patients reduce amount compression maintaining proper form repetitive activities furthermore strengthening increasing flexibility reduces risk nerve compressioncitation needed depending severity lesion physicians may recommend either conservative treatment surgery first step simply rest modify daily activities aggravate symptoms patients may prescribed antiinflammatory drugs physical occupational therapy splints elbow wrists corticosteroid injections common treatment cts especially involving compression wrist cts possible recover without treatment physical therapy help build muscle strength braces splints help pronator teres syndrome specifically immobilization elbow mobility exercise within painfree range initially prescribed however patient relieved symptoms usual month refractory period decompression surgery may surgery involves excising tissue removing parts bone compressing nervecitation needed many tendon transfers shown restore opposition thumb provide thumb finger flexion order optimal results individual needs follow following principles tendon transfer normal tissue equilibrium movable joints scarfree bed requirements met certain factors need considered matching lost muscle mass fiber length crosssectional area pick muscletendon units similar size strength potential excursioncitation needed patients low median nerve palsy shown flexor digitorum superficialis long ring fingers wrist extensors best approximate force motion required restore full thumb opposition strength type transfer preferred method median nerve palsy strength motion required situations thumb mobility desired extensor indicis proprius ideal transfercitation needed high median nerve palsy brachioradialis extensor carpi radialis longus transfer appropriate restore lost thumb flexion sidetoside transfer flexor digitorum profundus index finger generally restore independent flexion index finger could performed using pronator teres extensor carpi radialis ulnaris tendon muscle units mentioned transfers generally quite successful combine proper direction action pulley location tendon high median nerve palsy patients recovery time varies early four months years initially patients immobilized neutral position forearm elbow flexed order prevent injury additionally gentle exercises soft tissue massage applied next goal strengthening flexibility usually involving wrist extension flexion however important overuse muscles order prevent reinjury surgery required post operative therapy initially involves decreasing pain sensitivity
