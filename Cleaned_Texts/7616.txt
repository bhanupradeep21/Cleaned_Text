asthma common pulmonary condition defined chronic inflammation respiratory tubes tightening respiratory smooth muscle episodes centers disease control prevention estimate children adults asthma united states according world health organization asthma affects million people two major categories asthma allergic nonallergic focus article allergic asthma cases bronchoconstriction asthma episode inflamed airways react environmental triggers smoke dust pollen airways narrow produce excess mucus making difficult breathe essence asthma result immune response bronchial airways asthma patients hypersensitive certain triggers also known stimuli see usually classified type response exposure triggers bronchi large airways contract spasm asthma attack inflammation soon follows leading narrowing
