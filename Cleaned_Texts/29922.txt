listeriosis bacterial infection commonly caused listeria although l ivanovii l grayi reported certain cases listeriosis cause severe illness including severe sepsis meningitis encephalitis sometimes resulting lifelong harm even death risk severe illness elderly fetuses newborns immunocompromised pregnant women may cause stillbirth spontaneous abortion preterm birth common listeriosis may cause mild selflimiting gastroenteritis fever listeria ubiquitous primarily transmitted via oral route ingestion contaminated food products bacteria penetrates intestinal tract cause systemic infections diagnosis listeriosis requires isolation causative bacteria blood andor cerebrospinal fluid treatment includes prolonged administration antibiotics primarily ampicillin gentamicin organism usually susceptible disease primarily affects older adults persons weakened immune systems pregnant women newborns rarely people without risk factors also affected person listeriosis usually fever muscle aches often preceded diarrhea gastrointestinal symptoms almost everyone diagnosed listeriosis invasive infection meaning bacteria spread intestines bloodstream body sites disease may occur much two

conditions leading fatal nature listeriosis infection liver condition causes subclinical pyogranulomatous hepatitis central nervous system causes meningoencephalitis pregnancy individuals causes
