convenient patients undergoing vitreoretinal anterior segment cataract levobupivacaine combined analgesics including opioids postoperative pain using mgml levobupivacaine similar bupivacaine contraindicated obstetric patients use paracervical blocks obstetrics also contraindicated levobupivacaine furthermore contraindicated patients known hypersensitivity levobupivacaine amidetype local anaesthetics patients severe hypotension eg cardiac hypovolemic shock use intravenous regional anaesthesia bier possible adverse effects central nervous system caused levobupivacaine usage lightheadedness tinnitus tongue numbness convulsions may due blockade sodium potassium calcium channels tissues intended cardiotoxicity may result indirect effects drug blockade myocardial sympathetic nerves thus leading contractile delay direct effects blockade potassium effects nature lead lowered contractile function arrhythmogenic effects potentially cause cardiovascular collapse note drug also vasoconstrictive activity thereby increasing duration sensory blockage relatively low risk central nervous system toxicity one hand effect uteroplacental blood flow harm ultimately levobupivacaine shown lower risk cardiovascular central nervous system toxicity compared bupivacaine animal studies expense potency efficacy therefore considered levobupivacaine become favourable alternative regional anaesthesia bupivacaine due reduced toxicity plethora nonhuman studies established levobupivacaine lower risk cardiac neurotoxic adverse animal studies show lethal dose levobupivacaine approximately higher general laevorotatory isomers tend cause significantly fewer adverse effects thus safer pharmacological levobupivacaine protein binding rate higher observed faster protein binding rate
