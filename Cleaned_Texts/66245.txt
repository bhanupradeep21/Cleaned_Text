blue baby syndrome refer conditions cause cyanosis blueness skin babies result low oxygen levels blood term traditionally applied cyanosis result although common causes cyanosis potential factors cause blue tint babys skin mucous membranes factors include hypoventilation perfusion ventilation differences lungs poor cardiac output oxygenated blood among others blue baby syndrome cyanosis occurs absolute amount deoxygenated hemoglobin typically reflected saturation conditions cause cyanosis bluish discoloration skin mucous normally oxygenated blood appears red deoxygenated blood blue babies low levels oxygen mixing oxygenated deoxygenated blood blood blue purple color causing main sign blue baby syndrome cyanosis depending underlying cause cyanosis additional symptoms may blue baby syndrome attributed cyanotic congenital heart diseases methemoglobinemia however additional causes could result baby becoming cyanotic specific types congenital heart defects cause blood pass directly right side heart left side result defects blood pumped body oxygenated lungs therefore appear blue infants types heart defects may constant bluish tint skin may temporary episodes cyanosis degree cyanosis dependent much deoxygenated blood mixed oxygenated blood pumped body cardiac conditions decreased blood flow lungs tetralogy fallot pulmonary valve atresia result less blood becoming oxygenated also cardiac conditions transposition great arteries truncus arteriosus results overall increase blood flow lungs limited flow oxygenated blood rest body conditions poor blood flow systemic circulation coarctation aorta suggests body receive oxygenated blood requires resultant five common cyanotic heart defects may result blue baby syndrome include following methemoglobinemia acquired congenital occurs iron hemoglobin oxidized leading poor binding oxygen additionally oxygen already bound held tightly hemoglobin due higher affinity resulting less oxygen delivery methemoglobin level causes cyanosis common congenital cause deficiency enzyme cytochrome reductase reduces methemoglobin however infants common cause methemoglobinemia acquired ingestion nitrates well water foods infants younger months greater risk given drink water per body weight lower nadh cytochrome reductase activity higher level fetal hemoglobin converts easily methemoglobin additionally infants increased risk episode gastroenteritis due production nitrites sources nitrate include fertilizers used agricultural lands waste dumps pit example nitrate levels subject monitoring comply drinking water quality standards united states link blue baby syndrome nitrates drinking water widely accepted studies indicated contaminants dietary nitrate sources might also play role diagnosing blue baby syndrome important perform thorough history physical exam obtaining history important determine timing symptoms ask risk factorsexposures prenatal history access physical exam important visualize cyanosis present differentiate peripheral central cyanosis central cyanosis typically visible blueish discoloration entire body mucous membranes contrast peripheral cyanosis typically blueish discoloration extremities cyanosis noted babies around lips tongue sublingual area skin addition important observe infant signs respiratory distress visualized nasal flaring subcostal retractions etc examination include respiratory cardiac one key tools diagnosing pulse oximeter determine oxygen saturation severe cyanosis easily noticed oxygen saturation low causes mild clinical cyanosis difficult additionally arterial blood gas useful example case methemoglobinemia expected normal even low oxygen saturation additional work includes complete blood count blood glucose blood culture chest xray babies cyanosis due congenital heart disease usually present symptoms hours days birth addition cyanosis often show signs tachypnea fast breathing heart murmur decreased peripheral congenital heart disease suspected newborn doctors likely perform several tests evaluate heart including chest xray echocardiogram tetralogy fallot episodes infants become cyanotic called tet spells typically occurring feeding older children may squat feel relief since increases systemic vascular resistance causing blood go towards lungs resulting increased babies cyanosis due methemoglobinemia also usually present cyanosis neonatal period pulse oximetry may falsely elevated always reveal low blood oxygen saturation cooximeter used detect levels methemoglobin blood methemoglobinemia suspected seeing difference oxygen saturation arterial blood gas measurement cooximeter additionally direct methemoglobin level may united states environmental protection agency established maximum contaminant level mgl nitrate mgl nitrite drinking water due potential harmful effects screening tool developed screen critical cardiac defects refers cardiac lesions require surgery intervention year life screening critical congenital heart defects done newborns shortly discharge oxygen saturation measured right hand either screening considered positive treatment blue baby syndrome depend underlying cause evaluating patient cyanosis respiratory distress vital signs monitored especially patients heart rate oxygen saturation beneficial vascular access established newborns pulse oximeter typically placed right hand determine preductal oxygenation referring oxygenation ductus arteriosus connection aorta pulmonary gives oxygenation level heart brain receive traditionally supplemental oxygen given escalating manner beginning freeflowing oxygen progressing positive pressure ventilation continuous positive airway pressure ending mechanical intubation goal oxygen saturation infant requires supplemental oxygen prolonged time heated humidified avoid heat babies born cyanotic heart disease treated prostaglandin birth keep ductus arteriosus open allow oxygenated blood pumped body many also receive oxygen therapy increase percentage oxygen blood babies require surgery infancy correct structural heart firstline treatment severe methemoglobinemia methylene blue medication reduce methemoglobin blood possible methylene blue oxidizes nadph turn convert methemoglobin back babies born congenital heart defects cyanosis result tetralogy fallot common cyanotic cardiac heart methemoglobinemia considered rare acquired methemoglobinemia encountered congenital case cyanotic causing heart defects infants survive year age survive years age individuals increased risk
