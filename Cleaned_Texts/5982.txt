effects include headache diarrhea vomiting rash peripheral nerve severe side effects include high blood lactate pancreatitis enlarged generally recommended stavudine nucleoside analog reversetranscriptase inhibitor nrti class stavudine first described approved use united states available generic stavudine used treatment infection cure normally recommended initial stavudine also reduce risk developing infection coming contact virus either work eg needlestick exposure infected blood bodily always used combination hiv medications better control infection reduction hiv world health organization recommends stavudine phased due high toxicity levels drug must used recommended use low dosages reduce occurrence side effects however cochrane review found clear advantage high low dosage stavudine demonstrated affect fetus animal studies data available human pregnant women therefore given stavudine potential benefits outweigh potential harm fetus additionally case reports fatal lactic acidosis pregnant women receiving combination therapy stavudine didanosine antiviral centers disease control prevention recommend hivinfected mothers breastfeed infants order avoid risk hiv transmission breast also evidence stavudine gets animal breast milk although data available human breast stavudine safe use children infected hiv birth adolescence adverse effects safety profile
