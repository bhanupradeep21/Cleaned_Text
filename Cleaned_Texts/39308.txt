structures built nonhuman animals often called animal common many species examples animal structures include termite mounds ant hills wasp beehives burrow complexes beaver dams elaborate nests birds webs spiders often structures incorporate sophisticated features temperature regulation traps bait ventilation specialpurpose chambers many features may created individuals complex societies social animals different forms carrying specialized roles constructions may arise complex building behaviour animals case nighttime nests inbuilt neural responses feature prominently construction bird songs triggered hormone release case domestic emergent properties simple instinctive responses interactions exhibited termites combinations process building structures may involve learning cases even tool use may also involved building structures building behaviour common many nonhuman mammals birds insects arachnids also seen species fish reptiles amphibians molluscs urochordates crustaceans annelids arthropods virtually absent animal animals create structures primarily three animals primarily build habitat protection extreme temperatures predation constructed structures raise physical problems need resolved humidity control ventilation increases complexity structure time evolution animals use shelters purposes reproduction food storage predators attracted animalbuilt structures either prey offspring stored caches food structures built animals may provide protection predators avoiding detection means camouflage concealment prevention invasion predators located hideout prey combination last resort structures may provide means escape among structures created animals prevent predation paper wasps polistes chinensis nests wasps contain defensive structures formations built onto inside nest prevent new nests formed spring young queens worker wasps hatched time worker wasps growing nest vulnerable predators might rip open nest eat one method queens use prevent covering developing pupae pulp acts reinforcer makes difficult predators break open pupae pulp mixture plant matter liquids mouth queen costs associated using pulp requiring time energy collect materials hindering emergence worker wasps cocoon lower risk predation nests areas higher predation rates found contain pulp cocoons nests low predation animals use techniques crypsis camouflage concealment mimicry avoiding species birds use materials foraged nature camouflage nests prevent offspring gnatcatchers polioptila caerulea longtailed tits aegithalos caudatus use materials spider webbing silk lichen species great crested flycatchers myiarchus crinitus common waxbills estrilda astrild use animal feces snake skins disguise nests crypsis works blending structure use lichen flakes outer covering

systems may cool nest habitat trapbuilding method used catch prey instead active animals snare prey construct trap wait nearby organism observed webbuilding spiders weave elaborate webs sticky spider silk entangle spiders increase size webs prey scarce add extra ornamental pieces web order attract traps allow organisms capture larger prey provide protection predators serve area mating seen another method trap creation used antlion myrmeleon crudelis larva prey small arthropods larva dig pits fineparticle soil capture prey fall holes often unable climb antlions may alter pits based prey areas less available prey antlions make wider holes increase chance catching prey able climb hole antlions increase depth animal structures serve means communication animals may construct attract mates seen species male fiddler crabs may form pillars hoods sand mud gain attention nearby bowerbirds ptilonorhynchus violaceus also create display structures attract mating season male bowerbirds collect twigs colourful objects create structures known bowers attract attention bowers colourful well constructed attractive female bowerbirds quality constructed bowers reflects quality male army ants eciton hamatum form living bridges assist army ant colonies may move locations day search bridges provide path obstacles allow ants search food increased bridges constructed ants join bodies together vary size shape depending situation ants ants confined position forming bridges preventing bridges broken apart longer materials used animals building structures need suitable kind structure built also manipulable animals materials may organic nature mineral may also categorised collected material selfsecreted animals collect materials plastic properties used construct shape nest include resin collected stingless bees mud collected swallows silk collected materials nature act ready made building blocks animals question feathers leaf petioles birds animal hair chaffinch materials need processed caddisfly larvae use stone pieces also cut sections green leaves use construction stone pieces selected per size shape large variety case leaf sections cut shaped required size similarly bagworms cut shape thorns twigs form sphecid wasps collect mud blend water construct free standing nests paper wasp queens build paper pulp prepare rasping wood jaws mixing saliva case collecting
