patients cases least well removed bacteria nothing remove bacteria wright strongly supported flemings findings despite army physicians course war continued use antiseptics even cases worsened condition st marys hospital fleming continued investigations bacteria culture antibacterial substances research scholar time v allison recalled fleming tidy researcher usually expected unusual bacterial growths culture plates fleming teased allison excessive tidiness laboratory allison rightly attributed untidiness success flemings experiments said tidy thought would made two great late maintaining agar plates bacteria found one plates contaminated bacteria air added nasal mucus found mucus inhibited bacterial surrounding mucus area clear transparent circle cm mucus indicating killing zone bacteria followed glassy translucent ring beyond opaque area indicating normal bacterial growth next test used bacteria maintained saline formed yellow suspension within two minutes adding fresh mucus yellow saline turned completely clear extended tests using tears contributed coworkers allison reminisced saying next five six weeks tears source supply extraordinary phenomenon many lemons used failure onions produce flow tears demand us tears great laboratory attendants pressed service receiving threepence tests sputum cartilage blood semen ovarian cyst fluid pus egg white

become model different biological importance lysozyme recognised fleming well aware presidential address royal society medicine meeting october said choose lysozyme subject address two reasons firstly fatherly interest name secondly importance connection natural immunity seem generally nobel lecture december briefly mentioned lysozyme saying penicillin first antibiotic happened towards end century true importance flemings discovery immunology realised lysozyme became first antimicrobial protein discovered constitute part innate one sometimes finds one looking woke dawn september certainly didnt
