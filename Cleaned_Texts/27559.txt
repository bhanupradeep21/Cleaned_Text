hibernaculum plural form hibernacula latin tent winter quarters place animal seeks refuge bear using cave overwinter word used describe variety shelters used many kinds animals including insects toads lizards snakes bats rodents primates various species insects range size structure general appearance use hibernacula insects primarily reason extremely cold temperatures experienced winter outside tropical locations cause metabolic systems shut long exposure may lead death insects survive colder winters process overwintering occurs stages development may include migration hibernation different insects latter must done hibernacula insects migrate must halt growth avoid freezing death process called insects prepare overwinter variety mechanisms using antifreeze proteins cryoprotectants freezeavoidant insects like soybean aphids cryoprotectants toxic high concentrations tolerated low temperatures thus hibernacula used avoid sporadic warming risk death due high concentrations cryoprotectants warmer freezetolerant insects like secondgeneration cornborers survive frozen therefore undergo inoculative hibernacula range size structure depending insects using however insect hibernacula generally required insects like convergent lady bugs reuse hibernacula year year converge lady beetles migrate hibernacula used prior generations able find old hibernacula due hydrocarbons released lady beetle feet create lasting path allows lady beetles retrace footsteps previously used tendency aggregate overwinter groups likely due attraction similar environments conspecifics beetles use rock crevices hibernacula often clumping groups rock crevices found rock fields beetle attracted high levels vegetation types insect hibernacula include selfspun silk hibernacula made used spruce budworms moult overwinter second example eastern spruce budworm creates hibernacula dispersing first instar overwinter emerging hibernacula early woolly bear caterpillars overwinter caterpillars grow isabella tiger moths use plant debris makeshift hibernacula protect extreme butterflies like white admiral butterfly also mature halfway caterpillar hibernating freezeavoidant insects ideal hibernacula dry freezeavoidant insects less likely dampen freeze however moist hibernacula promote inoculative freezing freezetolerant amphibians hibernate include several species frogs salamanders northern continental climates north america eurasia also extreme southern hemisphere amphibians slow metabolism winter avoid unsuitable conditions freezing freeze avoidance strategies include overwintering aquatic situations burrowing soil depths hibernaculum amphibians provide species cool continental climates hibernate temperatures species survive hibernation temperatures exceed generally amphibians hibernate ice necessary animal submerged water cm deep maintain temperature water well aerated maintained lowintensity light levels minimal disturbance amphibians like amphibians frogs show minimal capacities freezing tolerance survive winter using terrestrial hibernacula avoid freezing however frogs may exhibit greater freezetolerance capacity high latitude range limits winter climate severe example data suggests cricket frogs south dakota survive winter locating hibernacula prevent freezing toleration short freezing bouts may expand range suitable however overwinter mortality may high northern range boundary due colder temperatures might limit cricket frogs expanding range microclimate refers climate small restricted area like hibernaculum especially differs climate surrounding area overwinter survival cricket frogs among frogs dependent using hibernacula appropriate physical microclimate characteristics moist soil buffer frogs temperatures drop freezing point body fluids extended although determining frogs identify sites appropriate microclimates support overwinter survival factors might inform choices still unknown require study therefore still

quality terrestrial habitat increasing number potential overwintering also determined habitat surrounding breeding ponds plenty cover suitable overwintering sites may less need provision artificial hibernacula landscapes less woodland hedgerows scrub great crested newts show high loyalty overwintering locations returning established areas year year artificial hibernacula could important future

however therefore studies need conducted order create speciesappropriate artificial hibernaculacitation needed many reptiles undergo hibernation process called brumation similar hibernation processes require usage hibernaculum staying inside insulated hibernaculum strategy avoid harsh winter months frigid outside temperatures may kill ectothermic reptile depress metabolism heart rates reduce energy consumption dont need exit hibernacula hibernating reptiles also safer predation inside concealed protected hibernacula various species turtles snakes lizards use hibernacula forms vary hibernacula typically common snapping turtles generally hibernate six months early october midapril live lakes active months travel small offshoot streams hibernate hibernacula meters away main body home lake snapping turtles hibernate burrowing banks alder streams vegetated streams use structures abandoned beaver dens streams typically less deep wide covered sunken alder roots fallen trees covered ice winter many animals return stream hibernate subsequent unlike solitary snapping turtles snakes may either hibernate alone large aggregations several thousand individuals different species use wide variety hibernacula including rock piles debrisfilled wells caves crevices unused burrows made animals ant mounds common european viper actually observed using hibernacula listed species seem prefer finding alreadypresent suitable site rather constructing one expand upon present structures may make burrows arent quality sites pine snakes closely related louisiana pine snakes two wellstudied hibernating snake species share similar hibernacula characteristics species sometimes construct burrows use tunnels formed decay tree roots gophers tunnels form complex networks side chambers house one mesquite lizards mexico southern united states found hibernating groups cracks slabs bark mesquite common collared lizards spend months hibernating almost always solitarily though pairs juvenile females observed within hibernaculum use undersides rock slabs hibernacula digging small chamber dirt large enough bodies small tunnel outside access adults use larger rock slabs dig deeper chambers longer tunnels perhaps extreme example seen viviparous lizard northern lizards burrow soil go leaf litter use shelters like rocks hibernacula although air temperature west siberia drop soil temperature depths lizards hibernate remains higher enables survive harshest temperatures like animals mammals hibernate seasons harsh environmental conditions resource scarcity requires less energy maintain homeostasis survive individual hibernating costeffective strategy increase survival hibernation usually perceived taking place winter wellknown hibernators bears also occur dry season little food water mouse lemurs given mammals spend anywhere months hibernating choice hibernaculum essential determining hibernacula vary greatly typically many bears occupy similar hibernacula smaller mammals course much larger vary greatly across within species black bears excavate dens hillside base tree stump shrub make dens bases hollow trees hollow logs rock caves cavities den reuse observed species rarely significant den size differences age sex classes except adult males creating larger grizzly bears likewise dont show age sex class differences den dimensions grizzlies prefer hibernacula sites abundant ground canopy cover abundant polar bears differ black bears grizzlies bear species sexes hibernate females use hibernacula like female bears polar bears use hibernacula maternity dens also like species tend dig dens earth although arctic hibernacula usually covered snow time bats favor larger hibernacula large groups may roost together including natural caves mines cellars kinds underground sites manmade structures like within hibernacula bats still highly tuned environmental factors little brown bats northern latitudes hibernate eight months winter leave roosts warm spring weather insect prey plentiful bats gauge outside temperature attuned airflow hibernacula entrance driven temperature differences inside outside hibernacula allowing bats leave temperature
