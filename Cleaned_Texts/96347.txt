shunt specifically shunting blood flow lungs properly oxygenated shunts may occur venous arterial blood mix completely bypass lungs extrapulmonary every alveolus perfectly ventilated blood right ventricle pass fully functional pulmonary capillaries unimpeded diffusion across alveolar capillary membrane would theoretical maximum blood gas exchange alveolar arterial would formula shunt describes deviation normal lung imperfectly ventilated perfused small degree intrapulmonary shunting normal anatomical shunting occurs blood supply lungs via pulmonary arteries returned via pulmonary veins without passing pulmonary capillaries thereby bypassing alveolar gas exchange capillary shunting blood passes capillaries unventilated deoxygenated blood flowing directly pulmonary arterioles

method narrowing differential diagnosis gradient calculation follows represents alveolar oxygen pressure represents arterial oxygen pressure arterial oxygen pressure directly measured using arterial blood gas test abg estimated via venous blood gas test vbg alveolar oxygen pressure easily measured directly therefor estimated using alveolar gas represents alveolar oxygen pressure patm represents atmospheric pressure sea level mm hg represents partial pressure water approximately mm hg represents fraction inspired oxygen represents partial pressure carbon dioxide alveoli normal physiological

perfusion alveoli persist blood regions would less oxygenated blood normally ventilated alveioli combined blood oxygenation mixing would lower normal pulmonary shunt occurs imbalance undercompensated normal response pulmonary blood vessels sensing low oxygen saturation constrict slowing flow underoxygenated areas thereby giving time increase saturation increasing relative flow areas effective oxygenation resulting higher combined oxygen available alveoli blood oxygenated blood flowing areas lung considered intrapulmonary shunt pulmonary shunt ventilationperfusion ratio zero lung units vq v ventilation q perfusion ratio less indistinguishable shunt gas exchange perspectivecitation needed alveoli fill fluid unable participate gas exchange blood causing local regional hypoxia thus triggering vasoconstriction vasoconstriction triggered smooth muscle reflex consequence low oxygen concentration blood redirected away area poorly matches ventilation perfusion areas ventilated decrease perfusion relative ventilation occurs pulmonary embolism example example increased dead dead space space gas exchange take place trachea ventilation without perfusion pathological example dead zone would capillary blocked embolus although ventilation area unaffected blood able flow capillary therefore zone gas exchange dead zones may corrected supplying inspired oxygen capillary blocked blood inside flow upstream blood distributes capillaries exchanging gases effectively resulting blood flows saturated contains unoxygenated blood one came blocked capillary reason blood
