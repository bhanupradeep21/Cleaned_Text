clavicle collarbone slender sshaped long bone approximately inches cm serves strut shoulder blade sternum breastbone two clavicles one left one right clavicle long bone body lies together shoulder blade makes shoulder girdle palpable bone people less fat region location bone clearly visible receives name latin clavicula little key bone rotates along axis like key shoulder abducted clavicle commonly fractured bone easily fractured impacts shoulder force falling outstretched arms direct collarbone thin doubly curved long bone connects arm trunk located directly first rib acts strut keep scapula place arm hang freely rounded medial end sternal end articulates manubrium sternum breastbone sternoclavicular joint flattened lateral end acromial end articulates acromion process scapula shoulder blade acromioclavicular joint rounded medial region sternal region shaft long curve laterally anteriorly along twothirds entire shaft flattened lateral region acromial region shaft even larger posterior curve articulate acromion scapula medial region longest clavicular region takes twothirds entire shaft lateral region widest clavicular region thinnest clavicular region lateral end rough inferior surface bears ridge trapezoid line slight rounded projection conoid tubercle coracoid process surface features attachment sites muscles ligaments shoulder divided three parts medial end

costal cartilage lateral end also known acromial end flat downward bears facet articulates shoulder form acromioclavicular joint area surrounding joint gives attachment joint capsule anterior border concave forward posterior border convex backward shaft divided two main regions medial region lateral region medial region also known sternal region longest clavicular region takes twothirds entire

laying minerals onto preformed matrix development embryo fifth sixth weeks gestation however one last bones finish ossification years age lateral end formed intramembranous ossification medially formed endochondral ossification consists mass cancellous bone surrounded compact bone shell cancellous bone forms via two ossification centres one medial one lateral fuse later compact forms layer fascia covering bone stimulate ossification adjacent tissue resulting compact bone known periosteal collar even though classified long bone collarbone medullary cavity marrow cavity like long made spongy cancellous bone shell compact dermal bone derived elements originally attached skull shape clavicle varies long bones occasionally pierced branch supraclavicular nerve males clavicle usually longer larger females study measuring males females saw difference collarbone length age groups mm males females left clavicle usually longer weaker right collarbones sometimes partly completely absent cleidocranial dysostosis levator claviculae muscle present people originates transverse processes upper cervical vertebrae inserted lateral half clavicle collarbone serves several muscles ligaments attach collarbone include vertical line drawn midclavicle called midclavicular line used reference describing cardiac apex beat medical examination also useful evaluating enlarged liver locating gallbladder midclavicular line transpyloric plane clavicle fractures colloquially broken collarbone occur result injury trauma common type fractures occur person falls horizontally shoulder outstretched hand direct hit collarbone also cause break cases direct hit occurs lateral side towards medial side bone common site fracture junction two curvatures bone weakest results sternocleidomastoid muscle lifting medial aspect superiorly result perforation overlying skin clavicle first appears part skeleton primitive bony fish associated pectoral fin also bone called cleithrum fish paired clavicles run behind gills side joined solid symphysis fishs underside however absent cartilaginous fish vast majority living bony fish including earliest tetrapods retained arrangement addition diamondshaped interclavicle base clavicles although found living amphibians cleithrum disappeared early evolution reptiles found living amniotes interclavicle present modern reptiles also monotremes modern forms however number variations primitive pattern example crocodilians salamanders lack clavicles altogether although crocodilians retain interclavicle turtles form part armoured interclavicle absent marsupials placental mammals many mammals clavicles also reduced even absent allow scapula greater freedom motion may useful fastrunning though number fossil hominin humans chimpanzees clavicles found mere segments offering limited information form function pectoral girdle one exception clavicle al attributed australopithecus afarensis wellpreserved sternal end one interpretation specimen based orientation lateral end position deltoid attachment area suggests clavicle distinct found extant apes including humans thus shape human shoulder dates back less million years ago however analyses clavicle extant primates suggest low position scapula humans reflected mostly curvature medial portion clavicle rather lateral portion part bone similar afarensis thus possible species high shoulder position similar modern dinosaurs main bones pectoral girdle scapula shoulder blade coracoid directly articulated clavicle clavicle present saurischian dinosaurs largely absent ornithischian dinosaurs place scapula articulated humerus upper bone forelimb called glenoid clavicles fused theropod dinosaurs form furcula equivalent birds clavicles interclavicle
