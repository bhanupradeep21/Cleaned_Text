killing modern elephants occurrence tool marks bifaces found kill sites leaves doubt clovis people fact kill hunt mastodons mammoths camel horses bison could hunting caused mass extinction came end pleistocene climate change third theory also emerging colonists possibly domesticated dogs brought disease caused extinction species hunted humans became extinct doesnt account loss many species loss cornerstone species typically result implosion population diversity similar see transition pleistocene holocene probably caused loss major species vegetation previously accepted idea called clovis first theory mean clovis showed fluted biface technology assumes years original settlers developed technology clovis first successful material culture north america became widespread however new dates

environment however ideas studies result driven information field past half century third less subscribed theory called solutrean hypothesis bruce bradley dennis stanford recently resurrected idea charles conrad abbott claimed early colonists came european roots although solutrean bifaces look similar clovis technology lacking flute separated time years solutrian industry lasted bce bce clovis popularly held bce even face modern dating techniques bradley stanford continued lecture published papers pursuing model theory based atlatl hunting strategies utilized maritime arctic type environment stanford bradley theorize people hunting seals would moving across ice sheets groups could cover breathing holes prescribed technique studies found seals today northern europe north eastern canada migrate greenland theory people using something much like atlatl hunt seals large aquatic mammals could followed wrong group seals back north america used spear based bifacial technology adapt new environment would mean paleoindians probably boat technology used spear hunting technology ocean adapted large terrestrial game seemingly enormous time gap solutrian clovis overcome rising sea levels peoples dependence aquatic resources theory makes sense without good knowledge floral assemblages would difficult risky depend plant resources survival meat hunting reliably nontoxic reported dennis stanford recent lectures mammoth bones dredged shores delaware atlantic ocean one bones actually projectile point possibly preclovis morphologically lacking flute nearly identical solutrean biface model contradicting genetic mapping based mitochondrial dna though many people disagree similarities bifacial technology explained independent invention empirically based

group huntergatherers persisted across continent technology spread across continent successful points large enough kill found multiple kill sites megafauna extinct studies shown even light hunting large animals cause extinction data supports climate change caused extinctions many improvements technology came archaic indians increase social connection many advantages technology economics society constant interaction groups archaic indians gave opportunity trade many things tools weapons strategies techniques ideas exchanged frequently wider range people paleoindians obviously universally improved living condition everyone involved sped advancement throughout early middle late archaic age speed technological advancement increased steadily beginning slow progression early archaic age ending much quickly immense change solitary hunting late archaic age projectile technology greatly drew hunters almost game together exchange techniques technology increased interaction provided opportunity learn teach practices also band together hunt team along technology environmental opportunity helped define trend archaic indians integration practices social interaction opposed solitary hunting one distinctions archaic indians predecessors characteristics complex weaponry expendable smaller projectiles favored larger melee weapons many fuels change outside obvious advantages type weapon use though environment one factor newer availability resources postglacial age changed abundance weapons also type less concerned availability local weapon materials archaic indians favored cheap fast easy weapons meant archaic indians projectiles projectile weapons great disadvantages limiting use breaking often stated earlier abundance local materials meant brand new dart arrow could made quickly cheaply also produced interesting trend technology clovis tipped spears paleoindians required remarkable amount skill familiarity material spear head great deal care skill taken creation larger size persistence user meant user also cared great deal quality many clovis tips surviving today remarkable characteristics truly experienced individual could create many marks clovis tips done single blow larger rocks less expendable safe assume relatively low failure rate concerning probability error one would assume great deal familiarity present craftsmen physical characteristics local rocks smaller flying weapons archaic age meant less time care taken tips habit became less familiarity rocks also habitual migration interaction others meant trade happened often complexity quality clovis tips relatively quickly replaced cheaper inferior tips archaic age although style obviously efficient interesting see devolution material craftsmanship brought change climate lessening concern

emphasizing high degree residential begin understanding modern hunting technologies modern civilizations origins hunting techniques must examined many inuit tribes around canada late century excellent examples modern premodern hunting techniques indigenous peoples lived arctic coast plains thousands years learned adapt environment also modernized methods contemporary weapon technology come global market use rifle decreased energy needed hunt prey distances previously allowed traditional methods depending typesizecaliber weapon typically determines type metal used also bigger calibre gun easier obtain bigger prey increase general diet use rifle would taken energy hunt stalk kill caribou particularly herd move however rifle increased accuracy range meat available distributed families tribe also skins animal turned leather rawhide use furs keep warm however rifles weapon used hunting technologies available winter harpoons summer harpoons winter harpoons toggling harpoon made wood iron brass iron used shaft brass typically used hook handle harpoon made wood tightly attached iron shaft harpoons fairly small narrow used primarily stab seals breathing hole hunter set hunting area would stand breathing hole knows seal seal brought surface transported back community women children waited many uses seal food blubber fuel hides warmth bone create weapons thrusting spears type used also summer version winter harpoon summer harpoon composed natural materials wood ivory walrus tusk harpoons bigger weighed much used hunt larger animals bearded seals walruses wood used handle walrus tusk used shaft straightness brass hook also replaced ivory heavier hundreds thousands years many diverse inuit communities arctic subarctic survived traditional forms hunting recently expansion western ideas ideologies technology cultural ideas remained untouched new technologies played role modernday hunting techniques mentioned earlier one hunting technologies gun dramatically improved hunting efficiencies since boating guns must kept ready hand case seal suddenly bobs within introduction technology hunters would instead armed sort thrusting spear harpoon hopes catching meal introduction gun accuracy killing animal also quickness readiness response time group primitive according western ideology come global economy even ever slightly use guns must purchased somewhere none inuit groups makes guns exchange money hunters sell furs seal meat however guns modernized technology groups adapted also snowmobiles allow easy transportation along faster distance traveling consumption gasoline also prevalent society gas another commodity must purchase wish continue modernized hunting practices william b kemp observing inuit baffin island canada recorded us gal l imp gal gasoline snowmobiles
