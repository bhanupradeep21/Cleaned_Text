novel psychedelic substance beta β ketone structural analogue psychedelic drug family used recreational drug usually taken orally controlled substance canada germany switzerland united kingdom designer drug specifically beta keto analogue controlled substance first synthesized alexander shulgin unknown first synthesized first appeared market recreational although synthesis compound previously years emergence market papers reporting analytical characterizations substance offered online termed psychedelic drug since october become controlled substance schedule iii also illegal germany switzerland united kingdom substituted phenethylamine features methoxy substituents ring well bromine ketone group present beta β position functional amine group connected alpha α carbon giving rise name indicating structural analogue ketone functional group correctly referred ketophenethylamine mistakenly referred substituted cathinone however cathinones definition ketoamphetamines amphetamine synthetic route replicated power et consists following steps starting mechanism synthetic pathway involves initial nucleophilic attack ketone carbon starting compound yields secondary alcohol oxidation use strong oxidizing agent pcc converts back ketone vicinal primary carbon easily brominated ketone halogenation delépine reaction employed convert alkyl halide primary amine affording mixed hydrochloridehydrobromide salt delépine reaction step advantage simple reaction conditions short reaction times makes use cheap easily available reagents primary amine react beta ketone second molecule vice versa form two imine bonds two molecules water eliminated reversible reaction process imine formation however ph dependent generally greatest near ph high ph enough acid protonate hydroxyl group low ph amine reactant protonated therefore lose nucleophilicity prerequisite reaction occur imine formation favored slightly acidic environments experimental evidence intramolecular reaction proceeds readily neutral ph imine formation present full extent two molecules purple pyrazine dimer formed dimer converted back imine hydrolysis process acid catalysis possible absolute requirement thermal decomposition studied using simulated meth pipe twelve major pyrolysis products found thermallyinduced decomposition compounds known properties example αchloro ketones known express level toxicity others found safe even analogues applied medicine example would patented compound suitable glaucoma treatment common classes drugs phenethylamine family oral administration reported goto route administration routes entry insufflation generally recommended users similarly irritate mucous membrane lines nasal cavity furthermore partial dimerization occur since nasal passages slightly basic forming pharmacologically inactive dimer numerous reports users experiencing intense pain nasal region excretion purple colored mucus following insufflation latter suggesting lower bioavailability route administration compared ingestion said times less potent requires higher doses perceived effect threshold dose mg often reported normal dosage ranges mg generally followed users also report steep doseresponse curve around upper limit dosage range nevertheless several testimonies reporting clear effect achieved mg dose reports express commencement action minutes significant psychological effect observed total duration hours despite seen relatively safe compound within dosage range listed report healthy male user cardiac arrest following dose mg attending experiences users recommend taking dose mg perceived effects change notoriously higher doses likely cause toxic effects thus dangerous approaching steep doseresponse curve attending chemical structure various possible interactions take place compound target receptors body functional groups within structure exert pharmacological activity receptor sites notable structureactivity relationships sar hydrogen bonding dipoledipole interactions van der waals interactions polar hydrophobic nature bromine atom four distinct sars proposed like substituted cathinones phenethylamine family suggested show affinity different subtypes serotonin receptor compounds interference reuptake dopamine serotonin noradrenaline also possible sufficient study affinity compound specific

receptor site assay measuring recruitment receptor registered efficacy comparison lsd reported nm respectively comparison displayed nm efficacy addition concentration registered namely nm shown cause agonistic response μopioid lastly affinity towards monoamine oxidase mao enzymes studied weak inhibition caused evident value μm maob whereas maoa value could determined due even weaker much known pharmacokinetics novel psychedelic clearance biotransformation compound within body therefore hard interpret moreover assessment toxicity caused possible current state research compound common many designer drugs therefore recreational use illadvised however extrapolation parent compound possible conclusive general compounds family shown metabolized liver hepatocytes resulting deamination demethylation oxidative deamination common substitutes dimethoxybenzoic acid produced following route biotransformation metabolism may occur demethylation contrast relatively high dosage compared members family indicates affinities pharmacologically active sites drastically differ compounds qualitatively however effects similar higher dosage could translate higher toxicity also longer halflife would increase exposure specific sites within body possibly giving rise increased toxic response compared like compounds family species differentiation likely metabolism enzyme expressions biotransformation enzymes differ dramatically species sex furthermore drugdrug interactions ddi possible example inhibition mao caused could potentiate drugs mimic amine neurotransmitters function amine neurotransmitters norepinephrine epinephrine serotonin dopamine show biotransformation pathways monoamine oxidase principally responsible degradation relatively small amount research towards effect compounds within family translates well close research conducted within field interest knowledge available reported anecdotally recreational users often main described pronounce effects open closedeye visuals time distortion euphoria effects common psychedelics substituted phenethylamine class strong similarity subjective effects caused however often described stimulating less psychedelic combined long duration could increase perceived severity effects also physiological stress could follow much like elevated heart rate blood pressure often reported could potentiate perceived sense euphoria perception namely color intensity bodily feelings like psychedelics regarded nonaddictive subsequent dosing intervals generally increase tolerance psychedelic substances form crosstolerance
