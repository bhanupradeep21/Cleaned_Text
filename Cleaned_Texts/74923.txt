latex allergy medical term encompassing range allergic reactions proteins present natural rubber generally develops repeated exposure products containing natural rubber latex latexcontaining medical devices supplies come contact mucous membranes membranes may absorb latex proteins susceptible people immune system produces antibodies react immunologically antigenic many items contain made natural rubber including shoe soles pen grips hot water bottles elastic bands rubber gloves condoms babybottle nipples balloons consequently many possible routes exposure may trigger reaction people latex allergies may also develop allergic reactions fruits allergic reactions latex range type hypersensitivity serious form reaction type iv rate onset directly proportional degree allergy type responses begin showing symptoms within minutes exposure latex type iv responses may take hours days commonly latex allergy presents hives point contact followed rhinitis common physiological reaction latex exposure dermatitis point contact gives way soreness itching redness angioedema also common response oral vaginal rectal symptoms severe hypersensitivity include local generalized hives feelings faintness impending doom angioedema nausea vomiting abdominal cramps rhinitis bronchospasm anaphylaxis type iv responses typically include erythema blistering forming vesicles papules itching crusting point irritant contact dermatitis considered nonimmune reaction degree reaction directly proportional duration exposure well skin temperature among latex allergy experience irritant contact dermatitis experience type allergic reaction experience type iv allergic contact dermatitis experience type type iv compared general population occupational populations frequently utilize latex gloves barrier healthcare professionals hospital staff see disproportionately high levels workers environments exposed latex allergens direct skin contact contaminated aerosolized powder gloves toy balloons dusted latex occupational settings employees frequently putting pulling powdered latex gloves hospitals health care settings increase rate airborne latex allergens subsequent hospital workers particularly risk due prevalence latex gloves number hospital implements tourniquets elastic bandages bag valve masks urinary occupations see increased exposure latex gloves supplies higher rates latex allergy irritation compared general population include housekeeping food service workers manufacturers industrial rubber reported allergic reactions latex occurred medical settings nonhealthcare workers show similar levels latex antibodies suggesting sensitized natural rubber latex sources inside home medical particular individuals chronic health concerns lead repeated surgeries catheterizations thus experience greater exposure latex allergens may develop outside hospital environments latex allergy may develop amateur professional athletes whose sports equipment includes natural rubber swimsuits running shoes rubber basketballs particular may lead contact dermatitis hands sensitization latex athletes may accelerated use topical analgesics agents diminish skin barrier increase also hypothesized young children may develop latex allergy due exposure home school environment objects rubber balloons boots gloves people spina bifida often latex allergies children condition reaction
