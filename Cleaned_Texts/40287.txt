surfactant metabolism dysfunction condition pulmonary surfactant insufficient adequate respiration surface tension liquidair interphase alveoli makes air sacs prone collapsing post expiration due fact water molecules liquidair surface alveoli attracted one another molecules air spherelike structures like alveoli water molecules line inner walls air sacs stick tightly together hydrogen bonds
