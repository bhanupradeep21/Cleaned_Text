mastocytosis type mast cell disease rare disorder affecting children adults caused accumulation functionally defective mast cells also called mastocytes mast cell people affected mastocytosis susceptible variety symptoms including itching hives anaphylactic shock caused release histamine proinflammatory substances mast mast cells undergo degranulation substances released cause number symptoms vary time range intensity mild severe mast cells play role allergic reactions symptoms mastocytosis often similar symptoms allergic reaction may include limited qualitative studies effects mastocytosis daily life however danish study describes multidimensional impact disease everyday mast cells located connective tissue including skin linings stomach intestine sites play important role immune defence bacteria parasites releasing chemical alarms histamine mast cells attract key players immune defense system areas body neededcitation needed mast cells seem roles well gather together around wounds mast cells may play part wound healing example typical itching felt around healing scab may caused histamine released mast cells researchers also think mast cells may role growth blood vessels angiogenesis one mast cells found indicates scientists may able survive mast cellscitation needed mast cells express cell surface receptor receptor stem cell factor scf laboratory studies scf appears important proliferation mast cells mutations gene coding ckit receptor mutation leading constitutive signalling receptor found patients systemic diagnosis urticaria pigmentosa cutaneous mastocytosis see often done seeing characteristic lesions dark brown fixed small skin sample biopsy may help confirm diagnosiscitation needed case suspicion systemic disease level serum tryptase blood help base level stryptase elevated implies mastocytosis systemic cases suspicion sm help also drawn analysis mutation peripheral blood using sensitive pcrtechnologycitation needed set diagnosis systemic mastocytosis certain criteria must met either one major one minor criterion three minor criteria types mast cell disease include mastocytosis occur variety forms cutaneous mastocytosis children usually presents first year birth cases vanishes adolescence systemic mastocytosis involves bone marrow majority cases cases internal organs usually addition involving skin mast cells collect various tissues affect organs mast cells normally inhabit liver spleen lymph nodes organs normal populations numbers increased bowel may manifest mastocytic however normal ranges mast cell counts gastrointestinal tract mucosa well established literature depend upon exact location eg right versus left colon gender patient populations asymptomatic patients versus patients chronic diarrhea unknown etiology quantitative mast cell stains may yield little diagnostic information research studies warranted determine whether mastocytic enterocolitis truly represents distinct five types systemic cure mastocytosis number medicines help treat antidepressants important often overlooked tool treatment mastocytosis depression neurological symptoms noted antidepressants doxepin mirtazapine potent antihistamines help relieve physical well cognitive symptomscitation needed cases advanced systemic mastocytosis rare cases indolent systemic mastocytosis troublesome symptoms cytoreductive therapy allogeneic stem cell transplantation used rare cases aggressive systemic mastocytosis patients deemed fit procedure treatment ultraviolet light relieve skin symptoms may increase risk skin patients indolent systemic mastocytosis normal life expectancy prognosis patients advanced systemic mastocytosis differs depending type disease mcl serious form short true incidence prevalence mastocytosis unknown mastocytosis generally considered orphan disease orphan diseases affect fewer people united states mastocytosis however often may misdiagnosed typically occurs secondary another condition thus may occur frequently assumedcitation needed national institute allergy infectious diseases scientists studying treating patients mastocytosis several years national institutes health nih clinical centercitation needed important research advances rare disorder include improved diagnosis mast cell disease identification growth factors genetic mechanisms responsible increased mast cell researchers currently evaluating approaches improve ways treat mastocytosiscitation needed scientists also focusing identifying diseaseassociated mutations changes genes nih scientists identified mutations may help researchers understand causes mastocytosis improve diagnosis develop better treatmentscitation needed europe european competence network mastocytosis ecnm coordinates studies
