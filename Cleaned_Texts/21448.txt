vomerine palatal process broad central portion wide maxillary process large dorsally located sutural surface anterior process maxilla premaxilla also bears anteriorly tilted dorsal nasal process key characteristic also foramen opens dorsally base dorsal process substantially larger oromycter autapomorphy arisierpeton presence four premaxillary teeth size unlike caseasaurs three two premaxillary teeth often first tooth largest tooth marginal maxillary dorsal process may slenderly built similar respects observed anatomy oromycter modest anterodorsal process maxilla present level internal narial border bone medially dorsal terminus broken complete maxillary fragment making difficult determine original height contrast oromycter preserved base narial border dorsal process wide rounded

sharp ridge distinctive anterolateral narial shelf restricted lacrimal bone anterior lateral surface maxilla single large anteriorly oriented foramen present arisierpeton instead series relatively large labial foramina situated along external surface bone external surface sculpturing also modest oromycter restricted faint grooves associated small foramina surface assignment two dentaries caseid based shape symphyseal area caseids dorsal edge dentary bone curves ventrally near symphysis forms acute angle ventral edge bone results substantially slender dentary bone near symphysis rest bone caseids related presence welldeveloped anterior process splenial bone one contributes large portion symphysis medially although dentary bones assigned nearly complete anteriorly morphology confirm entire depth height lower jaw symphysis dentary contributes dorsal half symphysis caseids splenial likely contributed symphysis formed lower part symphyseal region mandible assignment dentaries arisierpeton based mainly dental features extent labial surface characteristics bone teeth dentaries identical found maxillae addition surface characteristics labial side dentaries similar maxillae showing little sculpturing occasional small foramina welldeveloped anteriorly extending meckelian canal formed dentary bone would attached splenial premaxillary teeth known specimens damaged near tips show clear evidence tapering crownward however preserved teeth also show somewhat spatulate towards tip crown unlikely pointed maxillary teeth damaged way unfortunately preserved maxillary tooth rows short determine heterodonty present teeth show typical caseid morphology lingually curved crowns little recurvature unerupted tooth preserved partially resorbed tooth gaa typical teeth early stages development prior implantation enamel cap preserved simple conical structure although difficult discern small secondary cusp present along posterior edge cap tooth immediately anterior unerupted tooth similar superficial morphology premaxilla vertical fluting lingually enamel surface unfortunately teeth lost crown tips making difficult determine also tricuspid however arrangement fluting suggests also central cone teeth possibly two accessory cusps least incipient accessory anterior teeth dentary lean forward caseids intact teeth gaa smaller teeth anterior posterior carry kind vertical fluting lingually seen upper teeth apex tooth carries anterior posterior carinae slight hint accessory cusp associated fanning anterior fluting central cone tooth evidence posterior cusp fluting extends posterior carina teeth also appear slightly posteriorly tilted central cone typical caseid fashion clear evidence pronounced lingual tilt crown far determined dentary teeth conform pattern although

arisierpeton shows modifications tooth shape crown outline primitive amniote condition seen basal caseid eocasea eothyridid caseasaurians teeth show little recurvature instead medial lingual curvature apically crowns preserved show fluting occasional carinae sometimes sufficiently well developed formation tricuspid terminus somewhat reminiscent condition seen cotylorhynchus however kind bulging
