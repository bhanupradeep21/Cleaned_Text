skeptical commitment bias womens commitment skepticism arises high costs falsely inferring mates commitment relationship hypothesizes women adapted cognitively biased towards perceiving male interest commitment due high cost false positive man committed woman accepting could lead raising child without investing mate reputational damage risk reducing chances future courtship cost false negative man committed woman rejecting far less costly female women limited many children lifetime however men limited reproduce multiple times therefore overperception costs higher hypothesis mentioned briefly

negative errors drives cognitive biases decisionmaking processes gender defined imagine woman assessing potential mates commitment intent womans father also vested interest whether reproduces shares genes thus reproductive interests extend daughters mate choice father also evaluate costs benefits two types errors could make evaluating mates commitment intent chosen mate sexually deceives leaves outcome costly daughter cautious underestimates intent thus father might take time offering parental seal approval father shows skeptical commitment bias daughter favouring false negative error less costly taking parental dynamic switching father mother could said sexual overperception bias mother interest son decides mate therefore favour false positive error false negative fails detect real interest woman thus fails share female interest son costly falsely detects sexual interest woman towards son encourages pursue son misses opportunity missed chance pass genes therefore mother shows overperception bias son favouring false positive error less costly sex gender predicts type cognitive bias might expressed rather potential costs reproductive success contrasting evidence fertile females skeptical commitment bias occur postmenopausal women haselton buss found evidence perception biases studying young subjects however representative older females passed menopause reason disparity pre postmenopausal females fertile females underestimate intentions males invest relationship order avoid costs pregnancy without support however postmenopausal women perceive costs inability conceive means reason underestimate males intentions recent studies researching error management theory found men womens perceptions opposite gender sexual commitment interest may mitigated
