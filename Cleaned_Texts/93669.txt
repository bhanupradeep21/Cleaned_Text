heart sounds noises generated beating heart resultant flow blood specifically sounds reflect turbulence created heart valves snap shut cardiac auscultation examiner may use stethoscope listen unique distinct sounds provide important auditory data regarding condition heart healthy adults two normal heart sounds often described lub dub occur sequence heartbeat first heart sound second heart sound produced closing atrioventricular valves semilunar valves respectively addition normal sounds variety sounds may present including heart murmurs adventitious sounds gallop rhythms heart murmurs generated turbulent flow blood murmur heard turbulent flow must require pressure difference least mm hg chambers pressure dominant chamber outflow blood nondominant chamber diseased condition leads lefttoright shunt righttoleft shunt based pressure dominance turbulence may occur inside outside heart occurs outside heart turbulence called bruit vascular murmur murmurs may physiological benign pathological abnormal abnormal murmurs caused stenosis restricting opening heart valve resulting turbulence blood flows abnormal murmurs may also occur valvular insufficiency regurgitation allows backflow blood incompetent valve closes partial effectiveness different murmurs audible different parts cardiac cycle depending cause murmur normal heart sounds associated heart valves closing first heart sound forms lub lubdub composed components mitral valve closure tricuspid valve closure normally precedes slightly caused closure atrioventricular valves ie tricuspid mitral bicuspid beginning ventricular contraction systole ventricles begin contract papillary muscles ventricle papillary muscles attached cusps leaflets tricuspid mitral valves via chordae tendineae heart strings papillary muscles contract chordae tendineae become tense thereby prevent backflow blood lower pressure environment atria chordae tendineae act bit like strings parachute allow leaflets valve balloon atria slightly much evert cusp edges allow backflow blood pressure created ventricular contraction closes valve papillary muscles contraction ventricle begins prior av valves closing prior opening semilunar valves sudden tensing chordae tendineae squeezing ventricles closed semilunar valves send blood rushing back toward atria parachutelike valves catch rush blood leaflets causing valve snap shut sound results reverberation within blood associated sudden block flow reversal valves delay even normally causes split heard right bundle branch second heart sound forms dub lubdub composed components aortic valve closure pulmonary valve closure normally precedes especially inspiration split heard caused closure semilunar valves aortic valve pulmonary valve end ventricular systole beginning ventricular diastole left ventricle empties pressure falls pressure aorta aortic blood flow quickly reverses back toward left ventricle catching pocketlike cusps aortic valve stopped aortic valve closure similarly pressure right ventricle falls pressure pulmonary artery pulmonary valve closes sound results reverberation within blood associated sudden block flow splitting also known physiological split normally occurs inhalation decrease intrathoracic pressure increases time needed pulmonary pressure exceed right ventricular pressure widely split associated several different cardiovascular conditions split sometimes wide variable whereas sometimes wide fixed wide variable split occurs right bundle branch block pulmonary stenosis pulmonary hypertension ventricular septal defects wide fixed splitting occurs atrial septal defect pulmonary accentuated loud pulmonary hypertension pulmonary embolism becomes softer aortic rarer extra heart sounds form gallop rhythms heard normal abnormal third heart sound rarely heard also called protodiastolic gallop ventricular gallop informally kentucky gallop onomatopoeic reference rhythm stress followed together lubdubta sloshingin new indicates heart failure volume overloadcitation needed occurs beginning diastole lower pitch valvular origin third heart sound benign youth trained athletes sometimes pregnancy reemerges later life may signal cardiac problems failing left ventricle dilated congestive heart failure chf thought caused oscillation blood back forth walls ventricles initiated blood rushing atria reason third heart sound occur middle third diastole probably early part diastole ventricles filled sufficiently create enough tension may also result tensing chordae tendineae rapid filling expansion ventricle words heart sound indicates increased volume blood within ventricle heart sound best heard bellside stethoscope used lower frequency sounds leftsided best heard left lateral decubitus

called presystolic gallop atrial gallop gallop produced sound blood forced stiff hypertrophic talubdub astiffwall sign pathologic state usually failing hypertrophic left ventricle systemic hypertension severe valvular aortic stenosis hypertrophic cardiomyopathy sound occurs atrial contraction end diastole immediately producing rhythm sometimes referred tennessee gallop represents ten

sometimes referred atrial contraction must present production absent atrial fibrillation rhythms atrial contraction precede ventricular heart murmurs produced result turbulent flow blood strong enough produce audible noise usually heard whooshing sound term murmur refers sound believed originate within blood flow near heart rapid blood velocity necessary produce murmur heart problems produce murmur valve problems also produce audible murmurs heard many situations adults without major congenital heart though several different cardiac conditions cause heart murmurs murmurs change markedly severity cardiac disease astute physician sometimes diagnose cardiac conditions accuracy based largely murmur related physical examination experience relative frequency different heart conditions however advent better quality wider availability echocardiography techniques heart status recognized quantified much accurately formerly possible stethoscope examination experience another advantage use echocardiogram devices inhalation decreases intrathoracic pressure allows venous blood return right heart pulling blood right side heart via vacuumlike effect therefore rightsided heart murmurs generally increase intensity inhalation decreased negative intrathoracic pressure opposite effect left side heart making harder blood exit circulation therefore leftsided murmurs generally decrease intensity inhalation increasing venous blood return right side heart raising patients legs lying supine produces similar effect occurs inhalation inhalation also produce nonpathological split heard
