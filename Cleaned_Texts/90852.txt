like theropods deinonychosaurs bipedal walked two hind legs however whereas theropods walked three toes contacting ground fossilized footprint tracks confirm deinonychosaurs held second toe ground hyperextended position third fourth toes bearing weight animal called functional enlarged second toe bore unusually large curved sickleshaped claw held ground retracted walking claw especially large flattened side side largebodied predatory first toe hallux relatively small angled inward toward center body fully reversed modern teeth deinonychosaurs curved serrated bladelike except advanced species dromaeosaurus albertensis serrations front edge deinonychosaur teeth small fine back edge serrations large deinonychosaurs generally long winged forelimbs though smaller troodontids wings usually bore three large flexible deinonychosaurs seem predatory though smaller species especially among troodontids known least one bestknown features deinonychosaurs presence enlarged strongly curved sickle claw hyperextendible second toe modified hold sickle claw clear ground walking characteristic claw associated modifications anatomy foot shortened metatarsus eudromaeosaurs known since century possible functions subject mainly speculation actual studies published initial speculation regarded claws slashing implements used disembowel large prey scenario shortened upper foot would serve anchor point powerful tendons improve kicking ability however subsequent studies actual claw shape showed underside claw weakly keeled would effective cutting instrument instead appeared hooking implement manning et al suggested claws similar crampons used climbing case larger species individuals climbing flanks large larger study deinonychosaur claw function published fowler colleagues concluded earlier study manning colleagues correct sickle claws deinonychosaurs would ineffective cutting weapons compared claw overall foot anatomy various deinonychosaurs modern birds shed light actual function fowler colleagues showed many modern predatory birds also enlarged claws second toes modern raptors claws used help grip hold prey sizes smaller equal predator birds use body weight pin prey ground eat folwer colleagues suggested behavior entirely consistent anatomy advanced deinonychosaurs like deinonychus slightly opposing first toes strong tendons toes foot makes likely advanced dromaeosaurids also used claws puncture grip prey aid pinning ground using shallow wing beats tail movements stabilize lines evidence behavior include teeth large hooked serrations back edge useful pulling flesh upward rather slicing large claws wings greater maneuvering prey mantling primitive dromaeosaurids troodontids feet specialized claws large hooked additionally toe joints allowed range motion simple updown movements advanced dromaeosaurids makes likely species specialized smaller prey could pinned using inner toes requiring feet strong httpsenwikipediaorgwikideinonychosauria
