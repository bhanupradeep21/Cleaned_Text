pain babies whether babies feel pain large subject debate within medical profession centuries prior late nineteenth century generally considered babies hurt easily last quarter century scientific techniques finally established babies definitely experience pain probably adults developed reliable means assessing treating recently widely believed medical babies could feel pain year today believed newborns likely even fetuses beyond certain age experience pain number metabolic homeostatic changes result untreated pain including increased requirement oxygen accompanied reduction efficiency gas exchange lungs combination lead inadequate oxygen supply resulting potential hypoxemia addition rise stomach acidity accompanies stress reaction precipitated pain risk aspirating lungs endangering lung integrity tissue oxygenationcitation needed cases acute persistent pain metabolism becomes predominantly catabolic causing reduced efficiency immune system breakdown proteins caused action stress hormones combination healing damaged infected tissue may impaired morbidity mortality neuropsychological effect bonding mother child later contact health professionals personal social psychological wellbeing difficult quantify research suggests babies exposed pain neonatal period difficulty areas professionals working field neonatal pain speculated adolescent aggression selfdestructive behaviour including suicide may cases attributed longterm effects untreated neonatal present understanding pain babies largely due recognition fetal newborn unmyelinated nerve fibres capable relaying information albeit slower would case myelinated fibres birth baby developed neural pathways nociception experiencing pain pain responses immature version adult number differences nerve structure quality extent nerve response considered pertinent understanding neonatal nerves young babies respond readily noxious stimuli lower threshold stimulation adults babys threshold sensitization also substantially decreased whilst process involves much larger area sensitization neural pathways descend brain spinal cord well developed newborn resulting ability central nervous system inhibit nociception limited also indication neonates nervous system may much active adult terms transforming connections central nerve pathways response stimuli ongoing process neural pathway development involving structural chemical changes nervous system shown affected pain events short term potentially adult signs pain babies obvious requiring special equipment training baby crying irritable awake develops disturbed sleep pattern feeds poorly shows fearful distrustful reaction towards caregivers classical international association study pain definition subjective emotional experience described terms tissue damage depends patient able selfreport pain little use diagnosing treating pain babies significant nonverbal responses two kinds gross physical movements physiological response measurements former simple direct observation latter requires specific equipment monitor blood pressure stress hormone levels cry response increasingly important researchers able differentiate different kinds cry classed hungry angry fearful interpretation difficult however depending sensitivity listener varies significantly studies sought additional visible easily definable indicators pain particular high level pain detected babies hungry compared pain levels developed children combinations crying facial expressions posture movements aided physiological measurements tested found reliable indicators number observational scales published verifiedwhich even noticeable responses infant underlying problem may hidden due inability speak side effects illness may difficult receive proper diagnosis causing infant diagnosis one hardest medical field children infants postoperative pain scale chipps often used assessment hospitalised babies scale requires special measurements therefore applicable across wide range circumstances described scale uses measurement five items rated based following parameters total score indicates baby managed according observations movement physiological tend decrease pain persistent thus rendering scale unreliable acute prolonged cases addition hyperalgesia allodynia occur quickly extensively babies day day changes response specific injury may therefore become unpredictable baby undergo form planned procedure health professionals take steps reduce pain minimum though circumstances may possible remove painwhich case illness accident post operative pain graded sequence treatment becoming established standard practice research making easier simpler provide necessary care clearer understanding risks possible side effects touching holding stroking keeping warm talking singingmusic ways adults comforting babies since start human history way managing pain shared primates actions performed female male adults children able

longterm harm scientific studies animals various brain lesions interpreted supporting idea responses seen babies merely spinal reflexes furthermore whole effort relieving pain considered futile since
