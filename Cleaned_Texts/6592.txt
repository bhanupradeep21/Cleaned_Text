hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy hsan hereditary sensory neuropathy hsn condition used describe types inhibit sensation less common charcotmarietooth eight different clinical entities described hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathies characterized progressive loss function predominantly affects peripheral sensory nerves incidence estimated hereditary sensory neuropathy type condition characterized nerve abnormalities legs feet peripheral neuropathy many people condition tingling weakness reduced ability feel pain sense hot cold affected individuals lose sensation instead feel shooting pains legs feet disorder progresses sensory abnormalities affect hands arms shoulders abdomen affected individuals may also experience muscle wasting weakness get older varies widely within families affected individuals typically get open sores ulcers feet hands infections soft tissue fingertips whitlows slow heal affected individuals feel pain sores may seek treatment right away without treatment ulcers become infected may require amputation surrounding area albeit rarely people hereditary sensory neuropathy type may develop hearing loss caused abnormalities inner ear sensorineural hearing loss signs symptoms hereditary sensory neuropathy type typically appear persons teens twenties features disorder tend worsen time affected individuals normal life expectancy signs symptoms properly treated type common form among types hsan historical names include mal perforant du pied ulceromutilating neuropathy hereditary perforating ulcers familial trophoneurosis familial syringomyelia hereditary sensory radicular neuropathy among type includes popular disease charcotmarietooth type syndrome hmsn also named hsan subtype type inherited autosomal dominant trait disease usually starts early adolescence adulthood disease characterized loss pain sensation mainly distal parts lower limbs parts legs farther away center body since affected individuals feel pain minor injuries area may immediately recognized may develop extensive ulcerations infection occurs complications progressive destruction underlying bones may follow may necessitate amputation rare cases disease accompanied nerve deafness muscle wasting autonomic disturbance present appears anhidrosis sweating abnormality examinations nerve structure function showed signs neuronal degeneration marked reduction number myelinated fibers axonal loss sensory neurons lose ability transmit signals motor neurons reduced ability transmit genes related hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type mutations gene cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type gene provides instructions making one part subunit enzyme called serine palmitoyltransferase spt spt enzyme involved making certain fats called sphingolipids sphingolipids important components cell membranes play role many cell functions gene mutations reduce amount subunit produced result spt enzyme decreased function lack functional spt enzyme leads decrease sphingolipid production harmful buildup certain byproducts sphingolipids found myelin covering protects nerves promotes efficient transmission nerve impulses decrease sphingolipids disrupts formation myelin causing nerve cells become less efficient eventually die sphingolipids made accumulation toxic byproducts also lead nerve cell death gradual destruction nerve
