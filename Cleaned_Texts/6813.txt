selection genetic drift biogeography moreover newer field evolutionary developmental biology evodevo investigates embryogenesis controlled thus yielding wider synthesis integrates developmental biology fields study covered earlier evolutionary synthesis evolution central unifying concept biology biology divided various ways one way level biological organization molecular cell organism population another way perceived taxonomic group fields zoology botany microbiology reflecting seen major divisions life third way approaches field biology theoretical biology experimental evolution paleontology alternative ways dividing subject combined evolutionary biology create subfields like evolutionary ecology evolutionary developmental biology recently merge biological science applied sciences gave birth new fields extensions evolutionary biology including evolutionary robotics basic mechanisms evolution applied directly indirectly come novel designs solve problems difficult solve otherwise research generated applied fields contribute towards progress especially work evolution computer science engineering fields mechanical adaptive relates evolutionary changes happen due changes environment makes organism suitable habitat change increases chances survival reproduction organism referred organisms fitness example darwins galapagos island developed different shaped beaks order survive long time adaptive evolution also convergent evolution two distantly related species live similar environments facing similar pressures convergent evolution process related distantly related organisms evolve similar characteristics independently type evolution creates analogous structures similar function structure form two species example sharks dolphins look alike related likewise birds flying insects bats ability fly related similar traits tend evolve similar environmental pressures divergent evolution process speciation happen several ways influence two closely associated species known two species evolve company one species adapts changes species type evolution often happens species symbiotic relationships example predatorprey coevolution common type coevolution predator must evolve become effective hunter selective pressure prey steer clear capture prey turn need develop better survival strategies red queen hypothesis example predatorprey interations relationship pollinating insects like bees flowering plants herbivores plants also common examples diffuse guild mechanisms evolution focus mainly mutation genetic drift gene flow nonrandom mating natural selection mutation change dna sequence inside gene chromosome organism mutations deleterious neutral ie neither harm benefit also beneficial sometimes genetic drift genetic variational process happens result sampling errors one generation another generation random event happens chance nature changes influences allele frequency within population much stronger effect small populations large ones gene flow gene transfer genetic material gene pool one population another population migration occurs one species another resulting change allele frequency natural selection survival reproductive rate species depends adaptability species environment process called natural species certain traits population higher survival reproductive rate others fitness pass genetic features offsprings evolutionary developmental biology scientists look different processes development play role specific organism reaches current body plan genetic regulation ontogeny phylogenetic process allows kind understanding biology possible looking different processes development going evolutionary tree one determine point specific structure came example three germ layers observed present cnidarians ctenophores instead present worms less developed depending kind worm structures like development hox genes sensory organs eyes also traced phylogenetic trees representations genetic lineage figures show related species one another formed analyzing physical traits well similarities dna species using molecular clock scientists estimate species diverged example phylogeny would tree life genes shared ancestry homologs speciation event occurs one gene ends two different species genes orthologous gene duplicated within singular species paralog molecular clock used estimate events

evolutionary biology covers diverse topics incorporates ideas diverse areas molecular genetics computer science first fields evolutionary research try explain phenomena poorly accounted modern evolutionary synthesis include evolution sexual evolution cooperation evolution second evolutionary biologists ask straightforward evolutionary question happened includes fields paleobiology paleobiologists evolutionary biologists including thomas halliday anjali goswami studied evolution early mammals going far back time mesozoic cenozoic eras million years fields related generic exploration evolution happened include systematics phylogenetics third modern evolutionary synthesis devised time nobody understood molecular basis genes today evolutionary biologists try determine genetic architecture interesting evolutionary phenomena adaptation speciation seek answers questions many genes involved large effects gene interdependent effects different genes genes changes happen eg point mutations vs gene duplication even genome duplication try reconcile high heritability seen twin studies difficulty finding genes responsible heritability using genomewide association one challenge studying genetic architecture classical population genetics catalysed modern evolutionary synthesis must updated take account modern molecular knowledge requires great deal mathematical development relate dna sequence data evolutionary theory part theory molecular evolution example biologists try infer genes strong selection detecting selective fourth modern evolutionary synthesis involved agreement forces contribute evolution relative current research seeks determine evolutionary forces include natural selection sexual selection genetic drift genetic draft developmental constraints mutation bias biogeography evolutionary approach key much current research organismal biology ecology life history theory annotation genes function relies heavily comparative approaches field evolutionary developmental biology evodevo investigates developmental processes work compares different organisms determine evolved many physicians enough background evolutionary biology making difficult use modern however efforts gain deeper understanding disease evolutionary medicine develop evolutionary therapies evolution plays role resistance drugs example hiv becomes resistant medications bodys immune system mutation resistance hiv due natural selection survivors offspring hiv survive immune system reproduced offspring also resistant immune drug resistance also causes many problems patients worsening sickness sickness mutate something longer cured medication without proper medicine sickness death patient body resistance certain number drugs right medicine harder harder find completing prescribed full course antibiotic also example resistance cause bacteria antibiotic taken evolve continue spread full dosage medication enter body perform proper job bacteria survive initial dosage continue reproduce make another bout sickness later difficult cure bacteria involved resistant first medication used taking full course medicine prescribed vital step avoiding antibiotic resistance individuals chronic illnesses especially recur throughout lifetime greater risk antibiotic resistance overuse drug high dosage cause patients immune system weaken illness evolve grow stronger example cancer patients need stronger stronger dosage medication low functioning immune scientific journals specialise exclusively evolutionary biology whole including journals evolution
