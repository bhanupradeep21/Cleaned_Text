marasuchus meaning mara crocodile genus basal dinosauriform archosaur possibly synonymous genera lived late triassic la rioja province argentina marasuchus contains single species marasuchus marasuchus lilloensis originally designated lagosuchus lilloensis considered new species lagosuchus contemporary archosaur described previous however study argued original material lagosuchus undiagnostic would mean lagosuchus original species lagosuchus talampayaensis could considered nomen dubia specimens lagosuchus stored museum san miguel de tucuman considered diagnostic l talampayensis thus given new genus study redescribed original material lagosuchus concluded valid readily distinguishable marasuchus lilloensis suggests marasuchus lilloensis junior synonym lagosuchus specimens referred genus marasuchus possessed adaptations traditionally characterized dinosaurs example proportions indicate likely bipedal early dinosaurs also shared certain specific characteristics group relating hip head femur nevertheless lacked certain dinosaurlike features perforated acetabulum several plesiomorphic primitive features marasuchus hails chañares formation argentina formation dated early carnian first stage late triassic million years many chanares fossils including first known remains marasuchus unearthed result paleontological expedition expedition undertaken paleontologists mcz museum comparative zoology harvard mlp museo de la plata la plata argentina discoveries made expedition later described series papers alfred romer mcz around time expeditions jose bonaparte pvl paleontología de vertebrados instituto miguel lillo san miguel de tucuman argentina unearthed additional fossils marasuchus lilloensis known several specimens representing animals skeletal anatomy although skull material remains holotype pvl collected bonaparte initially known tucuman specimen specimen consists large portions tail left forelimb hip hindlimbs marasuchus fossils stored pvl well pvl includes skull material entire presacral vertebral column nearly complete hip hindlimbs pvl braincase associated cervical neck vertebrae pvl consist vertebrae base tail pvl sequence cervical dorsal trunk referral pvl marasuchus lagosuchus uncertain due absence diagnostic features clearly shared tucuman specimen first described romer placed type specimen new species lagosuchus lilloensis lagosuchus talampayensis type species lagosuchus named papers earlier two species differentiated mainly basis tucuman specimen larger type specimen l talampayensis review genus jose bonaparte regarded two species synonymous l lilloensis junior synonym l many sources published followed however later study paul sereno andrea arcucci concluded original type specimen lagosuchus poorly preserved undiagnostic argued assigning specimens genus lagosuchus regarded nomen dubium also noted many referred pvl specimens limb proportions subtle traits differing lagosuchus specimens stored elsewhere basis new genus erected contain pvl specimens new genus called marasuchus mara crocodile nod etymology lagosuchus rabbit crocodile given specific name marasuchus lilloensis based romers species designation tucuman marasuchus considered diagnostic welldescribed replacement name dinosauriform taxon known previously type specimen lagosuchus reexamined federico agnolin martin ezcurra noted type specimen actually share several diagnostic traits identified sereno arucci marasuchus furthermore argued variations size certain features skeleton either ontogenetic individually variable result referred pvl specimens back lagosuchus following conclusion marasuchus lilloensis could considered synonym lagosuchus talampayensis terms proportions marasuchus generally resembled early theropod dinosaurs like coelophysis limbs long slender hindlimbs twice length forelimbs proportions meant probably bipedal acquired upright stance characteristic dinosaurs neck long sshaped curve default position tail long thin though deeper base type specimen marasuchus pvl femur cm inches length larger type specimen lagosuchus talampayensis nevertheless marasuchus still small lightly built skull material limited marasuchus preserved bones region maxilla toothed bone side snout preserved pvl braincases preserved pvl maxilla low least teeth teeth bladelike serrated near rear bone less curved leafshaped maxilla also possessed interdental plates inner surface braincase tall fairly typical compared early archosaurs however cases shared specific similarities braincase early dinosaurs example basipterygoid processes pair plates bottom braincase connect roof mouth short bladelike tilted forwards addition exoccipitals pair braincase bones adjacent foramen magnum main exit spinal cord wide edged pronounced ridge next exit holes hypoglossal bonaparte additionally described squamosal quadrate bones similar euparkeria attached pvl braincase although mentioned later almost entirety spinal column present marasuchus barring tip tail marasuchus diagnostic features ie unique unusual traits characterize specifically occur vertebrae neck vertebrae elongated offset front rear ends creating long curved neck like avemetatarsalians birdlineage archosaurs also like avemetatarsalians upward projecting neural spine axis vertebra expanded trapezoidal rather peaklike uniquely neural spines vertebrae closer base neck leaned forwards vertebrae near hip also characteristic marasuchus since neural spines also trapezoidal expanded extent contacted adjacent vertebrae two vertebrae attach hip less dinosaurs typically acquire three sacrum tail characteristically elongated vertebrae drastically increasing length towards tip chevrons spinelike bones projecting tail vertebrae also elongated tail vertebrae near hip making tail unusually deep base scapulocoracoid shoulder blade quite large broad unlike avemetatarsalians hand glenoid shoulder socket directed somewhat backwards rather sideways case dinosauriforms forelimb bones consisting humerus ulna radius slender shorter leg bones forelimb whole half size hindlimb portion hand pelvis hip shared quite similarities dinosauriforms otherwise present earlier archosauriforms ilium upper blade hip similar herrerasaurus general shape pubis front lower blade hip longer ischium rear lower blade hip like dinosauriforms however ischium also enlarged relative earlier archosauriforms longer main portion ilium furthermore ischiums contact pubis less extensive early archosauriforms fails contact ilium along boundary pubis silesaurids saurischian dinosaurs gap ilium ischium along edge pubis becomes developed dinosaurs becomes open cavity fills entire acetabulum hip socket however yet evolved marasuchus retains bony inner wall acetablum moreover edge ischium marasuchus retains contact ilium pubis unlike dinosaurs nevertheless depression present area may predecessor advanced condition modifications acetabulum mirrored head femur thigh bone connects distinct tab bone known anterior trochanter present outer edge femoral head dinosauriforms lesser extent avemetatarsalians addition marasuchus also possessed ridge bone known trochanteric shelf branches anterior trochanter wraps around shaft femur trochanteric shelf also characteristic early dinosaurs silesaurids specimens dromomeron similar structure also present aphanosaurs albeit separate equivalent anterior trochanter dinosauriforms tibia shin bone longitudinal groove edged sharp flange rear outer corner near ankle tibia also longer ankle two main bones larger boxy astragalus smaller calcaneum attached outer edge aspects ankle shared features dinosauriforms vertical triangular branch astragalus known ascending process rises front tibia however aspects ankle surprisingly primitive even compared earlier avemetatarsalians like pterosaurs lagerpetids example rear astragalus possesses vertical groove calcaneum knob rear edge known calcaneal tuber unlike lagerpetids coelophysoids astragalus calcaneum fused together five metatarsals foot bones thin elongated close together third fourth metatarsals longest followed second first fifth half length longest although pedal phalanges toe bones preserved phalangeal formula number bones per toe likely marasuchus part avemetatarsalia branch archosaurs closer birds dinosaurs rather crocodilians specifically dinosauriform meaning closer dinosaurs lagerpetids although close silesaurids silesaurus marasuchus still one completely known avemetatarsalians
