behavioural change theories attempts explain human behaviours change theories cite environmental personal behavioural characteristics major factors behavioural determination recent years increased interest application theories areas health education criminology energy international development hope understanding behavioural change improve services offered areas scholars recently introduced distinction models behavior theories whereas models behavior diagnostic geared towards understanding psychological factors explain predict specific behavior theories change processoriented generally aimed changing given behavior thus perspective understanding changing behavior two separate complementary lines scientific investigation behavioural change theory model focuses different factors attempting explain behaviour change many exist prevalent learning theories social cognitive theory theories reasoned action planned behaviour transtheoretical model behavior change health action process approach bj fogg model behavior change research also conducted regarding specific elements theories especially elements like selfefficacy common several theories individuals impression ability

persuasion selfefficacy thought predictive amount effort individual expend initiating maintaining behavioural change although selfefficacy behavioural change theory per se important element many theories including health belief model theory planned behaviour health action process approach albert bandura performed two experimental tests selfefficacy theory first study asked whether systematic desensitization could effect changes avoidance behavior improving peoples expectations personal efficacy study found thorough extinction anxiety arousal visualized threats desensitization treatment produced differential increases selfefficacy accord prediction microanalysis congruence selfefficacy performance showed selfefficacy highly accurate predictor degree behavioral change following complete desensitization findings also lend support view perceived selfefficacy mediates anxiety arousal second experiment bandura examined process efficacy behavioral change individuals suffering phobias found selfefficacy useful predictor amount behavioral improvement phobics could gain mastering threatening according social learning recently expanded social cognitive behavioural change determined environmental personal behavioural elements factor affects others example congruence principles selfefficacy individuals thoughts affect behaviour individuals characteristics elicit certain responses social environment likewise individuals environment affects development personal characteristics well persons behavior individuals behaviour may change environment well way individual thinks

behaviour result intention important factor determining behaviour behavioural change according icek ajzen intentions develop individuals perception behaviour positive negative together individuals impression way society perceives behaviour thus personal attitude social pressure shape intention essential performance behaviour consequently behavioural change ajzen expanded upon theory reasoned action formulating theory planned also emphasises role intention behaviour performance intended cover cases person control factors affecting actual performance behaviour result new theory states

determining strength individuals intention perform behaviour fishbein ajzen introduced reasoned action approach successor theory planned behaviour according transtheoretical behavior change also known stages change model states five stages towards behavior change five stages individuals may transition achieving complete change precontemplation contemplation preparation action action maintenance

different factors motivation ability prompt fbm person user succeed behavior change needs motivated ability perform behavior needs trigger perform behavior next definitions elements bfm bj fogg provide definition motivation instead defines different motivators factor refers selfefficacy perception performing target behavior although low ability undesirable may unavoidable fundamentally lazy according bj fogg case behavior change approached learning instead promoting target behaviors user high ability additionally bj fogg listed several elements dimensions characterize high ability simplicity performing behavior triggers reminders may explicit implicit performance behavior examples triggers alarms text messages advertisement triggers usually perceptual nature may also intrinsic one important aspects trigger timing certain times best triggering certain behaviors example person trying go gym everyday remembers packing clothing house less likely person head back home pack contrast alarm sounds right leaving house reminding packing clothing take considerably less effort although original article references reasoning theories behind model elements traced social psychology theories eg motivation ability factors success failure related selfefficacy behavioural change theories used guides developing effective teaching methods since goal much education behavioural change understanding behaviour afforded behavioural change theories provides insight formulation effective teaching methods tap mechanisms behavioural change era education programs strive reach large audiences varying socioeconomic statuses designers programs increasingly strive understand reasons behind behavioural change order understand universal characteristics may crucial program design fact theories like social learning theory theory planned behaviour developed attempts improve health education theories address interaction individuals environments provide insight effectiveness education programs given specific set predetermined conditions like social context program initiated although health education still area behavioural change theories often applied theories like stages change model begun applied areas like employee training developing systems higher education education could formal informal depending target population empirical studies criminology support behavioural change time general theories behavioural change suggest possible explanations criminal behaviour methods correcting deviant behaviour since deviant behaviour correction entails behavioural change understanding behavioural change facilitate adoption effective correctional methods policymaking example understanding deviant behaviour like stealing may learned behaviour resulting reinforcers like hunger satisfaction unrelated criminal behaviour aid development social controls address underlying issue rather merely resultant behaviour specific theories applied criminology include social learning differential association theories social learning theorys element interaction individual environment explains development deviant behaviour function individuals exposure certain behaviour acquaintances reinforce either socially acceptable socially unacceptable behaviour differential association theory originally formulated edwin sutherland popular related theoretical explanation criminal behaviour applies learning theory concepts asserts deviant behaviour learned behaviour recent years seen increased interest energy consumption reduction based
