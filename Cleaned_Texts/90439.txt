xenobiotics nearundiluted form several mechanisms responsible either inducing hepatic injury worsening damage process many chemicals damage mitochondria intracellular organelle produces energy

liver promotes liver nonparenchymal cells kupffer cells collagenproducing stellate cells leukocytes ie neutrophil monocyte also role mechanism human body subjects compounds various chemical processes ie metabolism make suitable elimination involves chemical transformations reduce fat solubility b change biological activity although almost tissues body ability metabolize chemicals smooth endoplasmic reticulum liver principal metabolic clearing house endogenous chemicals eg cholesterol steroid hormones fatty acids proteins exogenous substances eg drugs central role played liver clearance transformation chemicals makes susceptible druginduced injury drug metabolism usually divided two phases phase phase phase reaction generally speaking prepare drug phase however many compounds metabolized phase directly excreted without phase reactions occurring phase reaction involves oxidation reduction hydrolysis hydration many rare chemical reactions processes tend increase water solubility drug generate metabolites chemically active andor potentially toxic phase reactions take place cytosol involve conjugation endogenous compounds via transferase enzymes phase typically suitable elimination group enzymes located endoplasmic reticulum known cytochrome important family metabolizing enzymes liver cytochrome single enzyme rather consists closely related family isoforms six metabolize tremendous diversity individual gene products heterogeneity allows liver perform oxidation vast array chemicals including drugs phase three important characteristics system roles druginduced toxicity proteins unique accounts extent variation drug metabolism individuals genetic variations polymorphism metabolism considered patients exhibit unusual sensitivity resistance drug

drugs modify cytochrome enzyme referred either inhibitors inducers enzyme inhibitors block metabolic activity one several enzymes effect usually occurs immediately hand inducers increase activity increasing enzyme production case preventing degradation proteasome usually delay enzyme activity drugs may share specificity thus competitively block biotransformation may lead accumulation drugs
