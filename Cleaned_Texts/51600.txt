disorders related psychological physical symptoms anxiety naturallyoccurring emotion response anxiety levels exceed tolerability person anxiety disorders may occur people anxiety disorders exhibit fear responses defensive behaviors high levels alertness negative emotions anxiety disorders may concurrent psychological disorders depression anxiety disorders classified using six possible clinical different types anxiety disorders share general symptoms distinctive symptoms explains people different types anxiety disorders respond differently different classes antianxiety medications etiology anxiety disorder remains unknown several contributing factors still yet proved cause anxiety factors include childhood anxiety drug induction central stimulant drugs metabolic diseases depressive disorder antianxiety medication drug taken prescribed treatment anxiety disorders may mediated neurotransmitters like norepinephrine serotonin dopamine gammaaminobutyric acid gaba central nervous system antianxiety medication classified six types according different mechanisms antidepressants benzodiazepines azapirones antiepileptics antipsychotics beta blockers antidepressants include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris reuptake inhibitors snris tricyclic antidepressants tca monoamine oxidase inhibitor maoi ssris used types anxiety disorders snris used generalized anxiety disorder gad considered firstline antianxiety medications tcas secondline treatment cause significant adverse effects compared firstline treatment benzodiazepines effective emergent shortterm treatment anxiety disorders due fast onset carry risk dependence buspirone indicated gad much slower onset advantage less sedating withdrawal first monoamine oxidase inhibitor maoi iproniazid discovered accidentally developing new antitubercular drug isoniazid drug found induce euphoria improve patients appetite sleep qualitycitation needed first tricyclic antidepressant imipramine originally developed studied antihistamine alongside firstgeneration antihistamines time tcas increase level norepinephrine serotonin inhibiting reuptake transport proteins majority tcas exert greater effect norepinephrine leads side effects like drowsiness memory loss order effective serotonin agonism avoid anticholinergic antihistaminergic side effects selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssri researched introduced treat anxiety disorders first ssri fluoxetine prozac discovered approved fda ssris like sertraline zoloft paroxetine paxil escitalopram lexapro entered first serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor snri venlafaxine effexor entered market snris target serotonin norepinephrine transporters avoiding imposing significant effects adrenergic β histamine muscarinic

stage indications include panic disorder sleep disorders seizures acute behavioral disturbance muscle spasm premedication sedation procedures buspirone useful gad particularly effective treating phobias panic disorder social anxiety safer option longterm use cause dependence like benzodiazepines antiepileptics rarely prescribed offlabel treatment anxiety disorders posttraumatic stress suggestions may help gad panic disorder phobic symptoms currently enough research conclusive data suggesting effective placebo olanzapine risperidone atypical antipsychotics also effective gad ptsd treatment however higher chance experiencing adverse effects antianxiety propranolol originally used high blood pressure heart diseases also used treat anxiety symptoms like tremor increased heart rate work nervous system alleviate symptoms propranolol also commonly used public speaking one nervous ssris snris reuptake inhibitors class nerve signal transduction chemical called neurotransmitters serotonin norepinephrine neurotransmitters related nervous control mood regulation level neurotransmitters regulated nerve reuptake avoid accumulation neurotransmitter endings nerve fiber reuptaking produced neurotransmitter level go back ready go back upon excitation new nerve however level patients anxiety disorders usually low nerve fibers insensitive neurotransmitters ssris snris block channel reuptake increase level neurotransmitter nerve fibers originally inhibit production neurotransmitters upon increase however prolonged increase eventually desensitize nerve change level therefore action ssris snris take weeks exert full benzodiazepines bind selectively gaba receptor receptor protein found nervous system control nervous response benzodiazepine increase entry chloride ions cells improving binding gaba gaba receptors better opening channel chloride ion passage high level chloride ion inside nerve cells makes nerve difficult depolarize inhibit nerve signal transduction excitability nerves reduces nervous system slows therefore drug alleviate symptoms anxiety disorder make person less selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris class medications used treatment depression anxiety disorders ocd personality ssris firstline antianxiety serotonin one crucial neurotransmitters mood enhancement increasing serotonin level produces antianxiety effect ssris increase serotonin level brain inhibiting serotonin uptake pumps serotonergic systems without interactions receptors ion channels ssris beneficial acute response longterm maintenance treatment
