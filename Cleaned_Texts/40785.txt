courtship display set display behaviors animal usually male attempts attract mate mate exercises choice sexual selection acts display behaviors often include ritualized movement dances vocalizations mechanical sound production displays beauty strength agonistic species males perform ritualized movements attract females male sixplumed birdofparadise parotia lawesii exemplifies male courtship display ritualized ballerina dance unique occipital breast feathers serve stimulate female visual drosophila subobscura male courtship display seen males intricate wing scissoring patterns rapid stimulations along many factors result subsequent copulation rejection species males may exhibit courtship displays serve visual auditory stimulation example male annas hummingbird calypte anna calliope hummingbird stellula calliope perform two types courtship displays involving combination visual vocal stationary shuttle dive engaging stationary shuttle display male displays flared gorget hovers front female moving side side rotating body tail rhythmic movements males wings produce distinctive buzzing conducting dive display male typically ascends approximately ft air abruptly turns descends divelike fashion male flies female rotates body spreads tail feathers flutter collide produce short buzzing addition animals attempt attract females construction decoration unique structures technique seen satin bowerbird ptilonorhynchus violaceus australia males build decorate nestlike structures called bowers decorated bright colourful objects typically blue colour attract stimulate visiting typically males acquire largest number decorations tend greater success species males initiate courtship rituals mounting female courtship may even continue copulation system ability female choose mate limited process known copulatory courtship prevalent many insect species male sex initiates courtship displays precopulatory sexual selection performing display allows male present traits abilities female mate choice context driven females direct indirect benefits female often determine males reproduce direct benefits may accrue female male courtship displays females raise fitness respond courtship behavior signals benefits female rather fitness male example choosing mate males produce local signals would require less energy female searches males may compete imposing lower mating costs female even providing material offspring contributions female indirect benefits benefits may directly affect parents fitness instead increase fitness offspring since offspring female inherit half genetic information male counterpart traits saw attractive passed producing fit offspring case males may compete courtship displaying desirable traits pass offspring female courtship display less common nature female would invest lot energy exaggerated traits energetically expensive however situations males sexually selective sex species occur nature male choice reproduction arise males sex species short supply example female bias operational sex could arise mating systems reproducing comes energy cost energy costs include effort associated obtaining nuptial gifts performing long courtship copulatory added cost time energy investments may come form increased male mortality rates putting strain males attempting reproduce pipefish syngnathus typhle females use temporary ornament striped pattern attract males intimidate rival females case female species developed sexually selected signal serves dual function attractive mates deterring many species animals engage type courtship display attract mate dancing creation sounds physical displays however many species limited one behaviors males species across many taxa create complex multicomponent signals effect one sensory modality also known multimodal two leading hypotheses adaptive significance multimodal signal processing multiple message hypothesis states signal male exhibits contribute possible mates perception male redundant signal hypothesis states male exhibits multiple signals portray message female extra signal acting fallback plan male signaling choosy sex may evaluate one couple traits given time interpreting complex signals opposite sex alternatively choosy sex may attempt process signals facilitate evaluation opposite process multimodal signaling believed help facilitate courtship process many species one species multimodal signaling seen improve mating success green tree frog hyla cinerea many anuran amphibians green tree frog may use visual cues well auditory signals increase chances impressing calls tree frogs held equal determined females tended overlook auditoryonly stimulus favor males combined auditoryvisual multimodal signals seen female green tree frogs preferred males coupled visual display auditory communication concluding male green tree frogs visually accessible increase probability mating peacock spiders maratus volans exceptionally sexually dimorphic appearance signaling behavior courtship male peacock spiders compete using visual displays vibratory signals intersexual intense sexual selection male peacock spiders reproductive success individual relies heavily male spiders ability combine visual vibratory displays courtship combination displays courtship offers support redundant signal multiple messages hypotheses evolution multimodal signaling multimodal signaling limited males females certain species one trait characteristic use courtship display attract mates dance flies rhamphomyia longicauda females two ornaments inflatable abdominal sacs pinnate tibial scales use courtship displays mating swarms intermediate variations femalespecific ornaments sexually selected male dance flies wild populations ornaments may also signal high fecundity often males females perform synchronized responsive courtship displays mutual fashion many socially monogamous species birds duet facilitates precopulatory reassurance pair bonding strengthens postcopulatory dedication development offspring eg great crested grebe podiceps example male female crested auklets aethia cristatella cackle one another vocal form mutual display serves strengthen bond cases males may pair perform mutual cooperative displays order increase courtship success attract females phenomenon seen longtailed manakins chiroxiphia wild turkeys meleagris gallopavo also engage cooperative displays small groups males typically brothers work together attract females deter competitive many cases one male within group mate typically dominant explain behaviour hamiltons theory kin selection suggests subordinate males receive indirect benefits helping related males copulate sexual ornaments serve increase indicate good genes higher levels exposed exaggerated male traits females may respond increasing maternal investments example female canaries shown produce larger denser eggs response male supranormal song sexual conflict phenomenon interests males females reproduction often quite many consequences courtship displays allow mate performing selection means base copulatory decision female chooses one male sperm competition comes play competition sperm fertilize egg competitive single sperm achieve insects male injects cocktail chemicals seminal fluid together sperm chemicals kill older sperm previous mates upregulates females egglaying rate reduces desire remate another male cocktail also shortens females lifespan also reducing likelihood mating also females get rid previous males mating taken place males perform various actions prevent females mating action performed depends animal species male produces mating plug insemination hymenoptera male provides huge quantity sperm enough last females entire life birds mammals male may participate agonistic behaviors candidate although rare agonistic behavior males females courtship displays seen nature intraspecific agonistic behavior results death combatant rare associated risk death injury however agonistic behavior turns dangerous occur species physical traits sexually selected male courtship displays may also used agonistic behavior two males mate fiddler crabs genus uca males sexually selected one enlarged claw take anywhere third half total body mass one regular claw although enlarged claw believed developed use combat territorial defense uncommon males employ claw battle even though claw developed weapon also closely linked crabs courtship display waved certain pattern attract females agonistic behavior courtship displays limited malemale interactions many primate species males direct agonistic behavior toward females prior courtship behaviors behavior include aggressive vocalizations displays physical western gorilla gorilla gorilla dominant males exhibit agonistic behavior toward female gorillas high rates majority interactions courtshiprelated documented cases male gorilla aggression toward females courtship related used primarily strategy prevent females migrating another many cases male courtship displays cause forms contest competition develop often seen within lek mating systems example males seek obtain certain spot position perform courtship display best spots regions high contention many males want direct conflict agonisticclarification needed encounters males fairly commoncitation needed mating preceded courtshippairing period many animal mating systems period sexually mature animals select partners courtship period involves displays attract mate member species usually short lasting anywhere minutes days however certain animals may undergo extended courtship period lasting long two one exception emperor penguin aptenodytes forsteri emperor penguins engage extended courtship period last two months longest arctic seabird courtship period accounts total time spend breeding whereas closest relatives king penguin aptenodytes patagonicus courtship period takes three per cent breeding courtship displays typically involve sort metabolic cost animal performing energy expended perform courtship behaviour vary among species animals engage displays expend little energy seen salamander desmognathus laboratory settings courtship behaviours species although complex involving release represent little approximately one per cent daily calorie contrast species engage prolonged elaborate displays expend considerable amounts energy run risk developing fatigue prepare prevent risk animals may gain weight courtship period lose weight afterward example seen greater sagegrouse centrocercus urophasianus peak breeding season lasts three months leks frequently visited groups seventy response large presence females males engage strutting display six ten times per approximately three four hours per frequent repetitive behaviour result energy expenditures kjday compared inactive males typically expend various environmental factors temperature photoperiod resource light availability effect timing effectiveness courtship displays certain species guppies poecilia reticulata variation light environment plays huge role ability attract guppy males alter courtship mode whether perform full courtship display try engage sneak copulations distance females light intensity courtship mode also varies light spectrum relates predation average male guppies seek spend time environment color

effectiveness hirtodrosophila mycetophaga mating displays influenced color bracket fungus mates courts flies choose brackets lighter making displays visible opposite multiple hypotheses courtship displays may evolved animals including fisherian runaway model good genes hypothesis explained fisherian runaway model sexually dimorphic males exaggerated ornamentation may sexually selected species female choice fitness males would increase resulting proliferation males ornamentation means gene set genes favoured female choice time would explain elaborate traits develop within certain species however time goes generations pass survival advantage associated one trait may dissipate due extreme exaggeration point decreases fitness good genes hypothesis proposes female selection mate dependent whether male genes would increase quality offspring female cases exaggerated male ornamentation may indicative choosing female male able place large investment trait somewhat counterintuitive survival would carry good example costs associated bright complex plumage high males good genes able support large investment development traits turn displays high fitness alternative sensory exploitation
