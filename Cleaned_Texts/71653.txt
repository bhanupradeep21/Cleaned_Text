appendectomy american english appendicectomy british english surgical operation vermiform appendix portion intestine removed appendectomy normally performed urgent emergency procedure treat complicated acute appendectomy may performed laparoscopically minimally invasive surgery open surgical practice increasingly moved towards routinely offering laparoscopic appendicectomy example united kingdom adult appendicectomies planned laparoscopic laparoscopy often used diagnosis doubt order leave less visible surgical scar recovery may slightly faster laparoscopic surgery although laparoscopic procedure expensive resourceintensive open surgery generally takes longer advanced pelvic sepsis occasionally requires lower midline laparotomy complicated perforated appendicitis undergo prompt surgical significant recent trial evidence uncomplicated appendicitis treated either antibiotics appendicectomy main difference treatment length time antibiotics administered uncomplicated appendicitis antibiotics continued hours postoperatively complicated appendicitis antibiotics continued anywhere interval appendectomy generally performed weeks conservative management antibiotics special cases perforated delay appendectomy hours admission symptoms appendicitis shown increase risk perforation general terms procedure open appendectomy standardization incision best practice performing appendectomy given appendix mobile physical exam performed prior operation incision chosen based point maximal tenderness incisions placed appendectomy past decade outcomes laparoscopic appendectomies compared favorably open appendectomies decreased pain fewer postoperative complications shorter hospitalization earlier mobilization earlier return work better cosmesis however despite advantages efforts still made decrease abdominal incision visible scars recent research led development natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery notes however numerous difficulties need overcome wider clinical application notes adopted including complications opening hollow viscera failed sutures lack fully developed instrumentation necessity reliable costbenefit many surgeons attempted reduce incisional morbidity improve cosmetic outcomes laparoscopic appendectomy using fewer smaller ports kollmar et al described moving laparoscopic incisions hide natural camouflages like suprapubic hairline improve cosmesis additionally reports literature indicate minilaparoscopic appendectomy using even smaller instruments along one port minimizes pain improves cosmesis recently studies ates et al roberts et al described variants intracorporeal slingbased singleport laparoscopic appendectomy good clinical also trend increasing towards singleincision laparoscopic surgery sils using special multiport umbilical sils conventional view field surgery seen compared notes equipment used sils familiar surgeons already laparoscopic surgery importantly easy convert sils conventional laparoscopy adding trocars conversion conventional laparoscopy called port rescue sils shown feasible reasonably safe cosmetically advantageous compared standard laparoscopy however newer technique involves specialized instruments difficult learn loss triangulation clashing instruments crossing instruments cross triangulation lack additional problem decreased exposure added financial burden procuring special articulating curved coaxial instruments exist sils still evolving used successfully many centres way go becomes mainstream limits widespread use especially rural peripheral centres limited pediatric patients mobile cecum allows externalization cecal appendix umbilicus cases led development surgical techniques laparoscopicassisted transumbilical appendectomy allows entire surgery performed single umbilical incision significant advantages terms recovery aesthetic outcome appendicitis common emergent general surgery related problem arise pregnancy natural elevation white blood cell count addition anatomical changes appendix occur findings addition nonspecific abdominal symptoms make appendicitis difficult diagnose appendicitis develops commonly second appendicitis develops pregnant woman appendectomy usually performed harm risk premature delivery risk fetal death perioperative period appendectomy early acute appendicitis risk fetal death perforated debate regarding surgical approach preferred pregnancy overall increased risk fetal loss preterm delivery laparoscopic approach la compared open approach oa however la associated shorter length stay hospital well reduced risk wound patient positioning utmost importance ensure safety fetus procedure especially important third trimester due potential compression inferior vena cava leading enlarged uterus placing patient left lateral decubitus position alleviates pressure prevents fetal one area concern related la pregnancy pneumoperitoneum causes increase intraabdominal pressure leading decreased venous return therefore decreased cardiac output decreased cardiac output may lead fetal acidosis cause distress however animal pregnancy model demonstrated insufflation pressure demonstrated adverse effects
