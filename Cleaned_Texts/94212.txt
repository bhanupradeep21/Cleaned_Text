feedback process plants alter biotic abiotic qualities soil grow alters ability plants grow soil negative feedback occurs plants less able grow soil previously occupied member species positive feedback occurs plants able grow soil previously occupied member although originally assumed negative feedback caused plants depleting soil nutrients recent work suggested major cause feedback buildup soilborne mutualism allelopathy also thought cause feedback studies shown average feedback tends however many notable exceptions many invasive negative feedback thought important factor helping plants coexist plant overabundant soil pathogens negative factors become common hurting similarly plant becomes overly rare soil pathogens negative factors helping negative feedback help populations stay community negative feedback called particular case feedback best measured using bevers interaction coefficient value quantifies much plants growth limited soil community compared much limits others twospecies comparisons measure quantity one must measure growth two plants soil conditioned members species gxhome species x soil conditioned members species gxaway plant species x interaction coefficient calculated negative means species grow worse site compared competitors soil therefore feedback helps species
