neuroendocrinology branch biology specifically physiology studies interaction nervous system endocrine system ie brain regulates hormonal activity nervous endocrine systems often act together process called neuroendocrine integration regulate physiological processes human body neuroendocrinology arose recognition brain especially hypothalamus controls secretion pituitary gland hormones subsequently expanded investigate numerous interconnections endocrine nervous systems endocrine system consists numerous glands throughout body produce secrete hormones diverse chemical structure including peptides steroids neuroamines collectively hormones regulate many physiological processes neuroendocrine system mechanism hypothalamus maintains homeostasis regulating reproduction metabolism eating drinking behaviour energy utilization osmolarity blood pressure hypothalamus commonly known relay center brain role integrating inputs areas brain producing specific response neuroendocrine system hypothalamus receives electrical signals different parts brain translates electrical signals chemical signals form hormones releasing factors chemicals transported pituitary
