diuretic ˌdaɪjʊˈrɛtɪk substance promotes diuresis increased production urine includes forced diuresis diuretic tablet sometimes colloquially called water tablet several categories diuretics diuretics increase excretion water body kidneys exist several classes diuretic works distinct way alternatively antidiuretic vasopressin antidiuretic hormone agent drug reduces excretion water urine medicine diuretics used treat heart failure liver cirrhosis hypertension influenza water poisoning certain kidney diseases diuretics acetazolamide help make urine alkaline helpful increasing excretion substances aspirin cases overdose poisoning diuretics sometimes abused people eating disorder especially people bulimia nervosa goal losing weightcitation needed antihypertensive actions diuretics thiazides loop diuretics particular independent diuretic reduction blood pressure due decreased blood volume resulting increased urine production occurs mechanisms lower doses required produce diuresis indapamide specifically designed mind larger therapeutic window hypertension without pronounced diuresis diureticscitation needed highceiling diuretics may cause substantial diuresis filtered

calcium increase risk reduced bone osmotic diuretics e g mannitol substances increase osmolarity limited tubular epithelial cell permeability work primarily expanding extracellular fluid plasma volume therefore increasing blood flow kidney particularly peritubular capillaries reduces medullary osmolality thus impairs concentration urine loop henle usually uses high osmotic solute gradient transport solutes water limited tubular epithelial cell permeability increases osmolality thus water retention previously believed primary mechanism osmotic diuretics mannitol filtered glomerulus reabsorbed thus presence leads increase osmolarity filtrate maintain osmotic balance water retained urinecitation needed glucose like mannitol sugar behave osmotic diuretic unlike mannitol glucose commonly found blood however certain conditions diabetes mellitus concentration glucose blood hyperglycemia exceeds maximum reabsorption capacity kidney happens glucose remains filtrate leading osmotic retention
