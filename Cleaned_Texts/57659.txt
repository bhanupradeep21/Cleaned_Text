heterotroph ˈhɛtərəˌtroʊf ancient greek ἕτερος héteros τροφή trophḗ nutrition organism produce food instead taking nutrition sources organic carbon mainly plant animal matter food chain heterotrophs primary secondary tertiary consumers living organisms heterotrophic include animals fungi bacteria many parasitic plants term heterotroph arose microbiology part classification microorganisms based type term used many fields ecology describing food chain heterotrophs may subdivided according energy source heterotroph uses chemical energy chemoheterotroph eg humans mushrooms uses light energy photoheterotroph eg green nonsulfur bacteria heterotrophs represent one two mechanisms nutrition trophic levels autotrophs auto self troph nutrition autotrophs use energy sunlight photoautotrophs oxidation inorganic compounds lithoautotrophs convert inorganic carbon dioxide organic carbon compounds energy sustain life comparing two basic terms heterotrophs animals eat either autotrophs plants heterotrophs detritivores heterotrophs obtain nutrients consuming detritus decomposing plant animal parts well saprotrophs also called lysotrophs chemoheterotrophs use extracellular digestion processing decayed organic matter process often facilitated active transport materials endocytosis within internal mycelium constituent heterotrophs organotrophs lithotrophs organotrophs exploit reduced carbon compounds electron sources like carbohydrates fats proteins plants animals hand lithoheterotrophs use inorganic compounds ammonium nitrite sulfur obtain electrons another way classifying different heterotrophs assigning chemotrophs phototrophs phototrophs utilize light obtain energy carry metabolic processes whereas chemotrophs use energy obtained oxidation chemicals photoorganoheterotrophs rhodospirillaceae purple nonsulfur bacteria synthesize organic compounds using sunlight coupled oxidation organic substances use organic compounds build structures fix carbon dioxide apparently calvin chemolithoheterotrophs like oceanithermus obtain energy oxidation inorganic compounds including hydrogen sulfide elemental sulfur thiosulfate molecular hydrogen mixotrophs facultative chemolithotroph use either carbon dioxide organic carbon carbon source meaning mixotrophs ability use heterotrophic autotrophic although mixotrophs ability grow heterotrophic autotrophic conditions c vulgaris higher biomass lipid productivity growing heterotrophic compared autotrophic heterotrophs consuming reduced carbon compounds able use energy obtain food growth reproduction unlike autotrophs must use energy carbon heterotrophs autotrophs alike usually dependent metabolic activities organisms nutrients carbon including nitrogen phosphorus sulfur die lack food supplies applies animals fungi also chemical origin life hypothesis suggests life originated prebiotic soup summary theory follows early earth highly reducing atmosphere energy sources electrical energy form lightning resulted reactions formed simple organic compounds reacted form complex compounds eventually resulted alternative theories autotrophic origin life contradict theory chemical origin life beginning heterotrophic life first proposed alexander ivanovich oparin eventually published origin life independently proposed first time english john burdon sanderson authors agreed gasses present progression events point oparin championed progressive complexity organic matter prior formation cells haldane considerations concept genes units heredity possibility light playing role chemical synthesis evidence grew support theory stanley miller conducted experiment added gasses thought present early earth water methane ammonia hydrogen flask stimulated electricity resembled lightning present early experiment resulted discovery early earth conditions supportive production amino acids recent reanalyses data recognizing different amino acids produced including several currently used experiment heralded beginning field synthetic prebiotic chemistry known early earth oceans shallow waters rich organic molecules could used primitive method obtaining energy energetically favorable organic carbon became scarce inorganic carbon providing potential evolutionary pressure become following evolution autotrophs heterotrophs able utilize food source instead relying limited nutrients found eventually autotrophic heterotrophic cells engulfed early heterotrophs formed symbiotic endosymbiosis autotrophic cells suggested evolved chloroplasts endosymbiosis smaller heterotrophs developed mitochondria allowing differentiation tissues development multicellularity advancement allowed diversification today many heterotrophs autotrophs also utilize mutualistic relationships provide needed resources one example mutualism corals algae former provides protection necessary compounds photosynthesis latter provides however hypothesis controversial main carbon source early earth suggesting early cellular life autotrophs relied upon inorganic substrates energy source lived alkaline hydrothermal vents acidic geothermal simple biomolecules transported space considered either reduced fermented heterogeneous support microbial heterotrophic microbes likely originated low partial pressures bases amino acids ribose considered first fermentation heterotrophs currently found domain life bacteria archaea domain bacteria includes variety metabolic activity including photoheterotrophs chemoheterotrophs organotrophs within domain eukarya kingdoms fungi animalia entirely heterotrophic though fungi absorb nutrients organisms within kingdom protista heterotrophic kingdom plantae almost entirely autotrophic except mycoheterotrophic lastly domain archaea varies immensely metabolic functions contains many methods many heterotrophs chemoorganoheterotrophs use organic carbon eg glucose carbon source organic chemicals eg carbohydrates lipids proteins electron heterotrophs function consumers food chain obtain nutrients saprotrophic parasitic holozoic break complex organic compounds eg carbohydrates fats proteins produced autotrophs simpler compounds eg carbohydrates glucose fats fatty acids glycerol proteins amino acids release chemical energy nutrient molecules oxidizing carbon hydrogen atoms carbohydrates lipids proteins carbon dioxide water respectively catabolize organic compounds respiration fermentation fermenting heterotrophs either facultative obligate anaerobes carry fermentation low oxygen environments production atp commonly coupled substratelevel phosphorylation production end products eg alcohol products serve substrates bacteria anaerobic digest converted important step carbon cycle removing organic fermentation products anaerobic heterotrophs undergo respiration atp production coupled oxidative leads release oxidized carbon wastes reduced wastes like atmosphere heterotrophic microbes respiration fermentation account large portion release atmosphere making available autotrophs source nutrient plants cellulose synthesis respiration heterotrophs often accompanied mineralization process converting organic compounds inorganic organic nutrient source taken heterotroph contains essential elements n p addition c h often removed first proceed oxidation organic nutrient production atp via n organic carbon source transformed desulfurylation deamination heterotrophs also allow dephosphorylation part conversion n organic form inorganic form critical part nitrogen sulfur cycle formed desulfurylation oxidized lithotrophs phototrophs formed deamination oxidized lithotrophs forms available heterotrophs ability mineralize essential elements critical plant opisthokonts prokaryotes heterotrophic particular animals fungi animals corals form symbiotic relationships autotrophs obtain organic carbon way furthermore parasitic plants also turned fully partially heterotrophic carnivorous plants consume animals augment nitrogen supply remaining autotrophic animals classified heterotrophs ingestion fungi classified heterotrophs absorption httpsenwikipediaorgwikiheterotroph
