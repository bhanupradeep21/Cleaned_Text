brachial plexus injury bpi also known brachial plexus lesion injury brachial plexus network nerves conducts signals spinal cord shoulder arm hand nerves originate fifth sixth seventh eighth cervical first thoracic spinal nerves innervate muscles skin chest shoulder arm brachial plexus injuries occur result shoulder trauma eg tumours inflammation obstetric obstetric injuries may occur mechanical injury involving shoulder dystocia difficult prevalence brachial plexus may injured falls height side head shoulder whereby nerves plexus violently stretched brachial plexus may also injured direct violence gunshot wounds violent traction arm efforts reducing dislocation shoulder rare syndrome causes brachial plexus inflammation without obvious injury nevertheless disabling signs symptoms may include limp paralyzed arm lack muscle control arm hand wrist lack feeling sensation arm hand although several mechanisms account brachial plexus injuries common nerve compression stretch infants particular may experience brachial plexus injuries delivery present typical patterns weakness depending portion brachial plexus involved severe form injury nerve root avulsion usually accompanies highvelocity impacts commonly occur motorvehicle collisions bicycle based location nerve damage brachial plexus injuries affect part entire arm example musculocutaneous nerve damage weakens elbow flexors median nerve damage causes proximal forearm pain paralysis ulnar nerve causes weak grip finger cases injuries cause total irreversible paralysis less severe cases injuries limit use limbs cause cardinal signs brachial plexus injury weakness arm diminished reflexes corresponding sensory needed cases nerve roots stretched torn origin since meningeal covering nerve root thinner sheath enclosing nerve epineurium nerve contiguous dura mater providing extra support nervecitation needed brachial plexus lesions typically result excessive stretching rupture injury nerve torn spinal cord avulsion injuries nerve torn attachment spinal cord bony fragment pseudoaneurysm hematoma callus formation fractured clavicle also put pressure injured nerve disrupting innervation muscles trauma directly shoulder neck region crush brachial plexus clavicle first although injuries occur time many brachial plexus injuries happen birth babys shoulders may become impacted birth process causing brachial plexus nerves stretch tear obstetric injuries may occur mechanical injury involving shoulder dystocia difficult childbirth common result injurious stretching childs brachial plexus birth often vaginal birth occasionally caesarean section excessive stretch results incomplete sensory andor motor function injured injuries brachial plexus result excessive stretching tearing nerve fibers injuries located front behind clavicle nerve disruptions root avulsions spinal cord injuries diagnosed based clinical exams axon reflex testing electrophysiological brachial plexus injuries require quick treatment order patient make full functional recovery tung types injuries common young adult traumatic brachial plexus injuries may arise several causes including sports highvelocity motor vehicle accidents especially motorcyclists also allterrainvehicle atv accidents injury direct blow lateral side scapula also possible severity nerve injuries may vary mild stretch nerve root tearing away spinal cord avulsion brachial plexus may injured falls height side head shoulder whereby nerves plexus violently brachial plexus may also injured direct violence gunshot wounds violent traction arm efforts reducing dislocation shoulder brachial plexus lesions divided three types backpack palsy caused much use heavy backpack whose packstraps chronically press brachial plexus injury brachial plexus happen numerous environments may include contact sports motor vehicle accidents although common events one two mechanisms injury remain constant point injury two mechanisms occur traction heavy brachial plexus made spinal nerves part peripheral nervous system includes sensory motor nerves innervate upper limbs brachial plexus includes last four cervical nerves thoracic nerve nerves splits smaller trunks divisions cords lateral cord includes musculocutaneous nerve lateral branch median nerve medial cord includes medial branch median nerve ulnar nerve posterior cord includes axillary nerve radial traction occurs severe movement causes pull tension among nerves two types traction downward traction upward traction downward traction tension arm forces angle neck shoulder become broader tension forced cause lesions upper roots trunk nerves brachial motorcycle accidents sports injuries usually cause type injury brachial upward traction also results broadening scapulohumoral angle time nerves torn away humeral fractures shoulder dislocations also cause type injury high energy root avulsion nerve rupture may occur severe trauma inappropriate surgical positioning inappropriate use surgical two mechanisms root avulsion injury peripheral central mechanism peripheral mechanism traction transmitted rootlet however dura mater torn rootlet intact dura less elastic compared rootlet pseudomeningocele shown cervical myelography hand central mechanism head neck pushed along spinal roots brachial plexus opposite site body leading direct nerve root injury dura sheath remains intact case anterior roots prone posterior roots avulsion thus nerve roots prone injury root avulsion injury divided based location lesion pre postganglionic lesions preganglionic lesion sensory fibre remain attached cell body sensory ganglion thus wallerian degeneration sensory fibre thus sensory action potential still detected distal end spinal nerve however get type lesion sensory loss affected nerve roots case surgical repair lesion possible proximal nerve tissue short stitching possible postganglionic lesions cell body sensory ganglion detached spinal nerve leading wallerian degeneration sensory fibre thus action potential detected distal end spinal nerve however surgical repair possible proximal nerve tissue enough length heavy impact shoulder second common mechanism causing injury brachial plexus depending severity impact lesions occur nerves brachial plexus location impact also affects severity injury depending location nerves brachial plexus may ruptured avulsed passing clavicle first rib brachial plexus may crushed costoclavicular space usually due direct trauma shoulder neck region result vehicular accidents occupational injuries sports injuries brachial plexus may also compressed surrounding damaged structures bone fragments callus clavicular fracture hematoma pseudoaneurysm vascular injury cervical rib prominent transverse process congenital fibrous bands also compress brachial plexus cause thoracic outlet delivery baby shoulder baby may graze pelvic bone mother process brachial plexus receive damage resulting injury incidence happening birth low compared identified brachial plexus accurate test diagnosing brachial plexus injury operative exploration potentially injured segments spinal roots endorgans nerves evaluated operative microscope without intraoperative electrical studies eg bipolar stimulation seps meps supplement operative evaluation rootlets within spinal canal intraforaminal portion spinal roots proximal dorsal root ganglia eg via hemilaminectomy otherwise difficult rarely clinically justifiable context apparently incontinuity root preoperative imaging studies method evaluating section nervecitation needed best noninvasive test bpi magnetic resonance imaging mri mri aids assessment injuries used provide information portion plexus operatively explored rootlets roots addition assessment cervical cord posttraumatic changes soft tissues associated injuries eg fractures cuff tears etc may appreciated although superior nerve conduction studies ultrasound tests conventional mri poor specificity meaning falsepositive rate high surgeons cant rely upon test guide consequently future peripheral nerve mr imaging including imaging brachial plexus injuries likely based diffusionweighted imaging diffusion tensor techniques significant potential clinical enable production easily interpreted reconstructions spinal cord brachial plexus several weeksmonths bpi emg
