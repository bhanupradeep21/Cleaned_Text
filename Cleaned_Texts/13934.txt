dna polymerase alpha also known pol α enzyme complex found eukaryotes involved initiation dna replication dna polymerase alpha complex consists subunits pol α limited processivity lacks exonuclease activity proofreading errors thus well suited efficiently accurately copy long templates unlike pol delta epsilon instead plays limited role replication pol α responsible initiation dna replication origins replication leading lagging strands synthesis okazaki fragments lagging strand pol α complex pol αdna primase complex consists four subunits catalytic subunit regulatory subunit small large primase subunits respectively primase created rna primer pol α starts replication elongating primer dna polymerase alpha like dna primase contains ironsulfur clusters critical electron transport uses dna transfer electrons high speeds process involved detecting dna damage may also involved feedback primase complex dna polymerase article incorporates text united states national library medicine public domain ec enzymerelated article stub help wikipedia expanding httpsenwikipediaorgwikidnapolymerasealpha
