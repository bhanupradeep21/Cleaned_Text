sharks fish general use hunting methods ambush ballistic interception pack hunting pursuit predation great white sharks typically ambush prey like fur seal coming high speeds hitting seal midair completely breaching water surface attacks successful first hours dropping late morning hunting prey though prefer hunting alone sometimes hunt cooperatively birds hunting success recorded species peregrine falcons merlins birds like mammals employ three hunting strategies includes ambush pack hunting pursuit hunting success peregrine falcons low high merlins high invertebrates employ five types predation grazing true predation parasitism parasitoidism competitive predation little known hunting success invertebrates dragonfly said highest hunting success invertebrates also use ambush pursuit predation ballistic interception pack hunting invertebrates employ ballistic interception includes dragonflies employ ambush includes trapdoor spiders use pursuit predation like asian giant hornets pack hunters like many ant species invertebrates also use camouflage like cuttlefish mantis octopus katydid etc kill rates number prey biomass killed individual predator per unit time

hypothesis evolution however previous research shows benefit increased hunting success present small groups several group hunting taxas ranging insects primates despite cooperation among hunters hunting success larger group size research shows predator groups animals highest hunting success rates levels even declines across larger theorised hunting success predators hunting formidable prey increases group size pattern caused increased cooperation large groups due much lower chance solitary predator prey low hunting success solitary predators promotes cooperation extra hunter sufficiently improve group hunting success avoid risk injury energy loss field studies show different predator hunting methods ambush pursuit predation etc lead distinct number individuals prey due predators different hunting strategies cause competing trophic cascades function different trophic predators often classified active sitandwait predators average hunting locomotor crossover hypothesis states ambush predators success hunting fastmoving prey whereas cursorial predators successful hunting sedentary prey studies reveal starvation cause ambush predator adopt pursuit predation hunting method though ambush predators regularly switch pursuit predation prey densities experiments show differences preys antipredator responses environment influence predator behaviour success field observations show predators alter hunting behaviour larger scales according prey behaviour smaller scales seek specific locations facilitate hunting conditions environment influence predators ability detect prey vice versa primary mechanism limiting foraging time obtained mobile predators due risk unfavourable conditions importance predators community functioning gentle environments effect reduces stressful situations hydrodynamic stress associated waves decreases predators success conditions restrict predator mobility foraging activity environmental conditions may impair predators ability find consume prey instance green crab predation drastically decreased vicinity damariscotta river high flow celerities though found greater densities high flow rates similar incidents happened fish insects copepods exhibited much lower foraging success rapid flows result environmental conditions influence predators reducing ability find handle prey behavioural research shows environmental conditions like hydrodynamics big effect systems predators rely chemical cues find predators hunting behaviour suited hunting specific types vegetative cover thus largely custom characteristic taxonomic families
