infantile myofibromatosis imf rare tumor found live births nonetheless common tumor derived fibrous connective tissue occurs primarily infants young children imf tumors benign sense metastasize distant tissues although occurring viscera ie internal organs carry guarded poor prognoses lifethreatening particularly newborns young condition first described arthur purdy stout congenital generalized fibromatosis coined word fibromatosis imf tumors occur three clinical patterns solitary imf tumors also called myofibromas often regress spontaneously rarely cause serious issues multiple tumors viscera involvement consists numerous ie dozens imf lesions located skin subcutaneous tissues visceral organs may regress spontaneously rarely cause serious issues multiple tumors viscera involvement also called generalized myofibromatosis rarely regress consist numerous imf lesions nonvisceral tissues plus one visceral tumors may minority infantile myofibromatosis tumors present individuals strong family history disease familial cases associated mutations either pdgfrb however imf cases family history disease nonetheless pdgfrb gene mutations tumor cells mutations similar occurring familial pdgfrb gene regardless genetic variations imf tumors consist blandappearing benign ie nonmalignant myofibroblasts ie cells blend variable set features seen fibroblasts common cell type connective tissue variable set features seen smooth muscle treatment imf tumors depends upon tumor numbers locations genetic abnormalities found individual often include one therapeutic regimen individuals solitary tumors usually treated observation expectation many tumors regress single tumors located vital areas eg intracranial tumors tumors regress suitable observation periods often treated surgical removal multiple tumors viscera involvement surgically inaccessible lifethreatening imf tumors treated one combination chemotherapy drugs radiation therapy tumors certain pdgfrb gene

history imf tumors date families reported carry various germline ie inherited mutations one two pdgfrb genes mutations gain function mutations ie mutant genes product overactive inherited autosomal dominant manner incomplete penetrance among identified familial carriers mutant genes history imf developed solitary imf developed multiple tumors viscera involvement multiple tumors viscera involvement imf died individuals diagnosed imf infancy early subsequent studies found individuals imf family history disease also carry mutations one two pdgfrb genes cells tumor tissues mutations somatic mutations ie noninherited mutations developing conception identical similar seen familial familial nonfamilial mutated pdgfrb genes produce highly overactive plateletderived growth factor receptor beta ie pdgfβ receptor proteins contribute development andor progression mutation one two genes reported occur single family autosomal dominant inheritance familys members imf plus mutation members imf since mutated gene family produces overactive neurogenic locus notch homolog protein product cell culture studies increases expression pdgfrb genes product pdgfβ receptor mutation may promote development andor progression imf manner similar pdgfrb mutant genes ie increasing number therefore overall activity pdgfβ studies needed define gene mutations frequency occurrence contribution development solitary imf tumors represent imf tumors commonly present mass infiltrates surrounding tissue head neck areas eg ethmoid sinusmaxillary sinus infratemporal fossa tongue hard

may regress multiple tumors viscera involvement typically occur dozens hundreds tumors located sites multiple tumors viscera involvement also occur one visceral organs gastrointestinal tract upper respiratory tract andor liver parietal cortex form imf particularly cases tumors involving gastrointestinal tract heart andor far higher morbidity mortality death occurring infants first weeks months death typically due tumors compression vital organs tissues eg blood however uncommon cases multiple tumors viscera involvement associated serious symptoms observed without treatment time showed spontaneous regressions almost microscopic histopathologic analyses imf tumor tissues commonly show repeated patterns central zone consisting spindleshaped cells lining capillaries roundtooval cells arranged around prominent antlershaped vascular spaces surrounded peripheral zone clustered smooth musclelike cells relative proportions two zones vary within different areas tumor tumors immunohistochemical analyses indicate spindleshaped cells strongly express smooth muscle actin calponin less commonly desmin twenty families inherited imf shown mutations one two pdgfrb genes pdgfrb

smooth muscle activated pdgfβ receptors tyrosine kinase stimulates cell signaling proteins kinase stat proteins phospholipase cγ turn promote parent cells grow proliferate survive abnormally prolonged times pdgfβ receptor gene protooncogene ie normal gene mutated could form cancercausing studies show pdgfrb mutant proteins imf constitutively overactive tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib blocks activity mutants well plus plus double mutants mutant two tyrosine kinase inhibitors dasatinib ponatinib inhibit mutants tyrosine kinase limited initial studies suggest inhibitors useful treating severe cases based clinical presentation gross appearance imf tumors confused wide range benign malignant papular nodular tumorous lesions particular cases involve multiple tumors however presence two zone histopathology family history disease presence cited pdgfrb gene mutations almost always definitive indicators imf imf classic form mesoblastic nephroma suggested disease similar histopathology however mesoblastic nephroma tumor cells unlike imf tumor cells express cyclin betacatenin proteins therefore likely different cellular origin imf infantile digital fibromatosis tumor develops primarily fingers toes regarded type imf however tumors distinctly different clinical presentation histopathology world health organization redefined infantile digital fibromatosis benign tumor category benign fibroblastic myofibroblastic tumors therefore different controlled studies define optimal treatments imf following give currently widely used recommended treatments along result treatments three categories imf tumors solitary imf tumors typically grow slowly produce symptoms often regress spontaneously within months diagnosis watchful waiting strategy commonly used tumors visceral solitary imf tumors cause significant tissue injury located vital areas andor lifethreatening treated surgical excision surgery deemed inappropriate treated drugs andor radiation therapy indicated following section multiple tumors visceral surgical excision also used diagnosis tumor rare cases aggressive imf tumors recurred regressing required observation andor overall prognosis almost cases solitary imf good multiple tumors viscera involvement also may regress spontaneously carry good excellent prognosis even invade local tissues however neonates presenting multiple imf tumors undergo examination including medical imaging tests determine extent disease particularly respect determining visceral tumors present therefore proper diagnosis multiple tumors viscera treatment multiple tumors viscera involvement similar used solitary imf individuals multiple tumors viscera involvement numerous tumors one located often injure vital internal organ may lifethreatening cases one tumors vital organ seriously symptomatic successfully treated surgical resection cases surgical resection single symptomatic tumor good option cases multiple visceral tumors treated nonsurgical methods tumors typically respond conventional systemic chemotherapy reductions sizes responses usually observed several weeks chemotherapy regimes successfully treated cases include low vincristine plus dactinomycin vinblastine plus vinblastine plus glucocorticoid prednisolone vincristine plus actinomycin plus glucocorticoid vincristine plus dactinomycin plus cytokine interferon alpha also used singledrug treatment least one multiple tumors viscera involvement also treated surgical resection combination drugs andor radiation therapy alone combined recently tyrosine kinase inhibitors used treat pdgfrbassociated imf imatinib imatinib plus second tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib successful treated several chemotherapy plus successfully treated cases lifethreatening imf studies suggest tyrosine kinase inhibitor selected based pdgfrb oncoproteins sensitivity eg dasatinib ponatinib used treat patients imatinibresistant pdgfrb gene imatinib initial choice dasatinib ponatinib used cases failing respond imatinib cases pdgfrb gene mutation inhibitors precise dosages use newborns infants welldefined serious sideaffects therefore considered
