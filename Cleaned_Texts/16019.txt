mammalian species pseudopregnancy physical state whereby signs symptoms pregnancy exception presence fetus creating false pregnancy corpus luteum remains ovulated ovarian follicle responsible development maternal behavior lactation mediated continued production progesterone corpus luteum pregnancy species corpus luteum degraded absence pregnancy however species corpus luteum may persist absence pregnancy cause pseudopregnancy female exhibit clinical signs mechanism well understood prolactin receptors known involved role prolactin maintaining pseudopregnancy evident instance rodent chronic prolactin administered pseudopregnancy continue whereas condition lasts days pseudopregnancy occurs female cat ovulates fertilised due breeding infertile male spontaneous ovulation due owner stimulating ovulation corpus luteum present ovulation persists around days length pseudopregnancy varies greatly mean duration days pseudopregnancy female cat returns proestrus become pregnant pseudopregnancy lasts around half length normal pregnancy cats advantageous cats conceive earlier making efficient cats become pseudopregnant following estrus queen bred infertile male queens induced ovulators meaning ovulate produce corpus luteum bred corpus luteum persists queen pregnant queens body distinguish pregnant nonpregnant state aside initial mechanical trigger coitus pseudopregnant queens rarely show mammary enlargement behavioral signs therefore rarely require treatment pseudopregnancy cats uncommon queen must bred infertile male become pseudopregnant compounded fact cats seasonal progesterone estradiol profiles pseudopregnancy different compared normal pregnancy pseudopregnancy estradiol increases straight mating decreases normal levels amount progesterone increase days post copulation level rises day post copulation gradually declines normal pseudopregnancy normal physiologic process occurs female dogs seen days normal estrous heat period ovulation progesterone levels rise pseudopregnancy happens progesterone levels begin fall decreasing progesterone leads increase hormone prolactin prolactin responsible behaviours seen pseudopregnancy dogs may exhibit mothering toys nesting aggression mammary development milk production common pseudopregnancy also acutely induced spaying removing ovaries dog near end estrus spaying removes source progesterone induces rise prolactin permanent prevention pseudopregnancy accomplished dogs become pseudopregnant following estrus phase female dog bred bred infertile male species require signals embryo ifnÏ„ ruminants alert females body pregnancy maternal recognition pregnancy cause persistence corpus luteum development characteristics behaviors necessary care offspring recent research suggests progesterone secretion similar pregnant nonpregnant female veterinary researchers hypothesize may require molecular factors embryo maternal recognition pregnancy instead corpus luteum persists regardless pregnancy since corpus luteum degraded cause development maternal characteristics absence pregnancy pseudopregnant dogs develop mammary glands lactate build nests varying degrees depending breed although female dogs usually cycle twice per year pseudopregnancy pseudopregnancy notinpig condition occurs females exhibit physiological behavioral signs associated pregnancy fetuses present
