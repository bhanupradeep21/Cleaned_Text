thalassotitan titan seas extinct genus large mosasaurs group extinct marine lizards lived late maastrichtian cretaceous period morocco around million years ago known species atrox described fossils discovered ouled abdoun basin many mosasaurs found assigned tribe prognathodontini alongside mosasaurs like prognathodon gnathomortis prognathodontines separated mosasaurs based massive jaws robust

mosasaurs skull measured meters ft length corresponding total length meters like prognathodontines skull thalassotitan blunt robust premaxilla bone bearing tip skull short lateral view broad convex viewed dorsally body premaxilla contains numerous pits called neurovascular foramina believed house tactile nerves sensitive touch internarial bar long extension premaxilla reaching frontal bone broad passes maxilla main toothbearing upper jaw bone external nares openings house nostrils narrows slender rod contacts frontal maxilla internarial bar forms distinct low short keel maxilla short robust deep surface flat except low broad ridge lining teeth neurovascular foramina line margin increasing size progress towards back skull texture maxillas surface rough especially apparent larger individual caused network veined grooves house blood vessels external nares extend fourth twelfth maxillary teeth jugal bone located eye broad robust frontal bone short broad shaped almost like isosceles triangle large neurovascular foramina center pineal foramen contains parietal eye small long supratemporal fenestrae large openings eyes back end skull take nearly quarter entire skull length somewhat triangular dentary toothbearing bone lower jaw short wide robust curved concave towards upper jaws many bones upper jaw tightly sutured together two toothbearing bones premaxilla maxilla connected interlocking joints containing unusual series flanges grooves interdigitating set tongueandgroove joints secure maxilla prefrontal thalassotitan teeth roughly conical shape lightly curved large size robust build similar teeth p saturator except slightly shorter stockier tooth crowns slightly swollen around base next root form round circumference surfaces crown generally smooth may sometimes faint ridges depending individual ontogenetic variation enamel tip contain veinous ridges coarse bumps cutting edges welldeveloped finely serrated tooth two cutting edges positions differ depending tooths position jaw towards front jaw frontfacing cutting edges pronounced diminished backfacing edges middle near end jaw edges equal development located diametrically opposite end jaw backfacing edges become pronounced tooth roots massive barrelshaped deep pits occur within roots new replacement teeth like mosasaurs thalassotitan four types teeth corresponding jaw bones located

twelve maxillary teeth least six pterygoid teeth pterygoids fully preserved fourteen dentary teeth dentary teeth generally flatter side maxillary teeth heterodonty present meaning tooth shape changes jawline first four five teeth tall narrow slightly curved become stockier erect robust around middle jawline become shorter broad tall hooked flatter side pterygoid teeth strongly hooked also large robust nearly approaching size teeth main postcranial skeleton fully known fossils representing little front half body general shape vertebrae typical mosasaurines procoelous meaning front side deeply cupped concavely back side bulged convexly cervical neck vertebrae slightly wider long atlas holds rectangular triangular neural arches another single tall neural arch also present top vertebra articular surfaces atach cartilage connect vertebrae together initially heartshaped becomes rounded rearmost cervicals dorsal back vertebrae slightly longer wide tall neural arches rounded articular surfaces large rectangular transverse processes ribs short pectoral girdle robust similar p overtoni mosasaurus conodon albeit squareshaped latter two bones making girdle scapula coracoid similar sizes loosely contact contact point nevertheless wider glenoid fossa scapula shaped like square long wide lacks defined scapular neck expands front back forming fanlike convex blade coracoid also somewhat squarish lacks welldefined neck margins weakly concave front back convex forelimbs formed long paddles resembled mosasaurin mosasaurs like mosasaurus plotosaurus primitive possessing longer fewer phalanges humerus stocky resemble p overtoni except expansion glenoid condyle beyond postglenoid process radius unusually shaped mosasaur large humerus much larger ulna takes crescentlike
