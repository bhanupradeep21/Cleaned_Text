representation especially early stages reading decoding involves mapping letters word corresponding sounds combining sounds form verbal word encoding process used spelling similar although process goes opposite direction words verbal representation encoded written form especially early stages reading encoding involves determining sounds verbal word mapping sounds onto letter sequence order spell written word encoding decoding phonological awareness needed child must know sounds words order relate letter sounds phonological awareness auditory skill developed variety activities expose students sound structure language teach recognize identify manipulate listening skills important foundation development phonological awareness generally develop therefore scope sequence instruction early childhood literacy curriculum typically begins focus listening teachers instruct children attend distinguish sounds including environmental sounds sounds speech early phonological awareness instruction also involves use songs nursery rhymes games help students become alert speech sounds rhythms rather meanings including rhyme alliteration onomatopoeia prosody exposure different sound patterns songs rhymes start towards developing phonological awareness exposure enough traditional actions go along songs nursery rhymes typically focus helping students understand meanings words attend sounds therefore different strategies must implemented aid students becoming alert sounds instead specific activities involve students attending demonstrating recognition sounds language include waving hands rhymes heard stomping feet along alliterations clapping syllables names slowly stretching arms segmenting words phonological awareness technically sounds students need know
