dates back antiquity rudimentary understanding many conditions present early societies attested records earliest historical societies including middle east india hellenic period ancient greece concerted causal study disease underway see medicine ancient greece many notable early physicians hippocrates modern hippocratic oath named developed methods diagnosis prognosis number diseases medical practices romans byzantines continued greek roots many areas scientific inquiry growth understanding medicine stagnated somewhat classical era continued slowly develop throughout numerous cultures notably many advances made medieval era islam see medicine medieval islam numerous texts complex pathologies developed also based greek even growth complex understanding disease mostly languished knowledge experimentation began proliferate renaissance enlightenment baroque eras following resurgence empirical method new centers scholarship century study rudimentary microscopy

natural philosophers physicians studied disease informal study termed pathological anatomy morbid anatomy however pathology formal area specialty fully developed late early centuries advent detailed
