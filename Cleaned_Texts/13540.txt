neonatalonset multisystem inflammatory disease rare genetic periodic fever syndrome causes uncontrolled inflammation multiple parts body starting newborn period symptoms include skin rashes severe arthritis chronic meningitis leading neurologic damage one cryopyrinassociated periodic syndromes nomid result mutation gene also known gene helps control inflammation mutations gene also cause familial cold urticaria syndrome nomid successfully treated drug anakinra syndrome also known syndrome first described authors age onset almost always months age many infants born preterm cases dysmature babies frequently small dates placenta may abnormal nonspecific inflammation histology umbilical cord anomalies occasionally reported severe cases signs brain may detected prenatal ultrasound disease manifests many forms making diagnosis difficult common features disease involve skin joints central nervous system maculopapular urticarial skin rash often present birth cases probably correctly described urticariallike rash presence rash varies time biopsy skin lesions shows perivascular inflammatory infiltrate including granulocytes cases arthritis occurs joint signs variably expressed lead transient swelling without sequelae crises unpredictable anomalies growth cartilage long bones epiphyses suggestive pseudotumour biopsies reveal hypertrophic cartilage without inflammatory cells commonly affects large joints knees ankles elbows wrists may also involve small joints hands feet usually bilateral painful common characteristic feature giant kneecaps severe cases may result contractures joint deformities patients eventually neurological problems manifest three principal ways chronic meningitis involvement optic tract eye sensorineural hearing loss chronic meningitis presents features chronically raised intracranial pressure headaches vomiting ventriculomegaly hydrocephalus macromegaly cerebral atrophy optic atrophy features may evidenced prenatal ultrasound cases intellectual deficit occurs seizures occur cases manifestations rare histological examination shows infiltration meninges polymorphs ocular manifestations occur cases include uveitis papillary involvement conjunctivitis optical neuritis untreated may result blindness sensorineural hearing loss occurs tends progressive leading deafness cases almost children remarkably short growth delay fever extremely common inconstant often mild anemia frequent findings reported include macrocephaly large fontanelle prominent forehead flattening nasal bridge saddleback nose short thick extremities finger clubbing liver andor spleen may enlarged lymph node enlargement may also present later life secondary amyloidosis may occur delayed puberty secondary amenorrhoea uncommon hoarseness due inflammation laryngeal cartilage also reported disease caused cases mutated gene called known involved syndromes appear somewhat similar syndrome familial cold urticaria many patients parents mutation indicating problem inherited even though genetic involved controlling immune system mutation leads outofcontrol inflammationcitation needed diagnosis based observing patient finding constellation symptoms signs described blood tests help showing signs long standing inflammation specific test disease though gene causes disease known may changecitation needed routine laboratory investigations non specific anaemia increased numbers polymorphs elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate elevated concentrations creactive protein typically abnormalities found lumbar puncture shows elevated levels polymorphs cases occasionally raised eosinophil counts cases csf neopterin may elevated x ray abnormalities unique characteristic syndrome changes include bony overgrowth due premature ossification patella long bone epiphyses young children bowing long bones widening shortening periosteal reaction older onescitation needed audiometry shows progressive sensineural deafness visual examination shows optic atrophy increase blind spot ct usually normal may show enlargement ventricles mri contrast may show enhancement leptomeninges cochlea consistent chronic meningitis eeg shows nonspecific pattern slow waves spike discharges polymorphs tend show increased expression stills disease affect children months old hyperimmunoglobulin syndrome cases associated mevalonate kinase deficiency measured leukocytescitation needed attempts control inflammation using drugs work conditions inflammation problem successful steroids side effects used long term medications including methotrexate colchicine canakinumab tried success otherwise treatment supportive aimed solely controlling symptoms maximizing functioncitation needed overall prognosis patients nomid good though many live adulthood appear relatively well risk leukemia infections develop deposits protein aggregated called amyloid lead kidney failure problems neurologic problems troubling finding diseases related better understanding disease comes may lead effective treatmentscitation needed rare condition incidence estimated less million live births cases reported worldwide bulk cases sporadic familial forms
