hemocyanins also spelled haemocyanins abbreviated hc proteins transport oxygen throughout bodies invertebrate animals metalloproteins contain two copper atoms reversibly bind single oxygen molecule second hemoglobin frequency use oxygen transport molecule unlike hemoglobin red blood cells found vertebrates hemocyanins confined blood cells instead suspended directly hemolymph oxygenation causes color change colorless cui deoxygenated form blue cuii oxygenated hemocyanin first discovered octopus vulgaris leon fredericq presence copper molluscs detected even earlier bartolomeo bizio hemocyanins found mollusca arthropoda including cephalopods crustaceans utilized land arthropods tarantula eurypelma emperor centipede scutigera coleoptrata also larval storage proteins many insects appear derived arthropod hemocyanin superfamily composed phenoloxidases hexamerins pseudohemocyanins cryptocyanins dipteran hexamerin phenoloxidase copper containing tyrosinases proteins involved

six histidine noted species using hemocyanin oxygen transportation include crustaceans living cold environments low oxygen pressure circumstances hemoglobin oxygen transportation less efficient hemocyanin oxygen nevertheless also terrestrial arthropods using hemocyanin notably spiders scorpions live warm climates molecule conformationally stable fully functioning temperatures degrees hemocyanins bind oxygen noncooperatively roughly onefourth efficient hemoglobin transporting oxygen per amount blood hemoglobin binds oxygen cooperatively due steric conformation changes protein
