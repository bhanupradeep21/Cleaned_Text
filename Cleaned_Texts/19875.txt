skeleton structural frame supports body animals several types skeletons including exoskeleton rigid outer shell holds organisms shape endoskeleton rigid internal frame organs soft tissues attach hydroskeleton flexible internal structure supported hydrostatic pressure body fluids vertebrates animals endoskeleton centered around axial vertebral column skeletons typically composed bones cartilages invertebrates animals lack vertebral column skeletons vary including hardshelled exoskeleton arthropods molluscs plated internal shells eg cuttlebones cephalopods rods eg ossicles echinoderms hydrostatically supported body cavities spicules sponges cartilage rigid connective tissue found skeletal systems vertebrates invertebrates term skeleton comes ancient greek σκελετός skeletós dried sceleton archaic form skeletons defined several attributes solid skeletons consist hard substances bone cartilage cuticle divided location internal skeletons endoskeletons external skeletons exoskeletons skeletons may also defined rigidity pliant skeletons elastic rigid fluid hydrostatic skeletons hard structure like solid skeletons instead functioning via pressurized fluids hydrostatic skeletons always exoskeletons external skeletons cover body animal serving armor protect animal predators arthropods exoskeletons encase bodies undergo periodic moulting ecdysis animal grows shells molluscs another form exoskeletons provide surface attachment muscles specialized appendanges exoskeleton assist movement defense arthropods exoskeleton also assists sensory external
