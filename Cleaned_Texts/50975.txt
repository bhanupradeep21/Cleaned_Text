memory conformity also known social contagion phenomenon memories information reported others influences individual incorporated individuals memory memory conformity memory error due social influences cognitive social contamination false memory exemplified prominent situations involving social interactions eyewitness research memory conformity revealed suggestibility errors source monitoring far reaching consequences important legal social implications one many social influences memory immediately murder former swedish foreign minister anna lindh witnesses put room together could leave scene crime interviewed witnesses discussed scene room contrary told specific descriptions witnesses gave perpetrator upon leaving room influenced causing police collect false information perpetrator initially searching perpetrator mijailo mijailovic caught camera match descriptions eyewitnesses gave conclusions made cause false search rooted witnesses discussion accounts one another caused influence others memories another example occurred oklahoma city bombing three employees working location timothy mcveigh rented truck used two witnesses originally thought mcveigh third believed mcveigh came accomplice three left discuss event two witnesses came conclusion indeed second person assisted fbi believes accomplice never existed despite initial search employee claimed seen accomplice likely unintentionally influenced two employees causing make later claims accomplice possible example event involving rudolf hess adolf hitlers chief staff flown scotland present duke hamilton peace proposal germany britain hess parachuted aircraft miles course apprehended held two people met years could brought identify rudolf hess prior meeting hess two individuals heard radio report rudolf hess parachuted scotland apprehended report colored confirmation hesss identity man question shown despite fact hundred people london could positively identified hess identification made two men anticipated hess identify due report heard people ever called identify hess subsequent years speculation double impersonated hess memory conformity resulting misinformation either encountered socially discourse two people brought nonsocial one study found individual given false information postevent discussion accuracy individuals memory lowered individual given accurate information discussion recall accurate even subjects initial memories accurate individuals discussed memory someone witnessed slightly different scene exhibited decrease accuracy due simply hearing another individuals report event enough alter ones confidence ones recalled memory conformity shown occur tasks involving free recall recognition study participants likely provide inaccurate details photographs discussed another memory conformity typically created research setting using photos videos depict crime scenes typically participants led believe viewed scene reality videos photos slightly different participant introduced confederate reported different memory event viewing participants tested initial accuracy allowed discuss memory others see social interaction affects accuracy early study found despite seen different scenes pairs able come agreedupon conclusion meaning nearly half individuals conformed member pair worth noting study participants initially accurate first recall three influences contribute memory conformity social contagion errors normative influences information influences source monitoring normative informational influences memory social influences lead memory normative influence first suggested asch conformity experiments states social situations people likely make statements believe order conform social norms gain social example research shown people social interactions event likely change thoughts event something actually one experiment participants reported findings could possibly study analyzed characteristics dialogue specifically regard response order participants effect predicted memory conformity study showed first member report element memory resistant influence even memory disputed another person contrast person first mention detail likely influenced subsequently report person seen even memory report differed detail seen researchers suggested normative conformity may influenced changes memory reports individuals wanted appear agreement around order create smooth interaction increase chances information influence describes kind conformity people tend report someone else stated previously depend person resolve uncertainty people likely conform believe information source time learn materials better visual acuity expressed high confidence one study found considered highpower individuals likely influence deemed lowpower highpower people likely express lead discussions lowerpower individuals tend follow depend upon confident one study considered effect memory conformity participants discuss information encountered omitted added contradicted originally encoded items study revealed people likely influenced encountering additional item detail memory comparison omitted contradictory manipulations researchers speculated uncertainty debate occurred trials surrounding confirmation additional information supplied another person convinced missed particular details likely due lapse attention ultimately led altering memory report motivation participants accurate reporting informational influence suspected played role increased conformity found source monitoring conscious effort one makes determine source memory piece information came sources tend ones experience others world imagination dreams specific vivid details within helps determine possibilities probable source one outer experience details usually involve setting events occurred around time contrasted events occurred past judge source could personal concrete experiences often vivid detail imagined noticing difference

region brain involved memory activated retrieving information external recalled memory piece information help hippocampus brain uses judgment abilities within prefrontal cortex determine whether received specific source source monitoring errors another mechanism underlying memory conformity sourcemonitoring error lead incorrect internal attribution memory belief memory made firsthand experience reality information external source someone else relayed piece information memory event similar qualities another possible information confused stored incorrectly enough differences permit strong enough distinction two lead false attributions working relation sources example two men speaking previous situation may difficult recall presented specific piece information compared one man one woman suggestions opinions others highly affect whether error memory source attribution occurs social interactions increase sourcemonitoring errors law studies showing participants attributed memory incorrect source reallife events provided examples errors source monitoring occurred especially relation criminal cases terrorist events show study done israeli plane crashing amsterdam asked person received news event many falsely reported source information claimed seen television although event filmed likely descriptions event stories brain created event visually causing person think seen researchers believe old age subsequent memory declines may cause individuals rely heavily external aids conversations others improve research would suggest older adults susceptible social influences memory conformity one study examining suggestibility found older adults average age experienced memory distortion introduced misleading information young adults average age despite findings study investigated memory conformity effects individuals witnessed discussed criminal event found agerelated differences susceptibility memory conformity effects younger years compared older years participants study participants watched unique video contained items seen assigned group either took recall test immediately control group discussed event recalling details significant proportion participants discussed event prior recall mistakenly recalled items acquired end spectrum children may also susceptible memory conformity young adults one study found children ages asked freely recall event cowitness seen slightly different version event children expressed social conformity presence cowitness also exhibited memory distortion independent factual test studies gone found enhanced suggestibility comparatively worse memory recall younger children ages older children ages studies shown adolescents much susceptible peer influence may therefore susceptible social influences conformity young individual likely conform memories anothers individual uncertain accuracy confidence plays important role uncertainty people less confident likely conform reports others suspect better effect demonstrated study involved showing pairs participants set photographs crime photos contained images accomplice others immediately seeing photographs participants asked presence accomplice photographs well level confidence reports initial reports highly accurate placed pairs person seen slightly different photograph pattern changed seventyfive percent pairs exhibited memory conformity one half dyad conforming almost every case less confident person pair accepted confident persons memory correct internal confidence time memory encoding also affects general social confidence levels individuals reliance another persons memory constantly changing initial encoder takes account conditions heshe first perceived event well conditions believed conditions another individual perceived one study showed levels memory conformity individuals varied based confidence comparative quality initial viewing conditions study participants thought less time view scene another individual much likely conform individuals report event participants believed initial viewing window longer less likely studies shown negative relationship social influence group size meaning stronger relationship memory conformity smaller researchers suggest influence group size conformity determined absence presence dissenters disagreeing larger group presence dissenters works decrease overall group certainty group unity decreases social conformity among group members thus increasing individual internal research suggests clarity participants recollection memory plays role withingroup recollection clarity internal confidence increase pressure conform group decreases research goes show false reports confederates within group influence participants heavily confident accuracy memories internally confident accuracy researchers report social anxiety two significant components fear negative evaluation social avoidance suggested people fear negative evaluation likely influenced peers tendency social avoidance less likely influenced individuals concerned negative evaluation likely comply disagreeing peers seen higher cost cost wrong individuals high levels social avoidance hand place less value information provided others less likely pay attention resulting lower level research also shown strength relationship individuals affect levels conformity studies exploring levels conformity acquaintances friends strangers romantic partners show pairs individuals stronger relationships susceptible memory source credibility involves judgment sources believability based various characteristics level expertise trustworthiness presented piece information may appear reliable based source providing analyzed source credibility confirmed objective means also perceived credible based various aspects source age gender status studies shown misinformation presented sources perceived less credible eg older adults children less likely incorporated decision whether trust information often based criteria author reputation status authority information plausibility opinions media criteria tend manipulated presented information often prewarnings warnings given individuals event social interaction misinformation introduced meant guard individual potential memory conformity warnings credibility witness attempts encourage individual trust internal sources resist external many lab experiments prewarnings consistently effective decreasing memory however prewarnings work paradoxically increase memory conformity overly sensitizing initial viewer mistakenly incorporates incorrect postevent information initial postwarnings postevent attempts reduce conformity misinformation effect occur memory eyewitness influenced misinforming studies found social postwarnings like characterizing individual low credibility misinformation introduced reduce misinformation memory conformity success postwarnings depends motivation individual accurate individuals perceived threat unduly influenced even face postwarnings many individuals still show memory earlier research shown postwarnings cause witnesses overcorrect memory exclusion neglect report correct memories appropriately gained time experience experiment participants first shown crime video presented nonwitnessed details details original video either discussion group reading report watching another version video three groups similarly reported nonwitnessed details first rendition experiment experiment later repeated participants warned incorporating details postvideo groups three groups showed significant decrease report nonwitnessed details postwarning worked encourage sensitive source monitoring caused decrease researchers investigated timing postwarnings influenced conformity researchers found postwarnings ineffective reducing memory conformity warned subjects one week study presented warning soon participants exposed false information found postwarnings significant effect recent study found postwarnings ineffective reducing memory conformity warnings different times exposure misinformation however experimenters test participants one session means warnings given shortly initial event encoded shortly misinformation presented additional opportunities study collaboration receiving misinformation partner may protect common cause wrongful conviction innocent people false testimony due eyewitness eyewitnesses encounter postevent information witnessing crime postevent information comes three basic types first due impact biased leading question altering eyewitnesss memory second type occurs eyewitness retold events false information included within retelling often incorporated eyewitnesss memories thus altering perception events occurred third type postevent information originates conversations others recent research shown critical period eyewitnesses occurs get report side time susceptible outside influences contaminating version events effects witness discussion memory even enhanced witnesses know well people likely believe information regardless whether true false comes someone friend significant person could viewed credibility stranger variety reasons including greater trust familiarity kind pattern falls larger trend perceived credibility person providing external information significant influence memory way witnesses retrieve memory also important factor likelihood individual expressing memory conformity studies shown participants asked discuss memories violent crime video terms emotions higher levels subjectivity major errors free one seven sins memory suggestibility interaction people changes pool information one event sway ones thoughts event actually suggestibility seems common way postevent information distortion occurs legal setting often witnesses prevented talking one another said multiple factors affect potential suggestibility witness accurate memories also less susceptible memory conformity less accurate finding important legal situations may logically deduced witness accurate memory event question less likely change story discussing witnesses someone less accurate recollection could prone false autobiographical memories also occur time recent study subjects remembered childhood event never actually naturally occurring autobiographical memories span large temporal range recent events childhood memories memories also contain weak perceptual detail makes similar real childhood memories thus believable firstborn children also likely laterborn siblings dominate discussion encounter conformity one study laterborn children influenced reason believe information given valid information possessed firstborn children relatively unaffected informational value influenced motivation either go along resist expectations discussion memory conformity also particularly relevant todays age mass advertisement research suggests predisposition trust judgment group affected political campaigns advertising even work alter personal brain imaging studies go show conformity seen neurological level individual changes personal beliefs due social influence called private conformity work shown individuals outwardly conform seeming support groups beliefs decisions public conformity without private conformity subsequent neurological analyses memory conformity typically focus entirely negative consequences witness memory distortion however benefits memory conformity fact psychologists posit memory conformity often results positive outcomes negative individual confident information alone possesses high subjective uncertainty reverting external sources help usually greater potential inaccurate memory report sticking original shaky memory stakes high something like criminal trial people readily available highly useful means helping recall httpsenwikipediaorgwikimemoryconformity
