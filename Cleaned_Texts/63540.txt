discoid lupus erythematosus common type chronic cutaneous lupus ccle autoimmune skin condition lupus erythematosus spectrum presents red painful inflamed coinshaped patches skin scaly crusty appearance often scalp cheeks ears hair loss may occur lesions lesions develop severe scarring centre areas may appear lighter color rim darker normal lesions last years without patients systemic lupus erythematous develop discoid lupus lesions however patients present initially discoid lupus infrequently develop systemic discoid lupus divided localized generalized childhood discoid lesions diagnosed patients first treated sunscreen topical work oral likely hydroxychloroquine related discoid lupus erythematosus dle skin lesions first present dull purplish red discshaped flat raised firm areas lesions develop increasing amounts white adherent finally lesions develop extensive scarring andor atrophy well pigment may also overlying dried fluid known darker skin lesions often lose skin pigmentation center develop increased dark skin pigmentation around lighter skin lesions often develop gray color little color rarely lesions may bright red look like skin lesions often sunexposed

though still small risk aggressive skin squamous cell sun exposure triggers lesions people discoid lupus erythematous evidence clearly demonstrate genetic component dle however genetics may predispose certain people experts consider dle autoimmune disease since pathologists see antibodies biopsy lesions look tissue however scientists understand connection antibodies lesions seen discoid possibly uv
