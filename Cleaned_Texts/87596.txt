cooperatives much distribution wealth members cooperatives means workers bottom organizational pyramid make money workers bottom pyramid conventional firms research also shows effect output price changes wage variations positive conventional firms cf cooperatives wc larger wcs means distribution wealth much greater wcs increase benefits wc usually reflected proportional increase wages whereas cf increase wages much smaller since wealth accumulated people higher position saved new corporate investments however fact wealth distributed already hired workers downside preventing cooperatives
