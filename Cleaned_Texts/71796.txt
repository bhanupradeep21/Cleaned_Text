emotions within normal spectrum reflect proper balance neurotransmitter function abnormally extreme emotions severe enough impact daily functioning patients seen schizophrenia reflect profound imbalance goal psychiatric intervention therefore regain homeostasis via psychopharmacological approaches existed prior onset disease conceptual framework debated within scientific community although demonstrably superior hypothesis emerged recently biopsychosocial approach mental illness shown comprehensive applicable theory understanding psychiatric disorders however still much discovered area inquiry prime example great strides made field understanding certain psychiatric disorders others major depressive disorder operate via multiple different neurotransmitters interact complex array systems yet completely understood niall mclaren emphasizes books humanizing madness humanizing psychiatry major problem psychiatry lacks unified model mind become entrapped biological reductionist paradigm reasons biological shift intuitive reductionism effective fields science medicine however despite reductionisms efficacy explaining smallest parts brain explain mind contends majority

different pharmaceutical medical device industry conflicts arising disparity raise natural concerns regard nevertheless sharfstein acknowledged without pharmaceutical companies developing producing modern medicines virtually every medical specialty would treatments patients care studies shown promotional marketing pharmaceutical companies potential influence physician decision pharmaceutical
