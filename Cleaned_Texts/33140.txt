diseases cardiovascular diseases infectious diseases general health syrian hamsters accounted total animal research participants united states covered animal welfare since use hamsters animal testing research united states animal research used hamsters total research animal use animal welfare act excludes mice rats fish year according canadian council animal care total hamsters used research canada making sixthmost popular rodent mice rats guinea pigs squirrels voles humans get lung cancer tobacco syrian hamsters model researching nonsmallcell lung carcinoma one types human lung research hamsters injected carcinogen nnk several times six months develop sort syrian hamsters humans cancer associated mutations kras various reasons collecting data way syrian hamsters develop lung cancer provides insight humans develop oral squamouscell carcinoma common cancer humans difficult scientists studying disease broadly accept syrian hamsters animal models researching research hamster given anesthesia mouth opened expose inside cheeks researcher brushes carcinogen dmba scientist take cell samples mouth hamster measure development process good cancer develops tumors predictable way starting hyperkeratosis hyperplasia dysplasia humans cancer increased production receptor tyrosine kinase syrian hamsters cancer also increased levels tumor develops hamster also increased gene expression cmyc similar human cancer hamsters develop cancer predictably researchers comfortable using hamsters research prevention scientific social controversy virus causing cancers leaving controversy aside syrian hamsters injected certainly develop various cancers predictable ways depending exposed hamster used research model clarify golden hamster contract contagious reticulum cell transmitted one golden hamster another means bite mosquito aedes syrian hamsters susceptible many metabolic disorders affect hamsters excellent animal model studying human metabolic gallstones may induced syrian hamsters giving hamster excess dietary cholesterol hamsters metabolize cholesterol way similar different sorts fats less likely produce gallstones gender differences gallstone formation hamsters hamsters different genetic strains significant differences susceptibility forming diabetes mellitus studied various ways using syrian hamsters hamsters feed fructose days get hyperinsulinemia hamsters increase hepatic lipase measurable responses useful understanding diabetes streptozotocin alloxan may administered induce chronic diabetes atherosclerosis may studied syrian hamsters organisms similar lipid hamsters develop atherosclerosis result dietary hamsters develop atherosclerotic plaques humans smoke inhalation studied syrian hamsters putting hamster laboratory smoking pregnant hamsters used model effects smoking pregnant emphysema component copd may induced hamsters injecting pancreatic elastase pulmonary fibrosis may induced hamsters injecting bleomycin cardiomyopathy hamsters inherited condition genetic lines hamsters bred retain gene may used study microcirculation may studied hamster cheek pouches hamsters thin easy examine without stopping bloodflow highly examined cheek pouch pulled mouth grasped point cheek everted pinned onto mount reperfusion injury may studied everted hamster pouches simulate reperfusion one method tie cuff around pouch restrict blood flow cause another method could compress veins arteries microvascular clips cause either case hour restricting blood pressure removed study pouch several inbred strains hamsters developed animal models human forms dilated cardiomyopathy gene responsible hamster cardiomyopathy widely studied inbred hamster strain identified pet hamsters also potentially prone cardiomyopathy infrequent cause unexpected sudden death adolescent young adult hamsters syrian hamsters infected range disease causing agents study disease cause disease hantavirus pulmonary syndrome medical condition humans caused hantavirus species syrian hamsters easily contract hantavirus species get symptoms humans infection deadly humans effects ranging nothing flu death syrian hamsters become easily infected used study pathogenesis andes virus maporal viruses infect hamsters cause pneumonia sin nombre virus choclo virus infect hamsters cause sars coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory syndrome humans syrian hamsters may infected virus like humans viral replication lesions respiratory tract examined histopathological however hamsters develop clinical symptoms hamsters might used study infection leptospira viruses cause leptospirosis humans similar symptoms syrian syrian hamsters used test drugs treat bacteria studied infection syrian hamsters include leptospira clostridium difficile mycoplasma pneumoniae treponema parasites studied infecting syrian hamsters include toxoplasma gondii babesia microti leishmania donovani trypanosoma cruzi opisthorchis viverrini taenia ancylostoma ceylanicum syrian hamsters infected scrapie get transmissible spongiform encephalopathy march researchers university hong kong shown syrian hamsters could model organism scientists use male hamsters study effects steroids male behavior castrated hamsters compared typical male castrated hamsters given steroids behavior steroid treatments cause castrated hamsters behaviors typical male hamsters poor nutrition may cause female infertility hamsters enough right food fewer estrous studies hamsters identify nutritional needs maintaining syrian hamsters used study nsaids cause reactive one way study inject hamsters indometacin causes ulcer within hours depending repeatedly given doses hamsters get severe lesions die within days peptic ulcers pyloric model creating chronically ill hamster die ulcers give naproxen hamster chronically ill used test antiulcer syrian hamsters also widely used research alcoholism virtue large livers ability metabolise high captivity golden hamsters follow welldefined daily routines running hamster wheel made popular subjects circadian rhythms research example martin ralph michael menaker colleagues used behavior provide definitive evidence suprachiasmatic nucleus brain source mammalian circadian hamsters number fixed action patterns readily observed including scentmarking body grooming interest study animal behavior scientific studies animal welfare concerning captive golden hamsters shown prefer use running wheels large diameters cm diameter preferred cm prefer bedding material allows build nests nesting material already prefer livedin bedding two weeks old longer durations tested new bedding suggesting may prefer bedding changes twoweek intervals rather weekly also prefer opaque tubes closed one end
