adenomyosis medical condition characterized growth cells proliferate inside uterus endometrium atypically located among cells uterine wall result thickening uterus occurs well misplaced patients condition endometrial tissue completely functional tissue thickens sheds bleeds every menstrual condition typically found women ages also affects younger patients adenomyosis often present painful menses dysmenorrhea profuse menses menorrhagia possible symptoms pain sexual intercourse chronic pelvic pain irritation urinary bladder adenomyosis basal endometrium penetrates hyperplastic myometrial fibers unlike functional layer basal layer undergo typical cyclic changes menstrual adenomyosis may involve uterus focally creating adenomyoma diffuse involvement uterus becomes bulky adenomyosis found together endometriosis differs patients endometriosis present endometriallike tissue located entirely outside uterus endometriosis tissue similar endometrium two conditions found together many cases yet often occur recognized distinct condition adenomyosis called endometriosis interna lesscommonlyused term adenomyometritis specific name condition specifying involvement adenomyosis vary widely type severity symptoms causes ranging entirely asymptomatic time severe debilitating condition cases women adenomyosis typically first report symptoms symptoms occur younger symptoms viz heavy bleeding pain estimated percent affected may clinical signs adenomyosis may include women adenomyosis also likely uterine conditions including cause adenomyosis unknown although associated sort uterine trauma may break barrier endometrium myometrium known junctional zone caesarean section surgical pregnancy termination pregnancy linked studies looking similarities differences two conditions conflicting pathogenesis adenomyosis still remains unclear functioning inner myometrium also called junction zone jz believed play major role development adenomyosis also matter discussion whether link reproductive disorders major obstetrical disorders also lies parity age previous uterine abrasion increase risk adenomyosis hormonal factors local hyperestrogenism elevated levels sprolactin well autoimmune factors also identified possible risk myometrium stroma adenomyosis affected uterus show significant differences nonaffected uterus complex origin includes multifactorial changes genetic biochemical levels tissue injury repair tiar theory widely accepted suggests uterine hyperperistalsis ie increased peristalsis early periods reproductive life induce microinjury endometrialmyometrial interface emi leads elevation local estrogen order heal damage time estrogen treatment increase uterine peristalsis leading vicious circle chain biological alterations essential development adenomyosis iatrogenic injury junctional zone physical damage due placental implantation likely results pathological also explains adenomyosis often becomes severe pregnancy childbirth endometriosis amelioratecitation needed misplaced endometrial tissue proliferation myometrium causes symptoms different uterine menstrual contractions caused prostaglandin produced normal endometrial dysmenorrhea main characteristic disease result high prostaglandin levels endometrial proliferation also led estrogen treatments try reduce levels order decrease adenomyosis patients present heavy menstrual bleeding due increase endometrial tissue greater degree vascularization atypical uterine contractions increased levels prostaglandins estrogen diagnosis adenomyosis pathologist microscopically examining small tissue samples tissue samples come uterine biopsy directly following hysterectomy uterine biopsies obtained either laparoscopic procedure abdomen hysteroscopy vagina diagnosis established pathologist finds invading clusters endometrial tissue within myometrium several diagnostic criterion used typically require either endometrial tissue invaded greater myometrium minimum invasion depth gross findings microscopic findings differential diagnosis adenomyosis vary widely extent location invasion within uterus result established pathognomonic features allow definitive diagnosis adenomyosis noninvasive imaging nevertheless noninvasive imaging techniques transvaginal ultrasonography tvus magnetic resonance imaging mri used strongly suggest diagnosis adenomyosis guide treatment options monitor response indeed tvus mri two practical means available establish presurgical transvaginal ultrasonography cheap readily available imaging test typically used early evaluation gynecologic ultrasound imaging like mri use radiation safe examination pelvis female reproductive overall estimated transvaginal ultrasonography sensitivity specificity detection common transvaginal ultrasound findings defined european musa group defined musa ultrasound characteristics divided direct indirect features direct features indirect features power doppler doppler ultrasonography function used transvaginal ultrasonography help differentiate adenomyomas uterine uterine fibroids typically blood vessels circling fibroids capsule contrast adenomyomas characterized widespread blood vessels within doppler ultrasonography also serves differentiate static fluid within myometrial cysts flowing blood within junction zone jz small distinct hormonedependent region endometrialmyometrial interface may assessed threedimensional transvaginal ultrasound tvus mri features adenomyosis disruption thickening enlargement invasion junctional consensus actual histology junctional zone recent review showed ultrasound mri histology define describe junctional zone magnetic resonance imaging mri provides slightly better diagnostic capability compared tvus due increased ability mri differentiate objectively different types soft possible mris higher spatial contrast resolution overall estimated mri sensitivity specificity detection diagnosis mri focuses predominately upon investigating junctional zone uterus thickened junctional zone darkerdiminished signal weighted three objective measures junctional zone used diagnose interspersed within thickened darker signal junctional zone one often see foci hyperintensity bright spots weighted scans representing small cystically dilatated glands acute sites mri limited factors calcified uterine fibroids ultrasound particular mri better able differentiate adenomyosis multiple small uterine fibroids adenomyosis cured definitively surgical removal uterus adenomyosis responsive reproductive hormones reasonably abates following menopause hormones decrease women reproductive years adenomyosis typically managed goals provide pain relief restrict progression process reduce significant menstrual bleeding broadly speaking surgical management adenomyosis split two categories uterinesparing nonuterinesparing procedures uterinesparing procedures surgical operations include surgical removal uterus uterinesparing procedures benefit improving fertility retaining ability carry pregnancy term contrast uterinesparing procedures worsen fertility even result complete sterility impact procedure womans fertility particular concern typically guides selection nonuterinesparing procedures definition include surgical removal uterus consequently result complete hysterectomy surgical removal uterus historically primary method diagnosing treating especially popular women completed childbearing cases fertility desired today many medical surgical interventions available treatments hormonal therapy endometrial ablation significantly reduced number women require hysterectomy said hysterectomies remain final treatment option women treatments typically viewed definitive treatment bleeding pelvic pain associated adenomyosis hysterectomy always result sterility cessation menstrual bleeding pelvic pain hand persist hysterectomy many many different types hysterectomy varying options existing removal fallopian tubes ovaries cervix also varying types hysterectomy performed many different surgical techniques hysterectomy performed variants also exist combine several techniques surgeries even change operation one technique another response unforeseen obstacles individual anatomy considerations example adenomyosis increase size uterus extent physically removed vagina without first cut smaller pieces recent data suggest prevalence adenomyosis often progressing condition advocated adenomyosis poses increased risk cancer development however entities could coexist endometrial tissue within myometrium could harbor endometrioid adenocarcinoma potentially deep myometrial condition estrogendependent menopause presents natural cure ultrasound features adenomyosis still present menopause
