causative gene identified symptoms typically appear baby reaches months agecitation needed aicardi syndrome develop normally first months later various symptoms appear due syndromes characteristic malformations brain common girls aicardi syndrome small head three six months age girls epileptic seizures often infantile spasm type caused changes brains gray matter cerebral cortex seizures occur either socalled flexor spasms childs neck suddenly bends forward arms make clasping movement types epileptic seizures seizures come series short intervals may increase number day day broken medication epilepsy usually persists severe intellectual disability major impact language communication motor skills moderate intellectual disability mild intellectual disability also occurs eyes always affected people impaired vision eye examination areas less pigment retinal lacunae appear white spots fundus due absence retinal pigment cells structures areas lacunae located macula affect acuity types eye abnormalities also common one eye smaller normal microphthalmia changes optic nerve incomplete closureslitting membranes eye coloboma rapid involuntary eye movements nystagmus common since girls aicardi syndrome intellectual disability makes difficult participate eye examination difficult measure vision problems gastrointestinal tract common example constipation diarrhea normal valve mechanism stomach esophagus upper mouth stomach work normally stomach contents therefore leak esophagus gastroesophageal reflux may also difficulty girls enter puberty earlier normal delayed puberty also drooling teeth grinding extra ribs lack ribs vertebral deformities often occur growing several girls get crooked back scoliosis reports isolated cases tumors especially brain aicardi syndrome nonprogressive condition lead deterioration various complications mean increased mortality among girls syndrome little known longterm prognosis occasional reports epilepsy may become milder increasing

electroencephalogram case infantile spasms shows characteristic pattern hypsarrhythmia magnetic resonance imaging mri brain blood urine samples examination spinal fluid cerebrospinal aicardi syndrome

earlycontinuing intervention programs developmental delayscitation neededadditional comorbidities complications sometimes seen aicardi syndrome include porencephalic cysts hydrocephalus gastrointestinal problems treatment porencephalic cysts andor hydrocephalus often via shunt endoscopic fenestration cysts though require treatment placement feeding tube fundoplication surgeries correct hernias gastrointestinal structural problems sometimes used treat gastrointestinal issuescitation needed girls aicardi syndrome come contact many different specialists healthcare early therefore important efforts drug treatment given infantile spasms types epilepsy also given girls aicardi syndrome epilepsy often difficult medication help examination regional hospital decision made whether another treatment may appropriate since cause epileptic seizures found many different places brain however epilepsy surgery rarely option aicardi treatment ketogenic diet may considered involves carefully calculated diet rich fat contains minimum carbohydrates provides daily need protein excess fat forms starvation bodies ketones used instead glucose fuel source metabolism brain children leads fewer seizures treatment started regional hospitals special teams doctors nurses another treatment option drug treatment epilepsy help socalled vagus nerve stimulator vns vagus nerve one twelve nerves originate directly brain cranial nerves small batterypowered box generator operated skin left collarbone thin wire electrode generator operated around left vagus nerve generator set sends electrical impulses brain via vagus nerve fixed intervals fixed strength gradually increased necessary lead reduction number strength seizures almost never results seizures disappearing completely treatment also started followed regional important girls eyesight used best possible way therefore examined pediatric ophthalmologist early stage investigate visual function need visual problems gastrointestinal tract need investigated treated medication girls difficulty eating may need receive nutrition via nasal tube socalled button peg percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy operatively created connection stomach via abdominal wall important closely monitor girls preventive dental care contact childrens dental care specialist pedodontist needed girls may find difficult participate tooth brushing dental due risk developing scoliosis back examined regularly scoliosis primarily treated brace may sometimes require girls aicardi syndrome need rehabilitation interventions also include vision rehabilitation habilitation team includes professional categories special knowledge disabilities effects everyday life health development interventions take place medical educational psychological social technical fields consist among things investigation treatment testing assistive devices information disability conversational support information societys support advice adapting home environments child lives also given parents siblings relatives also receive support family may need help coordination various interventions planned based needs child family vary time always take place close collaboration people childs network order develop ability communicate important work early educational efforts well alternative supplementary communication routes close collaboration takes place municipality offer various forms interventions facilitate familys everyday life personal assistance given due severe permanent disabilities need help basic needs also expand possibility active life despite extensive disabilities respite care contact family shortterm accommodation examples support adult women aicardi syndrome need continued habilitation efforts support daily life could example support care home special services daily prognosis varies widely case case depending severity symptoms however almost people reported aicardi syndrome date experienced developmental delay significant degree typically resulting mild moderate profound intellectual disability age range individuals reported aicardi syndrome birth cure worldwide prevalence aicardi
