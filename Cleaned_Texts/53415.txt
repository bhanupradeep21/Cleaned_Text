techniques also utilised divert patients attention allow avoid supposed negativity comfortable achieved television movies physical distraction focusing another body part wiggling toes recent research indicates use conscious sedation combined appropriate communication techniques may relieve anxiety modelling form psychobehavioural therapy used alleviate dental fear commonly used paediatric
