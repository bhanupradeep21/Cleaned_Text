destination telephone either radio landline wires radio used also transmit callers voicedata back receivers cell telephone twoway duplex phone conversation exists via interconnections make work correctly system allows automatic increases decreases transmitter power individual cell phone tower repeater minimum transmit power used complete hold call active allows users hear heard continuously conversation goal hold call active use least amount transmitting power mainly conserve batteries efficient tower system sense cell phone coming clearly order cell phone boost transmit power user control boosting may occur split second whole conversation user remote location power boost may continuous addition carrying voice data cell phone also transmits data automatically boosted system detects need encoding transmissions ensures crosstalk interference occurs two nearby cell users boosting power however limited design devices maximum setting standard systems high power thus overpowered secret systems using much boosted power take users cell phone overpowered way cell phone indicate change due secret radio programmed hide normal detection ordinary user know cell phone captured via overpowering boosts ways secret capture need overpower person shouting drowns someone whispering boost rf watts power cell telephone system overtake control total even one conversation strategy requires rf power thus simple types secret control power boosting equipment installed anywhere antenna including vehicle perhaps even vehicle move secretly boosted system takes control manipulation possible simple recording voice data total blocking cell phones geographic stingray used identify track phone compatible cellular data device even device engaged call accessing data stingray closely resembles portable cellphone tower typically law enforcement officials place stingray vehicle compatible computer software stingray acts cellular tower send signals get specific
