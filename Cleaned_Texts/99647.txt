ex situ conservation literally means offsite conservation process protecting endangered species variety breed plant animal outside natural habitat example removing part population threatened habitat placing new location artificial environment similar natural habitat respective animal within care humans example zoological parks wildlife degree humans control modify natural dynamics managed population varies widely may include alteration living environments reproductive patterns access resources protection predation mortality ex situ management occur within outside species natural geographic range individuals maintained ex situ exist outside ecological niche means selection pressures wild populations may undergo artificial selection maintained ex situ multiple agricultural biodiversity also conserved ex situ collections primarily form gene banks samples stored order conserve genetic resources major crop plants wild relatives botanical gardens zoos aquariums conventional methods ex situ conservation also ex situ conservation house whole protected specimens breeding reintroduction wild necessary possible facilities provide housing care specimens endangered species also

inbreeding depression loss genetic diversity adaptations captivity important manage captive populations way minimizes issues individuals introduced resemble original founders closely possible increase chances successful initial growth phase population size rapidly expanded target population size target population size number individuals required maintain appropriate levels genetic diversity generally considered current genetic diversity number individuals required meet goal varies based potential growth rate effective size current genetic diversity generation target population size reached focus shifts maintaining population avoiding genetic issues within captive managing populations based minimizing mean kinship values often effective way increase genetic diversity avoid inbreeding within captive kinship probability two alleles identical descent one allele taken randomly mating individual mean kinship value average kinship value given individual every member population mean kinship values help determine individuals mated choosing individuals breeding important choose individuals lowest mean kinship values individuals least related rest population least common ensures rarer alleles passed helps increase genetic diversity also important avoid mating two individuals different mean kinship values pairings propagate rare alleles present individual low mean kinship value well common alleles present individual high mean kinship genetic management technique requires ancestry known circumstances ancestry unknown might necessary use molecular genetics microsatellite data help resolve genetic diversity often lost within captive populations due founder effect subsequent small population minimizing loss genetic diversity within captive population important component ex situ conservation critical successful reintroductions long term success species since diverse populations higher adaptive loss genetic diversity due founder effect minimized ensuring founder population large enough genetically representative wild often difficult removing large numbers individuals wild populations may reduce genetic diversity species already conservation concern alternative collecting sperm wild individuals using via artificial insemination bring fresh genetic maximizing captive population size effective population size decrease loss genetic diversity minimizing random loss alleles due genetic minimizing number generations captivity another effective method reducing loss genetic diversity captive selection favors different traits captive populations wild populations may result adaptations beneficial captivity deleterious reduces success reintroductions important manage captive populations order reduce adaptations captivity adaptations captivity reduced minimizing number generations captivity maximizing number migrants wild minimizing selection captive populations creating environment similar natural environment another method reducing adaptations captivity important find balance environment minimizes adaptation captivity environment permits adequate adaptations captivity also reduced managing captive population series population fragments management strategy captive population split several subpopulations fragments maintained separately smaller populations lower adaptive potentials population fragments less likely accumulate adaptations associated captivity fragments maintained separately inbreeding becomes concern immigrants exchanged fragments reduce inbreeding fragments managed separately genetic disorders often issue within captive populations due fact populations usually established small number large outbreeding populations frequencies deleterious alleles relatively low population undergoes bottleneck founding captive population previously rare alleles may survive increase inbreeding within captive population may also increase likelihood deleterious alleles expressed due increasing homozygosity within high occurrence genetic disorders within captive population threaten survival captive population eventual reintroduction back genetic disorder dominant may possible eliminate disease completely single generation avoiding breeding affected however genetic disorder recessive may possible completely eliminate allele due presence unaffected case best option attempt minimize frequency allele selectively choosing mating pairs process eliminating genetic disorders important consider certain individuals prevented breeding alleles therefore genetic diversity removed population alleles present individuals may lost preventing certain individuals breeding also reduces effective population size associated problems loss genetic diversity increased showy indian clover

helpful humankinds efforts sustain protect environment rarely enough save species extinction used last resort supplement situ conservation recreate habitat whole entire genetic variation species symbiotic counterparts elements time might help species adapt changing surroundings instead ex situ conservation removes species natural ecological contexts preserving semiisolated conditions whereby natural evolution adaptation processes either temporarily halted altered introducing specimen unnatural habitat case cryogenic storage methods preserved specimens adaptation processes quite literally frozen altogether downside rereleased species may lack genetic adaptations mutations would allow thrive everchanging natural habitat furthermore ex situ conservation techniques often costly cryogenic storage economically infeasible cases since species stored manner provide profit instead slowly drain financial resources government organization determined operate seedbanks ineffective certain plant genera recalcitrant seeds remain fertile long periods time diseases pests foreign species species natural defense may also cripple crops protected plants ex situ plantations animals living ex situ
