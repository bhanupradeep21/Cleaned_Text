respiratory diseases lung pathological conditions affecting organs tissues make gas exchange difficult airbreathing animals include conditions respiratory tract including trachea bronchi bronchioles alveoli pleurae pleural cavity nerves muscles respiration respiratory diseases range mild selflimiting common cold influenza pharyngitis lifethreatening diseases bacterial pneumonia pulmonary embolism tuberculosis acute asthma lung severe acute respiratory syndromes respiratory diseases classified many different ways including organ tissue involved type pattern associated signs symptoms cause disease study respiratory disease known pulmonology physician specializes respiratory disease known pulmonologist chest medicine specialist respiratory medicine specialist respirologist thoracic medicine specialist asthma chronic bronchitis bronchiectasis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd obstructive lung diseases characterised airway obstruction limits amount air able enter alveoli constriction bronchial tree due inflammation obstructive lung diseases often identified symptoms diagnosed pulmonary function tests spirometry many obstructive lung diseases managed avoiding triggers dust mites smoking symptom control bronchodilators suppression inflammation corticosteroids severe cases one common cause copd including emphysema chronic bronchitis tobacco smoking common causes bronchiectasis include severe infections cystic fibrosis definitive cause asthma yet restrictive lung diseases category respiratory disease characterized loss lung causing incomplete lung expansion increased lung stiffness infants respiratory distress syndrome restrictive lung diseases divided two categories caused intrinsic factors caused extrinsic factors restrictive lung diseases yielding intrinsic factors occur within lungs tissue death due inflammation toxins conversely restrictive lung diseases caused extrinsic factors result conditions originating outside lungs neuromuscular dysfunction irregular chest wall chronic respiratory diseases crds longterm diseases airways structures lung characterized high inflammatory cell recruitment neutrophil andor destructive cycle infection eg mediated pseudomonas aeruginosa common asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease acute respiratory distress syndrome crds curable however various forms treatment help dilate major air passages improve shortness breath help control symptoms increase quality telerehabilitation chronic respiratory disease latest evidence suggests primary pulmonary rehabilitation maintenance rehabilitation delivered telerehabilitation people chronic respiratory disease reaches outcomes similar centrebased safety issues identified findings based evidence limited small number infections affect part respiratory system traditionally divided upper respiratory tract infections lower respiratory tract infectionscitation needed upper airway defined structures connecting glottis mouth common upper respiratory tract infection common cold however infections specific organs upper respiratory tract sinusitis tonsillitis otitis media pharyngitis laryngitis also considered upper respiratory tract infections epiglottitis bacterial infection larynx causes lifethreatening swelling epiglottis mortality rate adults haemophilus influenzae still primary cause even vaccinations also streptococcus pyogenes cause epiglottitis symptoms include drooling stridor difficulty breathing swallowing hoarse croup laryngotracheobronchitis viral infection vocal cords typically lasting five six days main symptom barking cough lowgrade fever xray croup recognized steeple sign narrowing trachea commonly occurs winter months children ages months years severe form caused bacteria called bacterial tonsillitis swelling tonsils bacterial viral infection inflammation lead airway obstruction tonsillitis come peritonsillar abscess common upper airway infection occurs primarily young adults causes one swelling one tonsils pushing uvula unaffected diagnosis usually made based presentation examination symptoms generally include fever sore throat trouble swallowing sounding like hot potato common lower respiratory tract infection pneumonia infection lungs usually caused bacteria particularly streptococcus pneumoniae western countries worldwide tuberculosis important cause pneumonia pathogens viruses fungi cause pneumonia example severe acute respiratory syndrome pneumocystis pneumonia pneumonia may develop complications lung abscess round cavity lung caused infection may spread pleural cavitycitation needed poor oral care may contributing factor lower respiratory disease bacteria gum disease may travel airways primary ciliary dyskinesia genetic disorder causing cilia move coordinated manner causes chronic respiratory infections cough nasal congestion lead bronchiectasis cause lifethreatening breathing malignant tumors respiratory system particularly primary carcinomas lung major health problem responsible cancer diagnoses cancer deaths majority respiratory system cancers attributable smoking tobaccocitation needed major histological types respiratory system cancer addition since many cancers spread via bloodstream entire cardiac output passes lungs common cancer metastases occur within lung breast cancer may invade directly local spread lymph node metastases metastasis liver colon cancer frequently metastasizes lung prostate cancer germ cell cancer renal cell carcinoma may also metastasize lung treatment respiratory system cancer depends type cancer surgical removal part lung lobectomy segmentectomy wedge resection entire lung pneumonectomy along chemotherapy radiotherapy used chance surviving lung cancer depends cancer stage time cancer diagnosed extent histology overall case metastases lung treatment occasionally curative certain rare circumstances benign tumors relatively rare causes respiratory disease examples benign tumors pleural cavity diseases include pleural mesothelioma mentioned collection fluid pleural cavity known pleural may due fluid shifting bloodstream pleural cavity due conditions congestive heart failure may also due inflammation pleura occur infection pulmonary embolus tuberculosis mesothelioma pneumothorax hole pleura covering lung allowing air lung escape pleural cavity affected lung collapses like deflated balloon tension pneumothorax particularly severe form condition air pleural cavity escape pneumothorax keeps getting bigger compresses heart blood vessels leading lifethreatening situation pulmonary vascular diseases conditions affect pulmonary circulation examples needed pulmonary diseases also impact newborns disorders often unique affect adults infant respiratory distress syndrome commonly occurs less six hours birth births united main risk factor prematurity likelihood occurring going infants risk factors include infant diabetic mother idm method delivery fetal asphyxia genetics prolonged rupture membranes prom maternal toxemia chorioamnionitis male sex widely accepted pathophysiology respiratory distress syndrome caused insufficient surfactant production immature lung vascular development lack surfactant makes lungs atelectatic causing ventilation perfusion mismatch lowered compliance increased air resistance causes hypoxia respiratory acidosis lead pulmonary hypertension ground glass appearance xray symptoms include tachypnea nasal flaring paradoxical chest movement grunting subcostal bronchopulmonary dysplasia condition occurs birth usually mechanical ventilation oxygen use happens almost exclusively premature infants characterized alveoli lung vasculature becoming inflamed damaged complications bpd follow patient adulthood child may experience learning disabilities pulmonary hypertension hearing problems adult increased likelihood asthma exercise meconium aspiration syndrome occurs full term postterm infants aspirate meconium risk factors include diabetic mother fetal hypoxia precipitous delivery maternal high blood diagnosis based meconium stained amniotic fluid delivery staining skin nails umbilical cord aspiration cause airway obstruction airtrapping pneumonia lung inflammation inactivated surfactant presents patchy atelectasis hyperinflation xray pneumothorax pneumomediastinum also persistent pulmonary hypertension newborn pphn syndrome occurs abnormal transition extrauterine life marked elevated pulmonary vascular resistance vasoconstriction causing righttoleft shunt blood foramen ovale ductus three main causes pphn parenchymal diseases meconium aspiration syndrome idiopathic hypoplastic vasculature like diaphragmatic hernia eventually resolve syndrome inhaled nitric oxide approved transient tachypnea newborn caused retention alveolar fluid lungs commonly occurs infants delivered via caesarean section without onset labor absorption amniotic fluid lungs yet commenced risk factors male sex macrosomia multiple gestations maternal asthma usually presents tachypnea increased work breathing xray diffuse infiltrates interlobar fissures sometimes pleural effusions seen diagnosis exclusion similarity diseases frequently cpap used help push lung fluid pulmonary pulmonary interstitial emphysema condition air escaping overdistended alveoli pulmonary interstitium rare disease occurs often premature infants even though possible appear often presents slow deterioration need increased ventilatory support chest xray standard diagnosis seen linear cystic translucencies extending edges bronchiolitis swelling buildup mucus bronchioles usually caused respiratory syncytial virus rsv spread infant touches nose throat fluids someone virus infects cells causing ciliary dysfunction death debris edema inflammation eventually leads common reason admission children age one year present widely mild respiratory infection respiratory failure since medication treat disease managed supportively fluids
