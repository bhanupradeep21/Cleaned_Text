acanthocephala greek ἄκανθος akanthos thorn κεφαλή kephale head group parasitic worms known acanthocephalans thornyheaded worms spinyheaded worms characterized presence eversible proboscis armed spines uses pierce hold gut wall host acanthocephalans complex life cycles involving least two hosts may include invertebrates fish amphibians birds species acanthocephala thought discrete phylum recent genome analysis shown descended considered highly modified unified taxon known syndermata earliest recognisable description acanthocephala worm proboscis armed hooks made italian author francesco redi joseph koelreuter proposed name philipp ludwig statius müller independently called echinorhynchus karl rudolphi formally named acanthocephala oldest known remains acanthocephalans eggs found coprolite late cretaceous bauru group brazil around million years old likely crocodyliform group may originated substantially acanthocephalans highly adapted parasitic mode life lost many organs structures evolutionary processes makes determining relationships higher taxa morphological comparison problematic phylogenetic analysis ribosomal gene revealed acanthocephala closely related rotifers possibly closer two rotifer classes bdelloidea monogononta class seisonidea producing names relationships shown cladogram seisonida bdelloidea monogononta acanthocephala three rotifer classes acanthocephala make clade called clade placed platyzoa study gene order mitochondria suggests seisonidea acanthocephala sister clades bdelloidea sister clade currently phylum divided four classes palaeacanthocephala archiacanthocephala polyacanthocephala eoacanthocephala monophyletic archiacanthocephala sister taxon clade comprising eoacanthocephala monophyletic several morphological characteristics distinguish acanthocephalans phyla parasitic worms acanthocephalans lack mouth alimentary canal feature share cestoda tapeworms although two groups closely related adult stages live intestines host uptake nutrients digested host directly body surface acanthocephalans lack excretory system although species shown possess flame cells protonephridia notable feature acanthocephala presence anterior protrudable proboscis usually covered spiny hooks hence common name thorny spiny headed worm proboscis bears rings recurved hooks arranged horizontal rows means hooks animal attaches tissues host hooks may two three shapes usually longer slender hooks arranged along length proboscis several rows sturdy shorter nasal hooks around base proboscis proboscis used pierce gut wall final

covering epidermis consists syncytium cell walls syncytium traversed series branching tubules containing fluid controlled wandering amoeboid nuclei inside syncytium irregular layer circular muscle fibres within rather scattered longitudinal fibres endothelium microstructure muscular fibres resemble nematodes except absence longitudinal fibres skin proboscis resembles body fluidcontaining

proboscis pierces gut wall feeds grows develops sexual organs adult worms mate male uses excretions cement glands plug vagina female preventing subsequent matings occurring embryos develop inside female life cycle repeats thornyheaded worms begin life cycle inside invertebrates reside marine freshwater systems gammarus lacustris small crustacean inhabits ponds rivers one invertebrate

worm becomes attracted toward light swims surface gammarus lacustris even go far find rock plant surface clamp mouth latch making easy prey duck duck definitive host acanthocephalan parasite order

gammarid predation thought gammarus lacustris infected thornyheaded worm parasite causes serotonin massively expressed serotonin neurotransmitter involved emotions mood researchers found mating gammarus lacustris expresses high levels serotonin also mating male gammarus lacustris clamps female holds days researchers additionally found blocking serotonin releases clamping another experiment found serotonin also reduces photophobic behavior gammarus lacustris thus thought thornyheaded worm physiologically changes behavior gammarus lacustris order enter bird final host examples behaviour
