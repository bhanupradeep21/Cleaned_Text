blister small pocket body fluid lymph serum plasma blood pus within upper layers skin usually caused forceful rubbing friction burning touching poison ivy freezing chemical exposure infection blisters filled clear fluid either serum however blisters filled blood known blood blisters pus instance become infected word blister entered english century came middle dutch bluyster modification old french blostre meant leprous rise skin due leprosy dermatology today words vesicle bulla refer blisters smaller greater size respectively heal properly blister popped unless medically necessary popped bacteria enter excess skin removed skin underneath needs top layer heal blister may form skin damaged friction rubbing heat cold chemical exposure fluid collects upper layers skin epidermis layers dermis fluid cushions tissue underneath protecting damage allowing heal intense rubbing cause blister friction skin continued long enough kind blister common walking long distances wearing old poorly fitting blisters common hands feet extremities susceptible walking running performing repetitive motions joystick manipulation whilst playing certain video games certain sports eg baseball pitching digging shovel playing guitar bass etc blisters form easily damp skin dry soaked common warm conditions lessaggressive rubbing long periods time may cause calluses form rather blister blisters calluses lead serious complications foot ulceration infection particularly sensation circulation impaired case diabetes neuropathy peripheral artery disease pad type blistering one tools used determine degree burns sustained first second degree burns may result blistered skin however characteristic second degree burns blister immediately whereas first degree burns blisters couple days sunburn also result blisters blisters also form hands feet result tissue damage incurred sometimes skin blister comes contact cosmetic detergent solvent chemical nickel sulfate balsam urushiol poison ivy poison oak poison known contact dermatitis blisters also develop result allergic reaction insect bite sting chemical warfare agents known blister agents vesicants cause large painful blisters wherever contact skin example mustard gas blood blister usually forms minute blood vessel close surface skin ruptures breaks blood leaks tear layers skin happen skin crushed pinched aggressively squeezed also number medical conditions cause blisters common chickenpox herpes impetigo form eczema called dyshidrosis much rarer conditions cause blisters include touching poison ivy also cause blisters friction blisters caused excess shear stress bottom surface skin body strata skin around stratum spinosum susceptible shear stratum spinosum tears away connecting tissues plasma cells diffuses plasma solution helps new cells divide grow new connective tissues epidermal layers clear fluid reabsorbed new cells develop swollen appearance subside painful blisters located hands palmar surface feet plantar surface due tissue shearing deeper epidermis near nerve endings lower tissues susceptible infection friction blisters caused rubbing skin prevented reducing friction level blisters accomplished variety ways blisters feet prevented wearing comfortable wellfitting shoes clean socks inherently illfitting stiffer shoes high heels dress shoes present larger risk blistering blisters likely develop skin moist socks manage moisture frequent sock changes aid particularly sweaty feet exercising playing sports special sports socks help keep feet drier reduce chance going long walk also important ensure shoes hiking boots properly broken even hot irritated area foot felt taping protective layer padding frictionreducing interface affected area footwear prevent formation bandages moleskin tapes generally must applied foot daily high coefficient friction cof frictionmanagement patch applied shoe remain place much longer throughout many changes socks insoles type intervention may used footwear worn daily specialty shoes boots like hockey skates ice skates inline skates ski boots cleats even orthotic braces splints periods sustained use hiking trail running especially water ingress moisture build shoe boot occur moisture wicking liner socks provide required friction protection avoid friction blisters hands gloves worn using tools shovel pickaxe manual work gardening using sports equipment like golf clubs baseball bats oars used competitive rowing known causing frequent blisters hands oarsmen weightlifters also prone blisters gymnasts friction developed rubbing bars reduce occurrence one tape hands also number products market claim reduce occurrence blisters intended worn liner underneath glove majority offerings simply add padding create layer reduces coefficient friction skin glove lubricant typically talcum powder used reduce friction skin apparel short term people put talcum powder inside gloves shoes purpose although type lubricant actually increase friction long term absorbs moisture increased friction makes blisters likely sunscreen protective clothing also used hottest part day avoid blisters sunburn avoiding sunlight midday best way avoid blisters sunburn protective gloves worn handling detergents cleaning products solvents chemicals httpsenwikipediaorgwikiblister
