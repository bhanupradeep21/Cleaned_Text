influence fertility felt generations even without changing dnacitation needed posttesticular factors decrease male fertility due conditions affect male genital system testicular sperm production include defects genital tract well problems ejaculationcitation needed diagnosis infertility begins medical history physical exam physician physician assistant nurse practitioner typically two separate semen analyses required provider may order blood tests look hormone imbalances medical conditions genetic issuescitation needed history include prior testicular penile insults torsion
