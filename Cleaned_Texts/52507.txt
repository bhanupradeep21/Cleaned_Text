henry quastler november july austrian physician radiologist became pioneer field information theory applied biology emigrating work sidney dancoff led publication commonly called dancoffs law quastler spent early career vienna doctor received medical degree vienna focusing histology radiology met wife gertrude quastler milliner came treatment tuberculosis married couple moved albania king zog asked quastler train radiologists also worked malaria quastlers malaria expertise earned place international health board world war ii approached couple left albania traveled america within year quastler working radiologist new rochelle hospital new york quastlers relocated urbana illinois henry employed chief radiologist carle hospital illinois gertrude quastler studied art soon became noted artist henry also painted amateur according sister johanna couple sometimes exhibited quastler gave medical practice concentrate science heinz von foerster knew quastler well said became even interested radiation invention atomic bomb considered horrifying human catastrophe foerster recalled quastler pondering quastler asked working person find damage done radiation atomic research question thus started conduct experiments radiation damage living henry quastler learned basic concepts formalisms information theory speed almost unbelievable needed instrument quastler met dancoff collaborated develop information theory biology interested problem define information content gene dancoffs death quastler organized symposium information theory biology founded quastler soon became interested information theory could used understand origin life edited information theory edited another collection essays information theory psychology problems methods year helped organize symposium information theory biology gatlinburg tennessee two years later resulted eponymous despite best efforts wifes tuberculosis slowly worsened deterioration wifes health led quastler take job brookhaven national laboratory new york continued work radiation information wife died quastler devastated took overdose pills laid beside held hand died richard diebenkorn later said neither wife think couple encountered heinz von foerster said quastler exceptionally conscientious ethically morally conscious human foersters words quastler dancoff attempted answer following problem many bits go informational content produces bits language information relationship quantity diversity complexity system create give rise quantity diversity complexity according lily e kay quastler dancoff created first technical application weinershannon theory quastler dancoff proposed replication errors inevitable biological reproduction must held check statistical process functioned checking device within gene quastler compared system checks balances american proposition known dancoffs law emerged work nonmathematical statement law greatest growth occurs greatest number mistakes made consistent quastlers book emergence biological organization published posthumously harold j morowitz described remarkably prescient book surprisingly contemporary outlook quastler pioneers theory emergence developing model series emergences probionts work based lectures given quastler spring term visiting professor theoretical biology yale university lectures quastler argued formation singlestranded polynucleotides well within limits probability could occurred prebiologic period earth however noted polymerization singlestranded polymer mononucleotides slow hydrolysis fast therefore closed system consisting mononucleotides singlestranded polymers small fraction available molecules polymerized however singlestranded polymer may form doublestranded one complementary polymerization using singlestranded polynucleotide template process relatively fast resulting doublestranded polynucleotide much stable single singlestranded one since monomer bound along sugar phosphate backbone also interstrand bonding bases capability selfreplication fundamental feature life emerged doublestranded polynucleotides disassociated singlestranded ones served template synthesis complementary strand producing two doublestranded copies system mutable since random changes individual bases may occur propagated individual replicators different nucleotide sequences may also compete nucleotide precursors mutations influence folding state polynucleotides may affect ratio association strands dissociation thus ability replicate folding state would also affect stability molecule ideas developed speculate emergence genetic information protein synthesis general features life lily e kay says quastlers works illuminating example well reasoned epistemic quest curious disciplinary failure quastlers aspiration create information based biology innovative work plagued problems outdated data unwarranted assumptions dubious numerology importantly inability generate experimental agenda
