astrocytoma type brain tumor astrocytomas also astrocytomata originate specific kind starshaped glial cell cerebrum called astrocyte type tumor usually spread outside brain spinal cord usually affect organs glioblastomas astrocytomas second common glioma occur parts brain occasionally spinal within astrocytomas two broad classes recognized literature people develop astrocytomas age lowgrade type often found children young adults highgrade type prevalent adults astrocytomas base brain common young people account roughly neuroepithelial astrocytoma causes regional effects compression invasion destruction brain parenchyma arterial venous hypoxia competition nutrients release metabolic end products eg free radicals altered electrolytes neurotransmitters release recruitment cellular mediators eg cytokines disrupt normal parenchymal secondary clinical sequelae may caused elevated intracranial pressure attributable direct mass effect increased blood volume increased cerebrospinal fluid

matter particular pilocytic astrocytomas commonly indolent bodies may permit normal neurologic function however left unattended tumors may eventually undergo neoplastic transformation date complete resection highgrade astrocytomas impossible diffuse infiltration tumor cells normal parenchyma thus highgrade astrocytomas inevitably recur initial surgery therapy usually treated similarly initial
