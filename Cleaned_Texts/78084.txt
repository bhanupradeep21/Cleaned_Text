rhizobia diazotrophic bacteria fix nitrogen becoming established inside root nodules legumes fabaceae express genes nitrogen fixation rhizobia require plant host independently fix general gram negative motile nonsporulating rods rhizobia group soil bacteria infect roots legumes form root rhizobia found soil infection produce nodules legume fix nitrogen gas atmosphere turning readily useful form nitrogen nitrogen exported nodules used growth legume legume dies nodule breaks releases rhizobia back soil live individually reinfect new legume first known species rhizobia rhizobium leguminosarum identified species initially placed rhizobium genus research done crop forage legumes clover alfalfa beans peas soybeans research done north american legumescitation needed rhizobia paraphyletic group fall two classes alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria shown belong order hyphomicrobiales several rhizobia occur distinct bacterial orders alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria groups include variety nonsymbiotic bacteria instance plant pathogen agrobacterium closer relative rhizobium bradyrhizobium nodulate although much nitrogen removed proteinrich grain hay harvested significant amounts remain soil future crops especially important nitrogen fertilizer used organic rotation schemes lessindustrialized nitrogen commonly deficient nutrient many soils around world commonly supplied plant nutrient supply nitrogen fertilizers severe environmental concerns specific strains rhizobia required make functional nodules roots able fix specific rhizobia present beneficial legume fixation increase crop inoculation rhizobia tends increase legume inoculation agriculture practice many years continuously improved million hectares soybeans inoculated annually technology produce inoculants microbial fermenters ideal inoculant includes following aspects maximum efficacy ease use compatibility high rhizobial concentration long shelflife usefulness varying field conditions inoculants may foster success legume result nodulation process harvest crop higher levels soil nitrate used next crop rhizobia unique nitrogenfixing bacteria living symbiotic relationship legumes common crop forage legumes peas beans clover soy symbiosis classic example supply ammonia amino acids plant return receive organic acids mainly malate succinate dicarboxylic acids carbon energy source however several unrelated strains infect individual plant classic tragedy commons scenario presents cheater strains may hoard plant resources polyhydroxybutyrate benefit reproduction without fixing appreciable amount given costs involved nodulation opportunity rhizobia cheat may surprising symbiosis exist formation symbiotic relationship involves signal exchange partners leads mutual recognition development symbiotic structures well understood mechanism establishment symbiosis intracellular infection rhizobia free living soil able sense flavonoids derivatives secreted roots host plant triggering accumulation large population cells eventually attachment root flavonoids promote dna binding activity nodd belongs lysr family transcriptional regulators triggers secretion nod factors bacteria entered root nod factors trigger series complex developmental changes inside root hair beginning root hair curling followed formation infection thread cellulose lined tube bacteria use travel root hair root bacteria infect several adjacent root cells followed continuous cell proliferation resulting formation root second mechanism used especially rhizobia infect aquatic hosts called crack entry case root hair deformation observed instead bacteria penetrate cells cracks produced lateral root inside nodule bacteria differentiate morphologically bacteroids fix atmospheric nitrogen ammonium using enzyme nitrogenase ammonium converted amino acids like glutamine asparagine exported return plant supplies bacteria carbohydrates form organic plant also provides bacteroid oxygen cellular respiration tightly bound leghaemoglobins plant proteins similar human hemoglobins process keeps nodule oxygen poor order prevent inhibition nitrogenase recently bradyrhizobium strain discovered form nodules aeschynomene without producing nod factors suggesting existence alternative communication signals nod factors possibly involving secretion plant hormone observed root nodules formed spontaneously medicago without presence implies development nodule controlled entirely plant simply triggered secretion nod factors two main hypotheses mechanism maintains legumerhizobium symbiosis though may occur nature sanctions hypothesis theorizes legumes recognize parasitic less nitrogen fixing rhizobia must counter parasitism postinfection legume sanctions response underperforming rhizobia legume hosts respond imposing sanctions varying severity sanctions include limited reduction nodule growth early nodule death decreased carbon supply nodules reduced oxygen supply nodules fix less nitrogen within nodule bacteria differentiate nitrogen fixing bacteroids found unable therefore development symbiotic relationship host sanctions hypothesis correct host sanctions must act toward whole nodules rather individual bacteria individual targeting sanctions would prevent reproducing rhizobia proliferating time ability reinforce mutual relationship host sanctions pushes relationship toward mutualism rather parasitism likely contributing factor symbiosis exists however studies found evidence plant partner choice hypothesis proposes plant uses prenodulation signals rhizobia decide whether allow nodulation chooses noncheating rhizobia evidence sanctions soybean plants reduce rhizobium reproduction perhaps limiting oxygen supply nodules fix less likewise wild lupine plants allocate fewer resources nodules containing lessbeneficial rhizobia limiting rhizobial reproduction consistent definition sanctions although called partner choice authors studies support partner choice mechanisms doubt contribute significantly maintaining rhizobial cooperation fully explain persistence mutualism partner choice hypothesis exclusive host sanctions hypothesis apparent prevalent symbiotic symbiosis nitrogen fixing rhizobia legume family emerged evolved past million although evolution tends swing toward one species taking advantage another form noncooperation selfishgene model management symbiosis allows continuation relative fitness species increased natural selection favor symbiosis understand evolutionary history symbiosis helpful compare rhizobialegume symbiosis ancient symbiotic relationship endomycorrhizae fungi land plants dates back almost million years endomycorrhizal symbiosis provide many insights rhizobia

plant proceeds induce variety intracellular responses prepare likely rhizobia coopted features already place endomycorrhizal symbiosis many shared similar genes involved two processes example plant recognition gene symrk symbiosis receptorlike kinase involved perception rhizobial nod factors well endomycorrhizal shared similar processes would greatly facilitated evolution rhizobial symbiosis symbiotic mechanisms would needed develop instead rhizobia simply needed evolve mechanisms take advantage symbiotic signaling processes already place endomycorrhizal symbiosis many species bacteria able fix nitrogen diazotrophs able associate intimately plants colonize specific structures like legume nodules bacteria associate plants include actinomycete frankia form symbiotic root nodules actinorhizal plants although bacteria much broader host range implying association less specific additionally several cyanobacteria like nostoc associated aquatic ferns cycas gunneras although form additionally loosely associated plant bacteria termed endophytes reported fix nitrogen bacteria colonize intercellular spaces leaves stems roots plants form specialized structures like rhizobia
