cataplexy sudden transient episode muscle weakness accompanied full conscious awareness typically triggered emotions laughing crying cataplexy affects approximately people caused autoimmune destruction hypothalamic neurons produce neuropeptide hypocretin also called orexin regulates arousal role stabilization transition wake sleep cataplexy without narcolepsy rare cause unknown term cataplexy originates greek κατά kata meaning πλῆξις plēxis meaning first used around german physiology literature describe phenomenon tonic immobility also known playing possum reference opossums behavior feigning death year french neuropsychiatrist jeanbaptiste gélineau coined term narcolepsy published clinical reports contain details two patients similar condition narcoleptic cases nevertheless onset reported adulthood compared nowadays cases reported childhood even preferred term astasia instead cataplexy case described remained iconic full narcoleptic cataplexy manifests muscular weakness may range barely perceptible slackening facial muscles complete muscle paralysis postural attacks brief lasting seconds couple minutes typically involve dropping jaw neck weakness andor buckling knees even fullblown collapse people usually able avoid injury learn notice feeling cataplectic attack approaching fall usually slow speech may slurred vision may impaired double vision inability focus hearing awareness remain normalcitation needed cataplexy attacks selflimiting resolve without need medical intervention person reclining comfortably may transition sleepiness hypnagogic hallucinations period rem sleep cataplexy worsens fatigue different narcoleptic sleep attacks usually always triggered strong emotional reactions laughter anger surprise awe embarrassment

secondary cataplexy associated specific lesions located primarily lateral posterior hypothalamus cataplexy due brainstem lesions uncommon particularly seen isolation lesions include tumors brain brainstem arteriovenous malformations tumors include astrocytoma glioblastoma glioma subependymoma lesions visualized brain imaging however early stages missed conditions cataplexy seen include ischemic events multiple sclerosis head injury paraneoplastic syndromes infections encephalitis rarely niemann pick disease cataplexy may also occur transiently permanently due lesions hypothalamus
