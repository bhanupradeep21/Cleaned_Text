procainamide pca medication antiarrhythmic class used treatment cardiac arrhythmias sodium channel blocker cardiomyocytes thus classified vaughan williams classification system class ia addition blocking ina current inhibits ikr rectifier k procainamide also known induce voltagedependent open channel block batrachotoxin btxactivated sodium channels procainamide used treating ventricular arrhythmias ventricular ectopy tachycardia supraventricular arrhythmias atrial fibrillation reentrant automatic supraventricular example used convert newonset atrial fibrillation although initially thought suboptimal purpose growing body literature amounting support exact administered mouth intramuscular injection also used chromatography resin somewhat binds many side effects following induction procainamide adverse effects ventricular dysrhythmia bradycardia hypotension shock adverse effects occur even often daily doses increased procainamide may also lead drug fever allergic responses also chance druginduced lupus erythematosus occurs time leads arthralgia myalgia pleurisy side effects may occur due acetylation close line plasma concentrations therapeutic toxic effect therefore high risk many symptoms resemble systemic lupus erythematosus procainamide reactivates hydroxylamine nitroso metabolites bind histone proteins toxic lymphocytes hydroxylamine nitroso metabolites also toxic bone marrow cells cause agranulocytosis metabolites formed due activation polymorphonuclear leukocytes leukocytes release myeloperoxidase hydrogen peroxide oxidize primary aromatic amine procainamide form procainamide hydroxylamine release hydrogen peroxide also called respiratory burst occurs procainamide monocytes lymphocytes furthermore metabolites formed activated neutrophils metabolites could bind cell membranes cause release autoantibodies would react procainamide hydroxylamine cytotoxicity hindering response lymphocytes tcell bcell mitogens hydroxylamine also generate methemoglobin protein could hinder oxygen also detected antiarrhythmic drug procainamide interferes pacemakers toxic level procainamide leads decrease ventricular conduction velocity increase ventricular refractory period results disturbance artificial membrane potential leads supraventricular tachycardia induces failure pacemaker thus prolongs qt interval action potential increases risk torsade de procainamide could initiate leukopenia andor agranulocytosis serious hematologic disorders also known causing gastrointestinal disturbances aggravating preexisting abnormalities impulse initiation procainamide works antiarrhythmic agent used treat cardiac arrhythmia induces rapid block batrachotoxin btxactivated sodium channels heart muscle acts antagonist longgating closures block voltagedependent occur sides either intracellular extracellular side blocking extracellular side weaker intracellular side occurs via hydrophobic pathway procainamide present charged form probably requires direct hydrophobic access binding site blocking channel furthermore blocking channel shows decreased voltage sensitivity may result loss voltage dependence blocking rate due charged hydrophilic form procainamide effect internal side causes blockage voltagedependent open channels increasing concentration procainamide frequency long blockage becomes less without duration blockage affected rate fast blocking determined membrane depolarization membrane depolarization leads increased blocking decreased unblocking channels procainamide slows conduction velocity increases refractory period maximal rate depolarization procainamide metabolized via different pathways common one acetylation procainamide lesstoxic rate acetylation genetically determined two phenotypes result acetylation process namely slow rapid acetylator procainamide also oxidized cytochrome reactive oxide metabolite seems acetylation nitrogen group procainamide decrease amount chemical would available oxidative metabolites procainamide include desethylnacetylprocainamide desethylprocainamide paminobenzoic acid excreted via urine acid well nacetylprocainamidenoxide acid also metabolites also known amino substituent attached paraposition arene substitution patterns benzene ring synthetic organic compound chemical formula procainamide structurally similar procaine place ester group procainamide contains amide group substitution reason procainamide exhibits longer halflife time procainamide belongs aminobenzamides aromatic carboxylic acid derivatives consisting amide benzamide moiety triethylamine attached amide certain lines paraamino group might become target site attach paraphernalia eg ref us patent procainamide approved us fda june brand name launched bristolmyers squibb due loss indonesia world war ii source cinchona alkaloids precursor quinidine reduced led research new antiarrhythmic drug result procaine discovered similar cardiac effects found mautz applying directly myocardium ventricular threshold electrical stimulation mechanism responsible antiarrhythmic effect however due short duration action caused rapid enzymatic hydrolysis therapeutic applications addition procaine also caused tremors respiratory adverse features stimulated search alternative procaine studies done various congeners metabolites ultimately led discovery
