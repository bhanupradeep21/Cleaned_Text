mouth injection comes mycophenolate sodium mycophenolate common side effects include nausea infections serious side effects include increased risk cancer progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy anemia gastrointestinal use pregnancy may harm works blocking inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase impdh needed lymphocytes make mycophenolic acid initially discovered italian bartolomeo gosio rediscovered approved medical use united states following discovery immunosuppressive properties available generic commonly prescribed medication united states thousand mycophenolate used prevention organ transplant rejection mycophenolate mofetil indicated prevention organ transplant rejection adults kidney transplantation rejection children years whereas mycophenolate sodium indicated prevention kidney transplant rejection adults mycophenolate sodium also used prevention rejection liver heart lung transplants children older two mycophenolate increasingly utilized steroid sparing treatment autoimmune diseases similar immunemediated disorders including beh√ßets disease pemphigus vulgaris immunoglobulin nephropathy small vessel vasculitides also used retroperitoneal fibrosis along number specifically also used psoriasis treatable increasing application treating lupus nephritis demonstrated frequent complete response less frequent compared cyclophosphamide bolus therapy

firstline induction therapy treatment lupus nephritis people without kidney compared azathioprine higher incidence diarrhea difference risk side effects transplant mycophenolic acid times expensive common adverse drug reactions people include diarrhea nausea vomiting joint pain infections leukopenia anemia reflect immunosuppressive myelosuppressive nature drug mycophenolate sodium also commonly associated fatigue headache cough andor breathing issues intravenous iv administration mycophenolate mofetil also commonly associated thrombophlebitis thrombosis infrequent adverse effects people

organ transplantation conceived idea molecule could block enzyme discovered would become immunosuppressive drug could used autoimmune diseases organ transplantation decided go drug discovery
