positive illusions unrealistically favorable attitudes people towards people close positive illusions form selfdeception selfenhancement feel good maintain selfesteem avoid discomfort least short term three general forms inflated assessment ones abilities unrealistic optimism future illusion term positive illusions originates paper taylor taylor browns model mental health maintains certain positive illusions highly prevalent normal thought predictive criteria traditionally associated mental controversies extent people reliably demonstrate positive illusions well whether illusions beneficial people aboveaverage effect people regard positively regard others less negatively others regard positive attributes judged descriptive average person whereas negative ones judged less descriptive average despite fact statistically impossible people superior peers rather equally aware ones strengths weaknesses people aware strengths aware weaknesses effect widely recognized across including different abilities leadership teaching ethics general health effect also evident memory people also tend perceive ability remember better actually illusion control exaggerated assessment individuals personal control environmental circumstances roll dice flip optimism bias tendency people overestimate likelihood experiencing wide variety pleasant events enjoying first job gifted child somewhat underestimate risk succumbing negative events getting divorced falling victim chronic disease illusory nature optimism also evident peoples underestimation time taken variety like many forms human perception selfperception prone illusion positive illusions commonly understood one apparent effects selfenhancement desire maximize positivity ones function boosting selfesteem might due desire see oneself favorably relative ones kinds selfserving attributions seemed displayed positive selfviewers fact negativeviewers found display opposite research suggests may genetic contributions ability developing positive early environment also plays important role people able develop positive beliefs nurturing environments harsh alternative explanations involve dimensions like easiness commonness tasks addition tasks shifted attention self comparative target would stop people overly cultural prevalence also significant role positive illusions although easy document positive illusions individualistic western cultures people collectivist east asian cultures much less likely selfenhance indeed often selfeffacing studies find people tend inflated views research indicates relationship peoples selfevaluations objective assessments relatively weak one explanation people mild positive however according recent studies evidence significant individual differences strength positive illusions people therefore people may extremely inflated selfviews mild little examined across population effect appears positive illusions advantages disadvantages individual controversy whether evolutionarily illusions may direct health benefits helping person cope stress promoting work towards hand unrealistically positive expectations may prevent people taking sensible preventive action medical research provided evidence people positive illusions may short term benefits long term costs specifically selfenhancement correlated academic success graduation rates taylor browns social psychological model mental health assumed positive beliefs would tied psychological wellbeing positive selfevaluations even unrealistic would promote good mental health reference wellbeing means ability feel good oneself creative andor productive ones work form satisfying relationships people effectively combat stress positive illusions particularly useful helping people get major stressful events traumas lifethreatening illnesses serious accidents people able develop maintain positive beliefs face potential setbacks tend cope successfully show less psychological distress less able example psychological research shows cancer survivors often report higher quality life people never cancer could physiologically protective able use traumatic experience evoke increased sense meaning relates concept psychological resilience individuals ability cope challenges stress selfenhancing found correlated resilience face tragedy among participants either near people also hold positive illusions beliefs often enhance productivity persistence tasks might otherwise give people believe achieve difficult goal expectation often creates sense energy excitement resulting progress would otherwise case positive illusions argued adaptive enable people feel hopeful face uncontrollable addition seems relationship illusions positive mood studies found direction relationship positive illusions cause positive mood however recent findings found forms illusion positive associated depressive various studies reject link positive illusions mental health wellbeing life satisfaction maintaining accurate perception reality compatible studying link selfesteem positive illusions compton identified group possessed high selfesteem without positive illusions individuals werent depressed neurotic psychotic maladjusted personality disordered thus concluding positive illusions arent necessary high selfesteem compared group positive illusions high selfesteem nonillusional group high selfesteem higher selfcriticism personality integration lower metaanalysis studies including subjects found slightly studies supported idea depressive realism studies poorer quality used nonclinical samples readily generalized used selfreports instead interviews used attentional bias judgment contingency method measuring depressive realism methods recall feedback evaluation performance showed results counter depressive another recent metaanalysis supports taylor browns central claim results indicate different forms selfenhancement positively linked personal adjustment high subjective wellbeing low depressiveness selfenhancement linked selfratings personal adjustment also adjustment ratings made informants including clinical experts furthermore selfenhancement also longitudinal predictor personal apart better psychological adjustment active ability develop sustain positive beliefs face setbacks health benefits research men hiv virus already diagnosed aids shown hold unrealistically positive assessments abilities control health conditions take longer develop symptoms experience slower course illness well positive cognitive outcomes acceptance several potential risks may arise people hold positive illusions personal qualities likely outcomes first might set unpleasant surprises illprepared overly optimistic beliefs disconfirmed may also tackle consequences thereafter however research suggests part adverse outcomes occur peoples beliefs realistic times realism serves particularly well example initially making plans accountability likely following negative feedback environment following setback failure still lost peoples overly positive beliefs may used new second risk people hold positive illusions set goals undertake courses actions likely produce failure success concern appears largely without basis research shows people deliberating future courses actions whether take particular job go graduate school perceptions fairly realistic become overly optimistic turn implementing plans although guarantee ones realistic prediction would turn shift realism optimism may provide fuel needed bring potentially difficult tasks conception third risk positive selfperceptions may social costs specific source evidence selfserving pattern ability assessment examined use idiosyncratic definitions traits authors suggested social costs occur ones definition ability perceived one relevant achievement outcomes words wherever people fail recognise plausible definitions ability relevant success estimates future wellbeing overstated fourth risk may harmful realize ones actual competence match illusions harmful ego result actually performing worse situations although positive illusions may shortterm benefits come longterm costs positive illusions linked decreasing levels selfesteem wellbeing well narcissism lower academic achievement among although academic attention focused positive illusions systematic negative illusions revealed slightly different example college students rate likely average live believe less likely average live people regard average easy tasks riding bicycle average difficult tasks like riding moore named latter effect worsethanaverage general people overestimate relative standing absolute standing high underestimate absolute standing depressive realism suggests depressed people actually realistic view world mentally healthy people nature depression seems role diminishing positive illusions example individuals low selfesteem slightly depressed balanced likewise mildly depressed individuals found less vulnerable overestimations control assess future circumstances biased however findings may depressed people fewer illusions people depressed studies dykman et al show depressed people believe control situations actually perspection accurate overall might also pessimistic bias depressives results depressive realism example measuring estimation control none proposed allan et al also msetfi et al msetfi et al found replicating alloy abramsons findingswhich overestimation control nondepressed people showed interval long enough implying take aspects situation account depressed counterparts two hypotheses stated literature regard avoiding drawbacks positive illusions firstly minimising illusions order take full advantage secondly making important according
