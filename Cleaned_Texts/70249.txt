sperm competition form postcopulatory sexual whereby male ejaculates simultaneously physically compete fertilize single sperm competition occurs sperm two rival males make attempt fertilize female within sufficiently short period results primarily consequence polyandrous mating systems due extrapair copulations females increases chance cuckoldry male mate raises child genetically related sperm competition among males resulted numerous physiological psychological adaptations including relative size testes size sperm midpiece prudent sperm allocation behaviors relating sexual however without consequences production large amounts sperm therefore researchers predicted males produce larger amounts semen perceived known increase sperm competition sperm competition exclusive humans studied extensively well throughout much animal differing rates sperm competition among primates indicates sperm competition highest primates multimale breeding systems lowest primates singlemale breeding compared animals primates particular humans show lowtointermediate levels sperm competition suggesting humans history little selection pressure sperm physiological evidence including testis size relative body weight volume sperm ejaculations suggests humans experienced lowtointermediate level selection pressure sperm competition evolutionary nevertheless large body research explores

relates actual perceived risk sperm competition situations risk sperm competition higher males allocate energy producing higher ejaculate studies found volume sperm vary sperm produced copulatory ejaculations higher quality younger motile etc sperm produced masturbatory ejaculates nocturnal suggests least within males evidence allocation higher quality sperm production copulatory purposes researchers suggested males produce higher quality sperm spending time apart partners implying males responding increased risk sperm although view challenged recent years also possible males may producing larger volumes sperm response actions partners may males produce larger volumes sperm may likely spend time away size sperm midpiece determined part volume mitochondria sperm midpiece size

human males several physiological adaptations evolved response pressures sperm competition size shape addition anatomy male sex organs men several evolved copulatory behaviors proposed displace rival male semen example males higher risk sperm competition defined female partners high reproductive value younger physically attractive engaged frequently semendisplacing behaviors sexual intercourse men lower risk sperm semendisplacing behaviors include deeper quicker thrusts increased duration intercourse increased number men invested relationship lose female partner engaging extrapair led development cuckoldry risk hypothesis states men higher risk sperm competition due female partner infidelity likely sexually coerce partners threatening termination relationship making partners feel obligated sex emotional manipulations partners addition physically forcing partners forensic cases found men rape partners experienced cuckoldry risk prior raping additionally men spend time away partners likely sexually coerce partners also likely report partner attractive well reporting men find attractive addition reporting greater interest engaging intercourse men perceive female partners spend time men also likely report interested copulating sperm competition also proposed influence mens sexual fantasies arousal researchers found much pornography contains scenarios high sperm competition common find pornography depicting one woman multiple men find pornography depicting one man multiple although may confounded fact less expensive hire male pornographic actors female kilgallon simmons documented men produce higher percentage motile sperm ejaculates viewing sexually explicit images two men one woman sperm competition risk viewing sexually explicit images three women likely indicating response active risk sperm unknown whether mens willingness desire perform oral sex female partners oral sex unique proposed serve number purposes relating sperm competition risk researchers proposed oral sex may serve assess reproductive health female fertility increase arousal thereby reducing likelihood extrapair increase arousal male increase semen quality thereby increase likelihood detect presence semen males sperm competition risk also influences males choice female partners men prefer low sperm competition risk possible therefore tend choose shortterm sexual partners sexual relationship women perceived desirable shortterm sexual partners committed relationship also casual sexual partners women committed longterm relationship least desirable following women intermediate risk sperm competition women longterm relationship engage shortterm mating casual sexual partners considered intermediate desirability shortterm sexual high levels sperm competition among great apes generally seen among species polyandrous multimale mating systems lower rates competition seen species monogamous polygynous multifemale mating humans low intermediate
