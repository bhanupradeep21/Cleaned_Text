allergic rhinitis seasonal type called hay fever type inflammation nose occurs immune system overreacts allergens signs symptoms include runny stuffy nose sneezing red itchy watery eyes swelling around fluid nose usually symptom onset often within minutes following allergen exposure affect sleep ability work people may develop symptoms specific times year often result pollen many people allergic rhinitis also asthma allergic conjunctivitis atopic allergic rhinitis typically triggered environmental allergens pollen pet hair dust inherited genetics environmental exposures contribute development growing farm multiple siblings decreases underlying mechanism involves ige antibodies attach allergen subsequently result release inflammatory chemicals histamine mast causes mucous membranes nose eyes throat become inflamed itchy work eject diagnosis typically based combination symptoms skin prick test blood tests allergenspecific ige tests however give false symptoms allergies resemble common cold however often last two weeks despite common name typically include exposure animals early life might reduce risk developing specific several different types medications reduce allergic symptoms including nasal steroids antihistamines diphenhydramine cromolyn sodium leukotriene receptor antagonists oftentimes medications completely control symptoms may also side exposing
