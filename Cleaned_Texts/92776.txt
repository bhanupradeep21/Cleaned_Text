photoaging also known term used characteristic changes skin induced chronic uva uvb tretinoin best studied retinoid treatment deterioration biological functions ability manage metabolic stress one major consequences aging process aging complex progressive process leads functional aesthetic changes skin process result intrinsic ie genetically determined well extrinsic processes ie environmental factors photoaging attributed continuous longterm exposure ultraviolet uv radiation approximately nm either natural synthetic intrinsically aged skin uvb rays primary mutagen penetrate epidermal outermost layer skin resulting dna mutations mutations arise due chemical changes formation cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers photoproducts formed adjacent pyrimidine bases mutations may clinically related specific signs photoaging wrinkling increasing elastin collagen epidermal layer contain blood vessels nerve endings melanocytes basal cells embedded layer upon exposure uvb rays melanocytes produce melanin pigment gives skin color tone however uvb cause formation freckles dark spots symptoms photoaging constant exposure uvb rays signs photoaging might appear precancerous lesions skin cancer may develop uva rays able penetrate deeper skin compared uvb rays hence addition epidermal layer dermal layer also damaged dermis second major layer skin comprises collagen elastin extrafibrillar matrix provides structural support skin however constant uva exposure size dermis layer reduced thereby causing epidermis start drooping body due presence blood vessels dermis uva rays lead dilated broken blood vessels commonly visible nose cheeks uva also damage dna indirectly generation reactive oxygen species ros include superoxide anion peroxide singlet oxygen ros damage cellular dna well lipids proteinscitation needed uv exposure also lead inflammation vasodilation clinically manifested sunburn uv radiation activates transcription factor nfκb first step inflammation nfκb activation results increase proinflammatory cytokines example interleukin vascular endothelial growth factor tumor necrosis factor tnfα attracts neutrophils lead increase oxidative damage generation free radicalscitation needed additionally uv radiation would cause downregulation angiogenesis inhibitor upregulation angiogenesis activator plateletderived endothelial cell growth factor keratinocytes enhance angiogenesis aid growth uvinduced neoplasmscitation needed reported uv radiation leads local systemic immunosuppression due dna damage altered cytokine expression implications cutaneous tumor surveillance langerhans cells may undergo changes quantity morphology function due uv exposure may eventually become depleted one proposed explanation immunosuppression body attempting suppress autoimmune response inflammatory products resulting uv uv exposure would also lead activation receptors epidermal growth factor tnfα keratinocytes fibroblasts activates signaling kinases throughout skin via unknown nuclear transcription factor activator protein controls transcription matrix metalloproteinases mmp expressed activated major metalloproteinases collagen degradation entire process aided presence reactive oxygen species inhibits proteintyrosine phosphatases via oxidation thereby resulting upregulation abovementioned receptors another transcription factor nfκb also activated uv light also increases expression upregulation mmp occur even minimal exposure uv hence exposure uv radiation inadequate cause sunburn thus facilitate degradation skin collagen lead presumably eventual photoaging thus collagen production reduced photoaged skin due process constant degradation collagen mediated mmps addition presence damaged collagen would also downregulate synthesis new collagen impaired spreading attachment fibroblasts onto degraded collagen could one contributing factors inhibition collagen synthesis uv radiation decreases expression retinoic acid receptors retinoid x receptors human skin thereby resulting complete loss induction raresponsive genes also leads increase activity pathway increasing mmp activity thus resulting functional deficiency vitamin skin early symptoms photoaging symptoms photoaging attributed prolonged exposure uv addition symptoms photoaging also result orderly maturation keratinocytes increase cell population dermis abundant hyperplastic elongated collapsed fibroblasts inflammatory infiltrates found photodamage also characterized disorganization collagen fibrils constitute connective tissue accumulation abnormal amorphous elastincontaining material condition known actinic elastosis endogenous defense mechanisms provide protection skin damages induced uv uv exposure would lead increase epidermal thickness could help protect uv damage reported many cases fairer individuals lesser melanin pigment show dermal dna photodamage infiltrating neutrophils keratinocyte activation expression increased mmps uv exposure therefore distribution melanin provides protection sunburn photoaging carcinogenesis absorbing scattering uv rays covering skin lower layers protecting damage dna due exposure uv rays lead expression thereby leading eventual arrest cell cycle allows dna repair mediated endogenous mechanisms like nucleotide excision repair system addition apoptosis occurs damage severe however apoptotic mechanisms decline age neither dna repair mechanism apoptosis occurs cutaneous tumorigenesis may result timps regulate activity mmp many studies shown uv rays would induce skin contains several antioxidants including vitamin e coenzyme ascorbate carotenoids superoxide dismutase catalase glutathione peroxidase antioxidants provide protection reactive oxygen species produced normal cellular metabolism however overexposure uv rays lead significant reduction antioxidant supply thus increasing oxidative stress hence antioxidants essential skins defense mechanism uv radiation photocarcinogenesis treatment intervention photoaging classified unique paradigm based disease prevention primary prevention aims reduce risk factors disease condition occurs sun protection effective form primary prevention photoaging major methods sun protection sunscreen products sun protective clothing reducing exposure sun especially peak sun hours spring summer seasons broadspectrum sunscreen products provide optimal coverage protection uv damage protect types uva rays along uvb rays proper application methods timing important factors proper sunscreen use includes using proper quantity sunscreen applying sunscreen prior sun exposure consistent reapplication especially exposure water secondary protection refers early detection disease potentially still asymptomatic allow positive interference prevent delay attenuate symptomatic clinical condition includes following retinoids eg tretinoin antioxidants eg topical vitamin c oral supplements lipoic acid estrogens growth factors cytokines various forms topical retinoids tretinoin retinoid widely considered efficacious treatment photoaging dermatologists due consistent evidence several randomized clinical trials retinoids vitamin derivatives bind retinoic acid receptors rars retinoid x receptors rxrs binding receptors induces cascade cellular processes ultimately lead increased collagen production epidermal thickening reducing appearance skin sagging wrinkling tretinoin also efficacious treatment acne adapalene tazarotene also thirdgeneration synthetic retinoids used treatment acne adapalene widely studied proven use photoaging however used offlabel purpose tazarotene proven efficacious treatment photoaging retinoid derivatives known retinol retinal often used counter cosmeceutical products antiaging purposes form retinol retinal metabolized skin retinoic acid act rars products considered cosmeceuticals rather drugs due lack regulation widely studied furthermore tretinoin well studied consistent efficacy treatment lastly tertiary prevention treatment existing symptomatic disease process ameliorate effects delay progress tertiary prevention includes use chemical peels resurfacing techniques eg microdermabrasion ablative nonablative laser resurfacing radiofrequency technology soft tissue augmentation also known botulinum toxins photorejuvenation procedures performed dermatologists reduce visible symptoms treatment modalities primary concerns address example botulinum injections paralyze facial muscles prevents muscle contraction subsequent wrinkle injectable fillers often used nasolabial fold increase volume minimize appearance sagging wrinkling httpsenwikipediaorgwikidermatoheliosis
