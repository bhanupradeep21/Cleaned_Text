induced ovulation female animal ovulates due externallyderived stimulus prior mating rather ovulating cyclically spontaneously stimuli causing induced ovulation include physical act coitus mechanical stimulation simulating sperm pheromones ovulation occurs ovary surface described process oocyte female germ cell released follicle ovulation nondeleterious inflammatory response initiated luteinizing hormone lh mechanism ovulation varies species humans ovulation process occurs around day menstrual cycle also referred cyclical spontaneous ovulation however monthly menstruation process typically linked humans animal species ovulate various mechanisms spontaneous ovulation ovulatory process maturing ovarian follicles secrete ovarian steroids generate pulsatile gnrh neuropeptide controls vertebrate reproductive function release median eminence area connects hypothalamus anterior pituitary gland ultimately cause preovulatory lh surge spontaneously ovulating species go menstrual cycles fertile certain times based part cycle species females spontaneous ovulators include rats mice guinea pigs horse pigs sheep monkeys induced ovulation process preovulatory lh surge therefore ovulation induced component coitus eg receipt genital stimulation usually spontaneous steroidinduced lh surges observed induced ovulator species throughout reproductive cycles indicates gnrh release absent reduced due lack positive feedback action steroid hormones however contradiction spontaneously ovulating species occasionally undergo matinginduced preovulatory lh surges species females induced ovulators include cats rabbits ferrets chen et al used bactrian camels investigate factors induce ovulation breeding season monitored camel ovaries ovulation rectal palpation following insemination semen samples chen et al concluded particular camel species ovulation induced seminal plasma although evolution two types ovulation well understood type ovulation would advantageous species understood looking social groups animals large complex social groups benefit spontaneous ovulation best males get breed females males suitable breeding makes sense spread times females fertile therefore increasing proportion conception explain evolution ovulation species however example species appear show estrus synchronisation spontaneous ovulators estrogen progesterone secreted follicles grow

voles ferrets species ferret duration intromission effect lh surge whereas species cat related higher levels lh produced mating multiple times many species lh surge occur little intromission required pathways information reaches brain causes gnrh release understood well however midbrain brainstem noradrenergic neurones appear activated response intromission mating neurones go stimulate mediobasal

rabbit ferret locus coereuleus part brain involved conveying genitalsomatosensory information gnrh substances similar effects include neuropeptide many species found induced ovulators reasons always clear however one possible reason induced ovulation could provide better reproductive potential species typically shorter life spans less encounters resulting lower mating opportunities throughout species may facultativelyinduced ovulators meaning spontaneously ovulate cycle may speed slow depending presence males females rodents molerats known induced ovulators rats east african mole rat

many animals simply presence male koala enough induce ovulation vaginal stimulation sufficient cause induced ovulation cats another widelyknown induced ovulator mating lh levels female cats surge time ovulation predicted occur days wolverines known induced ovulators require physical mating cause induced ovulation occurs various carnivoran including several species many bear species able induced ovulation including grizzly bear black bear polar bear presence male mating requirements induced ovulation however suggestions mating strict requirement ovulation japanese black bears induced ovulators observed females kept separate males ovulate whereas females kept areas male bears mating bears caused elevated progesterone levels seen increased progesterone levels measured bears months followed mating japanese black bears presence male enough cause notable rise progesterone levels even without mating could suggest pheromonalchemosensory factors could also contribute induced ovulation induced ovulation able occur fish species china freshwater fish including variety carp types bream loach able induced ovulate using agonists dopamine induction ovulation drugs able cause predictable ovulation period beneficial farming natural cycle spontaneous ovulation occurs species great demand ovulation induced cattle allows farmers synchronize cattle ovulate time helping improve efficiency dairy induced ovulation utilized warmer seasons increase plasma progesterone improve fertility however ovulation induced cows mature follicles merely initiates lutenization reduce time ovulation number methods used induce ovulation cattle artificial insemination introducing number hormones chorionic gonadotrophin hcg lh well injecting progesterone intravaginal devices called prids progesteronereleasing intravaginal domestic cats often described induced ovulators intromission penis probably causes distension posterior vagina induces release gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh hypothalamus via neuroendocrine reflexes surge luteinising hormone lh occurs within minutes mating multiple matings lh surge greater lasts longer one mating occurs reports ovulation without mating cats spontaneous ovulation occurs cats occurs frequency appears noncopulatory ovulation may possible response variety visual auditory olfactory cues appropriate consider domestic cats induced
