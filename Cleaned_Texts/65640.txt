bayley scales infant toddler development version released september standard series measurements originally developed psychologist nancy bayley used primarily assess development infants toddlers ages measure consists series developmental play tasks takes minutes derives developmental quotient dq rather intelligence quotient raw scores successfully completed items converted scale scores composite scores scores used determine childs performance compared norms taken typically developing children age bayleyiii three main subtests cognitive scale includes items attention familiar unfamiliar objects looking fallen object pretend play language scale taps understanding expression language example recognition objects people following directions naming objects pictures motor scale assesses
