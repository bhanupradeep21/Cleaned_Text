syndrome group mild severe xlinked recessive disorders share common genetic basis spectrum syndrome disorders includes xlinked complicated corpus callosum dysgenesis spastic paraplegia masa syndrome xlinked hydrocephalus stenosis aqueduct sylvius also called syndrome disorders causative gene crash syndrome acronym primary clinical features corpus callosum hypoplasia retardation intellectual disability adducted thumbs spasticity syndrome caused different variants gene provides information allows body produce cell adhesion molecule sometimes called cell adhesion molecule surface protein found surface allows neurons bind one another create synapses connections information passed axons one neuron dendrites cell body result cell adhesion molecule essential structural development brain contributes ability think move develop type severity variant causing syndrome particular person directly related severity symptoms functional impairment cure syndrome prognosis often life expectancy people syndrome vary dramatically depending severity condition dying shortly birth others reaching treatment people syndrome supportive aims improve quality life minimize functional syndrome presents spectrum ranging mild severe genotype phenotype correlation across spectrum meaning specific genetic variant causing disorder patient determines severity syndrome patients truncating lossoffunction variants prevent full synthesis protein experience severe features patients missense variants may result abnormal protein prevent illustrating difference syndrome severity infants born syndrome caused truncating mutation die age years despite provision best available medical comparison roughly infants born syndrome caused missense mutation die age despite presentation continuous spectrum syndrome loosely divided four discrete people diagnosed syndrome often experience issues respect societal roles interactions due severe physical mental disabilities associated disorder issues vary depending symptoms manifest specific individual severity symptoms ultimately determined based individual situated syndrome spectrumcitation needed spasticity one common signs syndrome seen four major clinical phenotypes characterized continuous contraction certain muscles leading muscle stiffness interfere normal movement three major phenotypes except hsas spasticity presented spastic paraplegia muscles lower limbs stiff continuously spastic paraplegia often manifests gait walking motion disorder specifically shuffling gait masa syndrome acts source impairment stress due postural instability leads poor quality life increased aphasia also common disorder especially people masa syndrome disorder syndrome spectrum describes range language impairments respect syntax structure semantics meaning phonology sound morphology structure andor pragmatics language comprehension people aphasia well family members often experience poor quality life due social isolation depression caused language impairment therefore may seek therapy enable functional socially relevant therapy services address aphasia masa syndrome patients include oneonone sessions clinician group therapy even computerbased therapy becoming popular given intellectual disabilities also contribute social difficulties faced people syndrome range mild severe depending persons location syndrome people mild intellectual disability usually iq around average slower developmental areas unusual physical characteristics able blend socially moderate intellectual disability characteristics include able maintain selfcare support travel familiar places community communicate simple ways iq around severe intellectual disability often seen people xlinked hydrocephalus stenosis aqueduct sylvius hsas syndrome spectrum several key characteristics including ability understand speech otherwise limited communication skills ability learn daily routines simple selfcare need direct supervision social settings need family support live supervised home depending severity intellectual disability people syndrome varying levels difficulty adapting social environments may need considerable support others complete daytoday taskscitation needed xlinked hydrocephalus stenosis aqueduct sylvius hsas severe phenotype spectrum predominantly known major feature profound hydrocephalus typically beginning due prenatal onset ie bones skull fused together hydrocephalus associated hsas results progressive macrocephaly abnormal enlargement skull due markedly increased intracranial signs symptoms hydrocephalus vary depending severity age onset however irritability due pain vomiting common amongst infants without treatment congenital hydrocephalus fatal less severe cases untreated hydrocephalus child may progress beyond infancy often experiences nausea vomiting missed developmental milestones physical cognitivesocial diplopia double vision papilledema swelling optic disc progress permanent visual impairment due increased intracranial pressure definitive treatment neurological damage caused hydrocephalus poor neuronal development defects cell adhesion molecule results nearly people hsas experiencing severe intellectual people living hsas also frequently experience condition causing muscles continuously contracted thereby causing stiffness body challenges walking spasticity also known cause difficulty performing activities daily living bathing showering dressing despite hsas frequently considered isolated disorder central nervous system genetic basis also causes musculoskeletal defects result half

patient process requires small amount blood drawn arm using however prenatal genetic testing carries significant risks fetus mother due need remove genetic material fetus still order conduct prenatal genetic testing mother fetus must undergo either amniocentesis surgical puncturing amniotic sac holds fetus womb less frequently chorionic villus amniocentesis provides sample amniotic fluid used screen sequence variants chromosomal whereas samples obtained chorionic villus sampling used detect major chromosomal abnormalities trisomy making chorionic villous sampling less relevant context diagnosing syndrome often caused sequence amniocentesis typically performed weeks pregnancy risk complications mother fetus including miscarriage chorionic villus sampling typically performed weeks pregnancy risk complications including mothers carrying fetus suspected syndrome often elect undergo amniocentesis despite risk rather waiting pursue lowerrisk genetic testing child born prenatal
