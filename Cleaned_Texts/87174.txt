dystonia neurological hyperkinetic movement disorder sustained repetitive muscle contractions result twisting repetitive movements abnormal fixed movements may resemble tremor dystonia often intensified exacerbated physical activity symptoms may progress adjacent disorder may hereditary caused factors birthrelated physical trauma infection poisoning eg lead poisoning reaction pharmaceutical drugs particularly stress treatment must highly customized needs individual may include oral medications chemodenervation botulinum neurotoxin injections physical therapy supportive therapies surgical procedures deep brain stimulation multiple types dystonia many diseases conditions may cause dystonia dystonia classified physicians use classifications guide diagnosis treatment example dystonia musculorum deformans oppenheim flatausterling syndrome also known torsion dystonia idiopathic torsion dystonia old terminology dystonia musculorum deformans common dystonias typically classified follows combination blepharospasmodic contractions oromandibular dystonia called cranial dystonia meiges syndrome segmental dystonias affect two adjoining parts bodycitation needed group called myoclonic dystonia cases hereditary associated missense mutation receptor cases responded well genes associated dystonia include gnal another report linked symptoms vary according kind dystonia involved cases dystonia tends lead abnormal posturing particular movement many individuals condition continuous pain cramping relentless muscle spasms due involuntary muscle movements motor symptoms possible including lip early symptoms may include loss precision muscle coordination sometimes first manifested declining penmanship frequent small injuries hands dropped items cramping pain sustained use trembling significant muscle pain cramping may result minor exertions like holding book turning pages may become difficult find comfortable position arms legs even minor exertions associated holding arms crossed causing significant pain similar restless leg syndrome affected persons may notice trembling diaphragm breathing need place hands pockets legs sitting pillows sleeping keep still reduce pain trembling jaw may felt heard lying constant movement avoid pain may result grinding wearing teeth symptoms similar temporomandibular joint disorder voice may crack frequently become harsh triggering frequent throat clearing swallowing become difficult accompanied painful crampingcitation needed electrical sensors emg inserted affected muscle groups painful provide definitive diagnosis showing pulsating nerve signals transmitted muscles even rest brain appears signal portions fibers within affected muscle groups firing speed hz causing pulsate tremble contort called upon perform intentional activity muscles fatigue quickly portions muscle groups respond causing weakness portions overrespond become rigid causing microtears load symptoms worsen significantly use especially case focal dystonia mirror effect often observed body parts use right hand may cause pain cramping hand well hand legs used stress anxiety lack sleep sustained use cold temperatures worsen symptomscitation

present challenges normal activitiescitation needed cases symptoms may progress plateau years stop progressing entirely progression may delayed treatment adaptive lifestyle changes forced continued use may make symptoms progress rapidly others symptoms may progress total disability making risky forms treatment worth considering cases patients already dystonia subsequent traumatic injury effects
