extensive gosau group yielded variety crocodylomorph remains including holotype mandible piuw various cranial remains mandible described emanuel bunzel crocodilus carcharidens referring additional material crocodilus genus harry govier seeley however cast doubt bunzels designation proposing material instead belonged dinosaur called doratodon coining genus name although name kept later researchers including franz nopcsa charles craig mook would return bunzels classification material type crocodyliform austrian crocodyliform material reviewed french paleontologist éric buffetaut concluded among additional material maxilla parietal bone isolated teeth could assigned doratodon however reasoning elaborated discovery today doratodon changed classification several times times

named truly ziphodont crocodyliform cretaceous europe although ogresuchus also sebecosuchian cretaceous europe lacked serrated due dalla vecchia andrea cau argue isolated remains referred indetermined carcharidens named triangular serrated teeth resemble sharks carcharias ancient greek species name ibericus derived iberian doratodon smallbodied ziphosuchian narrow deep skull much depth formed maxillae among defining features presence antorbital fenestra nares eye premaxilla also shows snout rather tall expected sebecosuchian nares located towards rostrums tip positioned way causes open

premaxillary teeth appears premaxillary toothrow entirely straight shows gentle curvature based known remains maxillary toothrow thought straight without undulating curves seen many modern crocodiles however since maxillary fossils believed located towards back skull possible front closer premaxilla could defined material known doratodon represents lower jaw viewing part skull ibericus side two clearly defined waves seen first abrupt raise reaches apex dentary tooth second raise peaks gently transitioning surangular bone wavelike toothrow however less pronounced carcharidens limited single raise external opening mandibular fenestra closed also seen wanosuchus sides lower jaw features pits inner side mandibular teeth received larger teeth upper overall doratodon possessed small number teeth ibericus carcharidens however buffetaut well rabi sebök argue higher tooth count carcharidens possibly teeth either side lower two species doratodon generally differentiated size variation found among teeth lower jaw type species carcharidens teeth show little variation size dental alveoli generally ranging mm length tooth largest though hypertrophied baurusuchus difference tooth size ibericus developed noticeable species tooth lower jaw also enlarged subsequent teeth initially decreasing size noticeably increasing tooth onward culminating dentary tooth largest lower jaw austrian fossil likely stems adult based heavily ornamented bone surface suggested curvature tooth row may vary animals different ages instead representing difference species regardless another way tell two species apart number diastemas carcharidens single diastema present located tooth lower ibericus hand possesses additional diastema right behind teeth doratodon ziphodont means compressed along sides lined serrated ridge created series small denticles clearly differentiating teeth smooth conical teeth modern shape individual teeth although consistently ziphodont separated morphotypes subtle differences first type relatively weakly compressed almost conical slender noticeable curve crown second morphotype one largest teeth belongs overall similar shape first morphotype however strongly compressed slender twice long wide base less developed curvature fossils assigned two morphotypes show varying degrees serrations reduced denticles towards tip along frontedge tooth however may inherent trait could instead represent teeth worn instances still show faint remains serration third tooth type takes form isosceles triangle curving barely even compressed second morphotype teeth three times longer base wide fourth final morphotype extreme regard showing greatest compression also lowest toothrow based overall form teeth shape tooth sockets thought transition one another along toothrow conical teeth front compressed teeth placed back absence postcranial remains makes difficult estimate size doratodon thought rather small animal two species ibericus appears larger dentary bone estimated reached length mm complete notably larger dentary carcharidens measures mm overall spanish species also appears proportionally besides seeley considered doratodon type dinosaur researchers agree animal represents type nopcsa first draw parallels doratodon notosuchians suggesting might affinities notosuchus interpretation mostly dismissed early mid century favor mooks suggestion goniopholid type neosuchian closely resembles modern crocodiles similarities notosuchians recognized time othmar kühn noted teeth resembled sebecosuchians yet another hypothesis suggested éric buffetaut considered doratodon related asian hsisosuchus hypothesis however refuted wu et al phylogenetic analysis conducted following discovery doratodon ibericus confirmed relationship genus
