dana expeditions four danish research expeditions first two undertaken dana third dana ii funded part carlsberg foundation led johannes schmidt first three expeditions took place fourth final centered around investigating breeding eels first two expeditions allowed schmidt prove theory european eels migrate sargasso sea spawn final expedition traveled indian ocean gathered numerous samples dana undertook series three expeditions led marine biologist johannes schmidt schmidt c f dreschel first proposed expedition would explore deep sea atlantic ocean although two men originally envisioned single large expedition january schmidt suggested instead running two expeditions first focusing atlantic second circumnavigating world course two two decided focus first atlantic began planning purchasing supplies endeavor complicated ongoing first world war schmidts battle bronchitis early gathered bulk necessary supplies schmidt continued emphasize felt attempted circumnavigation worthwhile particularly attention could generate comparable expedition also held potential increase prestige danish marine science dramatically challenger expedition uk efforts convince dreschel refocus planned expedition although continued january agreed first expedition would leave gibraltar march three month upon end first world war november first expedition almost set begin dana completed hn andersens east asiatic company andersen agreed loan schmidt dreschel vessel expedition fund operation three month period launching delayed equipment could purchased reasonable pricesa interim dana used company ship next schmidt dreschel decided executive committee expedition determined would prince valdemar denmark figurehead include representative carlsberg foundation board directors include many prominent expedition announced public summer announcement schmidt rushed execute plans hoped prove theory european eels migrate sargasso sea spawn researchers could beat result large expedition divided two first one could conducted quickly minimal autumn schmidt dreschel came conflict dreschel indicated desire invite member countries international council exploration sea join second expedition schmidt sought keep effort limited denmark threatened abandon effort wasnt nothing came expedition began early england dana left nation march gibraltar schmidt joined boat madeira arrived canary islands april left april arrived sargasso sea within seven days shortly thereafter crew began fishing large amounts european eel larvae searching breeding grounds could ship began leak forced travel charlotte amalie st thomas repairs result failure east asiatic company agreed give schmidt another three months ship waited st thomas month returned sargasso sea june however ship missed season eel eggs hatching caught larvae european eels american eel first expedition ended july bermuda islands dana shortly returned east asiatic company charleston south carolina group returned denmark still retained majority funds raised gotten definitive evidence support claim european eels spawned sargasso second expedition left august similar schmidts third expedition earned reputation first rate marine scientist autumn danish government purchased new research ship marine research great britain transported denmark overhauled renamed rv dana dana ii boat kilometres mi metal wire allowing fish

expedition travel panama canal pacific dana ii took numerous samples revealed pacific ocean cooler less salty atlantic also found oxygen minimum zone around metres ft surface making aboard dana ii first researchers document phenomenon high plankton densities helped expedition observe upwelling deeplevel samples gave image species richness greater atlantic january left pacific stopping lake found large amounts desmid algae returned europe bermuda schmidt published theory breeding expedition found growing fame magazines pottery various expedition discovered numerous new species captured valuable live specimens made several important discoveries reenactment filmed october schmidt embarked fourth dana expedition june returned june official title carlsberg foundations oceanographical
