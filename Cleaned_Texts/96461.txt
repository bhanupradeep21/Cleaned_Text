slowly evolving immunemediated diabetes latent autoimmune diabetes adults lada form diabetes exhibits clinical features similar type diabetes type diabetes sometimes referred type autoimmune form diabetes similar patients lada often show insulin resistance similar share risk factors disease studies shown lada patients certain types antibodies insulinproducing cells cells stop producing insulin slowly lada appears share genetic risk factors genetically distinct within lada patient group genetic phenotypic heterogeneity observed varying degrees insulin resistance knowledge today lada thus described hybrid form showing phenotypic genotypic similarities well variation within lada regarding degree autoimmunity insulin resistance concept lada first introduced though expert committee diagnosis classification diabetes mellitus recognize term instead including standard definition diabetes mellitus type symptoms latent autoimmune diabetes adults similar forms diabetes polydipsia excessive thirst drinking polyuria excessive urination often blurred compared juvenile type diabetes symptoms develop comparatively slowly period least six fasting blood sugar level mmol l mgdl used general diagnosis clear guidelines diagnosis lada criteria often used patient develop disease adulthood need insulin treatment first months diagnosis autoantibodies glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody gada islet cell autoantibody ica insulinomaassociated autoantibody zinc transporter autoantibody testing performed order correctly diagnose persons lada typically low although sometimes moderate levels cpeptide disease progresses insulin resistance type diabetes likely high levels cpeptide due production glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies gada islet cell autoantibodies ica insulinomaassociated autoantibodies zinc transporter autoantibodies associated lada gadas commonly found cases diabetes mellitus type presence islet cell complement fixing autoantibodies also aids differential diagnosis lada type diabetes persons lada often test positive ica whereas type diabetics seldom persons lada usually test positive glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies whereas type diabetes antibodies commonly seen adults rather addition useful making early diagnosis type diabetes mellitus gad antibodies tests used differential diagnosis lada type may also used differential diagnosis gestational diabetes risk prediction immediate family members type well tool monitor prognosis clinical progression type diabetes since regular autoantibody screening patients lada risk diagnosed type diabetes makes difficult estimate prevalence globally estimated adults form estimated lada accounts adult diabetes estimates saying could many people diabetes lada limited research lada risk lada depends genetic environmental genetic risk factors lada similar ie affected hla complex also genetic variants associated identified lada several lifestyle risk factors common obesity physical inactivity smoking consumption sweetened beverages linked insulin obesity shown increase risk lada several studies one study showed risk particularly high combination diabetes physical activity also affects risk lada less physical activity increasing swedish study showed low birth weight addition increasing risk increases risk although smoking shown increase risk coffee consumption shown reduce risk results regarding products lada however results two studies based population seem indicate coffee consumption increases risk foods shown increase risk lada sweetened beverages processed red consumption fatty fish shown protective diabetes chronic disease ie cured symptoms complications minimized proper treatment diabetes lead elevated blood sugar levels turn lead damage heart blood vessels kidneys eyes studies treat lada specifically probably due difficulties classifying diagnosing disease lada patients often need insulin treatment immediately diagnosed insulin production decreases slowly patients long run need lada patients initially misdiagnosed type gad antibodies become insulindependent within years according differing lada treatment type diabeteslada exogenous insulin control glucose levels prevent destruction residual beta cells reduce possibility diabetic complications prevent death diabetic ketoacidosis dka although lada may appear initially respond similar treatment lifestyle medications type diabetes halt slow progression beta cell destruction people lada eventually become people lada insulin resistance similar longterm type diabetes studies showed people lada less insulin resistance compared type diabetes however others found cochrane systematic review showed treatment sulphonylurea improve control glucose levels insulin months review actually found evidence treatment sulphonylurea could lead earlier insulin dependence cases requiring insulin studies measured fasting cpeptide intervention influenced concentration insulin maintained concentration better compared authors also examined study utilizing glutamic acid decarboxylase formulated aluminium hydroxide showed improvements cpeptide levels maintained vitamin insulin also demonstrated steady fasting cpeptide levels vitamin group levels declining insulinonly group followup one study examining effects chinese remedies fasting cpeptide followup show difference compared insulin still important highlight studies available included review presented considerable flaws quality although type diabetes identified autoimmune disease since concept latent autoimmune
