stomach muscular hollow organ gastrointestinal tract humans many animals including several invertebrates stomach dilated structure functions vital organ digestive system stomach involved gastric phase digestion following chewing performs chemical breakdown means enzymes hydrochloric acid humans many animals stomach located esophagus small intestine stomach secretes digestive enzymes gastric acid

food enters stomach esophagus via lower esophageal sphincter stomach releases proteases proteindigesting enzymes pepsin hydrochloric acid kills inhibits bacteria provides acidic ph proteases work food churned stomach muscular contractions wall called peristalsis reducing volume bolus looping around body stomach boluses converted chyme partially digested food chyme slowly passes pyloric sphincter duodenum small intestine extraction nutrients begins gastric juice stomach also contains pepsinogen hydrochloric acid activates inactive form enzyme active form pepsin pepsin breaks proteins polypeptides within moments food enters stomach mixing waves begin occur intervals approximately seconds mixing wave unique type peristalsis mixes softens food gastric juices create chyme initial mixing waves relatively gentle followed intense waves starting body stomach increasing force reach pylorus pylorus holds around ml chyme acts filter permitting liquids small food particles pass mostly fully closed pyloric sphincter process called gastric emptying rhythmic mixing waves force ml chyme time pyloric sphincter duodenum release greater amount chyme one time would overwhelm capacity small intestine handle rest chyme pushed back body stomach continues mixing process repeated next mixing waves force chyme duodenum gastric emptying regulated stomach duodenum presence chyme duodenum activates receptors inhibit gastric secretion prevents additional chyme released stomach duodenum ready process fundus stores undigested food gases released process chemical digestion food may sit fundus stomach mixed chyme food fundus digestive activities salivary amylase continue food begins mixing acidic chyme ultimately mixing waves incorporate food chyme acidity inactivates salivary amylase activates lingual lipase lingual lipase begins breaking triglycerides free fatty acids mono diglycerides breakdown protein begins stomach actions hcl enzyme pepsin contents stomach completely emptied duodenum within hours meal eaten different types food take different amounts time process foods heavy carbohydrates empty fastest followed highprotein foods meals high triglyceride content remain stomach longest since enzymes small intestine digest fats slowly food stay stomach hours longer duodenum processing fatty chyme however still fraction hours full digestion typically takes start although absorption human digestive system mainly function small intestine absorption certain small molecules nevertheless occur stomach lining includes parietal cells human stomach responsible
