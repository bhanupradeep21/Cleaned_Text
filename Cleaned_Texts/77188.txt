phytoestrogens exert effects primarily binding estrogen receptors two variants estrogen receptor alpha erα beta erβ many phytoestrogens display somewhat higher affinity erβ compared key structural elements enable phytoestrogens bind high affinity estrogen receptors display estradiollike effects addition interaction ers phytoestrogens may also modulate concentration endogenous estrogens binding
