pharmacologists anaesthesiologists doubts safety efficacy new drug halothane required specialist knowledge technologies safe administration also afforded british anaesthesiologists opportunity remake speciality profession period newly established national health service needed specialist context halothane eventually became popular nonflammable general anesthetic replacing volatile anesthetics
