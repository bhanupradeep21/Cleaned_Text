infections overpowering natural immune responses allowing bacteria rapidly multiply cause harm diagnosis perianal streptococcal dermatitis confirmed successful treatment regimens utilize combination topical systemic oral antibiotics recommended firstline treatment perianal streptococcal perianal streptococcal dermatitis resolve treatment choice oral antibiotics include penicillin v azithromycin clarithromycin clindamycin erythromycin penicillinaseresistant penicillin oral antibiotics work best combination topical antibiotic mupirocin antiseptic due effect perianal streptococcal dermatitis deeper layers skin topical antimicrobial therapy alone appears poorly treatment duration ranges days treatment success determined clinical examination posttreatment swabbing affected area confirm infection longer little data currently exists prevention perianal cellulitis however approximately onethird people cellulitis suffer recurrent episodes proven strategy preventing longterm lowdose oral performing posttreatment swabbing confirming eradication group βhemolytic streptococci infection reduces chance perianal streptococcal dermatitis cases recurrence perianal streptococcal dermatitis infection occurs within case perianal cellulitis maintaining dryness site addressing infection topical antifungal ointment sufficient prevent recurrent infection duration potential risk factors perianal streptococcal dermatitis include poor living conditions atopic dermatitis routine hygiene practices also encouraged children adults order reduce risk recurrent prescribed antibiotic regimens also adhered completion avoid risk developing multiresistant strain infection proper screening measures followed perianal cellulitis continues severely underdiagnosed perianal cellulitis often
