euthanasia device machine engineered allow individual die quickly minimal pain common devices designed help terminally ill people die voluntary euthanasia assisted suicide without prolonged pain may operated second party physician person wishing die ongoing debate ethics euthanasia use euthanasia devices invented jack kevorkian used device called thanatron death machine greek daemon thanatos worked pushing button deliver euthanizing drugs mechanically iv three canisters mounted metal frame bottle syringe connected single iv line persons arm one contained saline one contained sleepinducing barbiturate called sodium thiopental last lethal mixture potassium chloride immediately stopped heart pancuronium bromide paralytic medication prevent spasms dying two deaths assisted method kevorkian assisted others device employed gas mask fed canister carbon monoxide called mercitron mercy became necessary kevorkians medical license revoked first two deaths could longer legal access substances required thanatron rudimentary device consisting canister carbon monoxide attached face mask tube valve must released start gas flowing depending persons disability makeshift handle may attached valve make easier turn valve open position clip clothespin could clamped tubing pulling allows gas flow kevorkians estimates method took minutes longer sometimes encouraged people take sedatives muscle relaxants keep calm breathed deeply gas deliverance machine invented philip nitschke consisted software entitled deliverance came special laptop could connected iv persons arm computer program asked series questions confirm persons intent die aware go ahead last screen press yes button given lethal dose medications die certain understand proceed press yes button next screen die seconds given lethal press yes answering affirmatively questions lethal injection barbiturates interview nitschke said even legal doctor give lethal injection preferred patient control administration drugs reducing role physician also allowed patient alone family euthanasia machine used legally australian northern territorys rights terminally ill act effect act eventually nullified legislation australian parliament machine put display british science exit international euthanasia device invented philip nitschke uses canister plastic suicide bag plastic tube one end attached gas canister fixed inside bag tie held adhesive nitschke said idea giving people access means feeling theyre back control issue actually way prolonging life may seem paradoxical find people feel theyre back control theyre less likely desperate basic principle autoeuthanasia anoxia first described book final exit derek humphry original methodology devised using helium nutech nitschke described device modification exit bag helium method described peaceful pill handbook helium replaced cylinder compressed nitrogen regulator supply nitrogen plastic bag one advantage method availability larger amounts nitrogen flow rates last longer nitschke states nitrogen also physiologically inert helium less chance adverse loss consciousness quick death following within unlike helium cylinders nitrogen cylinders refilled event leakage nitrogen gas cant detected principle behind device oxygen deprivation leads hypoxia asphyxia death within minutes deprivation oxygen presence carbon dioxide creates panic sense suffocation hypercapnic alarm response struggling even unconscious whereas anoxia presence inert gas like nitrogen helium argon close contact enclosed inert gas lethal released open air quickly disperses safe others neither flammable explosive humphrys book describes close contact gas achieved enclosing head strong clear plastic bag secured around neck inert gas fed bag plastic suicides using method documented forensic study asphyxial suicide helium plastic bag ogden et al authors describe typical case history elderly cancer sufferer used plastic bag secured head helium tank plastic hose attached tank valve plastic authors noted suicide bag filled helium cause almost immediate unconsciousness followed within minutes time loss consciousness bag filled nitrogen seconds according professors copeland pappas parr campaigned humane execution method us state nitschke invented suicide capsule named sarco would contain touchpad nitrogen activation code entered person asked wish affirmative answer causes nitrogen flow capsule displacing oxygen death follows shortly thereafter sarco machine printed small printers sarco offers euphoric nitschke planned release open source plans sarco
