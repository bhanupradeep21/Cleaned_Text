phenomenon macromolecular crowding alters properties molecules solution high concentrations macromolecules proteins conditions occur routinely living cells instance cytosol escherichia coli contains mgml crowding occurs since high concentrations macromolecules reduce volume solvent available molecules solution result increasing effective concentrations crowding promote formation biomolecular condensate colloidal phase separation crowding effect make molecules cells behave radically different ways testtube consequently measurements properties enzymes processes metabolism made laboratory vitro dilute solutions may different many orders magnitude true values seen living cells vivo study biochemical processes realistically crowded conditions important since conditions ubiquitous property cells crowding may essential efficient operation metabolism indeed vitro studies shown crowding greatly influences binding stability proteins interior cells crowded environment example escherichia coli cell micrometres μm long μm diameter cell volume however e coli contain different types types produced high enough level easily added mix various forms rna cells dna chromosome giving total concentration macromolecules eukaryotes cells interior crowded protein filaments make cytoskeleton meshwork divides cytosol network narrow high concentrations macromolecules occupy large

transcription dna crowding also suggested involved processes diverse aggregation hemoglobin sicklecell disease responses cells changes importance crowding protein folding particular interest biophysics crowding effect accelerate folding process since compact folded protein occupy less volume unfolded protein however crowding reduce yield correctly folded protein increasing protein crowding may also increase effectiveness chaperone proteins groel could counteract reduction folding also shown macromolecular crowding affects proteinfolding dynamics well overall protein shape distinct conformational changes accompanied secondary structure alterations implying crowdinginduced shape changes may important protein function malfunction particularly striking example importance crowding effects involves crystallins fill interior lens proteins remain stable solution lens transparent precipitation aggregation crystallins causes crystallins present lens extremely high concentrations mgml levels crowding effects strong large crowding effect adds thermal stability crystallins increasing resistance effect may partly explain extraordinary resistance shown lens damage caused high crowding may also play role diseases involve protein aggregation sickle cell anemia mutant hemoglobin forms aggregates alzheimers disease tau protein forms neurofibrillary tangles crowded conditions within due macromolecular crowding enzyme assays biophysical measurements performed dilute solution may fail reflect actual process kinetics taking place one approach produce accurate measurements would use highly concentrated extracts cells try maintain cell contents natural state however extracts contain many kinds biologically active molecules interfere phenomena consequently crowding effects mimicked vitro adding high concentrations relatively inert molecules polyethylene glycol ficoll dextran serum albumin experimental however using artificial crowding agents complicated crowding molecules sometimes interact ways process examined binding weakly one major importance macromolecular crowding biological systems stems effect protein folding underlying physical mechanism macromolecular crowding helps stabilize proteins folded state often explained terms excluded volume volume inaccessible proteins due interaction macromolecular notion goes back asakura oosawa described depletion forces induced steric hardcore hallmark mechanism inferred effect completely athermal thus completely entropic ideas also proposed explain small cosolutes namely protective osmolytes preferentially excluded proteins also shift protein folding equilibrium towards folded however shown various methods depletion forces always entropic nature satyam et al national university
