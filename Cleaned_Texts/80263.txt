triceratops traɪˈsɛrətɒps lit threehorned face genus chasmosaurine ceratopsian dinosaur lived late maastrichtian age late cretaceous period million years ago western north america one lastknown nonavian dinosaurs lived extinction event million years ago name triceratops literally means threehorned face derived greek words trí τρί meaning three kéras κέρας meaning horn ṓps ὤψ meaning face bearing large bony frill three horns skull large fourlegged body exhibiting convergent evolution bovines rhinoceroses triceratops one recognizable dinosaurs bestknown ceratopsian also one largest metres ft long metric tons short tons body mass shared landscape likely preyed upon tyrannosaurus though less certain two adults would battle fanciful manner often depicted museum displays popular
