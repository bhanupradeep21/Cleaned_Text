contact granuloma condition develops due persistent tissue irritation posterior benign granulomas confused types granulomas occur vocal process vocal folds vocal ligament attaches signs symptoms may include hoarseness voice sensation lump throat contact granulomas may also without two common causes associated contact granulomas first common cause sustained periods increased pressure vocal folds commonly seen people use voice excessively singers john mayer treatment typically includes voice therapy changes lifestyle factors second common cause granulomas gastroesophageal reflux controlled primarily use antireflux associated causes discussed primary symptoms contact granuloma include chronic acute hoarseness voice vocal severe granulomas may result throat ache soreness well pain spreads one smaller granulomas may result tickling sensation slight discomfort signs contact granulomas frequent coughing people may also notice pitch range restricted due major etiologic factors contact granulomas organized following categories mechanical issues resulting contact granulomas related physical trauma level vocal trauma occurs adductive forces excessive meaning persons vocal folds closing abruptly forcefully speaking engaging nonvocal behaviors throatclearing addition presence contact granuloma makes impossible vocal folds come complete closure adduction causes person use force speaking attempt close vocal folds completely turn creates trauma vocal glottal insufficiency vocal folds close completely often due vocal fold paralysis also underlying cause contact contact trauma occur person frequently speaks pitch lower modal voice especially vocallydemanding professions like acting teaching research suggests men commonly affected inflammatory issues associated contact granuloma include gastroesophageal reflux allergy disagreement among researchers whether inflammatory issues direct researchers identify reflux infection indirect causes due aggressive coughing usually occurs resultcitation needed patients need tracheal intubation receive oral drugs oversized tube excessive movement tube infection lead contact granulomas people certain personality traits vocal patterns may susceptible development contact tenseness highstress aggressiveness impulsiveness personality traits associated contact diagnosis contact ulcers normally involves endoscopy examination biopsy sample taken ulcer examined cancerous cells contact granulomas physically identified diagnosed observing presence proliferative tissue originating vocal process arytenoid identification carried laryngoscopy produces image lesion form abnormal growth nodule polyp vocal process overwhelmingly common laryngeal site lesions although also observed medial anterior portions vocal nodule polyp form contact granulomas generally grey dark red measure mm contact granulomas occur unilaterally bilaterally affecting one vocal various methods used diagnose contact granuloma aid differentiating vocal fold laryngoscopy allow visualization suspected granuloma also checking signs vocal laryngoscopy well acoustic analysis voice help rule vocal fold paresis underlying microscopic examination tissue help determine lesion benign rather cancerous would case contact methods laryngeal electromyography reflux testing also used evaluate function vocal folds determine laryngopharyngeal reflux contributing screening tools contact granulomas currently available diagnosis contact granulomas require visualization using laryngoscopy may require biopsy differential combination symptoms lifestyle factors may linked development contact granuloma however symptoms vary greatly individual lifestyle factors linked elevated risk development contact granulomas include frequent use voice especially loud environments concurrent use voice alcohol consumption increasing risk gastroesophageal reflux symptoms contact granuloma may also arise intubation following intubation patients monitored voice symptoms arise symptoms may may include hoarse voice described huskiness aching throat related increased effort produce feeling lump ones throat also possible symptoms especially granuloma patient presenting symptoms risk factors therefore referred visualization therefore recommended obtain diagnosis doctorcitation needed causes vocal process granulomas quite varied prevention must target individual education lifestyle factors habitual vocal abuse habits may aggravate gastroesophageal reflux implemented lower risk use voice professionally use vocal hygiene techniques ensure safe voice vocal hygiene may include increasing water intake eliminating external irritants smoking airborne chemicals controlling loudness balancing periods increased vocal use periods since intubation also cause vocal process granulomas proper muscle relaxing medications used insertion removal tubes smaller tubes used proper lubrication patient movement controlled specific treatment contact granuloma depends underlying cause condition often initially includes combination speech vocal antireflux aggressive treatment approach could include steroids inhalant injections botulinum low dose radiotherapy vocal fold microlaryngeal microlaryngeal surgery performed either via cold steel excision various types laser accurate typically results less damage surrounding tissue aggressive approaches might used case refractory ie resistant treatment contact granuloma previous interventions succeeded recurrence rates best outcomes appear occur combination treatments application corticosteroids treat contact granulomas considered extreme utility remains employed usually used conjunction antibiotics reduction pain inflammation related treatment administered orally inhalation intralesion injection botulinum neurotoxin botox treat contact granulomas considered extreme generally pursued case resistant approach botox injected thyroarytenoid muscle unilaterally bilaterally targeting reduction contact forces surgery medical behavioural treatments attempted surgical removal contact granuloma possible last resort option however caution needs exercised especially cases contact granuloma resulting external factors ie factors eliminated contact granuloma resolves independently irritation cause contact granulomas masses granular tissue often benign prognosis generally however due variety treatment options lifestyle factors outcomes individual treatments form management vary high proportion contact granulomas present patients concurrent gastroesophageal reflux treatment reflux caused intubation trauma less likely common treatment voice therapy speechlanguage pathologist therapy enough many surgical solutions sometimes used however rates recurrence recent research suggests surgical options explored treatment reflux without voice therapy across posited etiologies contact granulomas commonly observed male patients female patients commonly adult patients pediatric cases gastroesophageal reflux disease identified likely cause granuloma patient commonly adult man contact granulomas occur female pediatric patients usually occur observable age gender trends within category postintubation patients contact granulomas within causation category vocal abuse several different terms used refer contact granulomas contact ulcer vocal fold granuloma vocal process granuloma etc term contact ulcer first used early century time single cause condition believed excessive force vocal folds make contact phonation nonphonatory behaviors ie later condition observed patients recovering recent recently came associated inflammation irritation resulting gastroesophageal likewise use ulcer granuloma reflect fact condition present ulcerated lesion granulated medical literature today term vocal process granuloma preferred term contact ulcer contact granuloma reflects fact condition result variety different causes excessively forceful contact vocal folds originally nevertheless term contact granuloma remains widely used httpsenwikipediaorgwikicontactgranuloma
