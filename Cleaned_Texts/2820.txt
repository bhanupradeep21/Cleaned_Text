clubmosses many ferns produce one type spore said homosporous exosporic gametophytes gametophyte freeliving develops outside spore wall exosporic gametophytes either bisexual capable producing sperm eggs thallus monoicous specialized separate male female organisms dioicous heterosporous vascular plants plants produce microspores megaspores gametophytes develop endosporically within spore wall gametophytes dioicous producing either sperm eggs bothcitation needed ferns example leptosporangiate fern dryopteris gametophyte photosynthetic free living autotrophic organism called prothallus produces gametes maintains sporophyte early multicellular development however groups notably clade includes ophioglossaceae psilotaceae gametophytes subterranean subsist forming mycotrophic relationships fungi homosporous ferns secrete chemical called antheridiogen extant lycophytes produce two different types gametophytes homosporous families lycopodiaceae huperziaceae spores germinate bisexual freeliving subterranean mycotrophic gametophytes derive nutrients symbiosis fungi isoetes selaginella heterosporous microspores megaspores dispersed sporangia either passively active microspores produce microgametophytes produce sperm megaspores produce reduced megagametophytes inside spore wall maturity megaspore cracks open trilete suture allow male gametes access egg cells
