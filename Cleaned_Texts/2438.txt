social contagion involves behaviour emotions conditions spreading spontaneously group network phenomenon discussed social scientists since late century although much work subject based unclear even contradictory conceptions social contagion exact definitions vary scholars include unplanned spread ideas population social contagion though others prefer class memetics generally social contagion understood separate collective behaviour results direct attempt exert social influence two broad divisions social contagion behavioural contagion emotional contagion study social contagion intensified century much recent work involves academics social psychology sociology network science investigating online social networks studies century typically focused negative effects violent mob behaviour whereas century sometimes looking harmful effects often focused relatively neutral contagion influence shopping choices even positive effects like tendency people take action climate change sufficient number neighbours metaphoric use connecting concept infection imitation mimesis dates back least plato continued medieval early modern literature term behavioural contagion first introduced modern scholarship gustave le bon book crowd study popular mind scholarly works subject first released slowly one two decade herbert blumer first specifically use term social contagion paper collective behavior gave dancing mania middle ages prominent example studies social contagion began investigate phenomena empirically became frequent widely shared definition social contagion century however many studies little common david levy paul r nail published review stated social contagion captures broadest sense phenomena opposed subtypes like behavioural emotional contagion review paul marsden suggested social contagion similar phenomena memetics field study inspired richard dawkins book selfish gene marsden suggested two fields could complementary sense work social contagion largely lacked coherent theory contained much evidence based analyses whereas memetics rich theory lacking empirical side century interest social contagion grew rapidly based part cross fertilisation emerging field network science especially application scholars long reported study social contagion suffered lack widely accepted precise definition definitions often though always classified social contagion method transmission rely direct intent influence definitions suggested social contagion involves spontaneous imitation others rather based conscious decisionsnote review levy nail proposed social contagion defined spread affect attitude behaviour recipient perceive intentional influence attempt part various typologies proposed social social contagion broadly split behavioural contagion emotional contagion spread ideas sometimes considered third broad category though often considered part memetics dr paul marsden said behavioural contagion split six subcategories hysterical contagions deliberate selfharm contagions contagions aggression rule violation contagions consumer behaviour contagions financial three main causes social contagion proposed disinhibitory contagion echo

group unknown means unlike echo disinhibitory contagion transmitted may way desirable attractive yet transmits social contagion examined threshold models based much exposure individual needs transmission behaviour emotion occurs models assume individual needs convinced fraction social contacts given threshold adopt novel therefore number exposures increase chances contagion unless number source exposures pass certain threshold threshold value divide contagion processes two types simple contagion complex simple contagion individual needs single exposure new behaviour instance cars travel groups twolane highway since car cluster travels slower speed car behind relative speed spreads cars slow match speed car complex contagion individual needs contact two sources exhibiting novel copying behaviours needs reinforcement encouragement multiple sources multiple sources especially close friends make imitation legitimate credible worthwhile due collective effort put examples complex contagions copying risky behaviour joining social movements much early work social contagion looked harmful effects keeping infectious disease metaphor yet towards end century especially scholars
