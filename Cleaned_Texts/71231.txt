apexification method dental treatment induce calcific barrier root incomplete formation open apex tooth necrotic pulpal involvement usually occurs consequence trauma caries involvement young immature permanent teeth sequelae untreated pulp involvement loss pulp vitality necrotic pulp took place involved teeth main purpose apexification includes restoring original physiologic structures functions pulpdentin complex addition elimination pulp tissue within tooth disinfection root canal system using irrigants sodium hypochlorite ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid necessary steps ensure purpose apexification apexification procedure normally requires several monthly appointments followups observe calcific changes induced apex tooth concerned visits material known calcium hydroxide placed inside root canal systems eliminate intracanal infection stimulates calcification achieves apical barrier seal apex tooth root success rate applying traditionally used calcium hydroxide induce calcific barrier nowadays newer material known mineral trioxide aggregate mta widely used difficulties said major clinical challenge carrying apexification including difficulty achieving appropriate apical seal open apex besides termination development dentinal walls pulpal pathologies occur result roots thin dentinal wall thus producing higher risk tooth apexification indicated immature permanent teeth nonvital incompletely formed objective procedure induce root end closure apexification apices immature roots formation mineralized tissue apical closure take various forms cases appears irregular aberrant along apical closure root development may may different materials used apexification mineral trioxide aggregate mta bioceramics biodentine mineral trioxide aggregate mta composed primarily tricalcium silicate tricalcium aluminate tricalcium oxide silicate oxide used endodontics rootend filling material sets presence presents either grey white form difference two white mta lacks numerous testing analysis mta showed superior properties physical properties biocompatibility shown less marginal gap formation less leakage better adaptation filling materials besides root ends filled mta showed good healing absence periradicular inflammation rootend filling material compared use mta endodontic repair material stimulates bone formation well inhibits bone due physical properties biocompatibility mta used numerous clinical situations rootend filling widely used repair perforations close open apices apexification direct pulp capping material deep carious tooth cover pulp stumps apexogenesis material possesses great sealing ability good antimicrobial activity great biocompatibility enhances dentin however known drawbacks use mta potential release hazardous substances potential discoloration inconvenience order overcome limitations mta recent advance dental materials introduced bioceramics new root canal obturation repair material composition mainly includes zirconium oxide calcium silicates calcium phosphate monobasic calcium hydroxide filler thickening premixed form easy use applied root canal therapy biodentin similar better mta biocompatibility antimicrobial activity sealing ability ability enhance dentin biomineralization bonding ability highhumidity environment color stability biodentine significantly better biodentine tricalcium silicatebased material alternative permanent dentin biocompatible new bioactive dentin substitute cement composed powder consists tricalcium silicate dicalcium silicate calcium carbonate calcium oxide zirconium oxide calcium hydroxide allows good marginal sealing thus preventing marginal leakage well protecting underlying pulp inducing formation tertiary unlike dentin substitutes biodentine application require conditioning dentin surface providing good sealing property tag like structures formed penetration biodentine material dentin tubules besides also bonded different types adhesives finishing final restoration composite setting time biodentine shorter compared mta conclusion material clinically indicated permanent dentin substitute direct indirect pulp capping pulpotomy repair furcation root perforations retrograde rootend filling proper assessment tooth important determining accurate diagnosis order formulate appropriate treatment plan clinical evaluation pulpal status includes comprehensive history diagnostic tests radiographic examination used determine maturity developing root however immature teeth commonly associated young patients pulp testing children complex subjective following steps included apexification procedure completed one two appointments depending initial clinical sign symptoms procedure may also vary depending materials medication used generally treatment paste allowed remain six months evaluation apical apical closure occurred within six months root canal retreated material choice ideally tooth demonstrate continued apical growth
