simple magnetic overunity toy smot invention greg watson australia claims show overunity energy supposedly produces energy consumes perpetual motion machine type magnet motor theoretical smot design steel ball pulled ramp array permanent magnets top ramp falls converting magnetic attraction kinetic energy smotlike structure shown emil hartmans watson claims mechanism called regauging happens allows cycle repeated without application outside energycitation needed perpetual motion overunity achieved smot ball cycled starting point one smot starting point second smot third arranging multiple smots circle ball circulated along smots thus giving illusion overunity ball never return starting place without adding energy compensate frictional losses energy dissipated system smot consists nonmagnetic inclined plane series permanent magnets steel ball nonmagnetic track eg aluminium versions pair long bar magnets place series permanent magnets inclined plane low grade still enough provide gain height track positioned directly center inclined plane usually surface track almost flush inclined planes surface two permanent magnets long bar magnets polarized poles long side placed almost parallel track poles nearest top inclined plane closer track bottom ball moves track magnetic field stronger magnets closer steel ball since net force towards top ramp motion ball also direction imperative magnets constantly getting closer ball order create net force upwards track serves keep ball away magnets track constructed carefully slight imbalance send steel ball track one magnets starting point ball potential energy given put forces magnets ball released potential energy converted kinetic energy ball rolls track drops top sum kinetic energy potential energy always constant minus energy lost due friction ball never energy first put position magnetostatic field produced arrangement stationary permanent magnets conservative field magnetic scalar potential means magnetic object moves closedloop path field like ball device gains energy field absence friction ends total energy kinetic plus potential started since moving object also subject friction forces dissipate kinetic energy moves ball always end cycle less energy started eventually stop moving httpsenwikipediaorgwikisimplemagneticoverunitytoy
