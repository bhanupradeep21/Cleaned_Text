three major parts hole ground concrete slab floor small hole shelter also called pit typically least three meters ft deep one meter ft hole slab larger cm prevent children falling light prevented entering pit reduce access may require use lid cover hole floor world health organization recommends pits built reasonable distance house ideally balancing easy access distance water wells surface

latrines used estimated billion people mostly developing million people percent global population practiced open defecation mostly southern asia subsaharan africa lowest access indian government

sanitation coverage india increased october almost estimated million pit latrines built due campaign another example india toilet bride campaign promotes toilet uptake encouraging women refuse marry men depending region term pit latrine may used denote toilet squatting pan water seal siphon accurately termed pourflush pit latrine common south east asia example simply hole ground without water seal also called simple pit latrine common type countries subsaharan africa whilst dry toilet without urine diversion pit latrine almost always without urine diversion key characteristic pit latrine use pit infiltrates liquids ground acts device storage limited pit latrines sometimes also referred dry toilets however pit latrines use water flushing therefore dry toilet dry toilets overarching term used several types toilets refers type user interface storage treatment pit latrine may may count towards millennium development goals mdg target increasing access sanitation worlds population

facilities available inside outside eg supplied water rainwater harvesting tank roof shelter although rarely case practice shelter anal cleansing materials eg toilet paper solid waste bin also available substantial structure may also built commonly known outhouse liquids leach pit pass unsaturated soil zone completely filled water subsequently liquids pit enter groundwater may lead groundwater pollution problem nearby water well used supply groundwater drinking water purposes passage soil pathogens die absorbed significantly mostly depending travel time pit pathogens die within days travel degree pathogen removal strongly varies soil type aquifer type distance environmental reason difficult estimate safe distance pit water source problem also applies septic tanks detailed guidelines developed estimate safe distances protect groundwater sources pollution onsite however mostly ignored building pit latrines addition household plots limited size therefore pit latrines often built much closer groundwater wells regarded safe results groundwater pollution household members falling sick using groundwater source drinking water general guideline recommended bottom pit least metres groundwater level minimum horizontal distance metres yards pit water source normally recommended limit exposure microbial contaminationcitation needed however general statement made regarding minimum lateral separation distances required prevent contamination well pit example even metres yards lateral separation distance might sufficient strongly karstified system downgradient supply well spring metres yards lateral separation distance completely sufficient well developed clay cover layer annular space groundwater well well sealed local hydrogeological conditions vary within space square kilometres square mile two ignored pit latrines cause significant public health risks via contaminated groundwater addition issue pathogens also issue nitrate pollution groundwater

ground lined pit lining materials include brick rotresistant timber concrete stones mortar plastered onto partial lining recommended pit latrine used great number people public restroom rural areas woodland park busy layby rest stop similarly busy location soils unstable order increase permanence allow emptying pit without collapsing easily bottom pit remain unlined allow infiltration liquids pit fully lined pit latrine concrete lining also base liquids infiltrate ground one could argue longer pit latrine stricter sense advantage groundwater contamination occur major disadvantage fully lined pit latrine fills fast urine escape pit results high costs empty maintain latrine increased odour also issue pit content much wetter emits odour type pit latrine used special circumstances eg denser settlements groundwater protection paramount pit latrines often built developing countries even situations recommended situations include areas prone flooding unstable rocky soil high groundwater also disadvantage pit latrines outdoors creates security issues night conditions pit latrines suitable installations types toilets considered eg urinediverting dry toilet pit latrines

interior outhouse type structure usually built pit provide privacy ventilated improved pit latrine vip pit latrine black pipe vent pipe fitted pit screen flyscreen top outlet pipe vip latrines improvement overcome disadvantages simple pit latrines eg fly mosquito nuisance unpleasant odors smell carried upwards chimney effect flies prevented leaving pit spreading despite simplicity

also allows odours escape minimizes attraction ensure flow air latrine must adequate ventilation superstructure usually achieved leaving openings door constructing spiral wall without covering feces absorbent decreases smell discourages flies may include soil sawdust ash lime among developing countries use absorbents pit toilets commonly practiced vent pipe internal diameter least mm reach mm highest point toilet superstructure typically pit least metres deep metres diameter depending number users deep pits last liquid leaches pit migrates unsaturated soil matrix pathogenic germs sorbed soil surface way pathogens removed prior contact groundwater degree removal varies soil type distance travelled moisture environmental factors thus difficult estimate distance necessary pit water

common design socalled twinpit pour flush toilets increases safety enter also vip latrines sometimes built two pits although vip toilets one problem users may stick alternation method fill pits time pits adequate size accommodate volume waste generated one two years allows contents full pit enough time transform partially sanitized soillike material manually excavated twin pits constructed metre apart minimize crosscontamination maturing pit one use also pits constructed metre structural foundation leachate negatively impact structural supports water within pit impact stability therefore full depth pit walls lined prevent collapse top cm fully mortared prevent direct infiltration support risk groundwater pollution pits located areas high variable water table andor fissures cracks bedrock soil groundwater properties often unknown difficult estimate distance necessary pit water source normally recommended minimum horizontal distance metres yards limit exposing water source microbial contamination ensure one two pits used time idle pipe junction connecting outofuse pit closed eg cement twin pit toilets commonly used rural governments swachh bharat mission primarily used twin pit
