phase occurs involves ship movement region region combat opposing fleets encounter sea opposing fleets moving adjacent regions towards region fleet invades naval battle victory occurs enemys deployed ships destroyed retreat within hours invasion victory attacker includes destroying forcing opposing enemy fleets retreat destroying existing enemy airfields within hours attacker fails even enemy ships destroyed within time limit defender still holds onto territory invading fleet retreats back region invaded player option playing one four major world war ii maritime powers united kingdom
