medicine median arcuate ligament syndrome mals also known celiac artery compression syndrome celiac axis syndrome celiac trunk compression syndrome dunbar syndrome condition characterized abdominal pain attributed compression celiac artery celiac ganglia median arcuate abdominal pain may related meals may accompanied weight loss may associated abdominal bruit heard clinician diagnosis mals one exclusion many healthy patients demonstrate degree celiac artery compression absence symptoms consequently diagnosis mals typically entertained common conditions ruled suspected screening mals done ultrasonography confirmed computed tomography ct magnetic resonance mr angiography treatment generally surgical mainstay open laparoscopic division separation median arcuate ligament combined removal celiac ganglia majority patients benefit surgical intervention poorer responses treatment tend occur patients older age psychiatric condition use alcohol abdominal pain unrelated meals experienced weight loss patients mals reportedly experience abdominal pain particularly epigastrium may associated eating may result anorexia weight loss pain left right side usually ribs signs persistent nausea lassitude especially heavy meal exercise intolerance diarrhea common symptom experience constipation experience vomiting everyone exercise certain postures aggravate symptoms occasionally physical examination reveals abdominal bruit complications mals result chronic compression celiac artery include aneurysm superior inferior pancreaticoduodenal median arcuate ligament ligament formed base

aorta branch point celiac artery however one quarter normal individuals median arcuate ligament passes front celiac artery compressing celiac artery nearby structures celiac individuals compression pathologic leads median arcuate ligament several theories attempt explain origin pain caused compression celiac one proposes compression celiac artery causes ischemia decreased blood flow abdominal organs leading pain another hypothesizes compression celiac artery also celiac ganglia pain results compression lattercitation needed median arcuate ligament syndrome diagnosis diagnosis mals generally considered patients undergone extensive evaluation gastrointestinal tract including upper endoscopy colonoscopy evaluation gallbladder disease gastroesophageal reflux disease diagnosis mals relies combination clinical features findings medical clinical features include signs symptoms mentioned classically mals involves triad abdominal pain eating weight loss abdominal bruit although classic triad found minority individuals carry mals diagnostic imaging mals divided screening confirmatory reasonable screening test patients suspected mals duplex ultrasonography measure blood flow celiac peak systolic velocities greater cms suggestive celiac artery stenosis associated evaluation confirmation obtained via angiography investigate anatomy celiac historically conventional angiography used although largely replaced less invasive techniques computed tomography ct magnetic resonance mr provides better visualization intraabdominal structures ct angiography preferred mr

characteristic anatomy mals helps distinguish causes celiac artery stenosis hooked contour entirely specific mals however given normal asymptomatic individuals decompression celiac artery general approach treatment mainstay treatment involves open laparoscopic surgery approaches divide separate median arcuate ligament relieve compression celiac combined removal celiac ganglia evaluation blood flow celiac artery example intraoperative duplex ultrasound blood flow poor celiac artery revascularization usually attempted methods revascularization include aortoceliac bypass patch angioplasty recent laparoscopic approach used achieve celiac artery however celiac artery require revascularization procedure would require conversion open endovascular methods percutaneous transluminal angioplasty pta used patients failed open andor laparoscopic pta alone without decompression celiac artery may studies longterm outcomes patients treated according largest relevant late outcomes data
