rapidonset obesity hypothalamic dysregulation hypoventilation autonomic dysregulation rohhad rare condition whose etiology currently rohhad mainly affects endocrine system autonomic nervous system patients exhibit variety signs patients present alveolar hypoventilation along hypothalamic dysfunction distinguishes rohhad congenital central hypoventilation syndrome rohhad rare disease reported cases worldwide thus first sign rohhad rapid weight gain years typically hypoventilation abnormally slow breathing presents rapid onset symptoms hypothalamic dysfunction autonomic dysfunction present variety ways order diagnosis rohhad must present approximately patients develop neuroendocrine also possibility behavioral disorders children rohhad normal cognitive development treatment plans rohhad vary depending patients symptoms cure treatment geared toward managing symptoms patient rohhad fatal cases undiagnosed untreated due cardiopulmonary arrest secondary untreated earlier disease diagnosed treatment starts better childs prognosis rapid onset obesity aspect rohhad usually first diagnostic indicator disease patients often present hyperphagia rapid weight gain rapid weight gain defined pounds month period typically occurs ages hypothalamic dysfunction refers hypothalamus structure within brain participates regulating pituitary gland autonomic nervous system endocrine symptoms related hypothalamic dysfunction may include abnormal sodium balance hyponatremia hypernatremia high progestin levels low cortisol levels delayed earlyonset puberty low thyroid patients also often experience decelerated growth rate throughout sodium imbalance within body severe symptoms potentially lifethreatening controlled hyponatremia low sodium levels cause symptoms nausea headache seizures even cause patients become hypernatremia high sodium levels blood cause nausea muscle weakness altered mental status irregular temperature regulation diabetes insipidus also possible symptoms hypothalamic rohhad patients develop symptoms varying ages varying numbers patients develop symptoms hypothalamic symptoms hypoventilation breathing malfunctions typically present rapid weight gain patients may initially develop obstructive sleep apnea common obese obstructive sleep apnea common form sleep apnea causes breathing abruptly stop begin sleep caused throat muscles relaxing sleep blocking airway typically noticed patients snore loudly throughout every patient diagnosed rohhad develops alveolar hypoventilation regardless whether presented sleep alveolar hypoventilation condition patients low blood oxygen levels shallow breathing healthy patients blood oxygen levels low brain sends signal breathe bring oxygen blood rohhad patients reaction condition usually present

replacement treat hormone deficiencies often patients placed strict fluid regimen treat imbalances hyponatremia patients present diabetes insipidus may also treated desmopressin synthetic replacement antidiuretic every rohhad patient requires form ventilatory support ranging noninvasive bipap machines tracheostomy procedures approximately rohhad patients require ventilatory support day night whereas half require nighttime bilevel positive airway pressure machine bipap ventilator mask worn night bipap pushes air lungs therefore breathing helpful rohhad patients hypoventilation causes
