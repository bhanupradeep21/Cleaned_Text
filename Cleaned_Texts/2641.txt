engineering disasters often arise shortcuts design process engineering science technology used meet needs demands demands include buildings aircraft vessels computer software order meet society demands creation newer technology infrastructure must met efficiently costeffectively accomplish managers engineers need mutual approach specified demand hand lead shortcuts engineering design reduce costs construction fabrication occasionally shortcuts lead unexpected design failures failure occurs structure device used past limits design inhibits proper structure designed support certain amount stress strain loading user applies greater amounts structure begin deform eventually fail several factors contribute failure including flawed design improper use financial costs miscommunication field engineering importance safety emphasized learning past engineering failures infamous disasters challenger explosion brings sense reality happen appropriate safety precautions taken safety tests tensile testing finite element analysis fea failure theories help provide information design engineers maximum forces stresses applied certain region design precautionary measures help prevent failures due overloading static loading force applied slowly object structure static load tests tensile testing bending tests torsion tests help determine maximum loads design withstand without permanent deformation failure tensile testing common calculating stressstrain curve determine yield strength ultimate strength specific test specimen specimen stretched slowly tension breaks load distance across gage length continuously monitored sample subjected tensile test typically withstand stresses higher yield stress without breaking certain point however sample break two pieces happens microscopic cracks resulted yielding spread large scales stress point complete breakage called materials ultimate tensile result stressstrain curve materials behavior static loading tensile testing yield strength found point material begins yield readily applied stress rate deformation material undergoes permanent deformation exposure radical temperatures constant loading functionality material become plastic distortion material known creep stress temperature major factors rate creep order design considered safe deformation due creep must much less strain failure occurs static loading causes specimen surpass point specimen begin permanent plastic mechanical design failures due timevarying dynamic loads applied system phenomenon known fatigue failure fatigue known weakness material due variations stress repeatedly applied said example stretching rubber band certain length without breaking ie surpassing yield stress rubber band rubber band return original form release however repeatedly stretching rubber band amount force thousands times would create microcracks band would lead rubber band snapped principle applied mechanical materials fatigue failure always begins crack may form time due manufacturing process used three stages fatigue failure note fatigue imply strength material lessened failure notion originally referred material becoming tired cyclic engineering precise discipline requiring communication among project developers several forms miscommunication lead flawed design various fields engineering must intercommunicate including civil electrical mechanical industrial chemical biological environmental engineering example modern automobile design requires electrical engineers mechanical engineers environmental engineers work together produce fuelefficient durable product consumers engineers adequately communicate among one another potential design could flaws unsafe consumer purchase engineering disasters result miscommunication including
