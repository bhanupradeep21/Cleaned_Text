monsanto canada inc v schmeiser scr scc leading supreme court canada case patent rights biotechnology canadian canola farmer percy schmeiser agricultural biotechnology company monsanto court heard question whether schmeisers intentionally growing genetically modified plants constituted use monsantos patented genetically modified plant cells majority court ruled supreme court also ruled schmeiser pay monsanto technology use fee damages costs schmeiser receive benefit case drew worldwide attention widely misunderstood concern happens farmers fields accidentally contaminated patented seed however time case went trial claims accidental contamination dropped court considered gm canola schmeisers fields schmeiser intentionally concentrated planted schmeiser put forward defence accidental biotechnology company monsanto developed patented glyphosateresistant gene canola plant effect producing canola resistant glyphosate monsanto marketed seed roundup ready canola farmers using system able control weed competition using roundup avoiding damage roundupresistant crops users required enter formal agreement monsanto specifies new seed must purchased every year purchase

harvested plants grown field including plants seeds accidentally sown tangible property right overrides monsantos patent rights canadian law mention farmers rights court held farmers right save replant seeds simply right property owner use property wishes hence right use seeds subject legal restrictions use rights apply case ownership property including restrictions arising patents
