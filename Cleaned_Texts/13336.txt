syndrome pks also termed tetrasomy mosaicism pallister mosaic aneuploidy syndrome extremely rare severe genetic disorder pks due presence extra abnormal chromosome termed small supernumerary marker chromosome ssmc ssmcs contain copies genetic material parts virtually chromosome depending genetic material carry cause various genetic disorders neoplasms ssmc pks consists multiple copies short ie p arm chromosome consequently multiple copies genetic material ssmc plus two copies genetic material two normal chromosome overexpressed thereby cause due form genetic mosaicism however individuals pks differ tissue distributions ssmc therefore show different syndromerelated birth defects disease severities example individuals ssmc heart tissue likely cardiac structural abnormalities without ssmc localization structurally normal pks first described philip pallister researched maria teschlernicola wolfgang killian individuals pks present prenatally birth multiple birth defects defects include

contributing development one suggested mechanism development ssmc pks involves three sequential events chromosome suffers nondisjunction ie failure homologous chromosomes sister chromatids separate
