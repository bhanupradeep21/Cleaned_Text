receptor protein effectively competing atp binding pocket secondary mutations arise alter binding site common mutation threonine replaced methionine amino acid position ligandbinding domain typically binds threonine gatekeeper residue meaning key determining specificity binding pocket mutated methionine researchers originally hypothesized caused drug inhibition due steric hindrance bulkier methionine selected binding atp instead current hypothesized mechanism resistance gefitinib conveyed increasing atp affinity egfr enzymatic level meaning protein preferentially binds atp order combat acquired resistance gefitinib firstgeneration inhibitors researchers used irreversible egfr inhibitors like neratinib dacomitinib called tyrosine kinase inhibitors tkis new drugs covalently bind atp binding pocket attached egfr displaced even mutated versions egfr higher affinity atp eventually use irreversible inhibitors ligands effectively shuts activity enough irreversible ligands bound egfr proliferation halted apoptosis triggered multiple pathways example bim activated longer inhibited erk one kinases egfr signaling even gefitinib halting progression nsclc development cancer progresses months due acquired resistances like mutation tkis like dacomitinib extended overall survival close httpsenwikipediaorgwikigefitinib
