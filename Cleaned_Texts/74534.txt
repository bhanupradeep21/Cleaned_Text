eoarctos extinct genus arctoid carnivorans known latest eocene early oligocene north dakota nebraska known several remains notable almost perfectly preserved skeleton large male comparable build size fisher small raccoon estimated body mass kg possessed variety features indicate mix terrestrial scansorial locomotion notable feature unique dentition massive premolars hypocarnivorous molars well robust mandible indicating consumed hardshelled prey possibly making oldest molluscivorous carnivoran fossils belonging eoarctos first discovered unique jaws found fitterer ranch fossil site north dakota described decades afterward although occasionally referred species subparictis dakotensis crew led paleontologist robert emry almost complete beautifully preserved fossil male arctoid later designated holotype namebearing specimen usnm emry colleague richard tedford recognized fossil represented new species planned describe already slow moving project remained unfinished death tedford however several paleontologists invited emry continue project description eoarctos vorax finally published far remains taxon nicknamed kittenotterbear describers discovered fitterer ranch locality dates late orellan early whitneyan outcrop chadronian chadron formation near roundtop genus name combination eos greek goddess dawn arctos bear species name vorax latin voracious eater general skull proportions eoarctos similar early canids hesperocyon although rostrum frontal shield broader orbital area postorbital process frontal postorbital constriction elongated snout appears relatively short however result broadening shortening atypically sutures individual skull bones strongly fused even among young adult individuals may adaption durophagous diet whereas premaxilla maxilla completely fused unfused suture premaxilla nasal indicating rather wide nasal process likely resulting gap posterior tips premaxilla anterior tips frontal seen modern ursids flat surface wide frontal suggests lacked domed forehead typical early canids crests located behind postorbital process form sharp ridge thin grove located front slight bulges along central segment sagittal crest comparatively high especially posterior end postorbital constriction minimum width mm located mm caudal postorbital process twice distance seen early canids many ursoids including eoarctos possessed elongated postorbital area possible explanation brains less inflated canids laterally expanding wings interparietal form large attachment area temporalis muscle relatively smooth supraoccipital shield also creates large wide concavity attachments deep neck muscles markedly rectus capitis dorsalis major possesses strong zygomatic arch dorsal rim curves smoothly right side small postorbital left side distinct medial rim rim squamosal process creates distinct flat dorsolaterally facing area feature seems unique eoarctos although many taxa lack similarly wellpreserved zygomatic arches making comparison difficult area arch didnt possess muscular attachments likely related processing hard food possibly related attachment masseter musculature ascending ramus zygomatic arch lateral scar attachment masseter muscle prominent runs entire length jugal another unique feature genus distinct large muscle scar area located bullae crosses basisphenoid surface among modern wolves pandas scar serves attachment area longus capitis rectus capitis ventralis muscles however located farther anteriorly eoarctos extant carnivorans eoarctos possessed moderately inflated bulla across ventral surface distinct ridge runs across half diagonal coronoid process mandible proportionally quite large tall wide rectangular outline viewed laterally anterior border mediolaterally thick indicating large masseteric fossa muscle quite deep divided ventral dorsal portions also possessed welldeveloped superficial temporalis muscle unique longitudinal groove located ventral border horizontal ramus bone distinctly swollen lingual buccal sides groove therefore flanked two longitudinal rims rims asymmetrical posterior half groove buccal ones elevated overall muscle attachment areas slightly tilted dorsally lingually bone textures suggest muscle attachment likeliest explanation groove insertion digastric muscle however lateral facet paroccipital process digastric muscle originates enlarged distinct groove found carnivorans although extinct durophagous otter siamogale shares unusually thickened horizontal ramus rough ventral surface another possible explanation unusual feature attachment genioglossus muscle horizontal ramus greatly thickened measuring mm mediolateral thickness mm deep resulting ratio thickness depth comparable siamogale bonecrushing canid borophagus however considering massive proportions jaw symphysis rather weak notably two hemimandibles fused possibly unilateral bites maximum among upper incisors similar dimensions except crown height whereas almost twice large dimensions observed lower incisors third incisor twice large first two cutting blade formed chisellike cutting edge top crowns lingual surface possesses shovellike concave surface robust canine proportionally shorter less curved hesperocyon enamel surface lacks distinct groove seen arctoids lower canine protrudes forwards possesses bulbous base among many arctoids canines showcase signs sexual dimorphism however seem case eoarctos subparictids premolars robust enlarged however development advanced eoarctos members family teeth broadened relative length typically arctoids possess surrounding cingulum lacking anterior posterior accessory cusps seen canids another features shares derived subparictids extensive crenulated textures found enamel surfaces upper premolars smallest upper premolar almost diastema separating slightly larger nothocyon possesses prominent lingual bulge supported extra root although feature extremely developed eoarctos cingulum thickest mesially lingually surrounds protocone lingually dispalaced paracone buccolingually thickened resulting occlusal outline tooth overall widened among lower premolar single rooted reduced size relatively teeth premolars double rooted possess ridges along occlusal surface anterior margin almost appear single ridge seen occlusal view similar dimensions shape one another notably larger ursoids upper molars appear mesiodistally lengthened furthermore possess somewhat rectangular outline protocones mesiodistally greatly expanded preprotocrista postprotocrista well enlarged paraconule metaconule whereas lingual cingulum shortened first lower molar low crowned trigonid even half height talonid distinct low carnassial blade formed paraconid protoconid wear facet tooth indicates contact lingual surface carnassial blade paraconule well paracone notable feature extreme shift strongly reduced trigonid mesiolingual corner tooth relative reduced anteroposterior length completely absent molars show adaptions towards overall build eoarctos comparable raccoon fisher unspecialized neck predominantly terrestrial locomotion possessed mix plesiomorphic advanced features baculum overall similar hesperocyon although deeper urethral groove proximal end derived later scapula roughly trapezoid outline diagonally divided gently curved spine possesses nearly parallel cranial caudal borders cranially protruding supraspinous fossa similar arctoids unlike straighter cranial border found canis furthermore possessed welldeveloped coracoid process extends medially slightly hooks caudally present neither modern carnivorans amphicynodon found early carnivorans viverravus clavicle eoarctos functional plesiomorphic retention miacid ancestors found modern ursids robust humerus possessed rounded head greatly expanded lateral supracondylar crest large medial epicondyle share slender proportions cursorial carnivorans greater tubercle poorly developed rather low similar amphicynodon unlike one found hesperocyon crest greater tubercle quite indistinct leading less prominent deltoid tuberosity therefore straighter humerus seen early carnivorans distal third humerus shaft occupied proximally expanded lateral supracondylar crest proximal end arises sharply creating fanshaped outline outline also seen modern ursids although possess distally located crests eoarctos distinct deltoid tuberosity crista pectoralis muscles extending greater tubercle weakly developed unlike fossorial carnivorans reduced deltopectoral crest suggests terrestrial arboreal ulna radius enlarged head robust strong shafts ulnas relatively long olecranon leans anteriorly possesses strong tilt toward medial side cranial view trochlear notch neither deep narrow cursorial taxa hesperocyon olecranon elongated enlarged aquatic fossorial among wrist bones left cuneiform similar raccoons left pisiform possesses large head protrudes ventrally posteriorly insertion flexor carpi ulnaris muscle robust shorter less ventrally protruding arboreal primates metacarpus likely widely spread metatarsals considerably longer metacarpals fourth metacarpal noticeably enlarged facet articulation uniform maximum mediolateral width equal dorsoventral length unlike carnivorans leaves room fifth metacarpals articulation unciform indistinct ventral crest ventral aspect head doesnt extend distal face cursorial canids likely eoarctos posture plantigrade proximal phalanges capable hyperextension middle fingers mc ii mc iii longer side fingers great size difference mc iii mc ii iv unique feature genus phalanges hand shorter foot length ratio mc iii compared third proximal phalanx used indicator cursorial vs arboreal adaptations comparable sloth bears raccoons claws deep middle phalanges lack adaptions seen felids proportions femur similar arctoids wider shorter canids greater trochanter height femoral head canis unlike condition seen modern ursids intertrochanteric crest welldeveloped canids almost indistinguishable trochanteric fossa isnt particular steep excavated moderately developed lesser trochanter projects medially fishers third trochanter slightly developed miacids trochlea intermediate size depth canids ursids femoral head indicates rather low abduction hind limb movements overall restricted movements however laterally oriented acetabulum suggests abduction still permitted overall features show combination various modes locomotion indicating predominantly scansorial retained ability climb trees like arctoids tibia lacked prominent tuberosity typical canids rather straight cranial border without widening proximal tibia seen cursorial canids slightly medially bowed tibia shaft results bigger distance tibia fibula orientation trochlea indicates may capable performing hindfoot reversal although wang et al consider unlikely due rarity feature modern carnivorans astragalar head strongly curved indicating considerable flexibility tarsal eoarctos member subparictidae family earlybranching ursoids restricted north america distribution family well variety early arctoids indicates north america played major role diversification carnivorans diversification alongside related canids occurred around eoceneoligocene boundary time open environments became common terrestrials even cursorial adaptions evolved response within family eoarctos recovered sister taxon nothocyon shares adaptions towards durophagy phylogeny recovered wang et al miacis sylvestris miacis gracillis canidae cynodictis spp gustafsonia cognita amphicyonidae

amphicynodon leptorhynchus campylocynodon personi drassodon harpagops allocyon loganensis cephalogale spp ursus arctos large variety features including presence astragalar foramen metatarsals without keel distal face head widespread toes fingers showcases eoarctos plantigrade animal typical caniforms canids possibly hemicyonines amphicyonid cynodictis evolved digitigrade stance limb joints capable wideranging rotations unlike cursorial carnivorans indicating arctoid pursuit predator also lacks powerful limbs flexible vertebrate columns typical semifossorial semiaquatic species however indications capable climbing trees plesiomorphic features typical earlier carnivorans including deep claw fulllength clavicle claw quite similar felids thin dorsoventrally deep although eoarctos able retract claws also lacks extreme arboreal adaptions carnivorans prehensile tail seen kinkajou furthermore features suggesting terrestrial lifestyle reduced deltopectoral crest humerus long third metacarpal indicating able travel rather large distances covering large home ranges although strongly developed modern ursids overall eoarctos likely similar raccoons fishers lifestyle spending time foraging ground capable escaping trees faced numerous eoarctos fossils showcase signs frequent dental injuries two six specimens preserving skull parts necessary comparison including holotype showcase loss premolars extensive painful infections may temporarily disabled feeding hard objects holotype lost crowns several premolars two full teeth alveolar bone density strongly reduced likely injuries observed holotype sustained crushing hard shells premolars breaking lower right teeth resulting open wounds infections including periapical infection osteomyelitis severe closure mandibular canal time animal forced use left teeth processing food broke upper left teeth crushing another hard object shows signs injuries predation likely two separate wounds prevented processing food forced starve however another specimen similar injuries survived old age despite loss premolars shifted main focus crushing hard objects first lower molars showcase extensive wear suggests eoarctos fed hardshelled food likely mollusks would make oldest known arctoid durophagous diet although teeth yet strong enough resist breakage adaptions surprising since adaptions towards durophagous diet commonly occur among much larger taxons may also supplemented diet fruits external brain morphology eoarctos rather simple expected basal caniform relatively large cerebellum small cerebrum large olfactory lobe cerebrums lateral aspect smooth globular lacking elaborations seen larger carnivorans possibly possessed proportionally largest olfactory bulb compared cerebrum carnivorans due lack comparable data taxa unclear result enlarging bulb possibly correlated development olfactory sensory lack enlargement cerebrum endocast overall similar hesperocyon less complex early amphicyonid daphoenus however encephalization quotient much lower hesperocyon similarly progressive carnivoran paragale comparable hyaenodont thinocyon miacid procynodictis quotient indicates along mode location eoarctos solitary predator furthermore supported starvation holotype following dental injuries indicating alack social care young eoarctos members family lived alongside possibly competed early canids hesperocyon leptocyon although far less common seem geographically restricted subparictids mostly recovered periphery white river group may avoided competition spatially separated canids extremely common large parts white river group eoarctos likely inhabited woodlands extensive canopy coverage may also lived peripheries nearby savannas likely possessed large home ranges stretching wooded terrains tens open areas capable travelling distances tens kilometers single day may foraged alongside riparian areas typical fitterer channel locality lacked semiaquatic adaptions likely searched mollusk prey alongside river banks wading shallow water shared habitat variety mammals including marsupials herpetotherium nanodelphys oreodont miniochoerus ruminant leptomeryx canid osbornodon bat quinetia furthermore
