ichthyosis vulgaris also known autosomal dominant ichthyosis skin disorder causing dry scaly skin common one mildest forms affecting around reason known common ichthyosis usually autosomal dominant inherited disease often associated filaggrin although rare nonheritable version called acquired ichthyosis ichthyosis vulgaris common type within ichthyoses diverse group inherited skin disorders characterized way skin produces keratin conditions share common trait causing generalized skin scaling range intensity comparison forms ichthyosis iv generally viewed least symptoms inherited form ichthyosis vulgaris usually present birth generally develop three months five years symptoms often improve age although may grow severe old ichthyosis vulgaris typically infancy signs like skin dryness xerosis skin lesions keratosis pilaris small skin bumps thickened skin palms soles palmoplantar hyperlinearity scaly skin scaly dermatosis severe cases red inflamed skin erythroderma become apparent usually age individuals condition expect regular lifespan potential complications include vitamin deficiency hearing problems due ear scaling furthermore visible changes skin significantly diminish persons quality life primary therapeutic approach physicians often recommend using creams containing urea along ceramides moisturising compounds manage ichthyosis vulgaris condition lifethreatening impact patient mild case generally restricted mild itching social impact skin unusual appearance people mild cases symptoms include scaly patches shins fine white scales forearms upper arms rough palms people mildest cases symptoms faint telltale mosaic lines achilles tendons calf muscles severe cases although rare exist severe cases entail buildup scales everywhere areas body

alphahydroxy many people severe ichthyosis problems sweating due buildup scales skin may lead problems prickly itch results afflicted skin unable sweat due buildup scales problems associated overheating majority people vulgaris sweat least little paradoxically means would comfortable living hot humid climate sweating helps shed scales improves appearance skin prevents prickly dry skin crack digits extremities create bloody cuts skin painful inflamed andor tight children adolescents psychological concerns may include inconsistent selfimage mood fluctuations due cyclical outbreaks tendency addiction possibility social withdrawal skin noticeably infected preoccupation strong air conditioning excessive consumption alcohol also increase buildup scales people ichthyosis vulgaris type atopic disease allergies eczema another common condition associated ichthyosis vulgaris keratosis pilaris small bumps mainly appearing back upper ichthyosis vulgaris common genetic disorder caused single disorder thought happen changes gene responsible making protein called profilaggrin later turns filaggrin filaggrin plays crucial role skin people gene changes profilaggrin gene also linked another skin problem called atopic dermatitis often occurs along ichthyosis vulgaris know exact gene changes responsible ichthyosis vulgaris cases usually ichthyosis vulgaris considered dominant condition means one gene change lead disease someone change chance passing child theres research suggesting might bit complex one gene change causes mild form disease youd need changes copies gene severe ichthyosis vulgaris mainly diagnosed based clinical features patient mainly physical exam findings personal family histories history age onset using family pedigree clarify pattern inheritance help specify ichthyosis vulgaris among types ichthyoses cases might hard clearly differentiate ichthyosis vulgaris ichthyoses doctor go genetic testing take biopsy make histopathology examination even test still suggestive specific ichthyosis hereditary ichthyosis vulgaris persistent condition tends improve age typically demands ongoing management seriousness acquired ichthyosis
