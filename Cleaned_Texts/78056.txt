information cascade informational cascade phenomenon described behavioral economics network theory number people make decision sequential fashion similar distinct herd information cascade generally accepted twostep process cascade begin individual must encounter scenario decision typically binary one second outside factors influence decision typically observation actions outcomes individuals similar scenarios twostep process informational cascade broken five basic components social perspectives cascades suggest agents may act irrationally eg think optimal social pressures great exist complements concept information often problem concept information cascade confused ideas match two key conditions process social proof information social influence indeed term information cascade even used refer section provides basic examples information cascades originally described bikchandani et al basic model since developed variety directions examine robustness better understand information cascades occur external information obtained previous participants event overrides ones private signal irrespective correctness former latter experiment conducted useful example process experiment consisted two urns labeled b urn contains two balls labeled one labeled b urn b contains one ball labeled two labeled b urn ball must drawn run determined randomly equal probabilities throw dice contents chosen urn emptied neutral container participants asked random order draw marble container entire process may termed run number runs performed time participant picks marble decide urn belongs decision announced benefit remaining participants room thus participant information decisions made n participants preceding also private signal label ball draws turn experimenters observed information cascade observed runs means runs cascade occurred least one participant gave precedence earlier decisions private signal possible occurrence produce wrong result phenomenon known reverse cascade persons signal telling accept denoted h high signal high signifies accept signal telling accept l low signal model assumes correct decision accept individuals likely see h conversely correct decision

compares original model makes several assumptions human behavior world humans relaxed later alternate definitions similar problems diffusion innovations literature exists examines individuals firms might respond existence informational cascades products sell buyers unsure quality products curtis taylor shows selling house seller might wish start high prices failure sell low prices indicative low quality might start cascade buying failure sell high prices could construed meaning house overpriced prices reduced get sale daniel sgroi shows firms might use guinea pigs given opportunity buy early kickstart informational cascade early public purchasing decisions work david gill daniel sgroi show early public tests might similar effect particular passing tough test biased seller instigate cascade bose et examined prices set monopolist might evolve presence potential cascade behavior monopolist consumers unsure products quality information cascades occur situations seeing many people make choice provides evidence outweighs ones judgment one thinks likely im wrong people wrong therefore termed reputational cascade late responders sometimes go along decisions early responders late responders think early responders right also perceive reputation damaged dissent early information cascades become one topics behavioral economics often seen financial markets feed speculation create cumulative excessive price moves either whole market market bubble specific asset like stock becomes overly popular among investorscitation needed marketers also use idea cascades attempt get buying cascade started new product induce initial set people adopt new product make purchasing decisions later may also adopt product even better perhaps even worse competing products effective later consumers able observe adoption decisions satisfied early customers actually choice consistent idea cascades arise naturally people see others knowcitation needed example hollywood movies test screenings suggest bigbudget movie might flop studios often decide spend initial marketing rather less aim making much money possible opening weekend word gets around turkeycitation needed information cascades usually considered economistscitation needed dotey et state information flows form cascades social network according authors analysis virality information cascades social network may lead many useful applications like determining influential individuals within network information used maximizing market effectiveness influencing public opinion various structural temporal features network affect cascade virality additionally models widely exploited problem rumor spread social network investigate reduce influence online social networks contrast work information cascades social networks social influence model belief spread argues people notion private beliefs social influence model relaxes assumption information cascades people acting observable actions taken others addition social influence model focuses embedding people within social network opposed queue finally social influence model relaxes assumption information cascade model people either complete action allowing continuous scale strength agents belief action completed information cascades also restructure social networks pass example constant low level churn social ties given month social connections often spike follow unfollow activity following information cascade sharing viral tweetsharing cascade passes network users adjust social ties particularly connected original author viral tweet author viral tweet see sudden loss previous followers sudden increase new followers part cascadedriven reorganization process information cascades also create assortative social networks people tend connected others similar characteristic tweet cascades increase similarity connected users users lose ties dissimilar users add new ties similar information cascades created news coverage media may also foster political polarization sorting social networks along political lines twitter users follow share polarized news coverage tend lose social ties users opposite addition examples information cascades shown exist several empirical studies perhaps best example given participants stood line behind urn balls different colors sequentially participants would pick ball urn looks places back urn agent voices opinion color balls red blue majority urn rest participants hear participants get monetary reward guess correctly forcing concept rationality examples include negative effects informational cascades sometimes become legal concern laws enacted neutralize ward farnsworth law professor analyzed legal aspects informational cascades gave several examples book legal analyst many military courts officers voting decide case vote reverse rank order officer lowest rank votes first suggested may done lowerranked officers would tempted cascade vote senior officers believed accurate judgement another example countries israel france laws prohibit polling days weeks elections prevent effect informational cascade may influence election one informational cascade study compared thought processes greek german organic farmers suggesting discrepancies based upon cultural socioeconomic even cascades extrapolated ideas financial volatility monetary policy helmut wagner wolfram berger suggested cascades analytical vehicle examine changes financial market became globalized wagner berger noticed structural changes framework understanding financial markets due globalization giving rise volatility capital flow spawning uncertainty affected central additionally information cascades useful understanding origins terrorist tactics attack black september occurred hard see similarities tactics baadermeinhof group also known red army faction examples portray process cascades put use moreover important understand framework cascades move forward globalized society
