shapiro maintains many genome changes occur naturally operate similar molecular dna rearrangements applied intentionally scientists using genetic engineering techniques developed last decades example transposable elements may amplified moved different locations genome dna changes found result distributed genomic networks execution wide range complex traits fungi diatoms plants animals flower
