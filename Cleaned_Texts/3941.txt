mac address anonymization performs oneway function mac address result may used tracking systems reporting general public making nearly impossible obtain original mac address result idea process allows companies like track users movements via computer hardware simultaneously preserve identities people tracking well hardware example mac address anonymization would use simple hash algorithm given address hash algorithm produces hexadecimal address one character different produces entirely different hash due avalanche effect problem lies fact possible mac addresses given encoding algorithm index easily created possible address using rainbow table compression index made small enough portable building index embarrassingly parallel problem work accelerated greatly eg renting large amount cloud computing resources temporarily example single cpu compute encrypted macs per second generating full table takes cpuyears fleet cpus would take around hours using rainbow table depth hashes per entry resulting table would contain hundred million entries gb require seconds average ignoring io time reverse encrypted mac original form academics found modern computing equipment ability calculate giga hashes mega hashes per second authors able recover million hashes another approach tested truncating mac address removing organizationally unique identifier first bits bit mac however total organizationally unique identifier space allocated manufacturers fully utilise allocated mac address space fails offer meaningful privacy furthermore manufacturers frequently assign contiguous address blocks specific devices allows finegrained mapping devices use allowing device type identified small part mac due pitfalls existing approaches robust anonymization approaches developed particular junade ali vladimir dyo developed approach works degree resulting hash truncated balancing act privacy offered desired collision rate probability one anonymised mac address overlap another previous work suggested therefore difficult control anonymity set size using approximations birthday instead ali dyo use overall rate collision dataset provide probability collision p calculated p n displaystyle mac addresses n possible hash digests therefore digests bits possible store mac addresses rate collisions less httpsenwikipediaorgwikimacaddressanonymization
