triune brain model evolution vertebrate forebrain behavior proposed american physician neuroscientist paul maclean triune brain consists reptilian complex basal ganglia paleomammalian complex limbic

set interconnected brain structures paper macleans recognition limbic system major functional system brain widely accepted among neuroscientists generally regarded important contribution field maclean maintained structures limbic system arose early mammalian evolution hence paleomammalian paleo meaning old responsible motivation emotion involved feeding reproductive behaviour parental behaviourcitation needed consists cerebral neocortex structure found uniquely higher mammals especially humans maclean regarded addition recent step evolution mammalian brain conferring ability language abstraction planning perceptioncitation needed triune brain model argues structures relatively independent one another still connected form model views different cognitive behaviors caused three different entities instead one reptilian complex said control instinctual impulsive actions neomammalian complex responsible keeping primitive instincts constrained example controlling impulse eating seems one hungry means reptilian complex commanding body eat however individual rational choice eat hungry rational thought said controlled neomammalian complex model thus suggest two three depending situation structures perpetual battle control body interactions neocortex reptilian brain often seem competitive conscious thought generated neocortex suppress primitive thoughts generated reptilian complex thus model suggests interactions structures constructive conflicting due anatomical separation brain separation structures proposed underlying difference consciousness unconscious behaviour argued reason humans intelligent conscious species due notsocommon neocortex possess unlike detachment contributes idea three complexes interact separately rather single construct interacting maclean originally formulated triune brain hypothesis drawing comparative neuroanatomical work done ludwig edinger elizabeth c crosby charles judson herrick early twentieth saw rebirth interest comparative neuroanatomy motivated part availability variety new neuroanatomical techniques charting circuitry animal brains subsequent findings according human brain evolution expert terrence deacon refined traditional neuroanatomical ideas upon maclean based hypothesis deacon mentioned evolutionary addition different parts brain simply realistic however parts brain already existing developed upon homosapien species evolved gained life example basal ganglia structures derived floor forebrain making macleans reptilian complex shown take much smaller portion forebrains reptiles birds together called sauropsids previously supposed exist amphibians fish well mammals sauropsids basal ganglia found forebrains modern vertebrates likely date common evolutionary ancestor vertebrates million years ago rather origin reptilescitation needed recent behavioral studies support traditional view sauropsid behavior stereotyped ritualistic macleans reptilian complex birds shown possess highly sophisticated cognitive abilities toolmaking new caledonian crow languagelike categorization abilities grey structures limbic system maclean proposed arose early mammals shown exist across range modern vertebrates paleomammalian trait parental care offspring widespread birds occurs fishes well thus like basal ganglia evolution systems presumably dates common vertebrate finally recent studies based paleontological data comparative anatomical evidence strongly suggest neocortex already present earliest emerging addition although nonmammals neocortex true sense structure
