colin chapman professor vancouver island university british columbia canada addition fellow royal society canada honorary lecturer makerere university uganda member committee research exploration national associate scientists wildlife conservation society new york prior taking position mcgill university university florida department zoology internationally recognized years research primate ecology population regulation nutrition disease dynamics contribution conservation globally director kibale monkey project longterm project kibale national park uganda started building data thomas struhsaker duke university worked kibale project focuses primate ecology conservation also strong component examining forest dynamics including driven climate change elephant numbers forest succession team researchers worked also placed heavy emphasis conservation strategies including forest regeneration animal population recovery fragmentation peopleparks relationships zoonotic disease spread link providing health care conservation chapman born edmonton alberta canada degrees bsc phd university alberta obtained joint phd supervision drs linda fedigan john addicott jan murie went postdoc louis lefebvre biology mcgill university richard wrangham anthropology harvard university prior coming harvard conducted primate research caribbean st kitts costa rica harvard started research kibale national park uganda interest conservation started costa rica time growth countries park system conducted surveys area become guanacaste national park aim helping daniel janzen evaluate wildlife recovery conservation became tenet research uganda helped establish makerere university biological field develop chimpanzee ecotourism encouraged local community establish small scale sustainable ecotourism efforts aided fisheries management plans worked evaluating forest regeneration uganda wildlife contributed making kibale field stations sustainable forming consortium university users establishing core courses come station canadian field studies africa tropical biology association makerere university established clinic mobile clinic clinics act instrument park local communities clinics provide subsidized health care return improved parkpeople throughout time put great deal effort training ugandan students park personnel early career interested ecological factors influencing group size social organization population regulation later interest led conservation plight primates witnessed course research early phd became interested determined size spider monkey ateles geoffroyi groups eventually lead formalize coined ecological constraints challenge daniel janzen show primates ecologically significant role lead study seed dispersal role primates forest regeneration tropical tree dynamics forest regeneration remained subject revisited throughout research career demonstrate longitudinal dynamics regeneration observed different parts forest experienced different degrees disturbance kibale became fascinated red colobus determinants group size lead groups individuals variation abundance led study nutritional ecology disease ecology document longterm change friendship tom struhsaker duke university extensive data encompassed research really lead dr chapman quantify longterm patterns data became invaluable globally researchers became aware climate change fact old growth forests much dynamic previously believedcitation needed chapman worked issues dealing understanding animal group size composition since phd formalized ecological constraints model ideas relatively simple various researchers suggested grouping confers predictable benefits differences group size explained widely accepted potential cost grouping thought reduction foraging efficiency individuals dietary requirements means animals either fight food one animal group beats another food thus second animal comes area simply food left situations thought competition food leads animals travel farther size group increases logic behind argument relatively simple animals must forage area meet energetic nutritional requirements follows increase group size increase area must covered find adequate food supplies thus individuals must travel expend energy large group forage smaller group increase time spent traveling point approached energy spent travel costly smaller groups become advantageous way ecological factors influence movement patterns foraging efficiency thereby constraining size groups efficiently exploit available food resources ideas formalized become known ecological constraints shown predict group size variety primates ecological constraint model found supported different primate species variety diet chimpanzees pan spider monkeys ateles red colobus procolobus redtailed guenon cercopithecus ursine colobus monkeys colobus vellerosus tropical forests beautiful biodiverse ecosystem face planet yet gravely threatened recent global assessments report million forest lost tropics forest loss increased per ultimately changes forest cover driven increased human population size natural resource consumption rates african countries tropical forest human population density increased people per people per increasingly dire situation threatens biodiversity clear extreme poverty rapid loss biodiversity intimately linked extreme poverty biodiversity hotspots geographically coincident people living next tropical protected areas poorest people world suffer often acute health problems example uganda country chapman worked last years deaths among children ages caused malaria disease could easily treated prevented children age five situation means effective conservation occur local community must involved often means receive benefits chapman implemented systems link health provision conservation receiving money employment park definitely beneficial appreciated saving life young child suffering malaria enormous benefit unmeasurable parent chapman first established clinic meet health needs local people subsequently since kibale large many people could travel clinic brought ambulance canada kibale act mobile clinic mobile health clinic travels around park bringing basic health care family planning deworming hivaids treatment counselling vaccinations health conservation education remote villagers staff also provide public talks disease prevention chapman taken sort approach working local community help obtain needs identify still administering strict wildlife protection conservation efforts
