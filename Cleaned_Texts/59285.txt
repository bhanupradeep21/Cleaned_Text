social learning theory learning process social behavior proposes new behaviors acquired observing imitating states learning cognitive process takes place social context occur purely observation direct instruction even absence motor reproduction direct addition observation behavior learning also occurs observation rewards punishments process known vicarious reinforcement particular behavior rewarded regularly likely persist conversely particular behavior constantly punished likely theory expands traditional behavioral theories behavior governed solely reinforcements placing emphasis important roles various internal processes learning b f skinner delivered series lectures verbal behavior putting forth empirical approach subject existed psychology proposed use stimulusresponse theories

cognitivebehavioral therapy noam chomsky published skinners book verbal behavior extension skinners initial review chomsky stated pure stimulusresponse theories behavior could account process language acquisition argument contributed significantly psychologys cognitive revolution theorized human beings somehow specially designed understand acquire language ascribing definite unknown cognitive mechanism within context albert bandura studied learning processes occurred interpersonal contexts view adequately explained either theories operant conditioning existing models social bandura began conduct studies rapid acquisition novel behaviors via social observation famous bobo doll experiments book social learning personality development bandura richard walters argued weaknesses learning approaches discount influence social variables nowhere clearly revealed treatment acquisition novel skinners explanation acquisition new responses relied process successive approximation required multiple trials reinforcement components behavior gradual rotters theory proposed likelihood behavior occurring function subjective expectancy value according bandura model account response yet learned though contention address likelihood generalization related situations would produce behaviors new bandura went write book social learning theory social learning theory integrated behavioral cognitive theories learning order provide comprehensive model could account wide range learning experiences occur real world initially outlined bandura walters theory entirely behavioral nature crucial element made innovative increasingly influential emphasis upon role imitation years however bandura shifted cognitive perspective led major revision theory time key tenets social learning theory stated typical stimulusresponse theories rely entirely upon direct experience stimulus inform behavior bandura opens scope learning mechanisms introducing observation adds ability modeling means humans represent actual outcomes models cognitively mediated allow future consequences much impact actual consequences would typical sr theory important factor social learning theory concept reciprocal determinism notion states individuals behavior influenced environment environment also influenced individuals words persons behavior environment personal qualities reciprocally influence example child plays violent video games likely influence peers play well encourages child play oftencitation needed social learning theory draws heavily concept modeling described bandura outlined three types modeling exactly information gleaned observation influenced type model well series cognitive behavioral processes social learning theory recently applied alongside used justify theory cultural cultural intelligence hypothesis argues humans possess set specific behaviors skills allow exchange information hinges model human learning social learning key humans selected traits maximize opportunities social learning theory builds extant social theory suggesting social learning abilities like banduras cognitive processes required modeling correlate forms intelligence experimental evidence shown humans overimitate behavior compared chimpanzees lending credence idea selected methods social academics suggested ability learn socially culturally led success recent research neuroscience implicated mirror neurons neurophysiology basis social learning observational learning motor cognition social mirror neurons heavily linked social learning humans mirror neurons first discovered primates studies involved teaching monkey motor activity tasks one study focused teaching primates crack nuts hammer primate witnessed another individual cracking nuts hammer mirror neuron systems became activated primate learned use hammer crack nuts however primate presented social learning opportunity mirror neuron systems activate learning similar studies humans also show similar evidence human mirror neuron system activating observing another person perform physical task activation mirror neuron system thought critical understanding goal directed behaviors understanding intention although still controversial provides direct neurological link understanding social social work theories taken many disciplines criminology education even though social learning theory comes psychology theory also applied study social social learning theory important social work observation others example child watches sibling daily routine likely going want copy routine step step feedback reinforcement help individuals learn adopt new behaviors social workers use feedback reinforcements help clients make positive changes example social worker might provide feedback reinforcement client made progress toward goal maintaining sobriety social learning provides useful framework social workers help clients make positive changes leveraging power social influence modeling social learning theory explained shown many different examples depression social learning discussed variety example person depression may withdraw social situations avoid interacting others may feel like dont anything contribute conversations others wont understand depression make difficult people find motivation engage social activities may also feel like takes much energy interact would rather stay home alone social learning theory provides framework understanding role social factors depression developing interventions promote positive behaviors attitudes social learning theory emphasizes importance observing modeling behaviors attitudes beliefs others promoting health behaviors promoting positive healthy habits big part educators even social workers teachers expected teach students behave class example teacher desires students quiet talking teach teacher talking quiet teachers also expected teach role play tell stories also classroom another example peer led health programs effectively promote health behaviors among adolescents young adults using social learning behaviors attitudes provide social support positive changes community based interventions use social learning theory principles promote healthy behaviors community levels addiction related social learning theory emphasizes role social influences reinforces development maintenance addictive behaviors social learning theory suggests people learn adopt behaviors observation experience reinforcement social interactions case addiction individuals may learn adopt substance use behaviors peers family members media exposure positive reinforcement pleasure relief stress additionally social learning theory highlights importance social context reinforcing addictive behaviors social situations norms may influence decision engage substance use social learning theory proposes addiction learned behavior influenced environmental social factors one modernday example social learning theory action phenomenon viral challenges social media challenges involve individuals performing specific action task usually purpose entertainment sharing video online community according banduras social learning theory people learn new behaviors observing imitating actions others case viral challenges individuals watch others perform specific task imitate behavior completing challenge example als ice bucket

celebrities politicians also participating raised million als another example feelings challenge took place social media summer challenge involved people dancing drakes song feelings alongside moving car sharing video online challenge initially started instagram user theshiggyshow quickly gained popularity across social media examples demonstrate social learning theory applied realworld phenomena
