eukaryotic translation biological process messenger rna translated proteins eukaryotes consists four phases initiation elongation termination recapping translation initiation process ribosome associated factors bind mrna assembled start codon process defined either capdependent ribosome binds initially cap travels stop codon capindependent ribosome initially bind cap initiation translation usually involves interaction certain key proteins initiation factors special tag bound mrna molecule cap well utr proteins bind small ribosomal subunit hold mrna place associated ribosomal subunit
