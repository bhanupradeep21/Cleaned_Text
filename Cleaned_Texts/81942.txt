polyvalent influenza vaccine type influenza vaccine provides immunity one type second week receiving flu shot bodys immune system triggered antigens body starts producing antibodies antibodies help fight influenza viruses influenza symptoms deaths prevented getting influenza vaccine every currently circulating influenza strains cause seasonal epidemics include influenza viruses divided subtype influenza b influenza viruses first identified group scientists wilson smith pp laidlaw ch andrewes discovered bacteria infection throat samples patients infected influenza concluded virus caused disease researchers thomas francis jonas salk developed first influenza vaccine university michigan vaccine tested safety effectiveness united states army afterward licensed use however researchers suspected one viral strain influenza patients develop antibodies strain discovered undergoing many investigations researchers discovered influenza b virus thus influenza b virus added vaccines packaged bivalent vaccine multiple types polyvalent influenza vaccines available market including eggbased cellbased recombinant influenza vaccines world health organisation announce viral strains included flu vaccines annually starting influenza vaccines quadrivalent containing two influenza two influenza b called quadrivalent influenza vaccines qivs vaccination may also cause range adverse effects patients fever injection site pain anaphylaxis severe allergic reaction wide variety influenza vaccines classified types different manufacturing processes eggbased influenza vaccines produced oldest production process method used years first viruses cloned fertilised chicken eggs incubated usually last several days wanted viruses allowed replicate target viruses harvested eggs inactivated killed purified advantage eggbased influenza vaccines low cost production require sophisticated setup however supply vaccines dependent supply eggs thus production process usually lasts months moreover changes may occur growing flu viruses hen eggs called eggadapted changes lead differences genes structures candidate viruses eggs circulating wild viruses result less effective antibodies made immune system humans hence eggbased vaccines may lower efficacy flu cellbased vaccines referred vaccines virus strains cultured mammalian cells instead hens eggs therefore used people egg allergies contraindiacted eggbased selected vaccine viruses combined mammalian cells one possible type madindarby canine kidney mdck cells allowing viruses reproduce couple days harvested killed purified contrast eggbased influenza vaccines polyvalent influenza vaccines derived mammalian cells protected eggadaptation changes result viruses cultured mammalian cells share structural similarities prevalent viruses theoretically vaccines produced cell culture may effective vaccines produced hen making comparison efficacy cellbased eggbased vaccines systematic review english spanishlanguage studies abundantly clear findings differences effectiveness two kinds influenza another comparative study reflected efficacy quadrivalent vaccines originated cells superior eggbased quadrivalent vaccines among elderly population aged united advantage cellbased vaccine affected egg shortage also scalable higher production cost eggbased vaccines recombinant vaccine require flu viruses fertilised eggs manufacturing process first licensed us food drug administration children recommended use recombinant vaccine administration recombinant vaccine people aged manufacturing process virus gene first obtained contains information expression ha antigen characterizes flu virus antigen trigger human immunity produce antibodies result flu symptoms body using recombinant

collected bulk purified packaged recombinant flu recombinant influenza vaccine proven effective older age groups clinical trial approved funded cdc recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine generated greater fold rise antibody response inactivated trivalent highdose influenza vaccine elderly ranging years old recombinant quadrivalent vaccines also protective larger range circulating another randomized clinical trial conducted effectiveness recombinant vaccine eggbased inactivated flu vaccine compared population aged contrast eggbased vaccine recombinant flu vaccine significantly reduced risk influenzalike illness based worldwide virological surveillance world health organization makes recommendations vaccine formulation every year annual trivalent influenza vaccinations tivs contain one influenza b virus two influenza antigens previously meanwhile efficacy trivalent vaccines depends closely vaccination viral strains match prevalent viral antigens nonetheless several mismatches influenza b virus vaccines circulating viruses past years response suggested including one influenza b surface protein qivs developed provide people protection influenza b regarding currently available literature qivs slightly reduce influenza brelated morbidity well mortality ranging compared tivs therefore qivs proven effective protecting people influenza b addition one influenza b virus thus qivs save healthcare costs partially cover higher price compared tivs qivs costeffective tivs however costeffectiveness qivs depends mainly matching influenza b virus strains circulating strains prices qivs tivs words costeffectiveness qivs vary influenza vaccines suitable persons six months age advised get types influenza vaccines may approved ages flu vaccines may also potentially effective others certain age groups example united states centers disease control prevention cdc preferentially recommended quadrivalent vaccines like highdose flu vaccines recombinant influenza vaccines adjuvanted flu vaccines people injection one make sure type vaccine suitable age people egg allergy chronic health conditions currently pregnant get however exceptions people avoid types vaccines extreme cases completely avoid influenza vaccines example children months small get vaccination quadrivalent recombinant vaccine approved people aged furthermore people serious allergy ingredient flu
