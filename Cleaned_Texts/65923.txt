ablative brain surgery also known brain lesioning surgical ablation various methods brain tissue treat neurological psychological disorders word ablation stems latin word ablatus meaning carried away cases however ablative brain surgery involve removing brain tissue rather destroying tissue leaving lesions causes irreversible target nuclei ablative surgery deep brain stimulation nuclei motor thalamus globus pallidus subthalamic ablative brain surgery first introduced pierre flourens french physiologist removed different parts nervous system animals observed effects caused removal certain parts example animal could move arm certain part removed assumed region would control arm movements method removal part brain termed experimental ablation use experimental ablation flourens claimed find area brain controlled heart rate ablative brain surgery also often used research tool neurobiology example ablating specific brain regions observing differences animals subjected behavioral tests functions removed areas may inferred experimental ablation used research animals research considered unethical humans due irreversible effects damages caused lesion ablation brain tissues however effects brain lesions caused accidents diseases behavior observed draw conclusions functions different parts parkinsons disease pd progressive degenerative disease basal ganglia characterized loss dopaminergic cells substantia nigra pars compacta surgical ablation used treat parkinsons disease pallidum common surgical target unilateral pallidotomy improves tremor dyskinesia one side body opposite side brain surgery bilateral pallidotomy found cause irreversible deterioration speech cognitioncitation needed two rapidly evolving potential surgical approaches parkinsons disease deep brain stimulation dbs restorative deep brain stimulation surgical treatment involving implantation neurostimulator medical device sometimes called brain pacemaker sends electrical impulses specific parts brain generally deep brain stimulation surgery considered preferable ablation effect adjustable advent deep brain stimulation important advance treatment parkinsons disease dbs may employed management medicationrefractory tremor treatmentrelated motor complications may benefit patients stage disease course dbs high frequency often behavioral effects similar lesioning australia patients pd reviewed specialized dbs teams assess likely benefits risks associated dbs aim guidelines assist neurologists general physicians identify patients may benefit referral dbs team common indications referral motor fluctuations andor dyskinesias adequately controlled optimised medical therapy medicationrefractory tremor intolerance medical therapy early referral consideration dbs recommended soon optimised medical therapy fails offer satisfactory motor thalamus another potential target treating tremor countries subthalamic nucleus although united states due severe side effects stimulation portions thalamus lesioning used various psychiatric neurological conditions practiced movement disorders target motor nuclei thalamotomy another surgical option treatment parkinsons disease however rigidity fully controlled successful thalamotomy replaced hypotonia furthermore significant complications occur example left ventrallateral thalamotomy righthanded patient results verbal deterioration right thalamotomy causes visualspatial however patients dbs feasible ablation subthalamic nucleus shown safe dbs suitable certain patients patients immunodeficiencies example situation dbs suitable procedure however major reason dbs often performed cost high cost dbs performed regions world wealthy case circumstances permanent lesion subthalamic nucleus stn created favourable surgical surgical procedure going done nondominant side brain lesion might favored evade numerous pacemaker replacements patients gain relief stimulation devoid side effects need pacemaker change may lesion performed position stimulation parameters act guide preferred size order identify part brain destroyed new techniques micro electrode mapping cluster headaches occur cyclical patterns gives condition name cluster headache one painful types headache cluster headache sometimes called alarm clock headache commonly awakens middle night intense pain around eye one side head bouts frequent attacks may last weeks months drug treatment fails invasive nerve stimulation procedure shows promisecitation needed cluster headaches treated ablation trigeminal nerve effective surgical treatments cluster headaches ablative psychosurgery continues used centres various us centres including massachusetts general hospital carry ablative psychosurgical united examples countries technique still used peoples republic china surgical ablation used treat psychological neurological disorders particularly schizophrenia also including clinical depression obsessivecompulsive official xinhua news agency since reported chinas ministry health banned procedure schizophrenia severely restricted practice recent studies deep brain stimulation dbs beginning replace ablative brain surgery severe psychiatric conditions generally treatment resistant obsessivecompulsive experimental ablation involves drilling holes skull animal inserting electrode small tube called cannula brain using stereotactic apparatus brain lesion created conducting electricity electrode damages targeted area brain likewise chemicals inserted cannula could possibly damages area interest comparing prior behavior animal lesion researcher predict function damaged brain recently lasers shown effective ablation cerebral cerebellar tissue laser technology called mriguided laser example allows great precision location size lesion causes little thermal damage adjacent tissue texas childrens hospital one first use mri guided method destroy treat brain lesions effectively precisely prime example patient hospital longer undergoes frequent seizures success mriguided laser ablation also used ablating brain prostate liver tumors heating freezing also alternative methods ablative brain sham lesion way researchers give placebo lesion animals involved experimental ablation whenever cannula electrode placed brain tissue unintended additional damage caused instrument sham lesion simply placement lesioning instrument spot would placed regular lesion chemical electrical process technique allows researchers properly compare appropriate control group controlling damage done separate intended excitotoxic lesion process excitatory amino acid injected brain using cannula amino acid used kill neurons essentially stimulating death kainic acid example excitatory amino acid used type lesion one crucial benefit lesion specificity chemicals selective damage surrounding axons nearby neurons target radio frequency rf lesions produced electrodes placed brain tissue rf current alternating current high frequency process current passes tissue produces heat kills cells surrounding area unlike excitotoxic lesions rf lesions destroy everything nearby vicinity electrode use ablative brain surgery nucleus accumbens wrong
