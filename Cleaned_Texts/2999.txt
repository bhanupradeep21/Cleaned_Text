phenology study periodic events biological life cycles influenced seasonal interannual variations climate well habitat factors examples include date emergence leaves flowers first flight butterflies first appearance migratory birds date leaf colouring fall deciduous trees dates egglaying birds amphibia timing developmental cycles temperatezone honey bee colonies scientific literature ecology term used generally indicate time frame seasonal biological phenomena including dates last appearance eg seasonal phenology species may april september many phenomena sensitive small variations climate especially temperature phenological records useful proxy temperature historical climatology especially study climate change global warming example viticultural records grape harvests europe used reconstruct record summer growing season temperatures going back addition providing longer historical baseline instrumental measurements phenological observations provide high temporal resolution
