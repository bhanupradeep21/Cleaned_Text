basilosaurus meaning king lizard genus large predatory prehistoric archaeocete whale late eocene approximately million years ago mya first described first archaeocete prehistoric whale known fossils attributed type species b cetoides discovered united states originally thought giant reptile hence suffix saurus ancient greek lizard animal later found early marine mammal prompted attempts renaming creature failed rules zoological nomenclature dictate using original name given fossils later found second species b isis egypt western sahara morocco jordan tunisia fossils also unearthed southeastern united states basilosaurus thought common tethys one largest animals paleogene top predator environment preying sharks large fish marine mammals namely dolphinlike dorudon seems predominant food source basilosaurus one point wastebasket taxon genus slowly started getting reevaluated many species different eocene cetacean assigned genus past however invalid reclassified new
