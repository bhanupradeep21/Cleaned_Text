retinopathy damage retina eyes may cause vision retinopathy often refers retinal vascular disease damage retina caused abnormal blood agerelated macular degeneration technically included umbrella term retinopathy often discussed separate entity retinopathy retinal vascular disease broadly categorized proliferative nonproliferative types frequently retinopathy ocular manifestation systemic disease seen diabetes diabetes common cause retinopathy us diabetic retinopathy leading cause blindness workingaged accounts blindness worldwide designated priority eye disease world health many people often symptoms late disease course patients often become symptomatic irreversible symptoms usually painful include development retinopathy broken proliferative nonproliferative types types cause disease altering normal blood flow retina different mechanisms retina supplied small vessel branches central retinal proliferative retinopathy refers damage caused abnormal blood vessel normally angiogenesis natural part tissue growth formation unusually high fast rate angiogenesis overgrowth blood vessels called neovascularization nonproliferative type abnormal blood flow retina occurs due direct damage compromise blood vessels many causes retinopathy may cause proliferative nonproliferative types though causes associated one type nonproliferative retinopathy often caused direct damage remodeling small blood vessels supplying many common causes nonproliferative damage include hypertensive retinopathy retinopathy prematurity radiation retinopathy solar retinopathy sickle cell retinopathy anemic including secondary vitamin three main mechanisms damage nonproliferative retinopathy blood vessel damage remodeling direct retinal damage occlusion blood vessels first mechanism indirect damage altering blood vessels supply retina case hypertension high pressures system cause walls artery thicken effectively reduces amount blood flow reduction flow causes tissue ischemia leading damage atherosclerosis hardening narrowing blood vessels also reduces flow retina second mechanism direct damage retina usually caused free radicals causes oxidative damage retina radiation solar retinopathy retinopathy prematurity fall category third common mechanism occlusion blood flow caused either physically blocking vessels retinal artery branches causing arteries result reduced blood flow retina causing tissue damage sickle cell disease compromises blood flow causing blood sludge thicken flow slowly retinal arteries disorders cause hyperviscosity syndrome may also cause blood sludging lastly clots central artery thrombosis directly blocks flow retina causing cells die proliferative retinopathy result aberrant blood flow retina due blood vessel overgrowth neovascularization pathologically overgrown blood vessels often fragile weak ineffective perfusing retinal weak fragile vessels also often leaky allowing fluids protein debris leach retina also prone hemorrhage due poor strength makes proliferative types retinopathy risky since vessel hemorrhaging often leads vision loss many causes mentioned nonproliferative retinopathy may also cause proliferative retinopathy later stages angiogenesis neovascularization tend later manifestation nonproliferative retinopathy many types nonproliferative retinopathies result tissue ischemia direct retinal damage body responds trying increase blood flow damaged retinal diabetes mellitus causes diabetic retinopathy common cause proliferative retinopathy genetic mutations rare causes certain retinopathies usually xlinked including ndp family genes causing norrie disease fevr coats disease among others emerging evidence may genetic predisposition patients develop retinopathy prematurity diabetic trauma especially head several diseases may cause purtschers retinopathy physical exertion like weight lifting aerobic exercise coughing sneezing straining stool vomiting sexual intercourse blowing balloons blowing musical instruments cardiopulmonary resuscitation compression injuries may cause valsalva retinopathy diagnosed ophthalmologist optometrist eye examination clinician need examine retina back eye make diagnosis several ways examine retina clinician directly view retina looking pupil light cases clinician dilate pupil make better stereoscopic fundus photography gold standard diagnosis retinopathy telemedicine programs available allow primary care clinics take images using specially designed retinal imaging equipment shared electronically specialists locations community health center inc implemented telemedicine retinal screening program lowincome patients diabetes part patients annual visits federally qualified health retinopathy often secondary diseases diabetes hypertension controlling blood sugar levels blood pressure shown help decrease incidence retinopathy blood sugar control someone diabetes high risk diabetes important blood sugar levels checked gold standard blood sugar test test many studies suggested lowering levels someone elevated levels lower incidence progression retinopathy fortunately blood sugar control benefits beyond eye primary care physician help blood sugar control strategies blood pressure control controlling blood pressure also lower incidence progression retinopathy primary care physician help blood pressure control strategies besides blood sugar blood pressure control modifications help regular exercise may help lower incidence progression retinopathy someone sleep apnea treatment sleep apnea may help well treatment based cause retinopathy may include laser therapy retina laser photocoagulation therapy standard treatment many types retinopathy evidence shows laser therapy generally safe improves visual symptoms sickle cell diabetic recent years targeting pathway controlling vessel growth angiogenesis promising vascular endothelial growth factor vegf seems play vital role promoting neovascularization using antivegf drugs antibodies sequester growth factor research shown significant reduction extent vessel outgrowth low quality evidence supports use antivegf antibodies bevacizumab pegaptanib seems improve outcomes used conjunction laser therapy treat retinopathy prematurity longer term systemic effects known evidence poorer treatment diabetic retinopathy use antivegf drugs appear improve outcomes clinically significant way compared standard laser therapy diabetic two common causes retinopathy include diabetic retinopathy retinopathy prematurity diabetic retinopathy affects million people retinopathy prematurity affect premature infants year hypertensive retinopathy next common cause affecting anywhere nondiabetic httpsenwikipediaorgwikiretinopathy
