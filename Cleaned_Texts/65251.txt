various nonhuman animal species exhibit behavior interpreted homosexual bisexual may include samesex sexual activity courtship affection pair bonding parenting among samesex animal various forms found every major geographic region every major animal group sexual behavior nonhuman animals takes many different forms even within species though homosexual behavior best known social species scientists perceive homosexual behavior animals different degrees paper states samesex sexual behavior observed previous book canadian biologist bruce bagemihl states samesex behavior comprising courtship sexual pairbonding parental activities documented species animals although samesex interactions involving genital contact reported hundreds animal species routinely manifested including simon levay stated although homosexual behavior common animal world seems uncommon individual animals longlasting predisposition engage behavior exclusion heterosexual activities thus homosexual orientation one speak
