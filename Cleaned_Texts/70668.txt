hallmarks cancer originally six biological capabilities acquired multistep development human tumors since increased eight capabilities two enabling capabilities idea coined douglas hanahan robert weinberg paper hallmarks cancer published january hallmarks constitute organizing principle rationalizing complexities neoplastic disease include sustaining proliferative signaling evading growth suppressors resisting cell death enabling replicative immortality inducing angiogenesis activating invasion metastasis underlying hallmarks genome instability generates genetic diversity expedites acquisition inflammation fosters multiple hallmark functions addition cancer cells tumors exhibit another dimension complexity incorporate community recruited ostensibly normal cells contribute acquisition hallmark traits creating tumor microenvironment recognition widespread applicability concepts increasingly affect development new means treat human update published hallmarks cancer next generation weinberg hanahan proposed two new hallmarks abnormal metabolic pathways evasion immune system two enabling characteristics genome instability cancer cells defects control mechanisms govern often divide feedback systems regulate control mechanisms ie defects homeostasis normal cells grow divide many controls growth grow stimulated growth factors damaged molecular brake stops dividing repaired cant repaired commit programmed cell death apoptosis divide limited number times part tissue structure remain belong need blood supply grow mechanisms must overcome order cell develop cancer mechanism controlled several proteins critical protein must malfunction mechanisms proteins become nonfunctional malfunctioning dna sequence genes damaged acquired somatic mutations mutations inherited occur conception occurs series steps hanahan weinberg refer hallmarks typically cells body require hormones molecules act signals grow divide cancer cells however ability grow without external signals multiple ways cancer cells producing signals known autocrine signalling permanently activating signalling pathways respond signals destroying switches prevents excessive growth signals negative feedback addition cell division normal noncancerous cells tightly controlled cancer cells processes deregulated proteins control altered leading increased growth cell division within tightly control cell division cells processes within prevent cell growth division processes orchestrated proteins known tumor suppressor genes genes take information cell ensure ready divide halt division dna damaged example cancer tumour suppressor proteins altered dont effectively prevent cell division even cell severe abnormalities another way cells prevent overdivision normal cells also stop dividing cells fill space touch cells known contact inhibition cancer cells contact inhibition continue grow divide regardless cells ability selfdestruct process known apoptosis required organisms grow develop properly maintaining tissues body also initiated cell damaged infected cancer cells however lose ability even though cells may become grossly abnormal undergo apoptosis cancer cells may altering mechanisms detect damage abnormalities means proper signaling occur thus apoptosis activate may also defects downstream signaling proteins involved apoptosis also prevent proper cells body dont normally ability divide indefinitely limited number divisions cells become unable divide senescence die crisis cause barriers primarily due dna end chromosomes known telomeres telomeric dna shortens every cell division becomes short activates senescence cell stops dividing cancer cells bypass barrier manipulating enzymes telomerase increase length telomeres thus divide indefinitely without initiating mammalian cells intrinsic program hayflick limit limits multiplication doublings point reach stage senescence limit overcome disabling prb tumor suppressor proteins allows continue doubling reach stage called crisis apoptosis karyotypic disarray occasional emergence immortalized cell double without limit tumor cells immortalized counting device cell doublings telomere decreases size loses nucleotides ends chromosomes cell cycle cancers upregulate telomerase extend telomeres remaining use method called alternative lengthening normal tissues body blood vessels running deliver oxygen lungs cells must close blood vessels get enough oxygen survive new blood vessels formed development embryos wound repair female reproductive cycle expanding tumour requires new blood vessels deliver adequate oxygen cancer cells thus exploits normal physiological processes benefit cancer cells acquire ability orchestrate production new vasculature activating angiogenic switch control noncancerous cells present tumor form blood vessels reducing production factors inhibit blood vessel production increasing production factors promote blood vessel one well known properties cancer cells ability invade neighboring tissues dictates whether tumor benign malignant property enables dissemination around body cancer cells undergo multitude changes order acquire ability metastasize multistep process starts local invasion cells surrounding tissues invade blood vessels survive harsh environment circulatory system exit system start dividing new ncri conference talk hanahan proposed two new emerging hallmarks two enabling characteristics later codified updated review article entitled hallmarks cancer next cancer cells use alternative metabolic pathways generate energy fact appreciated since early twentieth century postulation warburg gaining renewed research cancer cells exhibiting warburg effect upregulate glycolysis lactic acid fermentation cytosol prevent mitochondria completing normal aerobic respiration oxidation pyruvate citric acid cycle electron transport chain instead completely oxidizing glucose produce much atp possible cancer cells would rather convert pyruvate building blocks cells fact low atpadp ratio caused effect likely contributes deactivation mitochondria mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarized prevent voltagesensitive permeability transition pores ptp triggering ketogenic diet investigated adjuvant therapy including cancers inefficiency metabolizing ketone bodies despite cancer cells causing
