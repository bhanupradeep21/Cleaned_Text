seen patients schizophrenia sexual selection thus demonstrated within model schizophrenia correlated reduced fertility families disorder yet disorder reduce fertility rates female schizophrenics reduced three times male schizophrenics yields potential explanation minimal amount schizophrenic fathers within sexual selection model combined reduced rates mate choice due extreme abnormality traits allow disorder selected thus minimally represented within population yet disorder remains moderately heritable raising question still present within humans altering explanations mutation rates

indicator model schizophrenia describes fitter families able develop successful courting mechanisms less fit families schizophrenics represent reduced reproductive marriage rate another theory debating sexual selection model schizophrenia differentiates sexual selection rates schizophrenia genders alluding disorder presents differently male female brains thus generates diversity hemispheric growth explains presence psychosis remaining human race today crow theory hypothesizes difference onset psychosis male female genders onset difference causes relation man sexual dimorphism cerebral cortex specifically theory hypothesizes onset psychosis male brain leads cortex developing laterally asymmetrically female psychosis important since schizophrenia often correlated basal level intelligence within individuals becomes increasingly vital examine morphology schizophrenic brains compared brains without psychosis examine physical changes underlying lapse intelligence findings within morphological studies schizophrenia thus far indicated ventricular enlargement within psychotic population finding reported without evidence affects bimodal distribution brain within
