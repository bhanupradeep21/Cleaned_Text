selective auditory attention selective hearing process auditory system individual selects focuses certain stimuli auditory information processing stimuli selection important processing memory capabilities humans limited people use selective hearing noise surrounding environment heard auditory system certain parts auditory information chosen processed brain often auditory attention directed things people interested selective hearing physiological disorder rather capability humans block sounds noise notion ignoring certain things surrounding environment article krans isbell giuliano neville selective auditory attention seen process bottleneck effect process brain inhibits processing multiple stimuli example student focused teacher giving lesson ignoring sounds classmates rowdy classroom p result information given teacher stored encoded students long term memory stimuli rowdy classroom completely ignored werent present first place brain simply collect sensory information occurring environment relevant important information thoroughly processed early researches selective auditory attention traced back colin cherry introduced cocktail party time air traffic controllers control tower received messages pilots loudspeakers hearing mixed voices single loudspeaker made task cherrys experiment mimicking problem faced air traffic controllers participants listen two messages played simultaneously one loudspeaker repeat later termed dichotic listening though introduced colin cherry donald broadbent often regarded first systematically apply dichotic listening tests broadbent used method dichotic listening test participants selectively attend stimuli overloaded auditory stimuli broadbent used findings develop filter model attention broadbent theorized human information processing system bottleneck due limited capacity brain performs early selection processing auditory broadbent proposed auditory information enters unlimited sensory buffer one stream information filtered passes bottleneck cohesive others selected quickly decay salience broadbents model contradicts cocktail party phenomenon broadbents model predicts people would never respond names unattended sources since unattended information discarded processed deutsch deutschs late selection model proposed competing model broadbents early selection deutsch deutschs model theorizes information sensory input attended processed later processing routine information enters shortterm memory filter analyzes semantic characteristics information lets stimuli containing relevant information pass shortterm memory removes irrelevant information deutsch deutschs model selective auditory attention suggests weak response unattended stimuli comes internal decision informational relevance important stimuli prioritized enter working memory first anne treisman graduate student broadbent improved broadents theory proposed attenuation treismans model unattended information attenuated tuned compared attended information still processed example imagine exposed three extraneous sources sound coffee shop ordering drink chatter coffee brewer music treismans model indicates would still pick latter three sounds attending cashier extraneous sources noise would muffled volumes turned treisman also suggests threshold mechanism exists selective auditory attention words unattended stream information grab ones attention words low threshold higher level meaning importance ones name watch redirects ones attention urgently selective auditory attention component auditory attention also includes arousal orienting response attention span examining selective auditory attention known easier children adults compared infants due limited ability use understand verbal commands result understanding auditory selection infants derived research speech language perception however small amounts selection infants recorded preference infants mothers voice compared another ones native language foreign speech directed towards infants instead speech age older children increased ability detect select auditory stimuli compared younger counterparts result makes older children perform better make fewer errors school suggests selective auditory attention age dependent ability increases based improvements automatic processing another factor could lead change older children equipped understand task reward andor punishment able understand complete task thus eliminate unnecessary stimuli recent years neuroimaging tools pet positron emission tomography fmri functional magnetic resonance imaging successful neural operations high spatial resolution specifically fmri used find evidence attention effects auditory cortex multiple studies another study based classical dichotic selective listening paradigms proven successful well findings showed effects larger cortex contralateral direction interpreted selective tuning left right auditory cortices according direction prevalence selective hearing clearly researched yet however argued proportion selective hearing particularly higher males females ida zündorf hansotto karnath jörg lewald carried study investigated advantages abilities males localization auditory sound localization task centered cocktail party effect utilized study male female participants try pick sounds specific source top competing sounds sources results showed males better performance overall female participants found difficult locate target sounds multiplesource environment zündorf et al suggested may sex differences attention processes helped locate target sound multiplesource auditory field men women differences comes selective auditory hearing struggle presented challenge multitasking especially tasks attempted
