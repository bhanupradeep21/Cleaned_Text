field molecular biology gene expression profiling measurement activity expression thousands genes create global picture cellular function profiles example distinguish cells actively dividing show cells react particular treatment many experiments sort measure entire genome simultaneously every gene present particular cell several transcriptomics technologies used generate necessary data analyse dna measure relative activity previously identified target genes sequence based techniques like rnaseq provide information sequences genes addition expression level expression profiling logical next step sequencing genome sequence tells us cell could possibly expression profile tells us actually point time genes contain instructions making messenger rna mrna moment cell makes mrna fraction genes carries gene used produce mrna considered otherwise many factors determine whether gene time day whether cell actively dividing local environment chemical signals cells instance skin cells liver cells nerve cells turn express somewhat different genes large part makes different therefore expression profile allows one deduce cells type state environment forth expression profiling experiments often involve measuring relative amount mrna expressed two experimental conditions altered levels specific sequence mrna suggest changed need protein coded mrna perhaps indicating homeostatic response pathological condition example higher levels mrna coding alcohol dehydrogenase suggest cells tissues study responding increased levels ethanol environment similarly breast cancer cells express higher levels mrna associated particular transmembrane receptor normal cells might receptor plays role breast cancer drug interferes receptor may prevent treat breast cancer developing drug one may perform gene expression profiling experiments help assess drugs toxicity perhaps looking changing levels expression cytochrome genes may biomarker drug gene expression profiling may become important diagnostic human genome contains order genes work concert produce roughly distinct proteins due alternative splicing also cells make important changes proteins posttranslational modification first construct given gene serves basis many possible versions particular protein case single mass spectrometry experiment identify total knowledge precise proteins cell makes proteomics relevant knowing much messenger rna made genewhy gene expression profiling provides global picture possible single experiment however proteomics methodology improving species yeast possible identify proteins one sometimes scientist already idea going hypothesis performs expression profiling experiment idea potentially disproving hypothesis words scientist making specific prediction levels expression could turn false commonly expression profiling takes place enough known genes interact experimental conditions testable hypothesis exist hypothesis nothing disprove expression profiling help identify candidate hypothesis future experiments early expression profiling experiments many current ones known class discovery popular approach class discovery involves grouping similar genes samples together using one many existing clustering methods traditional kmeans hierarchical clustering recent apart selecting clustering algorithm user usually choose appropriate proximity measure distance similarity data figure represents output two dimensional cluster similar samples rows similar gene probes columns organized would lie close together simplest form class discovery would list genes changed certain amount two experimental conditions class prediction difficult class discovery allows one answer questions direct clinical significance given profile probability patient respond drug requires many examples profiles responded respond well crossvalidation techniques discriminate general expression profiling studies report genes showed statistically significant differences changed experimental conditions typically small fraction genome several reasons first different cells tissues express subset genes direct consequence cellular differentiation many genes turned second many genes code proteins required survival specific amounts many genes change third cells use many mechanisms regulate proteins addition altering amount mrna genes may stay consistently expressed even protein concentrations rising falling fourth financial constraints limit expression profiling experiments small number observations gene identical conditions reducing statistical power experiment making impossible experiment identify important subtle changes finally takes great amount effort discuss biological significance regulated gene scientists often limit discussion subset newer microarray analysis techniques automate certain aspects attaching biological significance expression profiling results remains difficult problem relatively short length gene lists published expression profiling experiments limits extent experiments performed different laboratories appear agree placing expression profiling results publicly accessible microarray database makes possible researchers assess expression patterns beyond scope published results perhaps identifying similarity work dna microarrays quantitative pcr exploit preferential binding base pairing complementary nucleic acid sequences used gene expression profiling often serial fashion high throughput dna microarrays lack quantitative accuracy qpcr takes time measure gene expression dozen genes via qpcr would measure entire genome using dna microarrays often makes sense perform semiquantitative dna microarray analysis experiments identify candidate genes perform qpcr interesting candidate genes validate microarray results experiments western blot protein products differentially expressed genes make conclusions based expression profile persuasive since mrna levels necessarily correlate amount expressed protein data analysis microarrays become area intense simply stating group genes regulated least twofold common practice lacks solid statistical footing five fewer replicates group typical microarrays single outlier observation create apparent difference greater twofold addition arbitrarily setting bar twofold biologically sound eliminates consideration many genes obvious biological significance rather identify differentially expressed genes using fold change cutoff one use variety statistical tests omnibus tests anova consider fold change variability create pvalue estimate often would observe data chance alone applying pvalues microarrays complicated large number multiple comparisons genes involved example pvalue typically thought indicate significance since estimates probability observing data chance genes microarray genes would identified significant p even difference experimental groups one obvious solution consider significant genes meeting much stringent p value criterion eg one could perform bonferroni correction pvalues use false discovery rate calculation adjust pvalues proportion number parallel tests involved unfortunately approaches may reduce number significant genes zero even genes fact differentially expressed current statistics rank products aim strike balance false discovery genes due chance variation nondiscovery differentially expressed genes commonly cited methods include significance analysis microarrays wide variety methods available bioconductor variety analysis packages bioinformatics companies selecting different test usually identifies different list significant since test operates specific set assumptions places different emphasis certain features data many tests begin assumption normal distribution data seems like sensible starting point often produces results appear significant tests consider joint distribution gene observations estimate general variability others look gene isolation many modern microarray analysis techniques involve bootstrapping statistics machine learning monte carlo number replicate measurements microarray experiment increases various statistical approaches yield increasingly similar results lack concordance different statistical methods makes array results appear less trustworthy maqc makes recommendations guide researchers selecting standard methods eg using pvalue foldchange together selecting differentially expressed genes experiments performed different laboratories agree better different analysis differentially expressed individual genes another type analysis focuses differential expression perturbation predefined gene sets called gene set gene set analysis demonstrated several major advantages individual gene differential expression gene sets groups genes functionally related according current knowledge therefore gene set analysis considered knowledge based analysis commonly used gene sets include derived kegg pathways gene ontology terms gene groups share functional annotations common transcriptional regulators etc representative gene set analysis methods include gene set enrichment analysis estimates significance gene sets based permutation sample labels generally applicable geneset enrichment tests significance gene sets based permutation gene labels parametric distribution statistics may identify gene products change experimental conditions making biological sense expression profiling rests knowing protein gene product makes function protein performs gene annotation provides functional information example location gene within particular chromosome functional annotations reliable others absent gene annotation databases change regularly various databases refer protein different names reflecting changing understanding protein function use standardized gene nomenclature helps address naming aspect problem exact matching transcripts remains important consideration identified set regulated genes next step expression profiling involves looking patterns within regulated set proteins made genes perform similar functions chemically similar reside similar parts cell gene ontology analysis provides standard way define relationships gene ontologies start broad categories eg metabolic process break smaller categories eg carbohydrate metabolic process finally quite restrictive categories like inositol derivative phosphorylation genes attributes beside biological function chemical properties cellular location one compose sets genes based proximity genes association disease relationships drugs toxins molecular signatures comparative toxicogenomics examples resources categorize genes numerous ways regulated genes categorized terms important relationships genes may example might see evidence certain gene creates protein make enzyme activates protein turn second gene list second gene may transcription factor regulates yet another gene list observing links may begin suspect represent much chance associations results list underlying biological process hand could one selected genes random one might find many seem something common sense need rigorous statistical procedures test whether emerging biological themes significant gene set comes fairly straightforward statistics provide estimates whether associations genes lists greater one would expect chance statistics interesting even represent substantial oversimplification really going example suppose genes experiment play known role making cholesterol experiment identifies regulated genes turn list cholesterol genes well based overall prevalence cholesterol genes one expects average cholesterol gene every regulated genes times expectation average one expects see one time question becomes often would see instead due pure chance according hypergeometric distribution one would expect try times followed zeroes picking cholesterol genes pool drawing genes random whether one pays much attention infinitesimally small probability observing chance one would conclude regulated gene list genes known cholesterol association one might hypothesize experimental treatment regulates cholesterol treatment seems selectively regulate genes associated cholesterol may true number reasons making firm conclusion based enrichment alone represents unwarranted leap faith one previously mentioned issue observation gene regulation may direct impact protein regulation even proteins coded genes nothing make cholesterol showing mrna altered directly tell us happening protein level quite possible amount cholesterolrelated proteins remains constant experimental conditions second even protein levels change perhaps always enough around make cholesterol fast possibly made another protein list rate determining step process making cholesterol finally proteins typically play many roles genes may regulated shared association making cholesterol shared role completely independent process bearing foregoing caveats mind gene profiles prove causal relationships treatments biological effects offer unique biological insights would often difficult arrive ways described one identify significantly regulated genes first find patterns comparing list significant genes sets genes known share certain associations one also work problem reverse order simple example suppose genes associated known process example predisposition diabetes looking two groups expression profiles one mice fed high carbohydrate diet one mice fed low carbohydrate diet one observes diabetes genes expressed higher level high carbohydrate group low carbohydrate group regardless whether genes would made list significantly altered genes observing none appears unlikely result pure chance flipping heads row predicted occur one time trillion attempts using fair coin type cell group genes whose combined expression pattern uniquely characteristic given condition constitutes gene signature condition ideally gene signature used select group patients specific state disease accuracy facilitates selection gene set enrichment analysis similar take advantage kind logic uses sophisticated statistics component genes real processes display complex behavior simply moving group amount genes move meaningful direction case statistics measure different behavior small set genes compared genes small set gsea uses kolmogorov smirnov style statistic see whether previously defined gene sets exhibited unusual behavior current expression profile leads multiple hypothesis testing challenge reasonable methods exist address expression profiling provides
