developmental biology animal embryonic development also known animal embryogenesis developmental stage animal embryo embryonic development starts fertilization egg cell ovum sperm cell fertilized ovum becomes single diploid cell known zygote zygote undergoes mitotic divisions significant growth process known cleavage cellular differentiation leading development multicellular passing organizational checkpoint mammals term refers chiefly early stages prenatal development whereas terms fetus fetal development describe later main stages animal embryonic development follows embryo transforms next stage development nature varies different animal species examples possible next stages include fetus larva egg cell generally asymmetric animal pole future ectoderm covered protective envelopes different layers first envelope one contact membrane egg made glycoproteins known vitelline membrane zona pellucida mammals different taxa show different cellular acellular envelopes englobing vitelline fertilization fusion gametes produce new organism animals process involves sperm fusing ovum eventually leads development embryo depending animal species process occur within body female internal fertilization outside case external fertilization fertilized egg cell known prevent one sperm fertilizing egg polyspermy fast block slow block polyspermy used fast block membrane potential rapidly depolarizing returning normal happens immediately egg fertilized single sperm slow block begins first seconds fertilization release calcium causes cortical reaction various enzymes released cortical granules eggs plasma membrane causing expansion hardening outside membrane preventing sperm cell division significant growth producing cluster cells size original zygote called cleavage least four initial cell divisions occur resulting dense ball least sixteen cells called morula early mouse embryo sister cells division remain connected interphase microtubule different cells derived cleavage blastula stage called blastomeres depending mostly amount yolk egg cleavage holoblastic total meroblastic holoblastic cleavage occurs animals little yolk humans mammals receive nourishment embryos mother via placenta milk might secreted marsupium meroblastic cleavage occurs animals whose eggs yolk ie birds reptiles cleavage impeded vegetal pole uneven distribution size cells numerous smaller animal pole holoblastic eggs first cleavage always occurs along vegetalanimal axis egg second cleavage perpendicular first spatial arrangement blastomeres follow various patterns due different planes cleavage various organisms end cleavage known midblastula transition coincides onset zygotic transcription amniotes cells morula first closely aggregated soon become arranged outer peripheral layer trophoblast contribute formation embryo proper inner cell mass embryo developed fluid collects trophoblast greater part inner cellmass thus morula converted vesicle called blastodermic vesicle inner cell mass remains contact however trophoblast one pole ovum named embryonic pole since indicates location future embryo cleavage produced cells morula becomes blastula usually spherical layer cells blastoderm surrounding fluidfilled yolkfilled cavity blastocoelcitation needed mammals stage form structure called characterized inner cell mass distinct surrounding blastocyst similar structure blastula cells different fates mouse primordial germ cells arise inner cell mass epiblast result extensive genomewide reprogramming involves global dna demethylation facilitated dna base excision repair pathway well chromatin reorganization results cellular gastrulation cells trophoblast become differentiated two layers outer layer forms syncytium ie layer protoplasm studded nuclei showing evidence subdivision cells termed syncytiotrophoblast inner layer cytotrophoblast consists welldefined cells already stated cells trophoblast contribute formation embryo proper form ectoderm chorion play important part development placenta deep surface inner cell mass layer flattened cells called endoderm differentiated quickly assumes form small sac called yolk sac spaces appear remaining cells mass enlargement coalescence spaces cavity called amniotic cavity gradually developed floor cavity formed embryonic disk composed layer prismatic cells embryonic ectoderm derived inner cell mass lying apposition embryonic disc becomes oval pearshaped wider end directed forward towards narrow posterior end opaque primitive streak formed extends along middle disc half length anterior end streak knoblike thickening termed primitive node knot known hensens knot birds shallow groove primitive groove appears surface streak anterior end groove communicates means aperture blastopore yolk sac primitive streak produced thickening axial part ectoderm cells multiply grow downward blend subjacent endoderm sides primitive streak third layer cells mesoderm extends laterally ectoderm endoderm caudal end primitive streak forms cloacal membrane blastoderm consists three layers outer ectoderm middle mesoderm inner endoderm distinctive characteristics gives rise certain tissues body many mammals sometime formation germ layers implantation embryo uterus mother gastrulation cells migrate interior blastula subsequently forming two diploblastic animals three triploblastic germ layers embryo process called gastrula germ layers referred ectoderm mesoderm endoderm diploblastic animals ectoderm endoderm among different animals different combinations following processes occur place cells interior embryo animals blastopore formed point cells migrating inward two major groups animals distinguished according blastopores fate deuterostomes anus forms blastopore protostomes develops front primitive streak two longitudinal ridges caused folding ectoderm make appearance one either side middle line formed streak named neural folds commence little distance behind anterior end embryonic disk continuous gradually extend backward one either side anterior end primitive streak folds shallow median groove neural groove groove gradually deepens neural folds become elevated ultimately folds meet coalesce middle line convert groove closed tube neural tube canal ectodermal wall forms rudiment nervous system coalescence neural folds anterior end primitive streak blastopore longer opens surface closed canal neural tube thus transitory communication neurenteric canal established neural tube primitive digestive tube coalescence neural folds occurs first region hind brain

presents time rhomboidal shape expanded portion term sinus rhomboidalis applied neural groove closed ridge ectodermal cells appears along prominent margin neural fold termed neural crest ganglion ridge spinal cranial nerve ganglia ganglia sympathetic nervous system developedcitation needed upward growth mesoderm neural tube ultimately separated overlying cephalic end neural groove exhibits several dilatations tube closed assume form three primary brain vesicles correspond respectively future forebrain prosencephalon midbrain mesencephalon hindbrain rhombencephalon fig walls vesicles

persists central extension mesoderm takes place throughout whole embryonic extraembryonic areas ovum except certain regions one seen immediately front neural tube mesoderm extends forward form two crescentic masses meet middle line enclose behind area devoid mesoderm area ectoderm endoderm come direct contact constitute thin membrane buccopharyngeal membrane forms septum primitive mouth front buccopharyngeal area lateral crescents mesoderm fuse middle line pericardium afterward developed region therefore designated pericardial area second region mesoderm absent least time immediately front pericardial area termed proamniotic area region proamnion developed humans however appears proamnion never formed third region hind end embryo ectoderm endoderm come apposition form cloacal

marking future somites presomitic mesoderm unsegmented paraxial presomitic mesoderm gives rise successive pairs somites identical appearance differentiate cell types structures formed cells vary depending upon anteroposterior eg thoracic vertebrae ribs lumbar vertebrae somites unique positional values along axis thought specified hox homeotic toward end second week fertilization transverse
