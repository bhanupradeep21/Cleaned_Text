vasospasm refers condition arterial spasm leads vasoconstriction lead tissue ischemia tissue death necrosis cerebral vasospasm may arise context subarachnoid hemorrhage symptomatic vasospasm delayed cerebral ischemia major contributor postoperative stroke death especially aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage vasospasm typically appears days subarachnoid hemorrhage along physical resistance vasospasm main cause ischemia like physical resistance vasospasms occur due atherosclerosis vasospasm major cause prinzmetals angina normally endothelial cells release prostacyclin nitric oxide induce relaxation smooth muscle cells reduce aggregation aggregating platelets stimulate adp act endothelial cells help induce relaxation smooth muscle cells however aggregating platelets also stimulate thromboxane serotonin induce contraction smooth muscle cells general relaxations outweighs contractions atherosclerosis dysfunctional endothelium observed examination stimulate much prostacyclin induce relaxation smooth muscle cells also much inhibition aggregation platelets case greater aggregation platelets produce adp serotonin thromboxane however serotonin thromboxane cause contraction smooth muscle cells result contractions outweigh vasospasm occur wide variety peripheral vascular beds poorly understood mechanisms prinzmetal angina buergers disease contrast mediated selective renal vasospasm hypercoagulability cryoglobulinemia likely represent known pieces puzzling phenomena ischemia heart due prolonged coronary vasospasm lead angina myocardial infarction even death vasospasm hands fingers due prolonged exposure vibration hzfailed verificationdubious discuss triggered cold lead handarm vibration syndrome feeling manual dexterity angiography vascular access femoral axillary arteries preferred less prone vasospasm meanwhile brachial artery prone vasospasm instrumental case study following surgery head trauma patient developed mild hypothermia typical defense mechanism brain uses protect injury hypothermia rewarming period patient died increased intracranial pressure anisocoria sample cerebrospinal fluid autopsy results indicated cerebral occurrence vasospasm reduced preventing occurrence atherosclerosis done several ways important lifestyle lowdensity lipoprotein ldl quitting smoking physical activity control risk factors including diabetes obesity hypertension pharmacological therapies include hypolipidemic agents thrombolytics anticoagulants pharmacological options reducing severity occurrence ischemic episodes include organic nitrates rapidly metabolized release nitric oxide many classified either longacting ie isosorbide dinitrate shortacting ie nitroglycerin durations action drugs work increasing nitric oxide levels blood inducing coronary vasodilation allow coronary blood flow due decreased coronary resistance allowing increased oxygen supply vital organs myocardium nitric oxide increase blood resulting drugs also causes dilation systemic veins turn causes reduction venous return ventricular work load ventricular radius reductions contribute decrease ventricular wall stress significant causes demand oxygen decrease general organic nitrates decrease oxygen demand increase oxygen supply favourable change body decrease severity ischemic symptoms particularly angina medications used reduce occurrence severity vasospasm ultimately ischemia include ltype calcium channel blockers notably nimodipine well verapamil diltiazem nifedipine betareceptor antagonists commonly known beta blockers Î²blockers propranolol ltype calcium channel blockers induce dilation coronary arteries also decreasing hearts demand oxygen reducing contractility heart rate wall stress reduction latter three factors decreases contractile force myocardium must exert order achieve level cardiac output betareceptor antagonists cause vasodilation like ltype calcium channel blockers reduce hearts demand oxygen reduction similarly results decrease heart rate afterload wall stress like pharmacological therapeutic options risks considered drugs particular vasodilation associated adverse effects might include orthostatic hypotension reflex tachycardia headaches palpitations tolerance may also develop time due compensatory response body well depletion sh groups glutathione essential metabolism drugs active forms potential side effects organic nitrates taken inhibitors ie sildenafil since inhibitors increase cyclic gmp levels sum pharmacodynamic effects greatly exceed optimal therapeutic levels could see upon taking medications time caused much higher induction relaxation smooth muscle cells include severe drop blood pressure betareceptor antagonists avoided patients reactive pulmonary disease avoid asthma attacks also betareceptor antagonists avoided patients av node dysfunction andor patients medications might cause bradycardia ie calcium channel blockers potential contraindications drugdrug interaction could lead asystole cardiac arrest certain calcium channel blocker avoided betareceptor blockers since may cause severe bradycardia potential side effects since vasospasms caused atherosclerosis contribute severity ischemia surgical options restore circulation ischemic areas regarding coronary vasospasm one surgical intervention referred percutaneous coronary intervention angioplasty involves placing stent site stenosis artery inflating stent using balloon catheter another surgical intervention coronary artery bypass httpsenwikipediaorgwikivasospasm
