frequently provide conditions particularly bare soil exposed new soil laid germination epigeal ground p trichocarpa seedlings usually become established abundance logging unless special measures taken prepare bare moist seedbeds required initial establishment seedlings become established great numbers thin naturally age five weaker seedlings shadeintolerant species suppressed due high levels rooting hormones p trichocarpa sprouts readily logging operations sometimes regenerates naturally rooting partially buried fragments branches stumps sprouting roots also occurs species also ability
