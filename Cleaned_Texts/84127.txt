amiloride sold trade name midamor among others medication typically used medications treat high blood pressure swelling due heart failure cirrhosis amiloride classified potassiumsparing diuretic amiloride often used together another diuretic thiazide loop taken onset action two hours lasts common side effects include high blood potassium vomiting loss appetite rash risk high blood potassium greater kidney problems diabetes amiloride blocks epithelial sodium channel enac late distal tubule connecting tubule collecting duct reduces absorption sodium ion lumen nephron reduces excretion potassium ion amiloride developed world health organizations list essential amiloride may used combination thiazide diuretic treatment high blood pressure less commonly combination loop diuretic treatment heart failure potassiumsparing effects amiloride offset low blood potassium hypokalemia often induced thiazides loop diuretics particular importance people maintaining normal level potassium critically example people taking digitalis ie digoxin higher risk changes heart rhythm potassium levels get clinical practice guidelines american college cardiologyamerican heart association task force clinical practice guidelines list amiloride secondary oral antihypertensive minimal people resistant hypertension already taking thiazide diuretic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor acei angiotensin ii receptor blocker arb calcium channel blocker addition amiloride spironolactone better reducing blood pressure adding betablocker bisoprolol blocker combined hydrochlorothiazide addition amiloride positive effects blood pressure blood sugar amiloride may therefore useful preventing metabolic side effects thiazide diuretics allowing use higher thiazide doses line originally amiloride treatment choice liddle characterized high blood pressure low blood potassium metabolic alkalosis conjunction low plasma renin activity low aldosterone people liddle phenotype liddle syndrome involves genetic mutation resulting upregulation epithelial sodium channel enac located apical membrane polarized epithelial cells late distal tubule collecting duct liddle phenotype usually involves upregulation enac channels leading retention sodium water hypokalemia amiloride useful enac channel inhibitor due promotion sodium excretion potassiumsparing effects restoring potassium normal amiloride used monotherapy singledrug therapy adjunctive therapy alongside diuretics eg hydrochlorothiazide furosemide treatment ascites edema swelling due cirrhosis clinical practice guidelines american association study liver diseases aasld states amiloride used treat ascites place spironolactone isnt tolerated eg due side effect gynecomastia though amiloride isnt preferred drug due cost lack people diabetes higher risk kidney problems increases risk hyperkalemia high blood potassium use amiloride people diabetes requires careful potassium kidney function monitoring prevent toxicity amiloride must discontinued least days prior glucose tolerance testing due risk fatal people poor kidney function eg blood urea nitrogen mgdl serum creatinine mgdl high risk data use amiloride women breastfeeding diuretics make lactation difficult unlikely amiloride would induce effect absence data use amiloride animals suggests pose risk developing fetus however used combination drug acetazolamide process organ formation amiloride increases risk kidney ureter abnormalities limited human data use pregnancy suggests association specific congenital penis abnormality taken first trimester well risk mild intrauterine growth restriction taken throughout amiloride contraindicated people kidney problems eg anuria acute chronic kidney disease diabetic nephropathy elevated blood potassium meql people hypersensitive amiloride ingredients within specific formulation use also contraindicated people already taking potassiumsparing drugs eg spironolactone triamterene taking potassium supplements eg potassium chloride amiloride generally well common adverse effects use amiloride include elevated blood potassium mild skin rashes headaches gastrointestinal side effects nausea vomiting diarrhea decreased appetite flatulence abdominal mild symptoms high blood potassium concentrations include unusual skin sensations muscle weakness fatigue severe symptoms flaccid paralysis limbs slow heart rate even shock exists overdose data amiloride humans though expected overdose would produce effects consistent therapeutic effects eg dehydration due overdiuresis electrolyte disturbances related hyperkalemia unknown amiloride dialyzed specific antidote exists treatment generally supportive though hyperkalemia amiloride may important drugdrug interactions combined medications also increase potassium levels blood leading example combination amiloride angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors like lisinopril angiotensin ii receptor type antagonists like losartan may lead high levels potassium blood requiring frequent amiloride works directly blocking epithelial sodium channel enac around Î¼m indicating potent antagonism enac thereby inhibits sodium reabsorption late distal convoluted tubules connecting tubules collecting ducts promotes loss sodium water body reduces potassium excretion drug often used conjunction thiazide diuretic counteract potassiumlosing effect due potassiumsparing capacities hyperkalemia elevated potassium concentration blood occur risk developing hyperkalemia increased patients also taking ace inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor antagonists potassiumsparing diuretics potassiumcontaining supplements fraction effects amiloride inhibition cyclic gmpgated cation channels inner medullary collecting amiloride second action heart blocking nah exchangers antiporter amiloride also blocks nah antiporter apical surface proximal tubule cells nephron abolishing action angiotensin ii secretion hydrogen ions proximal tubule amiloride angiotensin ii receptor blocker like losartan example nah transporter also found jejunum small intestine result amiloride also blocks reabsorption na thereby water amiloride considered reversible panacidsensing ion channel asic inhibitor prevents transient flow ions sustained flow ions asics members enac family protein channels found nervous system cardiovascular system gastrointestinal system skin broadly asics involved harm detection chemosensation ph changes specifically amiloride oral bioavailability meaning oral dose absorbed blood stream coadministration food reduces amount amiloride absorbed body though affect rate absorption however taking amiloride food helps reduce incidence gastrointestinal side effects taken amilorides diuretic effect occurs within hours peak diuresis within hours diuretic effects amiloride persist hours amiloride cross placenta distributes breast milk amiloride metabolized comparison enac inhibitor triamterene metabolized amiloride excreted unchanged kidneys around excreted feces likely drug wasnt absorbed halflife amiloride humans hours may prolonged people poor kidney single nucleotide
