psychology cognitive science schema pl schemata schemas describes pattern thought behavior organizes categories information relationships among also described mental structure preconceived ideas framework representing aspect world system organizing perceiving new mental schema conceptual model schemata influence attention absorption new knowledge people likely notice things fit schema reinterpreting contradictions schema exceptions distorting fit schemata tendency remain unchanged even face contradictory schemata help understanding world rapidly changing people organize new perceptions schemata quickly situations require complex thought using schema since automatic thought people use schemata organize current knowledge provide framework future understanding examples schemata include mental models social schemas stereotypes social roles scripts worldviews heuristics archetypes piagets theory development children construct series schemata based interactions experience help understand schema comes greek word schēmat schēma meaning prior use psychology term schema primarily seen use philosophy instance schemata especially transcendental schemata crucial architectonic system devised immanuel kant critique pure early developments idea psychology emerged gestalt psychologists founded originally max wertheimer jean piaget term schéma introduced piaget piagets later publications action operative procedural schémes distinguished figurative representational schémas although together may considered schematic subsequent discussions piaget english schema often mistranslation piagets original french distinction particular importance theories embodied cognition ecological concept first described works british psychologist frederic bartlett drew term body schema used neurologist henry head jean piaget credited first cognitive development theory schemas popularized expanded schema theory educational psychologist richard c anderson since terms used describe schema frame scene script use schemata heuristic technique encode retrieve memories majority typical situations require much strenuous processing people quickly organize new perceptions schemata act without process however always accurate people may develop illusory correlations tendency form inaccurate unfounded associations categories especially information nevertheless schemata influence hamper uptake new information existing stereotypes giving rise limited biased discourses expectations lead individual see remember something happened believable terms hisher example welldressed businessman draws knife vagrant schemata onlookers may often lead remember vagrant pulling knife distortion memory demonstrated see background research furthermore also seen affect formation episodic memory humans instance one likely remember pencil case office skull even present office tested certain recall schemata interrelated multiple conflicting schemata applied information schemata generally thought level activation spread among related schemata different factors current activation accessibility priming emotion specific schema selected accessibility easily schema come mind determined personal experience expertise used cognitive shortcut meaning allows common explanation chosen new information priming increased sensitivity particular schema due recent experience brief imperceptible stimulus temporarily provides enough activation schema used subsequent ambiguous information although may suggest possibility subliminal messages effect priming fleeting difficult detect outside laboratory conditions original concept schemata linked reconstructive memory proposed demonstrated series experiments frederic bartlett began presenting participants information unfamiliar cultural backgrounds expectations subsequently monitoring recalled different items information stories bartlett able establish individuals existing schemata stereotypes influence interpret schemaforeign new information also recall information time one famous investigations involved asking participants read native american folk tale war recall several times year later participants transformed details story way reflected cultural norms expectations ie line schemata factors influenced recall bartletts work crucially important demonstrating longterm memories neither fixed unchanging constantly adjusted schemata evolve experience work contributed framework memory retrieval people construct past present constant process narrativediscursive adjustment much people remember confabulated narrative adjusted rationalized allows think past continuous coherent string events even though probable large sections memory episodic semantic irretrievable inaccurate given important step development schema theory taken work de rumelhart describing understanding narrative work concept schemata conducted wf brewer jc treyens demonstrated schemadriven expectation presence object sometimes sufficient trigger incorrect experiment conducted participants requested wait room identified academics study later asked rooms contents number participants recalled seen books study whereas none present brewer treyens concluded participants expectations books present academics studies enough prevent accurate recollection scenes computer scientist marvin minsky trying develop machines would humanlike abilities trying create solutions difficulties encountered came across bartletts work concluded ever going get machines act like humans needed use stored knowledge carry processes frame construct way represent knowledge machines frame construct seen extension elaboration schema construct created frame knowledge concept way interact new information proposed fixed broad information would represented frame would also composed slots would accept range values world value slot would filled default minskys work computers stronger impact psychology david rumelhart extended minskys ideas creating explicitly psychological theory mental representation complex roger schank robert abelson developed idea script known generic knowledge sequences actions led many new empirical studies found providing relevant schema help improve comprehension recall schemata also viewed sociocultural perspective contributions lev vygotsky transactional relationship development schema environment influences schema develop independently construct mind carries aspects history social cultural meaning influences development schemata scripts frameworks called upon active processes solving problems interacting however schemas also contribute influential outside sociocultural perspectives like development racism tendencies disregard marginalized communities cultural misconceptions new information falls within individuals schema easily remembered incorporated worldview however new information perceived fit schema many things happen one common reactions person simply ignore quickly forget new information happen unconscious unintentionally individual may even perceive new information people may also interpret new information way minimizes much must change schemata example bob thinks chickens lay eggs sees chicken laying egg instead changing part schema says chickens dont lay eggs likely adopt belief animal question seen laying egg real chicken example disconfirmation bias tendency set higher standards evidence contradicts ones also known cognitive dissonance however new information ignored existing schemata must changed new schemata must created jean piaget known best work development human knowledge believed knowledge constructed cognitive structures believed people develop cognitive structures accommodating assimilating information accommodation creating new schema fit better new environment adjusting old schema accommodation could also interpreted putting restrictions current schema usually comes assimilation failed assimilation people use current schema understand world around piaget thought schemata applied everyday life therefore people accommodate assimilate information example chicken red feathers bob form new schemata says chickens red feathers lay eggs schemata future either changed removed entirely assimilation reuse schemata fit new information example person sees unfamiliar dog probably integrate dog schema however dog behaves strangely ways seem doglike accommodation new schema formed particular dog accommodation assimilation comes idea equilibrium piaget describes equilibrium state cognition balanced schema capable explaining sees perceives information new fit previous existing schema disequilibrium happen disequilibrium happens means person frustrated try restore coherence cognitive structures accommodation new information taken assimilation new information proceed find must make new adjustment later road person remains equilibrium process equilibration people move equilibrium phase disequilibrium phase back view persons new schemata may expansion schemata subtype allows information incorporated existing beliefs without contradicting example social psychology would combination persons beliefs women beliefs business women generally perceived business person meets woman new subtype businesswoman may created information perceived incorporated subtype activation either woman business schema may make available schema businesswoman also allows previous beliefs women business persist rather modifying schemata related women business persons subtype schemata oneself considered grounded present based past experiences memories framed light ones selfconception example people positive selfschemata ie people selectively attend flattering information ignore unflattering information consequence flattering information subject deeper encoding therefore superior even encoding equally strong positive negative feedback positive feedback likely moreover memories may even distorted become favorable example people typically remember exam grades better actually however people negative self views memories generally biased ways validate negative selfschema people low selfesteem instance prone remember negative information positive thus memory tends biased way validates agents preexisting selfschema three major implications selfschemata first information oneself processed faster efficiently especially consistent information second one retrieves remembers information relevant ones selfschema third one tend resist information environment contradictory ones selfschema instance students particular selfschema prefer roommates whose view consistent schema students end roommates whose view inconsistent selfschema likely try find new roommate even view example selfverification researched aaron beck automatically activated negative selfschemata large contributor depression according cox abramson devine hollon selfschemata essentially type cognitive structure stereotypes studied prejudice researchers eg wellrehearsed automatically activated difficult change influential toward behavior emotions judgments bias information selfschema also selfperpetuating represent particular role society based stereotype example mother tells daughter looks like tom boy daughter may react choosing activities imagines tom boy would conversely mother tells looks like princess daughter might choose activities thought feminine example selfschema becoming selfperpetuating person hand chooses activity based expectation rather schema therapy founded jeffrey young represents development cognitive behavioral therapy cbt specifically treating personality early maladaptive schemata described young broad pervasive themes patterns made memories feelings sensations thoughts regarding oneself ones relationships others contributing factor treatment outcomes mental disorders maintenance ideas beliefs behaviors towards oneself others considered develop childhood adolescence dysfunctional lead selfdefeating behavior examples include schemata abandonmentinstability mistrustabuse emotional deprivation schema therapy blends cbt elements gestalt therapy object relations constructivist psychoanalytic therapies order treat characterological difficulties constitute personality disorders underlie many chronic depressive anxietyinvolving symptoms present clinic young said cbt may effective treatment presenting symptoms without conceptual clinical resources tackling underlying structures maladaptive schemata consistently organize patients experience patient likely lapse back unhelpful modes relating others attempting meet needs young focused pulling different therapies equally developing schema therapy cognitive behavioral methods work increase availability strength adaptive schemata reducing maladaptive ones may involve identifying existing schema identifying alternative replace difficulties arise types schema often exist absolutes modification requires replacement absolutes otherwise initial belief may difference cognitive behavioral therapy schema therapy according young latter emphasizes lifelong patterns affective change techniques therapeutic relationship special emphasis limited recommended therapy would ideal clients difficult chronic psychological disorders examples would eating disorders personality disorders also success therapy relation depression substance
