communal burrow refers habitat built species mammals community habitat species build burrows communal burrows species live communal groups construct burrows type habitat burrow hole tunnel excavated ground animal create space suitable habitation temporary refuge byproduct locomotion burrows provide form shelter predation exposure elements found nearly every biome among various biological interactions many different animal species known form burrows species range small invertebrates corophium large vertebrate species polar burrows constructed wide variety substrates range complexity simple tube centimeters long complex network interconnecting tunnels chambers hundreds thousands meters total length example welldeveloped burrow would rabbit warren animals create burrows using variety methods burrowing animals divided three categories primary excavators secondary modifiers simple primary excavators animals originally dig construct burrow generally animals considered primary excavators prairie dog pygmy gerbil example secondary modifiers build original burrow live inside burrow made animals improve change aspects burrow third category simple occupants neither build modify burrow simply live inside use species bird actually make use burrows built tortoises example simple animals also referred common degus highly social live burrows digging communally able construct larger elaborate burrows could degus digging together coordinate activities forming digging females living group shown spontaneously nest nurse one anothers young spend large amount time surface forage foraging ability detect predators increased larger animal needs spend less time vigilance common degus exhibit wide array communication techniques elaborate vocal repertoire comprising different young need able hear mothers calls emotional systems brains develop use urine scent experiments shown react one anothers although males hormone testosterone may suppress sense smell common degus seasonal breeders breeding season wild degus begins chilean autumn day night roughly pups born early common degu pups born relatively precocial fully furred eyes open auditory visual systems functional unlike rodents male common degus also take part protecting raising pups old enough leave plains viscacha live communal burrow systems groups containing one males several females immatures

branches heavy objects cover burrow entrance live close human settlements tend hoard brooms tables garden tools firewood trinkets pieces concrete many humanmade objects cover burrow daurian pikas observed sharing burrows several mammal species occasionally visit burrows altai marmots mongolian pikas turn burrows visited ground squirrels sometimes burrowing birds due low competition predation rates limiting factor daurian pika populations highly social prairie dogs live large colonies towns collections prairie dog families span hundreds acres prairie dog family groups basic units society members family group inhabit territory family groups blacktailed mexican prairie dogs called coteries clans used describe family groups whitetailed gunnison utah prairie dogs although two family groups similar coteries tend closely knit clans members family group interact oral contact kissing grooming one another perform behaviors prairie dogs family groups prairie dog town may contain family groups may also subgroups within town called wards separated physical barrier family groups exist within wards prairie dog family groups made one adult breeding male two three adult females one two male offspring one two female offspring females remain natal groups life thus source stability groups males leave natal groups mature find another family group defend breed family groups contain breeding females one male control one breeding adult male among multiplemale groups may contain males friendly relationships majority contain males largely antagonistic relationships former males tend related latter tend related two three groups females may controlled one male however among female groups friendly relations average prairie dog territory takes hectares acres territories wellestablished borders coincide physical barriers rocks trees resident male territory defends antagonistic behavior occur two males different families defend territories interactions may happen times
