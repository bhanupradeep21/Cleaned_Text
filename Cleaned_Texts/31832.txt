clinical electrophysiological testing based techniques derived electrophysiology used clinical diagnosis patients many processes occur body produce electrical signals detected depending location source signals distinct methods techniques developed properly target electrophysiology important role ensuring accurate clinical diagnoses brain heart skeletal muscles prime sources electric magnetic fields recorded resulting patterns give insight ailments subject may electrophysiological tests generally passively collect electrical data sometimes necessary apply external stimulus desired target
