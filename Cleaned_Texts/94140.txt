myotonia congenita congenital neuromuscular channelopathy affects skeletal muscles muscles used movement genetic disorder hallmark disease failure initiated contraction terminate often referred delayed relaxation muscles myotonia symptoms include delayed relaxation muscles voluntary contraction myotonia may also include stiffness hypertrophy enlargement transient weakness forms disorder certain genetic mutations severe masseter spasm cramping condition sometimes referred fainting goat syndrome responsible eponymous fainting seen fainting goats presented sudden stimulus note myotonia
