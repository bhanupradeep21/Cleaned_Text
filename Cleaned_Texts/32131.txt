lysine acetylsalicylate also known aspirin dllysine lysine aspirin soluble form acetylsalicylic acid aspirin aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaid analgesic antiinflammatory antithrombotic antipyretic composed ammonium form amino acid lysine paired conjugate base aspirin lysine acetylsalicylate developed intravenous administration acute pain management enabling faster onset action compared oral adverse effects similar orally administered aspirin including upset stomach serious cases cause peptic ulcers gastric bleeding exacerbate asthma due antithrombotic properties patients using lysine acetylsalicylate oral aspirin increased risk bleeding especially patients blood thinning medications used children infections poses risk reye syndrome used final trimester pregnancy due risks premature closure foramen ovale fetal heart therapeutic effects salicylic acids first documented edward stone acetylsalicylic acid synthesized felix hoffmann chemist working bayer acetylsalicylic acidderived salt compounds first discovered synthesis lysine acetylsalicylate first documented lysine acetylsalicylate considered prodrug requiring metabolized displaying therapeutic properties administration lysine acetylsalicylate hydrolyzed separating lysine acetylsalicylate two forms cox enzymes identified cox enzymes responsible catalyzing conversion arachidonic acid prostaglandins used precursors substances particular thromboxane thromboxane potent platelet activator inducing changes platelets ultimately promote aggregation formation clots thromboxane also displays vasoconstrictor properties acting vascular smooth muscle prostaglandins also important mediators inflammatory response high levels prostaglandins seen inflamed acetylsalicylate compounds act inhibitors enzyme activity enabling drug display antiplatelet antiinflammatory compound irreversibly suppresses activity addition acetyl group serine amino disables binding mechanism arachidonic acid inhibiting synthesis prostaglandins thromboxane stops platelet aggregation inflammation mechanism also shown enzymes albeit lower efficiency acetylsalicylate compounds also thought mechanisms exert antiinflammatory effects cells mainly acetylsalicylate inhibits neutrophil activation desensitizing endogenous chemical signals leukotrienes stopping inflammatory acetylsalicylate also reduces expression nitric oxide obstructing synthesis nitric oxide compounds nitric oxide plays key role inflammation activating macrophages regulating acetylsalicylate also inhibits activation nuclear factor kappab decreases expression proinflammatory molecules lysine acetylsalicylate exists white crystalline substance displaying weakly acidic properties lysine acetylsalicylate generally unstable basic medium readily undergoing multistep hydrolysis reaction catalyzed presence negatively charged hydroxide ionscitation needed primary target hydrolysis reaction ester group dissociating carboxylic acid aromatic alcoholcitation needed synthesis lysine acetylsalicylate requires precursor sodium salicylate another salt salicylic acid sodium salicylate prepared adding acetylsalicylic acid solution sodium hydrogen carbonatecitation needed solution stirred filtered produce sodium salicylate crystals dried remove watercitation needed sodium salicylate synthesized acetylsalicylate two methods first method mixing sodium salicylate solution lysine heating mixture reflux minutescitation needed next solution cooled heated evaporate resulting water precipitate noticed solution put refrigerator fully crystallized resulting crystals lysine acetylsalicylatecitation needed second method involves process mixture initially heated instead left room temperature hours method noted obtain greater yield lysine lysine acetylsalicylate normally administered intravenously blood due high water solubility compared acetylsalicylate enables aspirin released directly blood circulation bypassing need absorption stomach well liver compared oral doses aspirin lysine acetylsalicylate displays greater antiplatelet antiinflammatory response additionally lysine acetylsalicylate shows faster onset action compared oral aspirin equivalent lysine acetylsalicylate also displays shorter mean residence time body hours well shorter elimination halflife minutes administered intravenously could indicate displays shorter duration exposure lysine acetylsalicylate also provides less interpatient variability antiplatelet acetylsalicylate predominantly metabolized conjugation reaction glycine form salicyluric acid salicyluric acid also acts main compound aspirin excretion aspirin secreted via pathway kidney salicyluric acid undergo metabolism form glucuronide compounds hydroxylation form gentisic acid total lysine acetylsalicylate used acutely inpatient setting conditions presenting severe pain particularly acute migraine attacks severe also used ultrarapid platelet blockade agent intraprocedural clearance thrombus among patients urgent need antiplatelet therapy without feasible nasogastric oral include limited patients acute ischemic stroke arterial dissection undergoing endovascular stent inpatient setting lysine acetylsalicylate shown safe effective inpatient management severe headache two randomized trials found combined metoclopramide lysine acetylsalicylate comparable efficacy sumatriptan clinical trials use lysine acetylsalicylate antiplatelet acute coronary syndrome chronic coronary syndrome finds comparable efficacy lysine acetylsalicylate oral economic efficiency using lysine acetylsalicylate secondary prevention ischemic stroke myocardial infarction also demonstrated one pharmacoeconomic lysine acetylsalicylate generally reserved patients urgent need antiplatelet therapy oral nasogastric however rapid onset iv administration makes applicable thrombus clearance stent placement surgical nsaidexacerbated respiratory disease refers

prevent risk kidney problems unborn due linkage reye syndrome aspirin used children age showing signs recovering allergic intolerant nsaids ibuprofen naproxen use lysine lysine acetylsalicylate avoided patients dehydrogenase deficiency due risk hemolytic nonselective blockade cox nsaids lysine acetylsalicylate results attenuation gastric defense resulting increased risk gastrointestinal lysine acetylsalicylate used caution patients peptic ulcer combining aspirin nsaids shown drastically increase risk gastrointestinal bleeding done blockade increases activation leukotriene pathway resulting release cysteinyl leukotrienes potent leukotriene also major factor pathogenesis caution applied use lysine acetylsalicylate patients asthma similarly increase cysteinyl leukotrienes also cause hyperreactivity healthy patients leading nsaidexacerbated respiratory lysine acetylsalicylate used caution patients diagnosed nsaidexacerbated respiratory disease owing antiplatelet properties use oral aspirin lysine acetylsalicylate increase risk bleeding patients hemophilia bleeding tendencies use oral aspirin lysine risk bleeding increased using warfarin
