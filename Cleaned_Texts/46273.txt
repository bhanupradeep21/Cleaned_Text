false potto pseudopotto martini lorisoid primate uncertain taxonomic status found africa anthropologist jeffrey h schwartz named species genus pseudopotto basis two specimens consisting skeletal material previously identified potto perodicticus precise provenances two specimens uncertain least one may come cameroon schwartz thought false potto could even represent separate family researchers argued supposed distinguishing features animal actually distinguish potto specifically false potto shares several features west african potto perodicticus potto false potto generally resembles small potto according schwartz differs longer tail shorter spines neck chest vertebrae smaller less complex spine second neck vertebra entepicondylar foramen opening humerus upper arm bone lacrimal fossa depression skull located inside eye socket smaller upper third premolar molar highercrowned cheekteeth among traits however many traits variable among pottos example one researcher found entepicondylar foramina almost half specimens sample pottos series potto perodicticus potto skeletons collections anthropological institute museum university zurich irchel anthropologist jeffrey h schwartz recognized two specimens traits believed distinct pottos used two specimens describe new genus species primate pseudopotto generic name pseudopotto combines element pseudo greek false potto referring superficial similarities new form specific name martini honors primatologist robert exact provenance two specimens unknown one represented complete skeleton skin skull schwartz placed specimens single species noted study might indicate two represent distinct thought relationships new form unknown difficult assess assign family provisionally placed closest family lorisidae together potto angwantibos discovery published anthropological papers american museum natural history featured scientific science science account noted schwartz thought pseudopotto may represent new family journal african primates published three papers primatologists false potto colin groves affirmed probably distinct simon bearder cited example unrecognized taxonomic diversity esteban sarmiento compared new taxon specimens potto found alleged distinctive traits false potto fact fell within range variation potto false potto probably even species distinct perodicticus primatologist bs leon agreed false potto distinct subspecies perodicticus potto potto noted various forms potto distinct enough may indeed one species opinions since divided compilation african primate diversity concluded insufficient evidence false potto distinct primate chapter third edition mammal species world written groves listed pseudopotto genus noted schwartz continued recognize false potto genus also primatologist david stump reviewed distinguishing features pseudopotto context studying variation among pottos found false pottos traits found pottos mainly western populations subspecies one specimens amz adult female lived z√ºrich zoo represented virtually complete skeleton skin preserved according schwartz skeleton shows signs osteoporosis periodontitis common zoo animals pathologies abnormalities right teeth removed schwartz studied schwartz selected specimen specimen amzas subadult male collected wild skull including mandible lower jaw preserved dentition includes permanent deciduous specimens pseudopotto least superficially similar according schwartz differ number traits among lorisids schwartz saw similarities false potto true pottos well angwantibos slow lorises false potto comparable size smallest pottos falls within range metrical small size also seen western tail according schwartz longer provide measurements tail amz notes least one vertebra sarmiento counted caudal vertebrae illustration amz groves counted least however sarmiento found number caudal vertebrae ranges average relatively long tails also common western form though according stump tail pseudopotto longer seen false potto allegedly shorter spines cervical neck first second thoracic chest leon notes feature also seen western schwartz writes false potto differs pottos angwantibos lacking bifid twotipped spine second cervical vertebra sarmiento found feature potto specimens ulnar styloid process projection ulna one bones forearm meets wrist hooked lorisids according groves suggests may indicate wrist another alleged diagnostic feature presence entepicondylar foramen opening near distal far end bone humerus upper arm however sarmiento found feature specimens one side stump noted foramen occurred specimens across pottos lacrimal fossa depression skull located upper surface skull lorisids schwartz found back inside orbit eye socket false potto slow sarmiento found feature pottos coronoid process mandible said hooked false potto potto slow distinguishing features false potto dentition sarmiento notes however captive specimens may develop abnormalities teeth dental characters schwartz uses quite variable sometimes even one side individual third upper molar reduced false potto prosimian according leon notes western pottos also relatively small third upper premolar also reduced resembling condition forkmarked lemurs stump writes small also common western pottos although false pottos shaped groves notes quite long another point similarity forkmarked lower premolars compressed laterally pseudopotto cusps cheekteeth higher cristid obliqua crest connected protoconid cusp relatively buccal position direction amz skull length mm length right humerus
