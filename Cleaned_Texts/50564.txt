australopithecus garhi species australopithecine bouri formation afar region ethiopia million years ago mya early pleistocene first remains described based several skeletal elements uncovered three years preceding garhi originally considered direct ancestor homo human line thought offshoot like australopithecines garhi brain volume cc cu jaw jutted prognathism relatively large molars premolars adaptations walking two legs bipedalism grasping climbing arboreality possible though unclear males larger females exhibited sexual dimorphism one individual presumed female based size may cm ft tall garhi first prehomo hominin postulated manufactured may counted among growing body evidence prehomo stone tool industries ability manufacture tools previously believed separated homo predecessors garhi possibly produced oldowan industry previously considered invented later h habilis though may instead produced contemporary homo like australopithecines garhi brain volume cc cu sagittal crest running along midline skull prognathic jaw jaw jutted relatively postcanine teeth molars premolars massive postcanine megadontia similar greater australopithecines largetoothed paranthropus like earlier afarensis region garhi humanlike humerus femur ratio apelike brachial index lower upper arm ratio well curved phalanges generally interpreted adaptations walking two legs habitual bipedalism well grasping climbing trees humerus specimen notably larger humerus specimen could potentially indicate sizespecific sexual dimorphism males larger females similar degree postulated afarensis unclear represent normal size variation sex based two specimens nonetheless basis size considered male female contemporary hominins kenya size may cm ft australopithecus thought fast apelike growth rates lacking extended childhood typical modern humans however legs garhi elongated unlike australopithecus humans elongated limbs develop delayed adolescent growth spurt could mean garhi compared australopithecus either slower overall growth rate rapid leg growth ethiopian australopithecus garhi first described palaeoanthropologists berhane asfaw tim white owen lovejoy bruce latimer scott

paranthropus aethiopicus likewise classification australopithecines prehomo erectus hominins subject much debate original describers considered garhi descendant earlier afarensis inhabited region based mainly dental similarities though assigned species australopithecus original describers believed could represent ancestor homo case would possibly lead reclassification h garhi characteristics garhi unexpected human ancestor stage specific name garhi means surprise local afar american palaeoanthropologists david strait frederick e grine concluded garhi instead offshoot human line instead ancestor garhi homo share synapomorphies traits unique homo recorded mya much earlier large teeth australopithecus species historically interpreted adaptations diet hard foods durable teeth may instead served important function leaner times harder fallback foods dental anatomy may accurately portray normal australopithecus diet rather abnormal diet times though found tools mammalian bones associated garhi remains exhibit cut percussion marks made stone tools left mandible alcelaphine bovid three successive unambiguous cut marks presumably made removing tongue bovid tibia cut marks chop marks impact scars hammerstone possibly inflicted harvest bone marrow hipparion horse femur cut marks consistent dismemberment filleting stone tools present hatayae locality likely featureless grassy lake margin raw materials making stone tools possible hominins creating carrying tools ways butchering sites intending use many times discarding previously believed homo could manufacture also possible butcherers manufacturing tools simply used naturally sharp nearby gona site abundance raw materials several oldowan tools industry previously believed invented h habilis recovered tools date around mya oldest evidence manufacturing time since garhi species identified vicinity time species best candidate however earliest remains homo ld discovered ledigeraru also afar region dating stone
