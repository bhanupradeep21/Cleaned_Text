tennis racket theorem intermediate axis theorem kinetic phenomenon classical mechanics describes movement rigid body three distinct principal moments inertia also dubbed dzhanibekov effect soviet cosmonaut vladimir dzhanibekov noticed one theorems logical consequences whilst space formally effect known least years described louis poinsot theorem describes following effect rotation object
