horse teeth refers dentition equine species including horses donkeys equines heterodontous diphyodontous means teeth one shape five shapes tooth horses mouth two successive sets teeth deciduous baby teeth permanent sets grazing animals good dentition essential survival continued grazing creates specific patterns wear used along patterns eruption estimate age fully developed horse around five years age teeth equines heterodontous means different shaped teeth different purposes horses twelve incisors front mouth used primarily cutting food often grass whilst also used part horses attack defence predators part establishing social hierarchy within herd immediately behind front incisors interdental space teeth grow gums bit placed used horses ridden behind interdental space horses also

draft horses miniature horses permanent middle corner incisors usually late appearing foal yearling two years three years five years six years seven years nine years twelve years horse teeth often wear specific patterns based way horse eats food patterns often used conjecture age horse developed full mouth aging observing tooth eruption imprecise may affected diet natural abnormalities vices cribbing importance dentition assessing age horses led veterinary dentistry techniques used method fraud owners traders altering teeth horses mimic tooth shapes characteristics horses younger actual age equine teeth evolved wear tooth horse chews thus preventing excess growth upper jaw wider lower one cases sharp edges occur outside upper molars inside lower molars unopposed opposite grinding surface sharp edges reduce chewing efficiency teeth interfere jaw motion extreme cases cut tongue cheek making eating riding painful wild natural foodstuffs may allowed teeth wear evenly many modern horses often graze lusher softer forage ancestors also frequently fed grain concentrated feed possible natural wear may reduced domestic horse hand uneven wear wild may times contributed shorter lifespan modern wild horses live estimated years domesticated horse depending breed management quite often lives years thus domesticated animals also live longer may simply time develop dental issues wild forebears never facedcitation needed typical wear patterns horses include horses incisors premolars molars fully developed continue erupt grinding surface worn chewing young adult horses teeth typically inches long majority crown remaining gumline dental socket rest tooth slowly emerges jaw erupting year horse ages animal reaches old age crowns teeth short teeth often lost altogether old horses lacking molars chew may need soft feeds maintain adequate levels nutrition older horses may appear lean shallow lower jaw roots teeth begun younger horses may seem lumpy jaw due presence permanent teeth within jaw bit fitted horse along bridle normally metal bar bit lies interdental space incisors canines present premolars bridle adjusted bit rests low high may push teeth cause

problems variety dental services available minimise problems reactive prophylactic intervention equine dentistry undertaken vet trained specialist equine dental technician cases performed lay persons including owners trainers problems dentition horses work result poor performance behavioural issues must ruled cause negative behaviours horse authorities recommend regular checks professional normally six monthly annually wear teeth cause problems uneven sharp points appearing especially outer edge molars inner edge premolars posterior end last molars bottom jaw specific conditions relating wear include step mouth one molar premolar grows longer others jaw normally corresponding tooth opposite jaw missing broken therefore could wear opposite wave mouth least two molars premolars higher others viewed side grinding surfaces produce wavelike pattern rather straight line leading periodontal disease excessive wear teeth shear mouth grinding surfaces molars premolars severely sloped individual tooth inner side teeth much higher lower outer side teeth severely affecting chewing horses may also experience overbitebrachygnathism parrot mouth underbiteprognathism sow mouth monkey mouth may affect incisors wear severe cases horses ability graze may affected horses also sometimes suffer equine malocclusion misalignment upper lower jaws curvature incisors may also vary normal straight bite curvature may dorsal ventral curvatures may result incisor malocclusion eg ventraloverbitedorsalunderbite curvature may also diagonal stemming wear pattern offset incisors pain cheek teeth rather incisors causes horse chew one direction common problems include abscessed loose infected cracked teeth retained deciduous teeth plaque buildup wolf teeth may also cause problems many times removed retained caps help prevent dental problems recommended get horses teeth checked vet equine dental technician every months however regular checks may needed often individuals especially horse young old additionally horses teeth checked major performance problems showing signs dental problem many horses require floating rasping teeth every months although variable dependent individual horse first four five years horses life growthrelated changes occur hence frequent checkups may prevent problems developing equine teeth get harder horse gets older may rapid changes prime adult years life horses become aged particularly late teens additional changes incisor angle molar growth patterns often necessitate frequent care horse late early molar loss becomes concern floating involves veterinarian wearing surface teeth usually remove sharp points balance mouth however veterinarian must careful take much surface enough roughened area tooth allow properly tear apart food additionally much work tooth cause thermal damage could lead extract tooth expose sensitive interior tooth pulp person without veterinary degree performs service called horse floater equine dental
