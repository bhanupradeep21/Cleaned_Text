pentobarbital analog thiobarbital sodium thiopental core medicine world health organizations list essential supplanted despite thiopental listed acceptable alternative propofol depending local availability cost previously first three drugs administered lethal injections united states us manufacturer hospira stopped manufacturing drug european union banned export drug although thiopental abuse carries dependency risk recreational use sodium thiopental ultrashortacting barbiturate used commonly induction phase general anesthesia use largely replaced propofol may retain popularity induction agent rapidsequence induction intubation following intravenous injection drug rapidly reaches brain causes unconsciousness within seconds one minute drug attains peak concentration total dose brain thereafter drug distributes rest body minutes concentration low enough brain consciousness returns normal dose sodium thiopental usually mgkg given pregnant woman operative delivery caesarean section rapidly makes unconscious baby uterus remains conscious however larger repeated doses depress babys sodium thiopental used maintain anesthesia surgical procedures infusion displays zeroorder elimination pharmacokinetics leading long period consciousness regained instead anesthesia usually maintained inhaled anesthetic gas agent inhaled anesthetics eliminated relatively quickly stopping inhaled anesthetic allow rapid return consciousness sodium thiopental would given large amounts maintain unconsciousness anaesthesia due rapid redistribution throughout body high volume distribution since halflife hours quite long consciousness would take long time veterinary medicine sodium thiopental used induce anesthesia animals since redistributed fat certain lean breeds dogs sighthounds prolonged recoveries sodium thiopental due lack body fat lean body mass conversely obese animals rapid recoveries take much longer drug entirely removed metabolized bodies sodium thiopental always administered intravenously fairly irritating tissue vesicant severe tissue necrosis sloughing occur injected incorrectly tissue around addition anesthesia induction sodium thiopental historically used induce medical superseded drugs propofol effects wear quickly thiopental patients brain swelling causing elevation intracranial pressure either secondary trauma following surgery may benefit drug sodium thiopental barbiturate class drugs decrease neuronal activity thereby decreasing cerebral metabolic rate oxygen consumption decrease cerebrovascular response carbon dioxide turn decreases intracranial pressure patients refractory elevated intracranial pressure rich due traumatic brain injury tbi may improved long term outcome barbiturate coma added neurointensive care reportedly thiopental shown superior pentobarbital reducing intracranial phenomenon also called inverse steal robin hood effect cerebral perfusion parts brain reduced due decreased cerebrovascular response carbon dioxide allowing optimal perfusion ischaemic areas brain higher metabolic demands since vessels supplying ischaemic areas brain would already maximally dilated metabolic refractory status epilepticus thiopental may used terminate seizure sodium thiopental used intravenously purposes euthanasia belgium netherlands active euthanasia allowed law standard protocol recommends sodium
