central nervous system tumor cns tumor abnormal growth cells tissues brain spinal cns tumor generic term encompassing distinct tumor common symptoms cns tumors include vomiting headache changes vision nausea cns tumor detected classified via neurological examination medical imaging xray imaging magnetic resonance imaging mri computed tomography ct analysis list common pediatric cns tumors childrens brain tumors list based classification cns tumors pediatric cancer register american cancer society estimated number new cases pediatric cns tumors us number deaths attributable cns tumors incidence rates common brain tumors adult patients different meningiomas common tumor accounting cases much higher mortality common symptoms cns tumors headache vomiting nausea symptoms vary depending tumor may include unsteady gait slowed speech memory loss loss hearing vision problems memory narrowing visual field back pain symptoms may also vary greatly individuals tumor type pediatric patients symptoms may symptoms adults specific location tumor causes cns tumors poorly understood risk factors known including radiation exposure genetic disorder family history cns tumors immunodeficiency stress history previous cancers cancers risk developing cns tumor increases number genetic disorders increase risk specific types cns tumors include tuberous sclerosis von hippellindau disease lifraumeni syndrome gorlin syndrome turcot syndrome cowden syndrome neurofibromatosis types patients higher risks schwannomas meningiomas types gliomas correlated vestibular schwannomas recommended tests diagnose cns tumor usually found patients develop symptoms visit doctor first step diagnosis usually neurological exam including tests reflexes muscle strength vision eye movements balance alertness results abnormal additional tests carried specialist neurosurgeon neurologist may recommended adults children undergo similar set tests diagnose cns tumors including patients cns tumors family record disease imaging important method diagnosing cns tumors determining location location informative identifying type tumor determining treat magnetic resonance imaging mri computed tomography ct scans commonly used imaging technologies diagnosis cns tumors mri provides better detail detection tumorinfiltrated magnetic resonance imaging uses strong magnetic fields magnetic field gradients radio waves generate images structure brain perfusion mri contrast agent gadolinium compounds may used study structure blood vessels around tumor provide nutrients remove contrast agent may taken mouth injected patient scan magnetic resonance spectroscopy mrs variant mri used measure biochemical changes brain comparing metabolites detected normal brain tissue affected brain tissue help determine type tumor estimate quickly computed tomography ct technologies include xray ct positron emission tomography pet singlephoton emission computed tomography spect xray ct scans take many xray measurements different angles produce virtual slices specific areas scanned object reassembled complete image object scans detect tumors swelling anatomical distortion cause surrounding edema ct scans widely available produce images rapidly mri scans provide better anatomic detail brain structures detection tumorinfiltrated biopsy definitive way diagnose cns tumors difficulty accessing brain tissue risk damage brain biopsies may guided computer imaging stereotactic surgery procedure stereotactic biopsy performed local anesthesia general anesthesia mri ct scan scalp scalp contours marked show position drill cut scalp image guidance system used provide assistance directing needle tumor collect small tissue sample sample analyzed pathologist neuropathologist determine whether tumor benign malignant identify type tumor biopsies also performed part operation remove tumor blood tests complete blood count cbc provide insight progress tumor measuring number blood cell types white blood cells red blood cells platelets blood chemistry also used check health liver kidneys organs many tumors shed microscopic extracellular vesicles bloodstream used monitor progress cancer response cns tumors typically treated using one following options treatment cns tumors frequently involves team doctors working together including neurosurgeons neurologists medical oncologists radiation oncologists endocrinologists surgeries used diagnose treat cns tumors removal tumor tissues helps decrease pressure tumor nearby parts main goal surgery remove much possible tumor mass preserving normal brain function relieve symptoms caused tumor headache nausea tumors deepseated unsafe remove cases role surgery may limited obtaining diagnostic surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy may used destroy remaining cancer cells radiation therapy uses high energy rays destroy cancer cells shrink tumors kind rays used xrays gamma rays electron beams protons according national cancer two types radiation therapy external radiation therapy teletherapy uses machine sends focused beam radiation directed location tumor body radiation may delivered several angles shaped beam maximize dose delivered tumor reducing harm healthy parts treatment commonly given daily internal radiation therapy source radiation inserted patients body may done placing solid source radiation adjacent tumor form seed ribbon capsule giving patient liquid source radiation travels body kills cancer cells system therapy case radiation usually given form injections ingesting capsule intravenous linecitation needed chemotherapy treatment uses tumorkilling drug prevent growth cancer cells stopping dividing often used surgery first line treatment drug may given systemically injection vein mouth may injected fluid surrounds brain spinal cord allow drug reach tumor without crossing barrier intrathecal common side effects chemotherapy include increasing number drugs available promise target tumor specifically reducing harm normal cells therapies matched specific tumor include antibodies bind specific surface molecules found primarily tumor small molecules target proteins mutated tumor targeted therapies may block enzymes proteins necessary cancer cell proliferation deliver toxic substances directly cancer cells help immune system function prevent tumor obtaining nutrients example bevacizumab targeted therapy drug used various cancers including glioblastoma blocks blood supply therefore proliferation cancerous tumorscitation needed checkpoint inhibitors prevent tumor blocking action tumorkilling cells immune system also tested cns tumor although targeted therapy may fewer side effects forms cancer treatment side effects still frequent may include high blood pressure fatigue increased risk infection diarrheacitation needed treatments cns tumors significant risks sideeffects cases tumors slow growing cause symptoms may preferable closely watch patients condition without treatment new test results symptoms indicate patients condition httpsenwikipediaorgwikicentralnervoussystemtumor
