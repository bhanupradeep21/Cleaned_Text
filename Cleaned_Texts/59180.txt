beta bulge described localized disruption regular hydrogen bonding beta sheet inserting extra residues one hydrogen bonded βbulges grouped according length disruption number residues inserted strand whether disrupted βstrands parallel antiparallel dihedral angles controls placement side chains two types occur commonly one classic beta bulge occurs within edge antiparallel betasheet first residue outwards bulge typically αr rather normal β conformation type beta bulge two common sorts mainly occurring association antiparallel sheet one residue αl conformation usually glycine one sort beta bulge loop one hydrogen bonds betabulge also forms beta turn alpha turn motif often loop beta sort beta link beta bulge occurs combination overlaps type ii beta turn level backbone structure classic βbulges cause simple aneurysm βsheet eg bulge long βhairpin ribonuclease residues βbulge also cause βsheet fold cross eg two residues lefthanded righthanded αhelical dihedral angles inserted opposite βhairpin occurs pseudoazurin pdb accession code conserved bulges regularly affect protein functionality basic function bulges accommodate extra residue added due mutation etc maintaining bonding pattern thus overall protein architecture bulges involved protein binding sites specific cases like immunoglobulin family proteins conserved bulges help dimerization ig domains also functional importance proteins dhfr dihydrofolate reductase sod superoxide dismutase loops containing bulges surround active site httpsenwikipediaorgwikibetabulge
