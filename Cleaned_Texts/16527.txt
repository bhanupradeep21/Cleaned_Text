body identification subfield forensic science uses variety scientific nonscientific methods identify body forensic purposes served rigorous scientific forensic identification techniques generally preceded formal involves requesting family member friend victim visually identify body body badly decomposed damaged one persons knew deceased well visually confirm authorities also compare supportive documents drivers license passport authoritative photo id accepting personal formal investigation used support additional scientific evidence allowing forensic scientists either reinforce question supposed identity scientific methods also used cases introductory approaches possible scientific identification techniques including anthropometry skin analysis dental records genetics rely individuality factors body size weight skin prints blood type act indicators identity forensic scientists analyse characteristics process identifying process generally involves comparison antemortem information living individuals either relatives information missing person postmortem information obtained dead unidentified traditional scientific identification methods developed late eighteenth nineteenth centuries allowed forensic scientists identify body without formal identification methods included dental analysis anthropometry fingerprinting forensic dentistry first used paul revere identified fallen soldier joseph warren false anthropometry first introduced alphonse bertillon developed bertillon system based physical findings overtaken method fingerprinting sir francis galtons observations fingerprints means identification proved modern scientific identification techniques developed late twentieth century response advancement technology research methods included analysis skin various prints dna profiling forensic scientists realised skin fingerprints use palm ear prints could also assist identification alec jeffreys first forensic scientist use dna analysis purpose body identification since dna examination become popular forensic identification many cases people died serving military remain unidentified due destructive nature death long remains go unidentified bodies service people returned country formal treatment required respect united states servicemen branch military supervise delivery transportation remains examination unidentified person placed white sheet persons body identified funeral burial takes place accompaniment members respective branch person anthropometry involves examining size weight dimensions analysis physical aspects facilitate possible identification scientific procedures take reduce unnecessary expenses spent scientific technology results anthropometric testing sufficient scientific methods employed increase accuracy identification alphonse bertillon developed bertillon system system identifying body three dimensions anthropometric information descriptive information description particular combination categories creates picture individual scientists attempt match anthropometric information incorporates measurement different body parts including head fingers feet process obtaining anthropometric information involves use different callipercompasses used measure dimensions sliding compasses used measure foot forearm middle little small sliding compasses used measure vertical measure used measure height horizontal measure used measure descriptive information includes aspects eye colour hair colour structure characteristics provide forensic scientists indicators identity however possible find two individuals similar anthropometric descriptive finding peculiarities human body particular marks allows forensic scientists narrow identification human body particular marks provide specific knowledge forensic scientists attempting determine identity body description particular marks involves assessment unique marks body scars marks individual characterised nature direction dimensions process anthropometry impacted factors influence perception body sex gender determination sex one first steps identifying physical differences standard male female bodies act indicator identity forensic particular body parts individuals reproductive organs size breasts indicator socially constructed ideas gender length one hair height individual also influence process body identification assumptions gender complicated contemporary society intersex transgender individuals becoming increasingly skin provides forensic scientists ways identify body skin variety prints unique individual fingerprints common form print analysis process body analysis palm prints similar fingerprints however also provide information dominant hand age individual key indicators hand deteriorated prints suggested dominant hand individual due frequent size ones hand suggest possible age range ear prints also assessed process body ear printing least common method print analysis due ears malleable accuracy skin prints influenced variety external factors temperature humidity time natural skin shedding components considered using skin prints form identification doubt scientific research take skin defects help identify body including scars birthmarks tattoos moles nature location defects particular individual deterioration skin time physically obvious young fit individual typically firm thick skin however individuals age particularly skin subject sagging appearance one skin indicator age significant characteristic person sun exposure lifestyle choices additional factors forensic scientists consider alongside age analysing appearance individuals gender also affects perception ones skin common cultural social constructs influence forensic scientist determination include expectations facial body hair length one factors used conjunction scientific identification methods due socially constructed individuals race also act indicator identity colour one skin visual identifier assumptions reinforced supportive identification documents scientific methods dental examination method body identification involves comparison antemortem postmortem dental records radiographs jaw analysed detect peculiarities teeth scenario skin prints unable assist process identification dental examination forensic dentistry anthropology center dental faculty piracicaba analysed radiographs dental records surgically implanted orthopedic successfully identify burned body success dental identification tainted individual endured physically traumatic experience caused damage teeth scenario dna identification used process body identification alec jeffreys known founding father dna identification invented dna fingerprinting assist process body since method dna typing forensic science advanced many techniques identify microrna markers bodily fluids dna analysis involves comparison dna profiles dna forensic scientists analyse impact time sensitivity appearance micrornas determining well detected different bodily fluids commonly used process dna identification menstrual blood venous blood semen saliva vaginal process dna profiling includes dna extraction dna quantification use pcr dna extracted variety samples cases body identification mostly encounter human remains teeth resistant damage degradation hair blood body common methods dna extraction include phenol chelex silica magnetic phenol process toxic open method primarily used extract cells nucleic acids necessary chelex process safe open method connects ions order purify also cheapest silica process safe open method binds dna molecules silica also expensive magnetic beads process safe open following binding dna process involves magnetic field paralysing beads allowing washing extracted dna must quantified ensure optimal amount dna template added pcr pcr polymerase chain reaction technology used purpose copying particular dna test method includes three steps denaturation annealing dna markers used identify specific dna characteristics allow distinction different markers analysed forensic scientists identifying unknown body dna markers either genotype genotype set genes organism phenotype organism characteristics determined genes nextgeneration sequencing ngs recent body identification method field process ngs includes three fundamental steps library preparation sequencing data interpretation success due ability target larger number pcr amplicons single assay genetic genealogy used identify deceased individuals unknown suspects well living method uses genomics computer database technologies genealogy finally forensic dna profiling identify unknown start determining individuals dna profile using single nucleotide polymorphisms snps uploaded onto one dna databases able match commonly used databases include gedmatch familytreedna ftdna relative identified closer relatives better cousin closer genealogists determine family tree using publicly available information birth certificates death certificates marriage certificates obituaries provides list possible candidates confirmed using forensic dna cases deceased individuals usually done kinship testing close living
