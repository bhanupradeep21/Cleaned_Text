immune system produce antibodies longterm shortterm drug administration induce response however immune response certain antigens may inadequate especially elderly additionally adverse reactions antibodies may occur longlasting response passive monoclonal antibody therapy ensure consistent antibody concentration control adverse reactions stopping administration however repeated administration consequent higher cost therapy major monoclonal antibody therapy may prove beneficial cancer autoimmune diseases neurological disorders result degeneration body cells alzheimers disease monoclonal
