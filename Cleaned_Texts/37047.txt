milder auditory disorders whether source disorder earlier auditory processing stage cerebral deafness also known cortical deafness central deafness disorder characterized complete deafness result damage central nervous system primary distinction auditory agnosia cerebral deafness ability detect pure tones measured pure tone audiometry using test auditory agnosia patients often capable detecting pure tones almost good healthy individuals whereas cerebral deafness patients found task almost impossible required loud presentations sounds db reported cases cerebral deafness associated bilateral temporal lobe lesions compared lesions two cerebral deafness patients auditory agnosia patient concluded cerebral deafness result complete deafferentation auditory cortices whereas auditory agnosia thalamocortical fibers spared cases disorder transient symptoms mitigate auditory agnosia although chronic cases similarly monkey ablated auditory cortices monkeys reported deafness lasted week cases gradually mitigated auditory agnosia period weeks since early days aphasia research relationship auditory agnosia speech perception debated proposed auditory agnosia result damage brain area dedicated perception spoken words consequently renamed disorder word deafness pure word deafness description word deafness exclusively words adopted scientific community despite patient reported lichtheims also general auditory deficits researchers surveyed literature however argued labeling disorder pure word deafness account patients reported impaired perceiving spoken words also noted auditory deficits aphasic one review literature presented evidence separation word deafness general auditory agnosia suggested naming disorder linguistic auditory agnosia name later rephrased verbal auditory contrast disorder auditory agnosia speech repetition intact word meaning deafness name word sound phonemic kleist also proposed although researchers argued purity word deafness anecdotal cases exclusive impaired perception speech citations several occasions patients reported gradually transition pure word deafness general auditory agnosiacerebral recovery general auditory agnosiacerebral deafness pure word review auditory agnosia literature phillips showed patients word deafness impaired ability discriminate gaps click sounds long milliseconds consistent duration phonemes also showed patients general auditory agnosia impaired ability discriminate gaps click sounds long milliseconds authors showed word deafness patients liken auditory experience hearing foreign language whereas general auditory agnosia described speech incomprehensible noise based findings word deafness general auditory agnosia patients reported similar neuroanatomical damage bilateral damage auditory cortices authors concluded word deafness general auditory agnosia disorder different degree severity pinard et also suggested pure word deafness general auditory agnosia represent different degrees disorder suggested environmental sounds spared mild cases easier perceive speech parts argued environmental sounds distinct speech sounds varied duration loudness also proposed environmental sounds easier perceive composed repetitive pattern eg bark dog siren ambulance auerbach et considered word deafness general auditory agnosia two separate disorders labelled general auditory agnosia prephonemic auditory agnosia word deafness postphonemic auditory agnosia suggested prephonemic auditory agnosia manifests general damage auditory cortex hemispheres postphonemic auditory agnosia manifests damage spoken word recognition center left hemisphere recent evidence possibly verified auerbach hypothesis since epileptic patient undergone electrostimulation anterior superior temporal gyrus demonstrated transient loss speech comprehension intact perception environmental sounds term auditory agnosia originally coined describe patients selective impairment environmental sounds review auditory agnosia literature renamed disorder nonverbal auditory agnosia although sound auditory agnosia environmental sound auditory agnosia also commonly used disorder rare cases contradiction pure word deafness general auditory agnosia disorder likely underdiagnosed patients often aware disorder thus dont seek medical throughout century reported nonverbal auditory agnosia patients bilateral right temporal lobe damage reason right hemisphere traditionally attributed perception environmental sounds however tanaka et reported patients nonverbal auditory agnosia right hemisphere lesions left hemisphere lesions et al also reported patient damage left auditory cortex underlying deficit nonverbal auditory agnosia appears varied several patients characterized impaired discrimination whereas others reported impaired discrimination timbre discrimination pitch relatively preserved one contrast patients pure word deafness general auditory agnosia patients nonverbal auditory agnosia reported impaired discriminating long gaps click sounds impaired short possible neuroanatomical structure relays longer sound duration suggested tanaka et comparing lesions two cortically deaf patients lesion word deafness patient proposed existence two thalamocortical pathways interconnect mgn auditory cortex suggested spoken words relayed via direct thalamocortical pathway passes underneath putamen environmental sounds relayed via separate thalamocortical pathway passes putamen near parietal white matter auditory agnosia patients often impaired discrimination sounds including music however two patients music perception one patient music perception medical literature reports patients diagnosed exclusive deficit discrimination recognition musical ie amusia damage cases localized right hemisphere bilateral exception one damage cases tended focus around temporal pole consistently removal anterior temporal lobe also associated loss music recordings directly anterior auditory cortex revealed hemispheres music perceived medially findings therefore imply loss music perception auditory agnosia damage medial anterior stg contrast association amusia specific recognition melodies amelodia temporal pole posterior stg damage associated loss rhythm perception conversely two patients rhythm perception intact recognitiondiscrimination musical segments amusia also dissociates regard enjoyment music two amusic patients werent able distinguish musical instruments reported still enjoy listening music hand patient left hemispheric damage amygdala reported perceive enjoy suggested etiology word deafness could due either impaired perception sound apperceptive auditory agnosia impaired extraction meaning sound associative auditory agnosia hypothesis first tested vignolo et examined unilateral stroke patients reported patients left hemisphere damage impaired matching environmental sounds corresponding pictures whereas patients right hemisphere damage impaired discrimination meaningless noise segments researchers concluded left hemispheric damage results associative auditory agnosia right hemisphere damage results apperceptive auditory agnosia although conclusion reached study could considered overreaching associative auditory agnosia could correspond disorder word meaning deafness patients word meaning deafness characterized impaired speech recognition intact repetition speech left hemisphere patients often repeat words attempt extract meaning eg jarjarwhat first documented bramwell translated ellis reported

diagnosed auditory unlike auditory agnosia patients word meaning deafness patients impaired discriminating gaps click yet unclear whether word meaning deafness also synonymous disorder deep dysphasia patients repeat nonsense words produce semantic paraphasia repetition real word meaning deafness also often confused transcortical sensory aphasia patients differ latter ability express appropriately orally writing auditory agnosia exception nonverbal auditory agnosia amusia strongly dependent damage order hemispheric damage irrelevant manifestation symptoms years could take damage first
