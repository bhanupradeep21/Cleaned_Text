angina also known angina pectoris chest pain pressure usually caused insufficient blood flow heart muscle commonly symptom coronary artery angina typically result partial obstruction spasm arteries supply blood heart main mechanism coronary artery obstruction atherosclerosis part coronary artery disease causes angina include abnormal heart rhythms heart failure less commonly term derives latin angere strangle pectus chest therefore translated strangling feeling chest relationship severity angina degree oxygen deprivation heart muscle however severity angina always match degree oxygen deprivation heart risk heart attack myocardial infarction people may experience severe pain even though little risk heart attack others may heart attack experience little cases angina quite severe worsening angina attacks suddenonset angina rest angina lasting minutes symptoms unstable angina usually grouped similar conditions acute coronary syndrome may precede heart attack require urgent medical attention general treated similarly heart early century severe angina seen sign impending however modern medical therapies improved outlook substantially middleage patients experience moderate severe angina grading classes ii iii iv fiveyear survival rate approximately also known effort angina refers classic type angina related myocardial ischemia typical presentation stable angina chest discomfort associated symptoms precipitated activity running walking etc minimal nonexistent symptoms rest administration sublingual symptoms typically abate several minutes activity recur activity resumes way stable angina may thought similar intermittent claudication symptoms recognized precipitants stable angina include cold weather heavy meals emotional stress unstable angina ua also crescendo angina form acute coronary syndrome defined angina pectoris changes least one three ua may occur often occur unpredictably even rest may serious indicator impending heart attack primary factor differentiating unstable angina stable angina symptoms underlying pathophysiology atherosclerosis pathophysiology unstable angina reduction coronary blood flow due transient platelet aggregation apparently normal endothelium coronary artery spasms coronary process starts atherosclerosis progresses inflammation yield active unstable plaque undergoes thrombosis results acute myocardial ischemia reversed results cell necrosis studies show unstable anginas occur patients stable angina developing atheroma fatty plaque protected fibrous cap cap may rupture unstable angina allowing blood clots precipitate decrease area coronary vessels lumen interior open space within artery explains many cases unstable angina develops independently microvascular angina also known cardiac syndrome x characterized anginalike chest pain context normal epicardial coronary arteries largest vessels surface heart prior significant branching angiography original definition cardiac syndrome x also mandated ischemic changes exercise despite normal coronary arteries displayed shown cardiac stress primary cause microvascular angina unknown factors apparently involved endothelial dysfunction reduced flow perhaps due spasm tiny resistance blood vessels since microvascular angina characterized major arterial blockages harder recognize microvascular angina previously considered rather benign condition recent data changed attitude studies including womens ischemia syndrome evaluation wise suggest microvascular angina part pathophysiology ischemic heart disease perhaps explaining higher rates angina females men well predilection towards ischemia acute coronary syndromes absence obstructive coronary artery angina pectoris quite painful many patients angina complain chest discomfort rather actual pain discomfort usually described pressure heaviness tightness squeezing burning choking sensation apart chest discomfort anginal pains may also experienced epigastrium upper central abdomen back neck area jaw shoulders explained concept referred pain spinal level receives visceral sensation heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation parts skin specified spinal nerves dermatome without ability discriminate two typical locations referred pain arms often inner left arm shoulders neck jaw angina typically precipitated exertion emotional stress exacerbated full stomach cold temperatures pain may accompanied breathlessness sweating nausea cases case pulse rate blood pressure increases chest pain lasting seconds normally angina precordial catch syndrome myocardial ischemia comes myocardium heart muscle receives insufficient blood oxygen function normally either increased oxygen demand myocardium decreased supply myocardium inadequate perfusion blood resulting reduced delivery oxygen nutrients directly correlated blocked narrowed blood vessels experience autonomic symptoms related increased activity autonomic nervous system nausea vomiting pallor major risk factors angina include cigarette smoking diabetes high cholesterol high blood pressure sedentary lifestyle family history premature heart disease variant form patients normal coronary arteries insignificant atherosclerosis believed caused spasms artery occurs younger coital angina also known angina damour angina subsequent sexual generally rare except patients

force recommend routine lifestyle counseling patients without known cardiovascular disease hypertension hyperlipidemia diabetes instead recommends selectively counseling patients seem ready make lifestyle changes using available time patients explore types intervention would likely preventative one study found smokers coronary artery disease significantly increased level sympathetic nerve activity compared without addition increases blood pressure heart rate peripheral vascular resistance associated nicotine may lead recurrent angina attacks addition centers disease control prevention cdc reports risk chd coronary heart disease stroke pvd peripheral vascular disease reduced within years smoking cessation another study found one year prevalence angina smokingmales initial attack less quit smoking compared continued studies found shortterm longterm benefits smoking myocardial ischemia result atherosclerosis common cause stenosis narrowing blood vessels hearts arteries hence angina pectoris people chest pain normal minimal narrowing heart arteries patients vasospasm likely cause pain sometimes context prinzmetals angina syndrome x myocardial ischemia also result factors affecting blood composition reduced oxygencarrying capacity blood seen severe anemia low number red blood cells longterm smoking angina results imbalance hearts oxygen demand supply imbalance result increase demand eg exercise without proportional increase supply eg due obstruction atherosclerosis coronary arteries however pathophysiology angina females varies significantly compared nonobstructive coronary disease common angina suspected people presenting tight dull heavy chest discomfort people present atypical symptoms including breathlessness nausea epigastric discomfort burning atypical symptoms particularly likely older people women anginal pain usually sharp stabbing influenced respiration antacids simple analgesics usually relieve pain chest discomfort whatever site precipitated exertion relieved rest relieved glyceryl trinitrate likelihood angina angina patients momentarily feeling chest pain electrocardiogram ecg typically normal unless cardiac problems past periods pain depression elevation st segment may observed elicit changes exercise ecg test treadmill test may performed patient exercises hisher maximum ability fatigue breathlessness pain intervenes characteristic ecg changes documented typically mm flat downsloping st depression test considered diagnostic angina even constant monitoring blood pressure pulse rate lead conclusions regarding angina exercise test also useful looking markers myocardial ischemia blood pressure response lack thereof particular drop systolic blood pressure dysrhythmia chronotropic response alternatives standard exercise test include thallium scintigram sestamibi scintigram patients unable exercise enough treadmill tests eg due asthma arthritis ecg abnormal rest stress echocardiography patients noninvasive testing diagnostic coronary angiogram typically performed identify nature coronary lesion whether would candidate angioplasty coronary artery bypass graft cabg treatment

directly angina pectoris occurs result coronary blood flow insufficiency face increased oxygen demand principal goal prevention relief angina limit oxygen requirement heart meet inadequate oxygen supply derived blood supplied stenosed constricted arteries main goals treatment angina pectoris relief symptoms slowing progression disease reduction future events especially heart attacks death beta blockers eg carvedilol metoprolol propranolol large body evidence morbidity mortality benefits fewer symptoms less disability longer life shortacting nitroglycerin medications used since symptomatic relief differing course treatments patient depending type angina patient however second provide brief overview types medications provided angina purpose prescribed beta blockers specifically adrenergic blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity preferred angina treatment selective nonselective well isa agents blockers cardioselective blocking agents nevibolol atenolol metoprolol bisoprolol result blocking camp heart muscle cells camp plays vital role phosphorylating ryanodine receptor ltcc usually increase levels heart muscle cells result contraction blocked therefore blockade decreases hr contraction heart muscle making demand less oxygen important thing note cardioselective blockers cardioselective cardio specific means betaadrenergic antagonist prescribed higher doses lose selectivity aspect begin causing hypertension adrenergic stimulation smooth muscle cells therapy patients angina vasodilatory organonitrates complement use bblockers prescribed use angina preference cardioselective blockers cardioselective blockers without instrinsic sympathetic activity beta blockers intrinsic sympathetic activity still beta blockade heart muscle cells decreased ionotrophic chronotropic effect effect lesser extent beta blocker instrinsic sympathetic activity common betablocker isa prescribed treatment angina acebutolol nonselective betaadrenergic antagonists yield action receptors however also act receptors medications propranolol nadolol act receptors smooth muscle cells well blockade occurs smooth muscle cells specifically camp responsible inhibiting myosin light kinase enzyme responsible acting actinmyosin inhibition result decreased levels camp lead increased levels myosin light chain kinase smooth muscle cells enzyme responsible acting actinmyosin leading contraction smooth muscle cell increased contraction smooth muscle cell blockade desirable since explains hypertension may arise patients taking medication calcium channel blockers act decrease hearts workload thus requirement oxygen blocking calcium channels heart muscle cell decreased intracellular calcium calciumtroponin complex form heart muscle cell contract therefore reducing need oxygen class medication used treat angina organic nitrates organic nitrates used extensively treat angina improve coronary blood flow coronary arteries arteries supply blood heart muscle reversing preventing vasospasm increases blood flow heart improving perfusion oxygen delivery heart associated pain angina drugs also reduce systemic vascular resistance veins arteries veins greater extent decrease resistance arteries veins decreases myocardial oxygen demand also reduces myocardial oxygen demand nitroglycerin potent vasodilator decreases myocardial oxygen demand decreasing hearts workload nitroglycerin given certain inhibitors sildenafil tadalafil vardenafil taken within previous hours combination two could cause serious drop blood pressure treatments angina balloon angioplasty balloon inserted end catheter inflated widen arterial lumen stents maintain arterial widening often used time coronary bypass surgery involves bypassing constricted arteries venous grafts much invasive angioplasty calcium channel blockers nifedipine adalat amlodipine isosorbide mononitrate nicorandil vasodilators commonly used chronic stable anginacitation needed new therapeutic class called inhibitor recently made available ivabradine provides heart rate reduction without affecting leading major antiischemic antianginal efficacy ace inhibitors also vasodilators symptomatic prognostic benefit statins frequently used lipidcholesterol modifiers probably also stabilize existing atheromatous lowdose aspirin decreases risk heart attack patients chronic stable angina part standard treatment however patients without established cardiovascular disease increase hemorrhagic stroke gastrointestinal bleeding offsets benefits longer advised unless risk myocardial infarction exercise also good longterm treatment angina particular regimens gentle sustained exercise rather intense short probably working complex mechanisms improving blood pressure promoting coronary artery collateralisation though sometimes used patients evidence support use traditional chinese herbal products thcp identifying treating risk factors coronary heart disease priority patients angina means
