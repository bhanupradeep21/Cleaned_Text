generally thought two major components contributing disease pathogenesis abnormalities arachidonic acid metabolic cascade dysregulation various innate immune cells two components feed highly complex negative cycle increasing inflammation dysregulation still active aerd associated aberrant arachidonic acid metabolism leads changes levels two major classes eicosanoids specifically certain cysteinyl leukotrienes cyslts prostaglandins notably reduced prostaglandin decreases inhibition causing increased conversion arachidonic acid leukotriene converted leukotriene converted leukotriene leukotriene powerful bronchoconstrictors contrast aerd patients show significantly higher levels prostaglandin exerts proinflammatory effects via recruitment eosinophils type helper cells cells addition direct bronchoconstrictive exact mechanism aspirin inhibitors lead acute respiratory reactions still investigation aerd patients exhibit seemingly paradoxical response inhibition leads greatly increased levels instead expected decrease relative lack change however given catalyzes formation leading explanation patients increased dependence corresponding receptor prevent inflammatory mediator release mast cells inhibited decreased production leads mast cell degranulation release leads respiratory symptom patients aerd also show increased expression leukotriene synthase converts platelets express generate attached leukocytes including eosinophils also implicated disease pathogenesis well acute aspirininduced exacerbations additionally aspirin nsaid exposure aerd patients generally become desensitized tolerate second exposure around one week lines half life circulating additional downstream products arachidonic acid produced significantly elevated nasal polyps aerd patients products like antiinflammatory lipoxins reduced possible increased activity preferential conversion arachidonic acid eoxins lipoxins contributes inflammation various innate immune cells also appear play important roles aerd pathogenesis eosinophils mast cells basophils type innate lymphoid cells found increased levels nasal polyps aerd patients appear part negative cycle inflammation cells activated cyslts addition class cytokines called alarmins released epithelial cells including thymic stromal lymphopoietin tslp strongly activated release cytokines lead increased eosinophil recruitment excessive mucus production via goblet cells promotion immunoglobulin e responses responses cause epithelial cells release cytokines inflammatory molecules creating feedforward negative cycle increasing eosinophils also activated epithelialcell released causing release cyslts turn active likewise mast cells also activated epithelialcell released tslp leading cyslt basophils degranulated aerd nasal polyps also appear important sources addition activating immune cells shown significantly increase activity playing cycle dysregulation diagnosis aerd difficult symptoms develop time often attributed allergies common asthma andor nonallergic rhinitis aerd generally diagnosed based patients medical history however oral aspirin challenge specialized facility considered definitive method patients considered candidates aerd diagnosis meet following three points patient meets two following criteria aerd diagnosis strongly high urinary leukotriene concentration also sign aerd especially

around times higher patients aerd aspirintolerant asthma increases fold aspirin challenge since nasal polyps identified important source inflammatory compounds aerd much effort goes prevention polyp growth control sinus symptoms general evidence supporting four different longterm pharmacological treatments end intranasal corticosteroids aspirin desensitization therapy range biologic medicines treatment benefits drawbacks one option recommended patients asthma symptoms controlled via biologics means managed standard asthma treatments inhaled corticosteroids longacting despite optimal medical management many patients continue require oral steroid medications alleviate asthma chronic nasal common corticosteroids fluticasone budesonide often used first line treatment aerd delivered

leukotrienes family inflammatory mediators derived arachidonic acid include cyslts implicated aerd pathophysiology drugs prevent leukotriene production zileuton block leukotriene receptors montelukast zafirlukast proven useful treatment nasal polyposis however may limited additional benefit used conjunction intranasal large survey aerd patients reported zileuton effective controlling symptoms montelukast despite zileuton remains less prescribed montelukast likely due concerns around risk liver enzyme often functional endoscopic sinus surgery required remove nasal although typically recur particularly aspirin desensitization undertaken approximately patients shown recurrence nasal polyps within five years surgery requiring revision surgery time complete endoscopic sinus surgery
