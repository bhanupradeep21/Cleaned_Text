otitis externa also called swimmers inflammation ear often presents ear pain swelling ear canal occasionally decreased typically pain movement outer high fever typically present except severe otitis externa may acute lasting less six weeks chronic lasting three acute cases typically due bacterial infection chronic cases often due allergies autoimmune common cause otitis externa bacterial risk
