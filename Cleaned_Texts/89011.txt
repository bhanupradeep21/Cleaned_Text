chaining technique used applied behavior analysis teach complex tasks breaking discrete responses individual behaviors part task backward chaining procedure learning happen two ways one approach adult complete steps learner give learner opportunity attempt last one prompt needed approach adult prompt learner throughout steps chain give learner opportunity complete last one independently however unable adult helps also prompting learner last step reinforcement given learner last step independency desired goal remove prompts soon learner complete steps without task analysis involves breaking complex skill smaller teachable units creating series steps tasks words identification stimuli responses behavior chain backward chain task analysis final step routine taught first reinforcement completing step accessible naturally occurring order teach task utilizing backward chaining procedure begin breaking entire task individual steps known task analysis example tooth brushing routine may broken follows grab toothbrush apply toothpaste toothbrush turn water wet toothbrush brush top teeth brush bottom teeth rinse toothbrush turn water put toothbrush away trainer would begin completing step learner beginning step one grabbing toothbrush trainer completed steps trainer allows learner complete last step put toothbrush away independently step independently mastered trainer move training last two steps steps training continue student completely independent complete entire tooth brushing routine without assistance important note transitioning one step next vary learner learner done learner proficient targeted step trainer either complete steps leaner physically prompt learner steps allowing learner complete last step independently example physical prompting toothbrushing look like hand hand helping learner complete steps correctly letting learner complete last one independently two types prompting behavior chain either leastmtl least ltm mtl prompting intrusive prompt introduced initially systematically faded least intrusive prompts prompting method mainly used task analysis ltm prompting prompt initially intrusiveness prompt increased necessary step task analysis prompting method mainly used error correction specific step task analysis learner experience considering backward chaining appropriate learner one must consider learner learning new behavior issue compliance learner perform task chain would appropriate learner step chooses another procedure used accordance compliance develop task analysis r chain developing steps task analysis steps match learner skill level collect baseline data implement continue collect data shift intermittent reinforcement order fade prompts steps targeted learner must show increased fading technique used least skills worked new prompts decreased least intrusive learner shows increased ability complete task less determine mastery assessments done prior chaining procedure implemented establish learner mastery two methods used assess mastery single multiple mastery level established mastery criterion also determined chain implemented mastery criterion set steps learner said mastered skill perform steps chain predetermined mastery
