thyroid function tests tfts collective term blood tests used check function tfts may requested patient thought suffer hyperthyroidism overactive thyroid hypothyroidism underactive thyroid monitor effectiveness either thyroidsuppression hormone replacement therapy also requested routinely conditions linked thyroid disease atrial fibrillation anxiety disorder tft panel typically includes thyroid
