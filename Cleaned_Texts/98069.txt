social psychology social buffering phenomenon explaining social connections alleviate negative consequences stressful events although models theories describe social support help reduce individuals stress responses social buffering hypothesis one dominant ones according idea social partners familiar others conspecifics act buffers face stressful events specifically stress happening model describes social support especially beneficial levels stress also high buffering effects relevant levels stress low social buffering explored humans social animals important questions physical mental health research attempted gain insight protective effects social support several domains biological developmental neurological clinical settings social buffering also relevant psychological processes including fear social bonding emotional reactivity psychological research midtwentieth century began increasingly reveal role stressful life events psychological also around time focus creating standardized approach diagnosing mental illnesses first diagnostic statistical manual mental health disorders commonly referred dsm published honed focus effective universal ways measure mental wellbeing application experimental psychology social issues large literature effects social support began form occurred effort fill gaps specific factors mediate relationship life events psychological specific focus attenuation social support negative impacts stressful events physical mental health began around time idea social buffering began take unclear phrase social buffering hypothesis first mentioned one credited cited works topic published researchers sheldon cohen thomas wills social buffering important feature psychology since early use specifically relevant social psychologycitation needed framework applied several areas well methods measurement definitions relevant terminology continue refined built uponcitation needed social buffering subset social support occurrences social support social buffering social support encompasses expectation actual act assisted nurtured attended participation social research social support makes distinction perceived support received social

support may better mitigating negative effects stress health psychological meaning measurable difference types social support proper definition variables important research area social support robustly associated positive health outcomes research shown people larger social networks higher quality relationships greater access social support resources better mental physical effects social support studied many different domains psychology social developmental clinical health social buffering hypothesis often compared evaluated direct effect hypothesis differs social buffering holds social support enhances physical psychological wellbeing general regardless presence stressors model says social support beneficial time people high social support overall better health without two models tend deal different measures social support direct effects hypothesis measures level person integrated social network social buffering hypothesis assesses available social resources help people respond stressful language around hypotheses also tends different direct effects hypothesis often looking enhancement health wellbeing result perception support integration network whereas buffering hypothesis concerned protection prevention especially times statistically direct effect hypothesis holds interaction stress social meaning beneficial effects observed notwithstanding level stress conversely according social buffering hypothesis magnitude beneficial effect social support larger stress present reflected statistically significant observable interaction two effects studied also means knowledge degree stress required social buffering hypothesis level may relevant context direct effects despite models providing somewhat separate explanations research found support work even suggests processes happen researchers suggested work directed critically comparing two hypotheses may actually benefit field studying social instead may beneficial use either model aims explain specific questions social support relates mediators health behavioral psychological emotional research studies done social buffering health consequences consistently show hpa axis plays central role link hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal hpa axis crucial regulator neuroendocrine responses body hpa axis made series pathways feedback loops involve hypothalamus anterior pituitary gland adrenal modulates several physiological processes including autonomic nervous system immune system reactions metabolism several processes active shortterm physiological responses hpa axis also plays major role bodily homeostasis includes regulating cardiovascular system reproductive system central nervous system addition previously proper functioning hpa axis important adaptation development reactivity lead series important humans experience high levels circulating stress hormones early life learn effectively respond threat adapt however much stress childhood lead long term often irreversible dysfunction hpa hpa axis activity goes aversive arousing situations induced physical psychosocial events hpa axis particularly sensitive psychological including uncertainty novelty feeling addition influenced psychological stressors one powerful widely studied moderators hpa axis activity induced stressful events social hpa axis often focal point physiological research examining social buffering biological mechanisms social buffering explored several components identified relevantcitation needed several hormones involved hpa axis endocrine regulation one corticotrophinreleasing factor crf crf stimulates release adrenocorticotropic hormone acth crucial physiological regulator increased activity hpa another vasopressin avp glucocorticoids final step social buffering observed high levels social support correlated lower levels stress hormone hpa axis oxytocin recognized important hormone involved mechanism social buffering oxytocin molecule often called love hormone released blood response physiological psychological stress increased oxytocin release hypothalamus inhibits activation hpa oxytocin involved stress processes inhibiting release corticosteroids acth release pituitary gland release crf central nervous system also meditates inhibitory effect oxytocin hpa oxytocin also involved behavioral side social buffering oxytocins role bonding means related process social support addition released response endogenous opioids endorphins also appear play major role social buffering via reinforcing effect active social opioid release also observed animals recognize supports idea animals find social support others species necessary see social buffering effects animals opioid release also helps explain seeking affiliation animals well opioid release result social stimulation

united states growing rate loneliness consider loneliness epidemic documented rise number people living alone many cultures loneliness strongly linked many psychiatric disorders including depression anxiety well several physical disorders cardiovascular diseases additionally rate loneliness increases age serious health consequences particularly older research shows high levels social connectedness help alleviate negative effects loneliness frequently accompany getting robust connection loneliness poor mental physical health difficult debate social buffering research highlight specific aspects loneliness damagingcitation needed social buffering also relevant process immigrants guest workers international students may experience increased likelihood isolation psychological difficulties depressive research shows interpersonal connections participate acculturation higher degrees benefit effects social increasing size one social network shown salient buffering effects particularly older immigrants important note social buffering works differently different groups gender age cultural additionally difficult study effects social support stress individuals impaired social include individuals autism spectrum disorders social phobias social anxiety social buffering recognized essential way nature experiences childhood affect development subsequent infancy parents play large role regulating negative consequences childhood especially regarding fear pain attachment also relevant studies development stress reduction attachment theory posits type attachment relationship child forms parents influences ability regulate emotional states whether parents immediately stress buffering effects often seen securely attached children indicating type stability relationships crucial well child recovers stressful research shows parents especially important social buffering around puberty late primary caregivers tend become less influential peers social take away role parents play social buffering whole instead reflects replaced friends become major source social support buffering furthermore major stressors adolescence puberty tend peers social standing social buffering provided friends time heavily interwoven social networks relates idea called friendship protection friendship protection hypothesis reflects idea social buffering hypothesis explains children least one supportive friend less negatively affected bullying peer looking social buffering development common approach measuring stress responses involves looking hpa axis hpa axis referred
