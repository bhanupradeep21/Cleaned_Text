laparoscopy ancient greek λαπάρα lapára flank side σκοπέω skopéō see operation performed abdomen pelvis using small incisions usually cm aid camera laparoscope aids diagnosis therapeutic interventions small cuts laparoscopic surgery also called minimally invasive procedure bandaid surgery keyhole surgery modern surgical technique number advantages patient laparoscopic surgery versus exploratory laparotomy include reduced pain due smaller incisions reduced hemorrhaging shorter recovery time key element use laparoscope long fiber optic cable system allows viewing affected area snaking cable distant easily accessible location laparoscopic surgery includes operations within abdominal pelvic cavities whereas keyhole surgery performed thoracic chest cavity called thoracoscopic surgery specific surgical instruments used laparoscopic surgery include obstetrical forceps scissors probes dissectors hooks retractors laparoscopic thoracoscopic surgery belong broader field endoscopy first laparoscopic procedure performed german surgeon georg kelling two types mechanism mentioned second type mainly used improve image quality flexible endoscopes replacing conventional fiberscopes nevertheless laparoscopes rigid endoscopes rigidity required clinical practice rodlensbased laparoscopes dominate overwhelmingly practice due fine optical resolution µm typically dependent aperture

seal allows passage hand must used surgeons choose handassist technique feel reduces operative time significantly versus straight laparoscopic approach also gives options dealing unexpected adverse events eg uncontrolled bleeding may otherwise require creating much larger incision converting fully open surgical conceptually laparoscopic approach intended minimise postoperative pain speed recovery times maintaining enhanced visual field surgeons due improved patient outcomes last two decades laparoscopic surgery adopted various surgical subspecialties including gastrointestinal surgery including bariatric procedures morbid obesity gynecologic surgery urology based numerous prospective randomized controlled trials approach proven beneficial reducing postoperative morbidities wound infections incisional hernias especially morbidly obese patients deemed safe applied surgery cancers cancer restricted vision difficulty handling instruments new handeye coordination skills needed lack tactile perception limited working area factors adding technical complexity surgical approach reasons minimally invasive surgery emerged highly competitive new subspecialty within various fields
