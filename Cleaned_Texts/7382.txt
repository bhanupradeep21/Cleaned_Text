acheronauta genus extinct vermiform arthropod lived early silurian telychiansheinwoodian stages waukesha biota fossil site southeast arthropod first discovered alongside biota fully described october creature recognized described possible early mandibulate grouping arthropods including crustaceans description important much fauna biota remain undescribed discovery allowed paleontologists get better grasp diversity arthropod fauna multiple phylogenetic analyses performed seems arthropod forms previously undiscovered clade devonian stemarthropod captopodus somewhat enigmatic group acheronauta assessed possible basal mandibulate distinguished arthropods due presence specific placement mandibulate family tree fully known accepted occupy position near base named acheronauta recognized one abundant arthropod fossils biota behind far undescribed dalmantid trilobite several leperditicopid ostracods leading description arthropod well studied remained enigmatic twentythree fossils known arthropod found due initial quarrying activity revealed lagerstätte currently fossils housed uwgm along many fossils fossils creature originally assumed thylacocephalans without wholebody acheronauta derives latin word acheronta latin version greek word acheron another name river woe river greek underworld last part genus name nauta means sailor acheronauta thus translated sailor river woe name reference harsh environments silurian waukesha allowed site species name stimulapis derives latin words stimulas means sting apis means bee specific epithet translates sting like bee according authors paper honor american boxer muhammad many specimens stimulapis preserve full anatomy arthropod however large number specimens helped paleontologists reconstruct twentythree specimens arthropod show two tagmata head covering carapace bore number head appendages elongated multisegmented trunk region composed around fortyfour pairs segments bore small swimming appendages carapace organism small shielding head first segments main body feature looks like bivalved carapaces arthropods like hymenocarines due lack dorsally oriented fossils means confirmation presence hinge line anterior area head ocular somite bore pair teardropshaped eyes possessed facets presence mandible creature seems provide evidence mandibulate mandibles found display rows simple teeth sat looks like grinding surface behind somite five head appendages first set arthrodized antennae mandibles others posterior biramous appendages appear end single claw first three segments trunk region smaller others trunk segment bore pair small paddleshaped swimming appendages organ materials observed species except cases poorly preserved gut also evidence muscle fibers present within head fossils enough evidence make argument two species differences fossils arthropod authors labeled morph morph b main distinction two morphs shape trunk terminus trunk morph fossils shorter morph b fossils showing fewer thirty appendages second distinction shape carapace morph fossils show blunt anterior margin eyes extending beyond said margin morph b fossils hand show pronounced anterodorsal keel coming margin carapace slightly deeper eyes slightly posterior venator ravitis dokeron poschmanni stimulapis oviformis myriapoda multinodosa pteroidea fieldensis dictynna perfecta katalepsis pretiosa exilis alata argulus ostracoda triops artemia remipedia cephalocarida hexapoda multicrustacea three versions bayesian phylogenetic analysis cunducted ambiguity features coded within analyses hundred taxa arthropods including captopodus poschmanni thylacocephalans interestingly authors paper also coded parioscorpio venator enigmatic arthropod coexisted studies originally provided evidence genus related either thylacocephalans remipedes grouping vermiform crustaceans found underground bodies water however remipedes dont carapace possess one tagma analyses show definite evidence related forming clade c poschmanni thylacocephalans study placed three taxa close base mandibulate family tree basal hymenocarines primary interpretation showed genus sister group thylacocephalans c study found instead members crustacea eucrustcea thylacocephalans found placed outside crowngroup crustaceans myirapods stemgroup mandibulates additionally parioscorpio remained enigmatic three years since description found occupy position artiopoda mandibulates making slightly related stimulapis basal taxon totalgroup actually consistent recent rejection genus cheloniellid within based certain characteristics creature including specialization appendages large size compared many taxa lagerstätte arthropod found scavenger well opportunistic predator exopods endopods appendages arthropod may functioned like masticatory basket similar modern crustaceans hand large size appendages lack setae would probably limited arthropod niche ensnaring small prey suspension arthropod lived alongside many unique taxa made fauna living benthic parts intertidal areas arthropods like parioscorpio synziphosurine arthropod venustulus waukeshaensis also living areas wide variety worms like annelids palaeoscolecids possibly hunting midwater thylacares brandonensis thylacocephalan arthropod terms geographical location closest relative living area number bivalved arthropods like phyllocarid ostracod also found area enigmatic butterfly animal undescribed arthropod unknown taxonomic hard shelled organisms like nautiloid cephalopods brachiopods clams corals crinoids rare sediments ones found well strange organisms normally common silurian aged reason due unique preservation bias site preservation lightly skeletonized soft bodied fossils favored aside trilobites group hard shelled organisms common sediments conulariids enigmatic group shelled invertebrates likely cnidarians closely related stalked predatory chordates like panderodus also known httpsenwikipediaorgwikiacheronauta
