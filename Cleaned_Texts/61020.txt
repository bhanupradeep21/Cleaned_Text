hip dysplasia abnormality hip joint socket portion fully cover ball portion resulting increased risk joint hip dysplasia may occur birth develop early regardless typically produce symptoms babies less year occasionally one leg may shorter left hip often affected complications without treatment include arthritis limping low back females affected often risk factors hip dysplasia include female sex family history certain swaddling practices breech presentation whether infant delivered vaginally cesarean one identical twin affected risk also screening babies condition physical examination ultrasonography may also many mild instability resolve without specific significant cases detected early bracing may cases detected later surgery casting may hip replacements done treat problems arisen hip babies hip hip instability meaningful importance occurs one two percent babies born females affected often hip dysplasia described least early bc hip dysplasia range barely detectable severely malformed dislocated congenital form teratologic nonreducible dislocation occurs part complex conditionscitation needed condition bilateral unilateral joint fully dislocated false acetabulum often forms often higher pelvis opposite dislocated femoral head position acetabular dysplasia acetabulum socket shallow deformed centeredge angle measured described two forms femoral dysplasia coxa vara femur head grows narrow angle shaft coxa valga angle wide rare type beukes familial hip dysplasia found among afrikaners members beukes family femur head flat irregular people develop osteoarthritis early hip dysplasia considered multifactorial condition means several factors involved causing condition cause condition unknown however factors congenital hip dislocation heredity racial background also thought higher rates ethnic groups native american groups due practice swaddling infants known potential risk factor developing dysplasia also low risk african americans southern chinesecitation needed studies suggest hormonal specifically hormone relaxin female sex alone without known risk factors accounts genetic factor indicated since trait runs families increased occurrence ethnic populations eg native sami locus described chromosome beukes familial dysplasia hand found map region chromosome nonpenetrant carriers risk factors include gender genetics family breech position femoral head tends get pushed socket breech position probably important single risk factor whether infant delivered vaginally cesarean acquired condition linked traditions swaddling use overly restrictive baby seats carriers methods transporting use cradle board locks hip joint adducted position pulling knees together tends pull heads femur bone sockets acetabulae extended periods modern swaddling techniques hip healthy swaddle developed relieve stress hip joints caused traditional swaddling narrow uterus also facilitates hip joint dislocation fetal development birthcitation needed newborns screened congenital hip dysplasia screening examination techniques detect hip dysplasia newborns include observation sometimes exam click precisely clunk hip may although clicks indicate hip hip click also known clicky hips uk detected childs hips tracked additional determine developmental dysplasia hip two maneuvers commonly employed diagnosis neonatal exams ortolani maneuver barlow order ortolani maneuver recommended examiner put newborn baby position opposite hip held still thigh hip tested abducted gently pulled anteriorly clunk heard sound femoral head moving acetabulum joint normal absence clunk sound indicates acetabulum fully developed next method used called barlow maneuver done adducting hip pushing thigh posteriorly hip goes socket means dislocated newborn congenital hip dislocation baby laid back examination separation legs clicking sound heard indicates baby may dislocated hip highly recommended maneuvers done baby fussing baby may inhibit hip movementcitation needed evidence suggesting hip examinations newborns painful pain relief form oral glucose suggested yet widely vexingly many newborn hips show certain ligamentous laxity hand severely malformed joints appear stable one reason followup exams developmental monitoring important physical examination newborns followed appropriate use hip ultrasound widely harris hip developed
