pancreaticoduodenectomy also known whipple procedure major surgical operation often performed remove cancerous tumours head also used treatment pancreatic duodenal trauma chronic due shared blood supply organs proximal gastrointestinal system surgical removal head pancreas also necessitates removal duodenum proximal jejunum gallbladder occasionally part common technique pancreaticoduodenectomy consists en bloc removal distal segment antrum stomach first second portions duodenum head pancreas common bile duct gallbladder lymph nodes area often removed operation well lymphadenectomy however lymph nodes removed common type pancreaticoduodenectomy studies showed patients benefit extensive beginning procedure surgeons gained access abdomen surfaces peritoneum liver inspected disease metastasized important first step presence active metastatic disease contraindication performing operation vascular supply pancreas celiac artery via superior pancreaticoduodenal artery superior mesenteric artery inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery additional smaller branches given right gastric artery also derived celiac artery reason removal duodenum along head pancreas share arterial blood supply superior pancreaticoduodenal artery inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery arteries run head pancreas organs must removed single blood supply severed head pancreas removed would compromise blood flow duodenum resulting tissue necrosis blood supply liver left intact common bile duct removed means liver remains good blood supply surgeon must make new connection drain bile produced liver done end surgery surgeon make new attachment pancreatic duct jejunum stomach surgery cholecystectomy performed remove gallbladder portion done en bloc gallbladder removed separately relevant nearby anatomy removed procedure include major vascular structures area portal vein superior mesenteric vein superior mesenteric artery inferior vena cava structures important consider operation especially done resection tumor located head pancreas tumor encases wraps around vessel celiac artery superior mesenteric artery inferior vena cava considered unresectable due lack patient benefit operation high occasionally portion superior mesenteric vein portal vein attached inseparable tumor setting vascular surgeons resect involved portion vessel vessel repaired either via endtoend anastomosis repair side wall vein vein graft pancreaticoduodenectomy often performed curative treatment periampullary cancer include cancer bile duct duodenum ampulla head shared blood supply pancreas duodenum common bile duct necessitates en bloc resection multiple structures indications pancreaticoduodenectomy include chronic pancreatitis benign tumors pancreas cancer metastatic pancreas multiple endocrine neoplasia type gastrointestinal stromal pancreaticoduodenectomy potentially curative intervention malignant tumors however majority patients pancreatic cancer present metastatic locally advanced unresectable thus patients candidates whipple procedure surgery may follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy aims shrink tumor increasing likelihood complete postoperative death complications associated pancreaticoduodenectomy become less common rates postoperative mortality falling less ampullary cancer arises lining ampulla duodenal cancer arises lining duodenal mucosa majority duodenal cancers originate second part duodenum ampulla cholangiocarcinoma cancer bile duct indication whipple procedure cancer present distal biliary system usually common bile duct drains duodenum depending location extension cholangiocarcinoma curative surgical resection may require hepatectomy removal part liver without treatment chronic pancreatitis typically includes pain control management exocrine insufficiency intractable abdominal pain main surgical indication surgical management chronic removal head pancreas relieve pancreatic duct obstruction associated chronic damage pancreas duodenum blunt abdominal trauma uncommon rare cases pattern trauma reported seen result lap belt motor vehicle pancreaticoduodenectomy performed abdominal trauma resulted bleeding around pancreas duodenum damage common bile duct pancreatic leakage transection due rarity procedure setting trauma robust evidence regarding postoperative outcomes absolute contraindications procedure metastatic disease abdominal cavity nearby organs found often peritoneum liver omentum order determine metastases surgeons inspect abdomen beginning procedure gaining access alternatively may perform separate procedure called diagnostic laparoscopy involves insertion small camera small incision look inside abdomen may spare patient large abdominal incision would occur undergo initial part pancreaticoduodenectomy cancelled due metastatic contraindications include encasement major vessels celiac artery inferior vena cava superior mesenteric artery mentioned clinical trials failed demonstrate significant survival benefits total pancreatectomy mostly patients submit operation tend develop particularly severe form diabetes mellitus called brittle diabetes sometimes pancreaticojejunostomy may hold properly completion operation infection may spread inside patient may lead another operation shortly thereafter remainder pancreas sometimes spleen removed prevent spread infection possible morbidity recent years pyloruspreserving pancreaticoduodenectomy also known traversolongmire procedurepppd gaining popularity especially among european surgeons main advantage technique pylorus thus normal gastric emptying theory conflicting data whether pyloruspreserving pancreaticoduodenectomy associated increased likelihood gastric practice shows similar longterm survival whipples pancreaticoduodenectomy hemigastrectomy patients benefit improved recovery weight pppd performed tumour involve stomach lymph nodes along gastric curvatures compared standard whipple procedure pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy technique associated shorter operation time less intraoperative blood loss requiring less blood transfusion postoperative complications hospital mortality survival differ two pancreaticoduodenectomy considered standard major surgical procedure many studies shown hospitals given operation performed frequently better overall results especially case complex procedures pancreaticoduodenectomy frequently cited study published new england journal medicine found operative mortality rates four times higher v lowvolume averaging less one pancreaticoduodenectomy per year hospitals highvolume per year hospitals even highvolume hospitals morbidity found vary factor almost four depending number times surgeon previously performed de wilde
