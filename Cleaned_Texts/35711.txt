compounds thus deactivating function transport peptidoglycan main component bacterial cell membranes microbial cell bacitracin used clinical practice mainly topical medication due toxicity high parental use however evidence successful treatment clinical trials limited surgeons able use bacitracin skin grafting procedures due nontoxic pseudomembranous colitis inflammation large intestine successfully treated bacitracin oral treatment case two patients relapses infection allergic reactions respectively common antibiotic treatment use oral bacitracin successfully treated four cases colitis diarrhea associated antibiotic use caused bacteria clostridium difficile however two patients relapsed whilst two cases experienced early stages relapse one relapsed patient subsequently treated successfully bacitracin also trialled bullous impetigo acute blistering infection however produced ineffective results significant difference success rate comparison placebo patients continued

treat leukaemia patients low levels white blood cells use nontoxic side effects casts azotaemia urine observed bleomycin polypeptide antibiotic derived fungus streptomyces verticillus mechanism action involves bleomycin binding guanine bases deoxyribonucleic acid dna oxidation ferrous iron ferric oxidation donates electron oxygen accepts form reactive species oxygen reactive oxygen entities attack dna bases store information thus inhibits dna synthesis bleomycin also acts via interfering cell wall synthesis target bacteria however exact mechanism action bleomycins medical application antitumour drug mainly germinative tumours hodgkins lymphoma however use limited pulmonary study combining bleomycin medicinal agents bladder cancer cells results showed bleomycin induced dna damage cell lines thus bleomycin combination therapy may option treat efficacy rates bleomycin conjunction cisplatin etoposide testicular cancer approximately bleomycin also induce myelosuppression decreased bone marrow activity immunosuppression suppressing immune responses patients unlike alternative cytotoxic however trials required pulmonary toxicity occurs approximately patients around cases death due pulmonary polypeptide antibiotics able exhibit resistance various resistance patterns occurring amongst closely related species bacteria cases present different strains development resistance result bacteria mutating response use medicines example resistance via blocking site action act function method resistance occurrence may account inability polypeptide antibiotics act gramnegative bacterium ie bacteria thin peptidoglycan layers cases changes growth medium produced changes outer polypeptide antibiotic resistance eliminates drugs effectiveness thus allowing bacteria survive replicate

conventional medications development new alternative drugs polypeptide antibiotics required ability polypeptide overcome resistance cases stems mechanism action inhibit cell wall synthesis thus prevent multiplication bacterial cells resistance able polypeptide antibiotic use may result minor side effects rare cases cause severe possibly chronic adverse effects predominantly administered via intramuscular clinical trials studies polypeptide antibiotic use pregnancy limited produced definite conclusions risk however use bacitracin topical ophthalmic medication considered relatively safe breastfeeding due skins low absorption rate bacitracin minimal adverse effects relatively low side effects minor skin irritation fever nausea present however cases anaphylaxis severe allergic reaction potentially lead death reported multiple uses topical bacitracin lesions bacitracin use irrigation solution topical bacitracin use rhinoplasty procedures also produced rare cases use polymyxins may cause nephrotoxicity neuropathy damage kidney via systemic use drugs toxins nerve damage cause pain numbness weakness colistin considered high toxicity mainly renal neurological effects including
