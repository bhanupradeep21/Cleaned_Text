australothyris extinct genus basal procolophonomorph parareptile known middle permian middle capitanian stage tapinocephalus assemblage zone south africa type known species australothyris smithi basal member procolophonomorpha australothyris helped contextualize origin major parareptile subgroup used support hypotheses procolophonomorphs originated gondwana ancestrally possess temporal fenestrae due large fully enclosed temporal fenestra south african heritage also possessed several unique features including high tooth number long postfrontal small interpterygoid vacuity specialized interaction stapes australothyris known single specimen discovered beukesplaas farm robert smith fossil site beukesplaas farm contains diverse parareptile synapsid fauna positioned middle permian tapinocephalus assemblage zone upper abrahamskraal formation specimen included skull portions rest skeleton mostly eroded away prior discovery initially referred owenetta based numerous teeth long postfrontal reexamination revealed temporal fenestra absent owenettids wake restudy specimen recognized new taxon named australohyris smithi sean p modesto diane scott robert r reisz generic name translates southern opening recognition supports hypothesis parareptiles originated gondwana went phase evolution possessed temporal fenestra opening skull behind eyes specific name honors robert portions snout upper skull weathered away many notable features preserved maxilla contains teeth unusually high number surpassed lanthanosuchus among parareptiles teeth small slender conical retaining roughly size shape except subtle decrease size towards rear maxilla prefrontal simple hosting small buttress front orbits eye holes dissimilar shape procolophonids although frontal contact upper edge orbit amniotes lacks distinct lappet observed lanthanosuchoids distinct lateral temporal fenestra present behind orbit completely surrounded jugal quadratojugal postorbital squamosal parareptiles lateral temporal fenestrae apart lanthanosuchids typically exclude postorbital edge contact jugal squamosal open lower edge due loss contact jugal quadratojugal postfrontal uniquely elongated rear branch contacts boxy supratemporal bone separates postorbital parietal pineal foramen large similar size procolophonids bolosaurids quadrates massive quite broad also tall acleistorhinus minor ornamentation present several bones including broad grooves nasal shallow pits jugal clusters knobs furrows postorbital low mounds vomers possess array ridges largest edge choanae also teeth small rows solitary positions vomers palatines characteristically large possessing several low ridges covered small teeth pterygoids notably broad owing extensive contact along midline palate consequence interpterygoid vacuity gap pterygoids short restricted triangular opening front parabasisphenoid tooth rows occur along inner edge pterygoids main underside bones transverse flanges rear branches pterygoids leading quadrates offset transverse flanges distinct notch overall palate closely resembles lanthanosuchus uniquely australothyris even possesses patches teeth basipterygoid processes rest braincase fairly typical basioccipital broad poorlydeveleloped basitubera kidneyshaped occipital condyle exoccipitals meet midline foramen magnum supraoccipital also broad fused opisthotics lower portion upper portion bone overlapped small postparietal tabular bones skull roof opisthotics thickest base generally similar milleretta connected thick yet complex stapes possessed conspicuous footplate stapedial foramen dorsal process knob outer edge stapes likely connected characteristic spur quadrate seen lower jaw indicates primarily formed dentary front half low elongated surangular angular rear half coronoid low peak tall articular small retroarticular process one tooth exposed similar maxilla albeit articulated postcranial skeleton weathered point portions cervical vertebrae interclavicle good enough condition describe cervicals slight excavations outer surface robust neural arches low neural spines axis overhanging predecessor interclavicle anchorshaped like ankyramorph anchorform parareptiles contrast ankyramorphs center interclavicle thicker front edge overall postcranium congruent known original describers australothyris used phylogenetic analysis designed muller tsuji investigate relations parareptiles analysis found optimal position relatively basal parareptile specifically sister taxon ankyramorpha group containing lanthanosuchoids derived parareptiles nevertheless derived mesosaurs millerettids papers authors assigned name procolophonomorpha parareptiles derived millerettids australothyris recovered first branch procolophonomorpha suggesting group whole originated simultaneously evolution large fully enclosed temporal fenestra however subsequent discovery microleter roughly equivalent phylogenetic position much restricted temporal emargination casts doubts hypothesis origin temporal fenestration certain millerettids also observed possess temporal position australothyris also supports another hypothesis argues procolophonomorphs evolved
