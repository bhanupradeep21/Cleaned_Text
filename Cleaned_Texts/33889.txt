strengthening exercises pelvic floor muscle training pfmt also known kegel exercise found improve bulk urinary symptoms associated pelvic organ prolapse improve quality life performed consistently pessaries mechanical treatment supports vagina elevates prolapsed uterus anatomically correct pessaries frequently offered firstline management option uterine prolapse especially amongst people wish undergo surgery due affordability lowrisk profile compared invasive properly fitted pessaries found improve bulk pressure symptoms associated prolapse improve quality life many surgical options available treatment uterine prolapse may performed vaginal procedure generally vaginal procedures considered less invasive offer quicker recovery shorter operative time compared abdominal procedures abdominal procedures offer longerterm results potentially reduce risk postoperative vaginal pain laparoscopic robotic approaches abdominal procedures prolapse surgery become common require smaller incision sites result less blood loss shorter hospital stays vaginal vault suspension known colpopexy upper portion vagina surgically connected another structure pelvis commonly performed treatment
