important social interactions among family members grooming takes place adults earlier day adults groom juveniles later day adult males involved dry season size siamangs daily range larger rainy season siamang southern sumatra spends less time foraging siamangs places eats diet higher fruit thus consumes nutrients results less time needed food acquisition siamang may spend entire day single

forests regeneration arboreal primate whose survival absolutely depends forest siamang faces population pressure due habitat poaching major threat siamang habitat fragmentation due plantations forest fire illegal logging encroachment human development firstly palmoil plantations removed large areas siamangs habitat recent decades since oil palm replaced much rainforest indonesia malaysia siamang originally lived secondly second decade century forests malay peninsula destroyed due illegal logging sixteen permanent forest reserves kelantan malay peninsula siamangs live encroached upon illegal thirdly forest encroachments change forest cover cultivated land example rising price coffee encouraged people sumatra replace forest coffee fourthly development many areas requires infrastructure roads divide conservation areas caused forest fragmentation edge effects unlike parts asia primates hunted meat indonesia hunted illegal pet trade hunters preferring infant siamangs poachers often
