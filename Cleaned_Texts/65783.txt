pelvic fracture break bony structure includes break sacrum hip bones ischium pubis ilium symptoms include pain particularly complications may include internal bleeding injury bladder vaginal common causes include falls motor vehicle collisions vehicle hitting pedestrian direct crush younger people significant trauma typically required older people less significant trauma result divided two types stable unstable fractures divided anterior posterior compression lateral compression vertical shear combined mechanism diagnosis suspected based symptoms examination confirmation xrays ct person fully awake pain pelvis medical imaging emergency treatment generally follows advanced trauma life begins efforts stop bleeding replace bleeding control may achieved using pelvic binder bedsheet support efforts may include angiographic embolization preperitoneal stabilization pelvis may require surgical pelvic fractures make around adult stable fractures generally good risk death unstable fracture also low blood pressure risk death approaching unstable fractures often associated injuries parts symptoms include pain particularly complications likely result cases excess blood loss puncture certain organs possibly leading swelling bruising may result highimpact pain affected areas may differ severity impact increases likelihood may radiate symptoms aggravated one moves aroundcitation needed common causes include falls motor vehicle collisions vehicle hitting pedestrian direct crush younger people significant trauma typically required older people less significant trauma result bony pelvis consists ilium ie iliac wings ischium pubis form anatomic ring sacrum disruption ring requires significant energy comes stability structure pelvis pelvic girdle understanding function support trunk legs helps recognize effect pelvic fracture pubic bone ischium ilium make pelvic girdle fused together one unit attach sides spine circle around create ring sockets place hip joints attachment spine important direct force trunk legs movement occurs extending ones back requires pelvis strong enough withstand pressure energy various muscles play important roles pelvic stability forces involved pelvic fractures frequently involve injury organs contained within bony pelvis addition trauma extrapelvic organs common pelvic fractures often associated severe hemorrhage due extensive blood supply region veins presacral pelvic plexus particularly vulnerable greater percent bleeding due pelvic fractures venous open surfaces bonecitation needed person fully awake pain pelvis medical imaging pelvis pelvic fractures commonly described using one two classification systems different forces pelvis result different fractures sometimes determined based stability tile classification system based integrity posterior sacroiliac complexcitation needed type injuries sacroiliac complex intact pelvic ring stable fracture managed nonoperatively type b injuries caused either external internal rotational forces resulting partial disruption posterior sacroiliac complex often unstable type c injuries characterized complete disruption posterior sacroiliac complex rotationally vertically unstable injuries result great force usually motor vehicle crash fall height severe compressioncitation needed youngburgess classification system based mechanism injury anteroposterior compression type ii iii lateral compression types ii iii vertical combination forces lateral compression lc fractures involve transverse fractures pubic rami either ipsilateral contralateral posterior injury common force type lateral compression lc forces sideimpact automobile accidents pedestrian injuries result internal superior inferior pubic rami may fracture anteriorly example injuries shear forces like falls result disruption ligaments bones multiple forces occur called combined mechanical injury cmi best imaging modality use classification probably pelvic ct one specific kind pelvic fracture known open book fracture often result heavy impact groin pubis common motorcycling accident injury kind injury left right halves pelvis separated front rear front opening rear ie like open book falls ground splits middle depending severity may require surgical reconstruction forces anterior posterior direction like headon car accidents usually cause external rotation hemipelvis openbook injury open fractures increased risk infection hemorrhaging vessel injury leading higher human body ages bones become weaker brittle therefore susceptible fractures certain precautions crucial order lower risk getting pelvic fractures damaging one car accident cycling accident falling high building result high energy dangerous pelvis supports many internal organs damage organs falling one common causes pelvic fracture therefore proper precautions taken prevent happeningcitation needed pelvic fracture often complicated treatment long painful process depending severity pelvic fractures treated without high index suspicion held pelvic injuries anyone major trauma pelvis stabilized pelvic purposemade device improvised pelvic binders also used around world good stabilisation pelvic ring reduces blood loss pelvic vessels reduced risk death surgery often required pelvic fractures many methods pelvic stabilization used including external fixation internal
