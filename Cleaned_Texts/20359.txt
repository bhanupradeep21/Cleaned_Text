various specialised fish motions fins major forms locomotion fish specialized fish include movement pectoral fins mainly stiff body opposed sculling dorsal anal fins sunfish movement propagating wave along long fins motionless body knifefish featherbacks addition fish variously walk ie crawl land using pectoral pelvic fins burrow mud leap water even glide temporarily air fish swim exerting force surrounding water exceptions normally achieved fish contracting muscles either side body order generate waves flexion travel length body nose tail generally getting larger go along vector forces exerted water motion cancel laterally generate net force backwards turn pushes fish forward water fishes generate thrust using lateral movements body caudal fin many species move mainly using median paired fins latter group swim slowly turn rapidly needed living coral reefs example swim fast fish using bodies caudal consider tilapia shown diagram like fish tilapia streamlined body shape reducing
