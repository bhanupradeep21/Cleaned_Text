shine dark colour wings make difficult usual resting position noctuids fold wings back bodies forewings overlap one another closed wings form tentlike almost acronicta larvae brightly coloured spiky brown hairs along dorsal side according thomas algernon chapman genus acronicta split three major groups first characterized hooplike structure pupa clumped oviposition includes auricoma myricae menthanthidis venosa rumicis second characterized terminal spines pupa domeshaped ova laid apart others includes psi tridens strigosa alni megacephala leporina aceris third group one species ligustri rumicis distributed throughout palearctic common northwestern china korean peninsula japan although also found parts eurasia including rumicis found almost parts europe though absent areas northwestern scandinavia much research species england moths tend spend lives plants located wideopen areas like meadows woodland clearings gardens hedgerows generally nonhumid caterpillar stage rumicis tends feed lowgrowing herbaceous plants including sorrel dock bramble thistles occasionally leaves addition rumicis larvae favour fruit trees like prunus species plants family research one commonly used host plants rumex obtusifolius herbaceous plant commonly found within rumiciss females tend lay eggs leaves host plants large clusters clusters arranged long longitudinal ridges originate spread leaf micropylar ovular area plant longest ridges tend zigzag eggs flattened shape making clustering clumping easier rumicis species generally two broods first generation flies may june second flies august september however number generations differ based location southern europe tends three broods north one likely due number broods may determined duration light temperature ranges larvae tend feed summer onwards winter rumicis spend time pupae stage eggs laid clusters almost regular overlapping rows host plants egg stage lasts days eggs round flattened shape like sand dollar micropylar area long ridges radiate center almost like childs drawing sun flattened structure allows stability resting host larvae hatch tend nibble round opening egg usually rumicis larvae ready pupate days tend mm long dark brown bodies white spots along sides body red spots along centre body hairs grow tufts arranged rows two rows along side body one row along centre winter months near fully grown caterpillars pupate cocoons leaves leaf litter cocoon tough white silk one simple layer grass twigs leaves better concealment adult moths tend emerge june also appear earlier months weather consistently warm although general cause trouble life rumicis parasitism via parasitoids another group predators includes small birds birds like great spotted woodpecker tend breed nest agricultural regions one study slovenia birds nested hop field hop popular food resource rumicis caterpillars primary food source parasitism rumicis generally occurs months may october rates lower months june july reasons yet unknown parasitoids affecting rumicis parasitic wasps braconidae ichneumonidae families well parasitic one common parasitoids rumicis glyptapanteles liparidis larval parasitoid highly distributed throughout g liparidis oviposits surface moth larvae hatched wasp larvae feed rumicis larvae eventually cause death based one study south korea g liparidis affects rumicis first second third fourth study also discovered secondinstar larvae apparently best food source parasitoid secondinstar larvae highest mortality rate comparison three larval stages g liparidis continuously grows utilizes resources produced internally rumicis larvae feeding habits larvae change well average parasitized larvae consume plant material parasitized second instar larvae tend consume food comparison first third fourth instars supporting idea g liparidis feed efficiently second instar larvae industrial melanism exists within species meaning moths evolved industrial period england dark soot deposited environment aberration salicis curtis commonly found throughout moths distribution range darker greyblotched sections wings retains rumicis identifying marker white spot aberration salicis commonly found distributed england wales ireland aberration lugubris schultz almost completely black lacking mixedgrey mottling wings still retains prominent white spot marker aberration lugubris found mainly england according bk west since late melanism rumicis become less less prevalent rumicis observed melanic course five years percentage decreased population industrial period past resting surfaces less darkened soot reasonable see evolutionarily melanic variations longer favourable rumicis duration light temperature two major factors causing diapause slowing stopping development insect environmental conditions optimal one study onset diapause observed varying photoperiods constantly rearing rumicis larvae rumicis exposed light short day hours experiment larval feeding period almost individuals underwent diapause reaching pupal daily photoperiods extended past hours incidence diapause began drop causing change development pupae ability rumicis undergo diapause allows completion two generations host plants first generation develops longer photoperiods therefore pupae physiologically active second generation grow shorter photoperiods meaning beneficial pupae form diapause overwinter rumicis minor pest various fruit plants mostly strawberries however also cause damage blackberry raspberry loganberry apple pear cherry usually larvae cause defoliation feed newly grown rumicis also attacks beans ground nuts wheat maize brassicas according study poland rumicis also taken maize populations feeding leaves corn plants longer fresh new shift harvesting season spring summer larvae moths damages leaves silks cobs occasionally eating soft kernels well second brood came fall ate leaves study poland supports rumicis larva prefer eat fresh newly grown overall population rumicis sharp decline focusing moths united kingdom current research suggests moths danger due habitat loss poor habitat management global warming environmental deterioration pesticides since population rumicis declined nearly recently rumicis assigned priority biodiversity action plan bap species meaning moth identified threatened immediately part conservation researchers realizing conservation woodland areas high priority order sustain many populations bap species possible also found positive correlation species richness herbaceous plants population density according emma coulthard hedgerows close proximity crop plants farmlands highly important survival moths like rumicis habitats like hedgerows tend provide food resources shelter place females lay eggs addition recent studies shown hedgerows may act guides moths flying one location another moths nocturnal highly unlikely use visual aids guides rather following olfactory however recently hedgerows removed increase agricultural efficiency removing key habitats like hedgerows limits basic necessities survival ie food shelter also prevents moth navigating properly eventually moth would lose trail potentially even smallest gaps two bunches hedgerows cause moth go astray one metre hedgerow make therefore crucial agriculturalists figure way pursue plans conserving homes moths like rumicis httpsenwikipediaorgwikiacronictarumicis
