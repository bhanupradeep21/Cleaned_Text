temporally limited species genus daphnia magna reproduces cyclical parthenogenesis form reproduction characterised alternating production asexual offspring clonal reproduction certain time sexual reproduction haploid eggs need fertilised asexual eggs dozens per clutch diploid usually develop females response adverse environmental stimuli males asexual eggs hatch female brood pouch day laid released days juveniles go four six moults becoming mature period days adult female produces one clutch eggs every days death live months laboratory response unfavourable environmental conditions could lead freezing drying pond female produce haploid resting eggs usually two time fertilised males wrapped within protective shell called ephippium resting eggs enter phase diapause able resist long periods adverse environmental conditions long period time hatching triggered response specific stimuli increasing photoperiod temperatures hatchlings resting eggs develop exclusively females clones magna produce males reproduce automictic parthenogenesis two haploid cells produced meiosis fuse produce female zygote without fertilisation tends make resulting daughters homozygous may name
