social development theory attempts explain qualitative changes structure framework society help society better realize aims objectives development defined manner applicable societies historical periods upward ascending movement featuring greater levels energy efficiency quality productivity complexity comprehension creativity mastery enjoyment development process social change merely set policies programs instituted specific results last five centuries process picked speed intensity last five decades witnessed marked surge basic mechanism driving social change increasing awareness leading better organization society senses new better opportunities progress develops new forms organization exploit new openings successfully new forms organization better able harness available social energies skills resources use opportunities get intended results development governed many factors influence results developmental efforts must motive drives social change essential preconditions change occur motive must powerful enough overcome obstructions impede change occurring development also requires resources capital technology supporting infrastructure development result societys capacity organize resources meet challenges opportunities society passes welldefined stages course development nomadic hunting gathering rural agrarian urban commercial industrial postindustrial societies pioneers introduce new ideas practices habits conservative elements initially resist later stage innovations accepted imitated organized used members community organizational improvements introduced support innovations take place simultaneously four different social mental psychological moreover four different types resources involved promoting development four physical resources visible least capable expansion productivity resources increases enormously quality organization level knowledge inputs rise development pace scope varies according stage society three main stages physical vital vital refers dynamic nervous social energies humanity propel individuals accomplish mental though term development usually refers economic progress apply political social technological progress well various sectors society intertwined difficult neatly separate development sectors governed principles laws therefore term applies uniformly economic development human

values skills information affect extent pace development factors come play whether development individual family community nation whole human development normally proceeds experience comprehension society develops centuries accumulates experience countless pioneers essence experience becomes formula accomplishment success fact experience precedes knowledge taken mean development unconscious process gets carried first knowledge becomes conscious later unconscious refers activities people carry without knowing end results actions lead carry acts without knowing conditions required gathering conscious knowledge society matures breaks surface form new pioneers also take new initiatives give expression ideas initiatives may call new strategies new organizations conservative elements may resist pioneers initiatives succeed encourages imitation slow propagation rest community later growing success leads society assimilating new practice becomes regularized institutionalized viewed three distinct phases social preparedness initiative pioneers assimilation society pioneer plays important role development person unconscious knowledge becomes conscious awakening comes lone receptive individual first person spreads awakening rest society though pioneers appear lone individuals act conscious representatives society whole role viewed though pioneer comes innovative ideas often initial response pioneer one indifference ridicule even one outright hostility pioneer persists succeeds initiative persons efforts may eventually get endorsement public endorsement tempts others imitate pioneer also succeed news spreads brings wider acceptance conscious efforts lend organizational support new initiative helps institutionalize new innovation organization human capacity harness available information knowledge resources technology infrastructure human skills exploit new face challenges hurdles block progress development comes improvements human capacity organization words development comes emergence better organizations enhance societys capacity make use opportunities face challenges development organizations may come formulation new laws regulations new systems new step progress brings corresponding new organization increasing european international trade centuries demanded corresponding development banking industry new commercial laws civil arbitration facilities new types business ventures formed attract capital needed finance expanding trade result new business entity jointstock company limited investors liability extent personal investment without endangering properties new developmental advance accompanied new suitable organizations facilitate advance often existing inadequate organizations must change accommodate new advances many countries introduced scores new reforms release business activities directories franchising lease purchase service credit rating collection agencies industrial estates free trade zones credit cards additionally diverse range internet services formed new facility improves effective use available social energies productive purposes importance facilities speeding development apparent absent eastern european countries wanted transition markettype economies seriously hampered efforts due absence supportive systems facilities particular stage organizations mature institutions become part society beyond point organization need laws agencies foster growth ensure continued presence transformation organization institution signifies societys total acceptance new organization income tax office example organization actively maintained enactment laws formation office procuring taxes without active governmental support organization would disappear enjoy universal public support hand institution marriage universally accepted would persist even governments withdrew regulations demand registration marriage impose age restrictions institution marriage sustained weight tradition government agencies legal enactments families play major role propagation new activities win support society family miniature version larger larger entity reflected smaller entity family educates younger generation transmits social values like selfrestraint responsibility skills occupational training though children follow parents footsteps much parents still mold childrens attitudes thoughts regarding careers future occupations families propagate new activity signals new activity become integral part society one powerful means propagating sustaining new developments educational system society education transmits societys collective knowledge one generation next equips new generation face future opportunities challenges knowledge gathered past shows young generation opportunities ahead thereby raises aspiration achieve information imparted education raises level expectations youth well aspirations higher income also equips youth mental capacity devise ways means improve productivity enhance living standards society conceived complex fabric consists interrelated activities systems development occurs complex fabric improves organization organizational improvement take place simultaneously several dimensions organizational innovations occur time continuous process new organizations emerge whenever new developmental stage reached old organizations modified suit new developmental requirements impact new organizations may powerful enough make people believe powerful society creates new organizations required achieve objectivescitation needed direction developmental process takes influenced populations awareness opportunities increasing awareness leads greater aspiration releases greater energy helps bring greater accomplishmentcitation needed since time english economist thomas malthus thought capacity development limited availability natural resources resources divided four major categories physical social mental human land water minerals oil etc constitute physical resources social resources consist societys capacity manage direct complex systems activities knowledge information technology mental resources energy skill capacities people constitute human resources science economics much concerned scarcity resources though physical resources limited social mental human resources subject inherent limits even appear limited fixity limitation resources continue expand time expansion accelerated use appropriate strategies recent decades rate growth three resources accelerated role physical resources tends diminish society moves higher developmental levels correspondingly role nonmaterial resources increases development advances one important nonmaterial resources information become key input information nonmaterial resource exhausted distribution sharing greater access information helps increase pace development ready access information economic factors helps investors transfer capital sectors areas fetches higher return greater input nonmaterial resources helps explain rising productivity societies spite limited physical resource basecitation needed application higher nonmaterial inputs also raises productivity physical inputs modern technology helped increase proven sources oil recent time reduced cost search operations moreover technology shows possible reduce amount physical inputs wide range activities scientific agricultural methods demonstrated soil productivity could raised synthetic fertilizers dutch farm scientists demonstrated minimal water consumption liters enough raise kilogram vegetables compared thousand liters traditional irrigation methods normally requirecitation needed henry fords assembly line techniques reduced manhours labor required deliver car minutes minutes examples show greater input higher nonmaterial resources raise productivity physical resources thereby extend mind engages pure creative thinking comes new thoughts ideas applies society come new organizations turns study nature discovers natures laws mechanisms applies technology makes new discoveries practical inventions boost productivity technical creativity erratic course history intense periods creative output followed dull inactive periods however period since marked intense burst technological creativity multiplying human capacities exponentiallycitation needed though many reasons cited accelerating pace technological inventionscitation needed major cause role played mental creativity increasing atmosphere freedom political freedom liberation religious dogma powerful impact creative thinking age enlightenment dogmas superstitions greatly restricted mental creativity example astronomer copernicus proposed heliocentric view world church rejected itcitation needed conform established religious doctrine galileo used telescope view planets church condemned device instrument devil seemed unusual enlightenment shattered obscurantist fetters freedom thought spirit experimentation thrived though technological inventions increased pace development tendency view developmental accomplishments mainly powered technology misses bigger picture technological innovation spurred general advances social organization knowledge middle ages efforts scientific progress mainly effective system preserve disseminate knowledge since organized protection patent rights scientists inventors secretive observations discoveries establishment scientific associations scientific journals spurred exchange knowledge created written record posteritycitation needed technological development depends social organizations nobel laureate economist arthur lewis observed mechanization factory production industrial direct result reorganization english agriculture enclosure common lands england generated surplus income farmers extra income generated additional raw materials industrial processing produced greater demand industrial products traditional manufacturing processes could meetcitation needed opening sea trade boosted demand industrial production export factory production increased many times production reorganized use steam energy combined moving assembly lines specialization division labor thus technological development result contributing factor overall development societycitation needed individual scientific inventions spring blue build past accomplishments incremental manner give conscious form unconscious knowledge society gathers time pioneers conscious surrounding community inventions normally meet initial resistance recedes time inventions gain wider acceptance opposition stronger pioneer introduction invention gets delayedcitation needed medieval times guilds tightly controlled members medical progress slow mainly physicians secretive remedies denis papin demonstrated steam engine german naval authorities refused accept fearing would lead increased unemployment john kay developed flying shuttle textile loom physically threatened english weavers feared loss jobs fled france invention favorably received widespread use computers application biotechnology raises similar resistance among public todaycitation needed whether public receives invention readily resists depends awareness willingness entertain rapid change regardless response technological inventions occurs part overall social development isolated field activitycitation needed concept inherent limits development arose mainly past development determined largely availability physical resources humanity relied musclepower thoughtpower accomplish work longer case today mental resources primary determinant development people drove simple bullock cart design ships aircraft carry huge loads across immense distances humanity tamed rivers cleared jungles even turned arid desert lands cultivable lands irrigationcitation needed using intelligence society turned sand powerful silicon chips carry huge amounts information form basis computers since inherent limit expansion societys mental resources notion limits growth ultimately societys developmental journey marked three stages physical vital mentalcitation needed clearcut stages overlap three present society times one predominant two play subordinate roles term vital denotes emotional nervous energies empower societys drive towards accomplishment express directly interactions human beings full development mind vital energies predominate human personality gradually yield ground mental element becomes stronger speed circumstances social transition one stage another physical stage characterized domination physical element human personalitycitation needed phase society preoccupied bare survival subsistence people follow tradition strictly little innovation change land main asset productive resource physical stage wealth measured size land holdings agrarian feudal phase society inherited wealth position rule roost little upward mobility feudal lords military chiefs function leaders society commerce money play relatively minor role innovative thinking experimental approaches discouraged people follow tradition unwaveringly show little inclination think outside established guidelines occupational skills passed parent child long process apprenticeship guilds restrict dissemination trade secrets technical

surplus income arises prompts people spend items far considered reach people begin aspire luxury leisure possible life subsistence levelcitation needed stage three essential characteristics practical social political application mind practical application mind generates many inventions social application mind leads new effective types social organization political application leads changes political systems empower populace exercise political human rights free democratic manner changes began renaissance enlightenment gained momentum reformation proclaimed right individuals relate directly god without mediation priests political application mind led american french revolutions produced writing first recognized rights common man gradually led actual enjoyment rights organization mental invention therefore surprising mental stage development responsible formulation great number organizational innovations huge business corporations emerged make money even total earnings small countries global networks transportation communication connect nations world within common unified social fabric sea air travel telecommunications weather reporting information exchange addition spurring technological organizational innovation mental phase also marked increasing power ideas change social life ethical ideals humanity since dawn civilization practical application daily social

man political social economic many rights extended sections humanity succeeding decadecitation needed relative duration three stages speed transition one another varies one society another however broadly speaking essential features physical vital mental stages development strikingly similar therefore quite recognizable even societies separated great distance little direct contact one another moreover societies also learn gone transitions therefore may able make transitions faster better netherlands introduced primary education pioneering initiative japan thing late century advantage experience us countries many asian countries initiated primary education winning independence could draw vast experience developed nations major reason quickening pace progresscitation needed natural
