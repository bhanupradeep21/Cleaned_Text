two prominent theoretical approaches phenomenon ingroup favoritism realistic conflict theory social identity theory realistic conflict theory proposes intergroup competition sometimes intergroup conflict arises two groups opposing claims scarce resources contrast social identity theory posits psychological drive positively distinct social identities general root cause ingroup favoring

experiment elevenyearold boys similar backgrounds studied mock summer camp situation researchers posing camp personnel boys divided two equal groups encouraged bond aim fostering ingroup mentality researchers introduced series competitive activities pitted groups valuable prize hostility outgroup negativity lastly researchers attempted reverse hostility engaging boys situations mutual interdependence effort eventually resulted relative harmony two groups sherif concluded experiment negative attitudes toward outgroups arise groups compete limited however also theorized intergroup frictions could reduced positive relations presence overarching goal could achieved two groups according social identity theory one key determinants group biases need improve selfesteem desire view

high selfesteem suffered threat selfconcept exhibited greater ingroup biases people low selfesteem suffered threat studies supported notion negative correlation selfesteem ingroup researchers found individuals low selfesteem showed bias toward ingroup outgroup studies even shown highselfesteem groups showed bias lower selfesteem research may suggest alternative explanation additional reasoning

social metaanalysis review effect oxytocin social behavior done carsten de dreu research reviewed shows oxytocin enables development trust specifically towards individuals similar ingroup cooperation favoritism towards bias oxytocininduced goodwill towards features characteristics perceived similar may evolved biological basis sustaining ingroup cooperation protection fitting darwinian insight acts selfsacrifice cooperation contribute functioning group hence improve odds survival members said race used example ingroup outgroup tendencies society often categorizes individuals groups based race caucasian african american latino etc one study examined race empathy found participants receiving nasally administered oxytocin stronger reactions pictures ingroup members making pained faces pictures outgroup members shows oxytocin may implicated ability empathize individuals different races individuals one race potentially biased towards helping individuals race individuals another race experiencing pain oxytocin also implicated lying lying would prove beneficial ingroup members study relationship examined found individuals administered oxytocin rates dishonesty participants responses increased ingroup members beneficial outcome group examples show tendency act ways benefit ingroup members noted two recent theoretical theoretical basis inclusion selfidentity theories reasoned action planned behavior many similarities social identity theory extension selfcategorization according social identity theory important component selfconcept derived memberships social groups categories people define evaluate terms selfinclusive social category eg sex class team two processes come play categorization perceptually accentuates differences ingroup outgroup similarities among ingroup members including self stereotypical dimensions selfenhancement selfconcept defined terms group membership seeks behaviorally perceptually favor ingroup outgroup social identities cognitively represented group prototypes describe prescribe beliefs attitudes feelings behaviors optimize balance minimization ingroup differences maximization intergroup differences specifically according social identity theory continuum personal social identity shifts along continuum determine extent grouprelated personal characteristics influence persons feelings particular social identity salient basis selfconception self assimilated perceived ingroup prototype thought set perceived ingroup norms selfperception beliefs attitudes feelings behaviors defined terms group prototype thus social identities influence behavior mediating role group norms people likely engage particular behavior accord norms behaviorally relevant group membership particularly identity salient basis selfdefinition group membership salient peoples behavior feelings accord personal idiosyncratic characteristics rather group norms hand selfidentity theory poses self often reflection expected norms practices persons social role center proposition self made multifaceted differentiated components exist organized manner sake filling roles people able create identity talking others often roles taking differ one group another differing roles positions people fill result interactions others called role identities role identities may selfrealized may facts like mother social worker blood donor role identities lead people act certain ways due assumed expectations roles satisfaction complying expectations role often distress behind inability appear congruent ones identity defined societal norms also existing hierarchy importance roles individuals take according hierarchical standing roles people become representative roles stand higher hierarchically according identity salience likelihood role identities invoked different situations result role identities placed hierarchically different orders person person people hold roles may act differently roles valued example working mother may less time spend child opposed mother work behaviors reflective identities held higher hierarchically people people act selfworth selfmeaning according someone holds identity psychologist higher identity linguist find heshe may become competitive meeting another person better psychology heshe heshe wont care contact someone much better linguist heshe similar way social relationships influenced salience selfidentity often places individuals social contexts commitment role within context becomes big part perpetrating idea self also finds people relating others hold similar role identities top hierarchies people selfconcepts derived role define within context group staying within roles intergroup similarities accentuated intergroup differences attempt assimilate oneself according tendencies group often people reconfigure intragroup representations identities certain prototypes form groups reaffirm rules members group encouraged follow shared information views discussed often novel unshared information within group therefore norm established majority views perpetuated others norm fluid changing according different contexts within group want keep majority views matters keep active role affirming views ingroup contest outgroups studies shown ingroup favoritism arises endogenously formation cultural symbolic markers certain conditions result trivial

groups present research analyzing articles intergroup conflicts eg falklands war comparing corresponding language versions wikipedia eg english spanish found evidence ingroup favoritism ingroup systematically preferred presented favorable light outgroup presented immoral responsible substantial variations conflicts however additional analyses revealed ingroup favoritism pronounced recent conflicts articles written predominantly ingroup social psychologists long made distinction ingroup favoritism outgroup negativity outgroup negativity act punishing placing burdens upon indeed significant body research exists attempts identify relationship ingroup favoritism outgroup negativity well conditions lead outgroup example struch schwartz found support predictions belief congruence belief congruence theory concerns degree similarity beliefs attitudes values perceived exist individuals theory also states dissimilarity increases negative orientations towards others applied racial discrimination belief congruence theory argues perceived dissimilarity beliefs impact racial discrimination race research finds evidence ingroup bias police judicial oxytocin correlated preferences individuals associate members group also evident conflicts members different groups conflict individuals receiving nasally administered oxytocin demonstrate frequent defensemotivated responses toward ingroup members outgroup members oxytocin correlated participant desire protect vulnerable ingroup members despite individuals attachment similarly demonstrated oxytocin administered individuals alter subjective preferences order align ingroup ideals outgroup studies demonstrate oxytocin associated intergroup dynamics oxytocin influences responses individuals particular group another group ingroup bias evident smaller groups however also extended groups large ones entire country leading toward tendency strong national zeal study done netherlands showed oxytocin increased ingroup favoritism nation decreasing acceptance members ethnicities people also show affection countrys flag remaining indifferent cultural objects exposed thus hypothesized hormone may factor xenophobic tendencies secondary effect thus oxytocin appears affect individuals international level ingroup becomes specific home country outgroup grows include countries crosscultural studies found ingroup derogation tendency criticize members ones group culture harshly members outside groups common among members disadvantaged minority groups among members majority dominant group according makellams spencerrodgers peng system justification theory seeks explain minorities sometimes endorse systemjustifying views group said research ingroup favoritism derogation partially supported theory theory failed address makellams et al also found compared individualist cultures people collectivist cultures east asian cultures tended judge group members less favorably judged outsiders whereas people individualist cultures inclined judge members group favorably judged social identity theorycitation needed freudian theorists explain ingroup derogation result negative selfimage believe extended makellams et al theorized ingroup derogation may culturally normative less troubling east asians evidenced fact east asians also likely report high levels positive affect emotion towards members ingroup demonstrating ambivalence towards unfavorable characteristics acknowledged ingroup according makellam et al culturallyingrained attitudes beliefs rather low selfesteem may play role collectivist cultures ingroup
