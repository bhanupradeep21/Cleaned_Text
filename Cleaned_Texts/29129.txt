social emotional development represents specific domain child development gradual integrative process children acquire capacity understand experience express manage emotions develop meaningful relationships social emotional development encompasses large range skills constructs including limited selfawareness joint attention play theory mind understanding others perspectives selfesteem emotion regulation friendships identity development social emotional development sets foundation children engage developmental tasks example order complete difficult school assignment child may need ability manage sense frustration seek help peer maintain romantic relationship fight teen may need able articulate feelings take perspective partner successfully resolve conflict however also interrelated dependent developmental domains example language delays deficits associated socialemotional many mental health disorders including major depressive disorder anxiety disorders borderline personality disorder substance use disorders eating disorders conceptualized lens social emotional development prominently emotion many core symptoms autism spectrum disorder reflect abnormalities social emotional developmental areas including joint theory attachment refers strong bond individuals develop special people lives though attachment relationships significant others adulthood marital partners humans first influential attachment primary caregivers infants john bowlby mary ainsworth first delineated tested attachment theory evolutionarily informed process emotional ties caregiver adaptive research supported presence four stages attachment early attachment considered foundational later socialemotional development predictive many outcomes including internalizing problems externalizing problems social competence selfesteem cognitive development mary ainsworths work using strange situation method identified four types attachment styles young children beginning birth newborns capacity signal generalized distress response unpleasant stimuli bodily states pain hunger body temperature may smile seemingly involuntarily satiated sleep response pleasant touch infants begin using social smile smile response positive social interaction approximately months age laughter begins expressions happiness become intentional age young children interrupting actions smile express happiness nearby adults months age markedly different kinds smiles eg grin muted smile mouth open smile developing months months children begin acquire sense self gives rise onset selfconscious emotions eg shame embarrassment guilt pride around age considered complex nature basic emotions happiness anger fear disgust require children recognition external standards evaluative capacities determine whether self meets emotion regulation defined two components first emotions regulating refers changes elicited activated emotions eg childs sadness eliciting change parent second component labeled emotions regulated refers process activated emotion changed deliberate actions taken self eg selfsoothing distraction others eg throughout infancy children rely heavily caregivers emotion regulation reliance labeled coregulation caregivers use strategies distraction sensory input eg rocking stroking regulate infants emotions despite reliance caregivers change intensity duration frequency emotions infants capable engaging selfregulation strategies young months age infants intentionally avert gaze overstimulating months infants use mobility walking crawling intentionally approach withdraw throughout toddlerhood caregivers remain important emotional development socialization children behaviors labeling childs emotions prompting thought emotion eg turtle sad continuing provide alternative activitiesdistractions suggesting coping strategies modeling coping caregivers use strategies respond sensitively childrens emotions tend children effective emotion regulation less fearful fussy likely express positive emotions easier soothe engaged environmental exploration enhanced social skills toddler preschool starting months infants begin engage social referencing refer another often adult caregiver inform reaction environmental classic visual cliff experiments babies separated mothers plexiglass floor appeared represent dangerous cliff looked mothers mothers responded infants facial expressions signaling encouragement happiness infants crossed cliff contrast mothers displayed fear anger infants cross infants age social referencing capacity becomes developed months infants able use information gained social referencing inform decisions outside immediate months infants able socially reference interactions directed example caregiver responded anger older brother went take cookie infant able harness information less likely take cookie age social referencing also begins support childrens understanding others children learn others like dislike based information gained social referencing eg facial expression adult reacts smiling given ball anger given doll choose give adult ball rather doll regardless preferences early age newborns reactive others distress evidenced behaviors crying response another infants cry children continue develop begin display behaviors indicate understanding connection others emotional states beyond simple informational value emotional states provide children months respond verbal nonverbal cues facial expressions body posture discomfort sadness simple helping behaviors eg giving adult blanket shivering rubbing arms saying brr throughout period months children become adept need fewer cues engage helping however helping behavior age already dependent cost helping eg less likely give adult blanket recipient help eg children likely help show concern caregivers strangers months old infants begin engaging simple backandforth exchanges often exchanges consist words coos gurgles smiles facial expressions bodily movements eg lifting arms kicking back forth exchanges mimic turntaking occurs conversations joint attention refers ability individuals share common point reference children common point reference often object environment toy development joint attention initially starts infants ability respond joint attention bids eg looking parent looks eventually develops age ability initiate joint attention directing attention another shared point done many means including gaze gesture eg pointing showing speech early months age infants show beginning requisites joint attention looking general direction adults however consistently able find shared point months accuracy infants also discerning response joint attention example age look direction adult adults eyes closed mistake younger children initiation joint attention begins approximately year might look like child pointing airplane looking mom back airplane say see look joint attention critical social skill drives development domains joint attention enables infants identify objects adults labeling promotes shared backandforth communication fifteenmonthold infants engaged interactions caregivers include joint attentional focus eg toy demonstrated frequent communicative utterances joint attention episodes joint engagement predictive later vocabulary word learning especially joint attention focused object infant initially attending infant picks ball mother engages joint attention episode infant using ball shared point reference later ages initiating joint attention frequency child combines one word gesture eg pointing plane saying plane associated earlier onset multiword utterances complex speech overall years selfconcept refers set attributes abilities attitudes values one identifies defining although initial milestones occur period support selfconcept including basic self awareness ie ability recognize selflabeling period involves several advances domain months children able describe likes dislikes suggesting developing awareness elicits positive negative emotions years old children demonstrate agreement mothers ratings behavior basic behavioral indicators preschool period children deepening gender identity integrating gender socialization information preschoolers learn gender stereotypes quickly definitively ranging toy preferences clothes jobs behaviors stereotypes initially held firmly often state violations possible would want friends child violates children acquire gender stereotypic behaviors early preschool period social learning organize behaviors beliefs forming basic gender identity end preschool period children acquire gender constancy understanding biological basis sex consistency younger preschool aged children demonstrate basics theory mind ability take perspective others however skill constrained childrens limited understanding thoughts beliefs even false influence demonstrated following scenario danny puts toy shelf leaves room friend sally comes plays toy puts cabinet asked danny look toy young preschool aged child state look cabinet therefore recognizing dannys current false belief toys location years childrens capacity understand false beliefs subsequently accuracy perspective taking becomes play often cited central building block childrens development much united nations commission human rights declared human right complexity diversity play increases immensely preschool years notably onset cooperative play children work toward common goal sociodramatic play type cooperative play children act make believe sociodramatic play rooted childs reallife experiences falling three categories family scenes eg playing house assigned mommy daddy roles character scenes eg superhero princess functional scenes eg playing cooperative play sociodramatic play bring increased social interactions compared solitary play parallel play children play similarly next without significant interaction eg two children building towers play becomes intertwined social emotional development characteristics sociodramatic play allow children practice cooperation negotiation conflict resolution skills well engage roleplaying promotes perspective taking sociodramatic play associated social emotional skills years old children begin use selfevaluations competencies define sense derives recently developed ability make social comparisons years old social comparisons may specific individual however becomes complex coming years allowing children compare performance multiple individuals arrive general school aged children also show ability simultaneously hold differentiated selfevaluations across domains eg good physical appearance poor school middle childhood boys girls form peer groups segregated may act perpetuate previously learned gender stereotypes deriving ability make social comparisons school aged children begin integrate attributions gender typical gender age childrens ability make global selfevaluations also allows recognize contentedness dissonance gender childrens gender identity two dimensions significantly correlated selfesteem children higher levels typicality contentedness report higher selfesteem years old children acquired basic vocabulary labeling simple emotional experiences using words scared happy mad however emotional vocabulary children grows much rapidly middle childhood doubling every two years period slowing dramatically end preschool period children reliably comprehend meaning around emotion words time years old children see sevenfold increase understanding almost emotion furthermore shift processing positive negative words course development occurs young children aged shown better performance positive words preference disappeared increasing age ie positivity bias emotion term emotional display rules culturally bound norms dictate individuals express emotions accordingly ability enact display rules relies childrens capacity emotional expression emotion regulation socialization toward display rules begins infancy children show capacity preschool period however childrens use display rules understanding value become increasingly complex elementary children age grade less likely outwardly express anger children also report using display rules control emotional expressions teachers peers evidence suggest emotional masking also increases age throughout school age period least display rules also inform children choose express emotions children move preschool period middle childhood become likely use verbal communication express negative emotions nonverbal behaviors crying finally around years old bolstered increased perspective taking skills display rules recognized important maintaining social harmony relationships rather simply means avoid upon school entry childrens emotion regulation repertoire becomes increasingly previously relied upon methods eg seeking support parents moving awayavoiding emotionally activating stimuli become less effective middle childhood children implement complex distraction techniques cognitive appraisal strategies eg choosing focus positive problem solving years old childrens emotion regulation involves balance problemfocused coping emotionfocused coping problemfocused coping represents change driven strategy focused attempting eliminate source stress proactive action eg child feels worried test choosing study regulate worry contrast emotionfocused coping acceptance based effective stressor easily changed removed eg child disappointed grade test using strategies reduce disappointment moment help know study final although diversification emotion regulation strategy use occurs age school aged children continue strengthen use previous regulation strategies well notably school age children continue seek regulation support parents increasingly teachers peers children also show developmental progression differentiation go emotional support given specific thus whole beginning adolescence children become skilled emotion regulators adolescents navigate increasingly diverse social world selfconcept shifts create accommodate organized understanding situational factors may influence behavior eg behavior different friends compared added complexity fundamental task adolescence considered forming unified coherent identity inclusive

identity development youth initially unexplored ethnic identity enter moratorium phase followed ethnic identity general identity achievement moratorium statuses appear associated positive psychological adjustment including higher selfesteem goaloriented behavior selfefficacy adolescence time peer relationships become increasingly important frequent period adolescents reliably spend approximately twice much time peers time developmental shift occurring quality nature friendships adolescents friendships characterized increased emotional support intimacy closeness loyalty contrasted friendships early childhood built upon time spent joint activities middle childhood defined reciprocity helping close friendships adolescence act buffer negative impacts stressors provide foundation intimacy conflict resolution necessary romantic relationships promote empathy peer acceptance related childrens prior social emotional development predictive later developments domain sociometric status identifies five classifications peer acceptance children based two dimensions social liking social popular average rejected neglected controversial patterns acceptance become selfperpetuating throughout childhood adolescence rejected children excluded peer interactions promote relationship skills perspective taking conflict adolescence children increasingly form peer groups often common interest values eg skaters jocks somewhat insular nature eg cliques crowds theoretically peer groups hypothesized serve intermediary support source adolescents exert independence supported data indicates importance peer group membership youth increases early adolescence followed decline later peers peer groups age become important socialization agents contributing adolescents
