board series meetings bringing together scientists neuroscience related news reports said research would map dynamics neuron activity mice eventually tens billions neurons human scientific commentary outlining experimental plans limited project alivisatos et al outlined variety specific experimental techniques might used achieve termed functional connectome well new technologies developed course indicated initial studies might done caenorhabditis elegans followed drosophila comparatively simple neural circuits midterm studies could done zebrafish mice etruscan shrew studies ultimately done primates humans proposed development nanoparticles could used voltage sensors would detect individual action potentials well nanoprobes could serve electrophysiological multielectrode arrays particular called use wireless noninvasive methods neuronal activity detection either utilizing microelectronic verylargescale integration based synthetic biology rather microelectronics one proposed method enzymatically produced dna would serve ticker tape record neuronal based calcium ioninduced errors coding dna data would analyzed modeled large scale related technique proposed use highthroughput dna sequencing rapidly mapping neural timeline proposed working group advisory committee december brain initiative website lists following participants affiliates scientists offered

psychologist ed vul expressed concern however initiative would divert funding individual investigator neuroscientist donald stein expressed concern would mistake begin spending money technological methods knowing exactly would physicist michael roukes argued instead methods nanotechnology becoming sufficiently mature make time right brain activity neuroscientist rodolfo llinás declared first rockefeller meeting happened magnificent never neuroscience seen much unity glorious projects face great logistical challenges neuroscientists estimated project would generate exabytes data every year
