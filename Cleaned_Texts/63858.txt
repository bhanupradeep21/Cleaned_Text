liver function tests lfts lfs also referred hepatic panel groups blood tests provide information state patients tests include prothrombin time ptinr activated partial thromboplastin time aptt albumin bilirubin direct indirect others liver transaminases aspartate transaminase ast sgot alanine transaminase alt sgpt useful biomarkers liver injury patient degree intact liver liver diseases cause mild symptoms initially diseases must detected early hepatic liver involvement diseases crucial importance testing performed patients blood sample tests associated functionality eg albumin cellular integrity eg transaminase conditions linked biliary tract gammaglutamyl transferase alkaline phosphatase tests measure function accurate call liver chemistries liver tests rather liver function several biochemical tests useful evaluation management patients hepatic dysfunction tests used detect presence liver disease help distinguish among different types liver disorders gauge extent known liver damage monitor response treatment measurements also carried usually twice year routine cases individuals taking certain medications anticonvulsants ensure medications adversely impacting persons livercitation needed standard liver tests assessing liver damage include alanine aminotransferase alt aspartate aminotransferase ast alkaline phosphatases aps bilirubin may used estimate excretory function liver coagulation tests albumin used evaluate metabolic activity although example reference ranges given vary depending method analysis used administering laboratory well age gender ethnicity potentially unrelated health factors individual results always interpreted using reference range provided laboratory performed testcitation needed measurement total bilirubin includes unconjugated indirect conjugated direct bilirubin unconjugated bilirubin breakdown product heme part hemoglobin red blood cells liver responsible clearing blood unconjugated bilirubin conjugating modified make watersoluble enzyme named udpglucuronyltransferase total bilirubin level exceeds μmoll indicates liver disease total bilirubin levels exceed μmoll bilirubin deposition sclera skin mucous membranes give areas yellow colour thus called increase predominantly unconjugated bilirubin due overproduction reduced hepatic uptake unconjugated bilirubin reduced conjugation bilirubin overproduction due reabsorption haematoma ineffective erythropoiesis leading increased red blood cell destruction gilberts syndrome syndrome defects udpglucuronyltransferase enzyme affecting bilirubin degree rise conjugated bilirubin directly proportional degree hepatocyte injury viral hepatitis also cause rise conjugated bilirubin parenchymal liver disease incomplete extrahepatic obstruction rise conjugated
