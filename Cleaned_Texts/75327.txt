genetic diversity total number genetic characteristics genetic makeup species ranges widely number species differences within species attributed span survival distinguished genetic variability describes tendency genetic characteristics vary genetic diversity serves way populations adapt changing environments variation likely individuals population possess variations alleles suited environment individuals likely survive produce offspring bearing allele population continue generations success academic field population genetics includes several hypotheses theories regarding genetic diversity neutral theory evolution proposes diversity result accumulation neutral substitutions diversifying selection hypothesis two subpopulations species live different environments select different alleles particular locus may occur instance species large range relative mobility individuals within frequencydependent selection hypothesis alleles become common become vulnerable occurs interactions high frequency defensive allele among host means likely pathogen spread able overcome allele study conducted national science foundation found genetic diversity withinspecies diversity biodiversity dependent upon ie diversity within species necessary maintain diversity among species vice versa according lead researcher study dr richard lankau one type removed system cycle break community becomes dominated single genotypic phenotypic diversity found species protein dna organismal levels nature diversity nonrandom heavily structured correlated environmental variation

neutral adaptive genetic diversity consists genes increase fitness responsible adaptability changes adaptive genes responsible ecological morphological behavioral natural selection acts adaptive genes allows organisms rate evolution adaptive genes greater neutral genes due influence however difficult identify alleles adaptive genes thus adaptive genetic diversity often measured example heritability measured h v v p displaystyle adaptive population differentiation measured q v g v g v displaystyle may possible identify adaptive genes genomewide association studies analyzing genomic data population identifying adaptive genetic diversity important conservation adaptive potential species may dictate whether survives becomes extinct especially climate magnified lack understanding whether low neutral genetic diversity correlated high genetic drift high mutation review current research teixeira huber discovered species genus arabidopsis appear high adaptive potential despite suffering low genetic diversity overall due severe therefore species low neutral genetic diversity may possess high adaptive genetic diversity since difficult identify adaptive genes measurement overall genetic diversity important planning conservation efforts species experienced rapid decline genetic diversity may highly susceptible variation populations gene pool allows natural selection act upon traits allow population adapt changing environments selection trait occur changing environment resulting increase genetic diversity new mutation selected maintained decrease genetic diversity disadvantageous allele selected hence genetic diversity plays important role survival adaptability capability population adapt changing environment depend presence necessary genetic genetic diversity population likelihood population able adapt survive conversely vulnerability population changes climate change novel diseases increase reduction genetic example inability koalas adapt fight chlamydia koala retrovirus korv linked koalas low genetic low genetic diversity also geneticists concerned koalas ability adapt climate change humaninduced environmental changes large populations likely maintain genetic material thus generally higher genetic small populations likely experience loss diversity time random chance example genetic drift allele variant gene drifts fixation allele locus lost resulting loss genetic small population sizes inbreeding mating individuals similar genetic makeup likely occur thus perpetuating common alleles point fixation thus decreasing genetic concerns genetic diversity therefore especially important large mammals due small population size high levels humancaused population genetic bottleneck occur population goes period low number individuals resulting rapid decrease genetic diversity even increase population size genetic diversity often continues low entire species began small population since beneficial mutations see rare gene pool limited small starting important consideration area conservation genetics working toward rescued population species genetically healthy random mutations consistently generate genetic mutation increase genetic diversity short term new gene introduced gene pool however persistence gene dependent drift selection see new mutations either neutral negative effect fitness positive beneficial mutation likely persist thus longterm positive effect genetic diversity mutation rates differ across genome larger populations greater mutation smaller populations mutation less likely persist likely eliminated gene flow often migration movement genetic material example pollen wind migration bird gene flow introduce novel alleles population alleles integrated population thus increasing genetic example insecticideresistant mutation arose anopheles gambiae african mosquitoes migration gambiae mosquitoes population anopheles coluzziin mosquitoes resulted transfer beneficial resistance gene one species genetic diversity increased gambiae mutation coluzziin gene humans initially started farming used selective breeding pass desirable traits crops omitting undesirable ones selective breeding leads monocultures entire farms nearly genetically identical plants little genetic diversity makes crops extremely susceptible widespread disease bacteria morph change constantly diseasecausing bacterium changes attack specific genetic variation easily wipe vast quantities species genetic variation bacterium best attacking happens humans selectively bred use harvest entire crop wiped nineteenthcentury great famine ireland caused part lack biodiversity since new potato plants come result reproduction rather pieces parent plant genetic diversity developed entire crop essentially clone one potato especially susceptible epidemic much irelands population depended potatoes food planted namely lumper variety potato susceptible rotcausing oomycete called phytophthora fungus destroyed vast majority potato crop left one million people starve death genetic diversity agriculture relate disease also herbivores similarly example monoculture agriculture selects traits uniform throughout plot genotype susceptible certain herbivores could result loss large portion one way farmers get around intercropping planting rows unrelated genetically distinct crops barriers herbivores preferred host plant farmer effectively reduces ability herbivore spread throughout entire genetic diversity livestock species permits animal husbandry range environments range different objectives provides raw material

increasing genetic diversity among oceanic plankton viruses aid genetic shifting process ocean viruses infect plankton carry genes organisms addition virus containing genes one cell infects another genetic makeup latter changes constant shift genetic makeup helps maintain healthy population plankton despite complex unpredictable environmental cheetahs threatened species low genetic diversity resulting poor sperm quality made breeding survivorship difficult cheetahs moreover cheetahs survive however recently discovered female cheetahs mate one male per litter cubs undergo induced ovulation means new egg produced every time female mates mating multiple males mother increases genetic diversity within single litter attempts increase viability species increasing genetic diversity called
