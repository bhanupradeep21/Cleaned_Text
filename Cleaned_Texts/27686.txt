artemia genus aquatic crustaceans also known brine shrimp genus family artemiidae first historical record existence artemia dates back first half century ad lake urmia iran example called iranian geographer aquatic although first unambiguous record report drawings made schl√∂sser animals lymington artemia populations found worldwide typically inland saltwater lakes occasionally oceans artemia able avoid cohabiting types predators fish ability live waters high salinity ability artemia produce dormant eggs known cysts led extensive use artemia aquaculture cysts may stored indefinitely hatched demand provide convenient form live feed larval fish nauplii brine shrimp artemia constitute widely used food item metric tons short tons dry artemia cysts marketed worldwide addition resilience artemia makes ideal animals running biological toxicity assays become model organism used test toxicity chemicals breeds artemia sold novelty gifts marketing name seamonkeys brine shrimp artemia comprises group seven nine species likely diverged ancestral form living mediterranean area million years around time messinian salinity crisis laboratory aquaculture artemia reference center ghent university possesses largest known artemia cyst collection cyst bank containing artemia population samples collected different locations around artemia typical primitive arthropod segmented body attached broad leaflike appendages body usually consists segments first pairs appendages next two often fused together carry reproductive organs last segments lead total length usually millimetres adult male mm female width sexes including legs mm body artemia divided head thorax abdomen entire body covered thin flexible exoskeleton chitin muscles attached internally shed female artemia moult precedes every ovulation brine shrimp many functions including swimming digestion reproduction controlled brain instead local nervous system ganglia may control regulation synchronisation autotomy voluntary shedding dropping parts body defence also controlled locally along nervous artemia two types eyes two widely separated compound eyes mounted flexible stalks compound eyes main optical sense

ecological niche protect physiologically optimal levels salinity due predators salt levels brine shrimp seldom occur natural habitats salinities less locomotion achieved rhythmic beating appendages acting pairs respiration occurs surface legs fibrous featherlike plates lamellar males differ females second antennae markedly enlarged modified clasping organs used adult female brine shrimp ovulate approximately every hours favourable conditions female brine shrimp produce eggs almost immediately hatchcitation needed extreme conditions low oxygen level salinity female brine shrimp produce eggs chorion coating brown colour eggs also known cysts metabolically inactive remain total stasis two years dry oxygenfree conditions even temperatures freezing characteristic called cryptobiosis meaning
