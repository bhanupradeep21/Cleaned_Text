large teeth thought evolved either basilosauridlike common ancestor multiple times independently group brygmophyseter oldest proposed raptorials placed extinct paraphyletic hence probably invalid subfamily hoplocetinae alongside scaldicetus diaphorocetus idiorophus species first described paleontologists kiyoharu hirota lawrence barnes observing teeth present jaws coated enamel placed genus scaldicetus described similar however study stated since scaldicetus described tooth remains likely wastebasket taxon new species assigned genus therefore study authored paleontologists kimura toshiyuki hasegawa yoshikazu barnes lawrence placed newly erected genus study geologists giovanni bianucci walter landini placed whale genus naganocetus created concluded closely related zygophyseter first time described study justified similar body sizes basin containing spermaceti organ supracranial basin extending forward causing convex snout presence long temporal fossae sides however since brygmophyseter published first naganocetus considered junior eudelphis physeter kogia since brygmophyseter raptorial group characterized adaptations subduing large prey brygmophyseter likely
