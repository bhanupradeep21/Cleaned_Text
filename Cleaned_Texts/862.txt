ankyloglossia also known tonguetie congenital oral anomaly may decrease mobility tongue caused unusually short thick lingual frenulum membrane connecting underside tongue floor ankyloglossia varies degree severity mild cases characterized mucous membrane bands complete ankyloglossia whereby tongue tethered floor ankyloglossia affect eating especially breastfeeding speech oral well mechanicalsocial ankyloglossia also prevent tongue contacting anterior palate promote infantile swallow hamper progression adultlike swallow result open bite also result mandibular prognathism happens tongue contacts anterior portion mandible exaggerated anterior opinion varies regarding frequently ankyloglossia truly causes problems professionals believe rarely symptomatic whereas others believe associated variety problems disagreement among professionals documented study messner lalakea messner et studied ankyloglossia infant feeding thirtysix infants ankyloglossia compared control group without ankyloglossia two groups followed six months assess possible breastfeeding difficulties defined nipple pain lasting six weeks infant difficulty latching onto staying onto mothers breast twentyfive percent mothers infants ankyloglossia reported breastfeeding difficulty compared mothers control group study concluded ankyloglossia adversely affect breastfeeding certain infants infants ankyloglossia however big difficulties feeding limitations study include small sample size fact quality mothers breastfeeding assessedcitation needed wallace clark also studied breastfeeding difficulties infants followed infants ankyloglossia underwent surgical tonguetie division eight ten mothers experienced poor infant latching onto breast experienced sore nipples experienced continual feeding cycles mothers exclusively breastfeeding following tonguetie division mothers noted immediate improvements breastfeeding mothers notice improvements mothers continued breastfeeding least four months surgery study concluded tonguetie division may possible benefit infants experiencing breastfeeding difficulties due ankyloglossia investigation warranted limitations study include small sample size fact control group addition conclusions based subjective parent report opposed objective measurescitation needed messner lalakea studied speech children ankyloglossia noted phonemes likely affected due ankyloglossia include sibilants lingual sounds r addition authors also state uncertain patients speech disorder linked ankyloglossia way predict young age patients need treatment authors studied children one years age ankyloglossia underwent frenuloplasty fifteen children underwent speech evaluation surgery eleven patients found abnormal articulation surgery nine patients found improved articulation surgery based findings authors concluded possible children ankyloglossia normal speech spite decreased tongue mobility however according study large percentage children ankyloglossia articulation deficits linked tonguetie deficits may improved surgery authors also note ankyloglossia cause delay speech language problems enunciation limitations study include small sample size well lack blinding speechlanguage pathologists evaluated subjects speech several recent systematic reviews randomized control trials argued ankyloglossia impact speech sound development difference speech sound development children received surgery release tonguetie messner lalakea also examined speech ankyloglossia another study studied patients speech grossly normal subjects however half subjects reported thought speech effortful peoples horton colleagues discussed relationship ankyloglossia speech believe tonguetie contributes difficulty range rate articulation compensation needed compensation worst may involve cupids bow although tonguetie exists even years following surgery common speech abnormalities include mispronunciation words common pronouncing ls ws example word lemonade would come wemonade ankyloglossia result mechanical social lalakea studied people aged years old subjects given questionnaires order assess functional complaints associated ankyloglossia eight subjects noted one mechanical limitations included cuts discomfort underneath tongue difficulties kissing licking ones lips eating ice cream cone keeping ones tongue clean performing tongue tricks addition seven subjects noted social effects embarrassment teasing authors concluded study confirmed anecdotal evidence mechanical problems associated ankyloglossia suggests kinds mechanical social problems noted may prevalent previously thought furthermore authors note patients may unaware extent limitations due ankyloglossia since never experienced normal tongue range motion limitation study small sample size also represented large age rangecitation needed lalakea note mechanical social effects may occur even without problems related ankyloglossia speech feeding difficulties also mechanical social effects may arise later childhood younger children may unable recognize report effects addition problems kissing may come later lifecitation needed ankyloglossia often prohibits

diagnosis ankyloglossia may difficult always apparent looking underside tongue often dependent range movement permitted genioglossus muscles infants passively elevating tongue tip tongue depressor may

ankyloglossia difficulty speaking difficulty eating ongoing dental issues jaw pain severity scale ankyloglossia grades appearance function tongue recommended use academy breastfeeding varying types intervention ankyloglossia intervention ankyloglossia sometimes include surgery form frenotomy also called frenectomy frenulectomy frenuloplasty relatively common dental procedure may done softtissue lasers frenotomy performed standalone procedure part another surgery procedure typically quick performed local anesthesia first area tongue numbed injection patient numb small incision made tissue tongue freed tether incision closed dissolvable sutures recovery frenotomy typically quick patients experience little pain according lalakea messner surgery considered patients age tight frenulum well

speech limited tongue range motion example tip tongue restricted making sounds n l tongue compensate dentalization tongue tip moves forward producing r elevation mandible compensate restriction tongue movement also compensations made z using dorsum tongue contact palate rugae thus horton et proposed compensatory strategies way counteract adverse effects ankyloglossia promote surgery nonsurgical
