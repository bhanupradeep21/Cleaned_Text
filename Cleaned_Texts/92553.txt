gynoecium ɡaɪˈniːsiəm dʒɪˈniːʃiəm ancient greek γυνή gunḗ woman female οἶκος oîkos house pl gynoecia commonly used collective term parts flower produce ovules ultimately develop fruit seeds gynoecium innermost whorl flower consists one pistils typically surrounded pollenproducing reproductive organs stamens collectively called androecium gynoecium often referred female portion flower although rather directly producing female gametes ie egg cells gynoecium produces megaspores develops female gametophyte produces egg cells term gynoecium also used botanists refer cluster archegonia associated modified leaves stems present gametophyte shoot mosses liverworts hornworts corresponding terms male parts plants clusters antheridia within androecium flowers bear gynoecium stamens called pistillate carpellate flowers lacking gynoecium called staminate gynoecium often referred female gives rise female eggproducing gametophytes however strictly speaking sporophytes sex gametophytes gynoecium development arrangement important systematic research identification angiosperms challenging floral parts unlike animals plants grow new organs embryogenesis including new roots leaves flowering plants gynoecium develops central region flower carpel groups fused fertilization gynoecium develops fruit provides protection nutrition developing seeds often aids gynoecium several specialized tissues gynoecium develop genetic hormonal interactions along threemajor tissue arise meristems produce cells differentiate different tissues produce parts gynoecium including pistil carpels ovary ovals carpel margin meristem arising carpel primordium produces ovules ovary septum transmitting track plays role fusing apical margins gynoecium may consist one separate pistils pistil typically consists expanded basal portion called ovary elongated section called style apical structure called stigma receives pollen word pistil comes latin pistillum meaning pestle sterile pistil male flower referred pistillode pistils flower considered composed one carpelsnote carpel female reproductive part composed style stigma sometimes individual ovary sometimes connecting shared basal ovary usually interpreted modified leaves bear structures called ovules inside egg cells ultimately form pistil may consist one carpel ovary style stigma may comprise several carpels joined together form single ovary whole unit called pistil gynoecium may present one unicarpellate pistils one multicarpellate pistil number carpels denoted terms tricarpellate three carpels carpels thought phylogenetically derived ovulebearing leaves leaf homologues megasporophylls evolved form closed structure containing ovules structure typically rolled fused along margin although many flowers satisfy definition carpel also flowers carpels flowers ovules although enclosed borne directly shoot different remedies suggested problem easy remedy applies cases redefine carpel appendage encloses ovules may may bear gynoecium single carpel called monocarpous gynoecium multiple distinct free unfused carpels apocarpous gynoecium multiple carpels fused single structure syncarpous syncarpous gynoecium sometimes appear much like monocarpous gynoecium degree connation fusion syncarpous gynoecium vary carpels may fused bases retain separate styles stigmas carpels may fused entirely except retaining separate stigmas sometimes eg apocynaceae carpels fused styles stigmas possess distinct ovaries syncarpous gynoecium fused ovaries constituent carpels may referred collectively single compound ovary challenge determine many carpels fused form syncarpous gynoecium styles stigmas distinct usually counted determine number carpels within compound ovary carpels may distinct locules divided walls called septa syncarpous gynoecium single style stigma single locule ovary may necessary examine ovules attached carpel usually distinct line placentation ovules attached pistils begin small primordia floral apical meristem forming later closer floral apex sepal petal stamen primordia morphological molecular studies pistil ontogeny reveal carpels likely homologous leavescitation needed carpel similar function megasporophyll typically includes stigma fused ovules enclosed enlarged lower portion basal angiosperm lineages degeneriaceae winteraceae carpel begins shallow cup ovules develop laminar placentation upper surface carpel carpel eventually forms folded leaflike structure fully sealed margins style exists broad stigmatic crest along margin allows pollen tubes access along

structure born inside ovaries ovule initially consists stalked integumented megasporangium also called nucellus typically one cell megasporangium undergoes meiosis resulting one four megaspores develop megagametophyte often called embryo sac within ovule megagametophyte typically develops small number cells including two special cells egg cell binucleate central cell gametes involved double
