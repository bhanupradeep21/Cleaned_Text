michelle cedillo v secretary health human services also known cedillo court case involving family michelle cedillo autistic girl whose parents sued united states government believed autism caused receipt measlesmumpsandrubella vaccine also known mmr vaccine thimerosalcontaining vaccines case part omnibus autism proceeding petitioners required present three test cases proposed mechanism vaccines according caused childrens autism cedillo first case mmrandthimerosal hypothesis family sought compensation national vaccine injury compensation program nvicp order qualify required prove likely childrens autism caused vaccines scientific community concluded vaccines cause autism years first cases heard concern therefore expressed relatively lax evidentiary standards nvicp could lead compensation awarded spite compelling scientific evidence contrary vaccine supporters argued might serious adverse public health effects discouraging vaccine manufacturers producing childhood vaccines though nvicp existed since designed handle thousands cases received led establishment omnibus autism proceeding trial opened june washington c cedillos six expert witnesses argued thimerosalcontaining vaccines degraded michelles immune system turn made possible weakened measles virus mmr vaccine cause persistent infection leading autism support hypothesis cedillos witnesses relied reported detection measles virus michelles gastrointestinal tract john olearys unigenetics laboratory dublin however governments expert witnesses conclusively demonstrated olearys positive results caused contamination unigenetics lab rather actual infection february special masters ruled cedillos entitled compensation failed demonstrate thimerosalcontaining vaccines combination mmr vaccine could cause autism special masters concluded among things governments experts considerably qualified testifying behalf families special master george hastings stating cedillos misled physicians guilty view gross medical misjudgment national vaccine injury compensation program established united states passing national childhood vaccine injury act funded tax vaccine dose programs aims maintain steady supply vaccines time allowing victims vaccine injury compensated efficiently previously possible program operates according nofault family michelle cedillo sought compensation program cedillo female wheelchair user yuma arizona involved first three test cases chosen government represent approximately vaccineautism cases brought michelle cedillo born august received thimerosalcontaining vaccines first fifteen months life december received mmr theresa michael cedillo filed vaccine injury claim behalf daughter december encephalopathy january changed petition causationinfact claim meaning arguing michelle developed autism result combined effects thimerosal mmr vaccine result meeting taken place previous year theresa cedillo andrew wakefield defeat autism many families also filed suit nvicp also believed childrens autism caused vaccines therefore entitled compensation following year office special masters united states court federal claims held series meetings decide deal claims july issued order establishing omnibus autism according cedillos michelle developmentally normal received mmr vaccine age months point developed fever began vomiting developed diarrhea michelle diagnosed autism months receiving mmr according washington post legal standard cases subjected trial meant outcome hinge scientific standards evidence legal standard one lawyer families called percent given large number litigants seeking compensation nvicp omnibus autism proceeding established aim resolve pending vaccineautism claims aggressively prior cedillo case beginning scientific community conducted considerable research hypothesized link either mmr vaccine autism thimerosalcontaining vaccines autism research consistently come conclusion link however vaccine supporters paul offit argued standards proving vaccine caused adverse effect nvicp far low court might therefore find favor cedillos also argued happened vaccine manufacturers might discouraged manufacturing childhood vaccines might lead frequent vaccine cedillo case family claimed michelle normal receiving vaccines evidenced number videos age months also argued thimerosalcontaining vaccines degraded immune system made possible measles virus infect cause autism health problems include inflammatory bowel disease glaucoma evidence presented consisted primarily detection measles virus michelle cedillos gi tract according testimony marcel kinsbourne pediatric neurologist professor psychology new school vaccine strain measles virus caused autism infecting gut entering brain causing dysfunction astrocytes brain cells turn provokes high levels neurotransmitter glutamate causing state overstimulation manifests symptoms witnesses testifying behalf state whose testimony attracted attention Ã©ric fombonne psychiatrist mcgill university jeffrey brent medical toxicologist university colorado health sciences center stephen bustin queen mary university london experts testified behalf state included edwin cook psychiatrist diane griffin virologist johns hopkins university stephen hanauer gastroenterologist christine mccusker pediatric immunologist brian ward virologist along fombonne published research failed replicate unigenetics labs results max wiznitzer pediatric testified behalf plaintiffs h vasken aposhian toxicologist university arizona arthur krigsman gastroenterologist johnson center child health development karin hepner molecular biologist wake forest university vera byers retired immunologist ronald c kennedy virus immunologist texas tech marcel kinsbourne retired pediatric neurologist june plaintiffs presented first argument contended michelle cedillo well children autism mercury efflux disorder described aposhian first expert witness problem getting metal case mercury cell evidence disorders documented pointed wilsons aposhian based claim part three peerreviewed first study coauthored boyd haley concluded hair children autism contained less mercury children without autism aposhian stated know hair excretory organ hair reflective mercury metal blood blood reflection mercury tissues fact children autism less mercury hair hint indication perhaps mercury efflux second studies conducted james b adams found baby teeth children autism twice much mercury children without autism aposhian cited study evidence autistic children greater body burden another study aposhian used back statement one conducted jeff bradstreet mark geier gave dimercaptosuccinic acid chelating agent children concluded children autism excreted much mercury thereafter children without autism aposhian also cited number vitro studies evidence thimerosal could cause immune system following day plaintiffs presented second argument namely measles vaccine caused intestinal damage witness day gastroenterologist arthur krigsman testified opinion case depended whether measles virus really detected intestinal tissue michelle cedillo children autism unigenetics lab using study conducted dr hepner steve walker jeff segal evidence unigenetics labs results reliable study however still preliminary stages time trial presented poster international meeting autism research year walker warned havent done anything demonstrate measles virus causing autism even causing bowel trials third day plaintiffs presented next argument uhlmann paper reported presence vaccinestrain measles virus gi tract children used reliable pcr techniques detect said virus witness day molecular biologist karin hepner testified positive negative controls used uhlmann authors led dr john j oleary runs unigenetics lab dublin appropriate operating procedure employed testing appropriate minimize possibility contamination assays utilized appropriately selected also contended two studies failed replicate uhlmann papers results flawed two reasons looked cells children autism rather gi tract test children autism gastrointestinal immunologist vera byers testified michelle cedillo dysregulated immune system allowed measles virus persist system malfunctioning immune system part result virus also stated dysregulation caused combination genetics measles virus vaccination thimerosalcontaining vaccines viral immunologist ronald c kennedy testified michelle cedillo selective immune dysfunction also like dr hepner testified unigenetics lab reliable followed appropriate measures prevent contamination stating laboratory dr john oleary dr orla sheils colleagues good kennedy also testified attended meeting dr cotter orally reported testing reached results similar reported however also acknowledged lab never published sequencing data line fact uhlmann paper mention sequencing retired pediatric neurologist marcel kinsbourne testified michelle developing normally december vaccinated mmr vaccine fever rash experienced shortly thereafter caused vaccine also testified michelle regressive autism since michelle experienced chronic gastrointestinal problems chronic neurologic disorder known autism reasonable conclusion single causative agentie vaccinestrain measles virusis cause chronic one key lines evidence presented cedillo family michelle developmentally normal received mmr vaccine claimed evident videos taken months old however eric fombonne testified michelle displayed early signs autism clearly visibly family video taken prior receiving mmr jeffrey brent past president american academy clinical toxicology invited testify potential role thimerosalcontaining vaccines triggering michelles autism stated single study indicating form mercury could cause serious neurological symptoms dosages used vaccines criticized aposhians use vitro studies equating happens actual animal arguing exposure cell petri dish far likely cause damage equivalent dosage living system regard specific vitro studies brent argued goth flawed tested thimerosal mouse cells human cells cells exposed ethylmercury human body would receiving thimerosalcontaining vaccine since thimerosal quickly metabolized ethylmercury thimerosal cells exposed far higher concentrations thimerosal could ever occur result administration thimerosalcontaining vaccines brent highlighted similar problems agrawal noting cells study like goth study exposed thimerosal ethylmercury much higher doses found also examined bradstreet geier study holmes study noting much better studies investigators could replicate results either holmes study bradstreetgeier study citing two peerreviewed papers concluded hair mercury levels significantly different study participants autism well study concluded children autism chelatable heavymetal body burden brent also pointed like another bradstreets studies bradstreetgeier study published nonindexed journal journal american physicians surgeons described much fringe journal lots alternative agendas even indexed national library brent concluded testifying thimerosal could degraded michelles immune system extent vaccinated mmr nine months later caused brain damage saying couldnt possibly second set proceedings pertained thimerosal alone opposed thimerosal working conjunction mmr brent testified regard jordan king one child autism also served test case trial absolutely reason chelate mercuryrelated many plaintiffs experts also relied reported detection measles virus rna michelles intestinal tissue claim based results olearys unigenetics lab examined stephen bustin worldrenowned expert polymerase chain reaction authored number scientific papers subject well book entitled az quantitative pcr pointed based results oleary lab concluded based paper uhlmann described pcr methodology lab contained lot contaminating dna assays actually detecting dna rather rna makes measles bustin pointed among things olearys unigenetics lab published study neglected use controls also discuss reason bustin concluded scientific certainty none childrens samples analyzed unigenetics lab actually contained measles addition bustin bertus rima testified cotter unable replicate unigenetics labs results contrast kennedys claim able replicate byers testimony countered christine mccusker testified dr byers compared results several tests michelle set normal values tests normal values utilized dr byers however adults children instead compared michelles results ageadjusted set normal values michelles results fell within normal mccusker noting expert report marker cell activity assessed michelles case namely serum immunoglobulin e level entirely additionally wards expert report stated byers expert report contained many statements appear entirely kinsbournes testimony countered ward noted kinsbourne correct persisting measles virus causing autism ought detectable blood since kinsbourne stated mv would travel throughout body via also criticized kinsbournes expert report citing bradstreet et als case series published journal american physicians regard study ward said cerebrospinal antibody data three asd children included manuscript actually argue powerfully persistent measles infection brains ward also noted krigsman cited research conducted vijendra k singh utah state university concluded children autism elevated measles however ward stated expert report unless virtually cases autism caused measles virus position expressly excluded mrc iom cochrane reports singhs work must error must alternate explanation finding recently tested antimeasles antibodies children asd found differences control another point contention paper paul cited kinsbourne expert report however ward noted kinsbourne neglected mention ashwoods paper concluded overwhelming majority epidemiological population studies indicate established correlation vaccinations autism additionally ward noted paper made mention potential link mmr february three special masters ruled petitioners causation claims decision george hastings noted unlike aposhian jeffrey brent testified evidence children autism uniquely susceptible mercury exposure medical doctor hastings also described dr brents testimony addition regard theory children genetically hypersusceptible mercury toxicity hastings concluded petitioners failed demonstrate theory according hastings decision byers testimony far outweighed testimony dr brent respondents witnesses also concluded insistence acceptable use adult norms measure immune function infants young children frankly hastings also wrote kennedy made mistake byers comparing measurements michelles immune system parameters kennedy testified cotters results evidence unigenetics labs testing conclusions reasonably drawn regarding results noting yet examining kinsbournes testimony hastings concluded contained contradictions inconsistencies concerning appropriate time period mmr vaccination onset autism also noted kinsbourne included measles virus cause autism chart wrote textbook done hastings decision noted petitioners causation theories depend upon validity certain testing purported find evidence persisting measles virus biological materials michelle number children however hastings concluded testing decision noted authors dsouza first performed pcr pbmcs children autism resulted large proportion apparently positive results however dsouza group subjected apparently positive samples additional testing techniques order determine whether pcr testing using uhlmann primers truly identifying measles virus measles virus application two techniques revealed nine samples initially tested positive pcr test using uhlmann primers fact measles virus regard remaining samples dsouza paper performed sequencing samples step demonstrated material pcr testing appeared measles virus material fact measles virus material human genetic regard michelle cedillo case general hastings concluded evidence overwhelmingly contrary petitioners also said cedillo family misled physicians guilty view gross medical cedillos appealed case march court upheld dismissal thereof august response second rulings safeminds stated denial reasonable compensation families based inadequate vaccine safety science poorly designed highly controversial similarly rebecca estepp coalition vaccine safety said statement deck stacked families vaccine court government attorneys defend government program using governmentfunded science government generation rescues jb handley argued courts wont concede something bring vaccination hand vaccine scientists praised ruling paul offit stating autism theory already day science court failed hold additionally autism speaks said proven benefits vaccinating child protect serious diseases far outweigh hypothesized risk vaccinations might cause autism thus strongly encourage parents vaccinate children protect serious childhood department health human services released statement saying hopefully determination special masters help reassure parents vaccines cause similarly chairman american medical association stated recent rulings special masters us court federal claims provide even overwhelming evidence association vaccines autism related ruling keelan wilson wrote contrast argued proceedings gave unnecessary publicity scientifically unsupported vaccineautism hypothesis nvicp successful management proceedings met intent original legislation protect integrity vaccine supply maintain public confidence immunization provide injured fair
