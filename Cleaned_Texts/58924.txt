disease rare recessive genetic disorder approximately reported cases since first officially reported erich urbach camillo although cases may recognized dating back early symptoms disease vary greatly individual individual may include hoarse voice lesions scarring skin easily damaged skin poor wound healing dry wrinkly skin beading papules around results general thickening skin mucous membranes cases also hardening brain tissue medial temporal lobes lead epilepsy neuropsychiatric disease typically lifethreatening patients show decreased life disease autosomal recessive condition individuals carriers disease show symptoms disease caused lossoffunction mutations chromosome extracellular matrix protein dermatological symptoms caused buildup hyaline material dermis thickening basement membranes disease typically diagnosed clinical dermatological manifestations particularly beaded papules eyelids discovery mutations within gene allowed use genetic testing confirm initial clinical diagnosis periodic acidschiff pas immunohistochemical staining may also used currently cure disease although ways individually treat many discovery mutations gene opened possibility gene therapy recombinant protein disease treatment neither options currently available researchers examining patients disease learn conditions exhibit similar neurological symptoms autism disease characterized neurological dermatological although symptoms vary greatly affected individuals even within family symptoms normally begin infancy typically result thickening skin mucous first symptom often weak cry hoarse voice due thickening vocal cords hoarse voice one striking clinical manifestations lesions scars also appear skin usually face distal parts often result poor wound healing scarring continues increase patient ages leaving skin waxy appearance skin may easily damaged result minor trauma injury leaving many blisters additional skin also usually dry wrinkly white yellow infiltrates form lips buccal mucosa tonsils uvula epiglottis frenulum lead upper respiratory tract infection sometimes requires tracheostomy relieve much thickening frenulum restrict tongue movement may result speech beading papules around eyelids common symptom often used part diagnosis disease dermatological symptoms sometimes seen less common include hair loss parotitis dental abnormalities corneal ulceration focal degeneration although dermatological changes obvious symptoms disease many patients also neurological symptoms diagnosed cases disease also show bilateral symmetrical calcifications medial temporal calcifications often affect amygdala periamygdaloid amygdala thought involved processing biologically relevant stimuli emotional longterm memory particularly associated fear pet mri scans shown correlation amygdala activation episodic memory strongly emotional therefore disease patients calcifications lesions regions may suffer impairments systems calcifications result buildup calcium deposits blood vessels within brain region time vessels harden tissue part dies causing lesions amount calcification often related disease true prevalence calcifications difficult accurately state patients undergo brain imaging patients also exhibit epilepsy neuropsychiatric abnormalities epilepsy symptoms could begin light anxiety attacks controlled antiepileptic patients present symptoms similar schizophrenia suffer mood anxiety psychotic researchers mapped disease chromosome specifically identified extracellular matrix protein gene gene containing mutations lead development point different mutations within reported lead homozygous lossoffunction mutations ie nonsense frameshift internal autosomal recessive requiring two mutated copies gene cause codes glycoprotein previously unknown origin discovery loss expression leads symptoms associated disease suggests may contribute skin adhesion epidermal differentiation wound healing also thought play role endochondral bone formation tumor biology endothelial cell proliferation blood vessel dermatological symptoms caused buildup hyaline material dermis thickening basement membranes nature material unknown researchers suggested may glycoprotein glycolipid acid mucopolysaccharide altered collagen elastic disease typically diagnosed clinical dermatological manifestations particularly beaded papules eyelids doctors also test hyaline material periodic acidschiff pas staining material colors strongly immunohistochemical skin labeling antibodies protein labeling shown reduced skin affected staining antitype iv collagen antibodies antitype vii collagen antibodies reveals bright thick bands dermoepidermal noncontrast ct scans image calcifications typically used means diagnosing disease partly due fact urbachwiethe patients exhibit calcifications also similar lesions formed diseases herpes simplex encephalitis discovery mutations within gene allowed use genetic testing confirm initial clinical diagnoses disease also allows doctors better distinguish disease similar diseases caused mutations needed currently cure disease although ways individually treat many symptoms success oral dimethyl sulfoxide dmso intralesional heparin true dpenicillamine also shown promise yet used also reports patients treated etretinate drug typically prescribed treat cases calcifications brain lead abnormal electrical activity among neurons patients given antiseizure medication help deal abnormalities tracheostomy often used relieve upper respiratory tract infections carbon dioxide laser surgery thickened vocal cords beaded eyelid papules improved symptoms discovery mutations gene opened possibility gene therapy recombinant protein disease treatment neither two options currently availablecitation needed disease typically lifethreatening life expectancy patients normal long potential side effects thickening mucosa respiratory obstruction properly although may require tracheostomy carbon dioxide laser surgery steps help ensure individuals disease able live full life oral dimethyl sulfoxide dmso shown reduce skin lesions helping minimize discomfort disease rare fewer reported cases medical although disease found worldwide almost quarter reported diagnoses south many patients dutch german khoisan high frequency thought due founder due recessive genetic cause ability carrier disease without symptoms disease often runs families regions south africa one individuals may carriers case studies involving disease patients involve one three cases cases often family due low incidence difficult find large enough number cases adequately study diseasecitation needed appears first case disease reported friedrich siebenmann professor otolaryngology basel switzerland friedrich miescher swiss dermatologist reported three similar official report disease first described viennese dermatologist otorhinolaryngologist urbach original name lipoidosis cutis et mucosae changed lipoid proteinosis cutis et mucosae due urbachs belief condition due abnormal lipid protein deposits within debated whether disease actually form mucopolysaccharidosis amyloidosis even porphyria discovery disease causing mutation gene provided definitive way differentiate disease httpsenwikipediaorgwikihyalinosiscutisetmucosae
