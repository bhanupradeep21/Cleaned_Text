diplopia simultaneous perception two images single object may displaced horizontally vertically relation also called double vision loss visual focus regular conditions often voluntary however occurring involuntarily results impaired function extraocular muscles eyes still functional turn target desired problems muscles may due mechanical problems disorders neuromuscular junction disorders cranial nerves iii iv vi innervate muscles occasionally disorders involving supranuclear oculomotor pathways ingestion diplopia one first signs systemic disease particularly muscular neurological may disrupt persons balance movement reading diplopia diverse range ophthalmologic infectious autoimmune neurological neoplastic diplopia diagnosed mainly information patient doctors may use blood tests physical computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri find underlying classification one first steps diagnosing diplopia often see whether one two major classifications may eliminated involves blocking one eye see symptoms evident eye alone persisting blurry double vision one eye closed classified monocular binocular diplopia double vision arising result laymans terms crosseyed misalignment two eyes relative either esotropia inward exotropia outward case fovea one eye directed object regard fovea directed elsewhere image object regard falls extrafoveal area retina acute diplopia diagnostic challenge common cause acute diplopia ocular motor nerve palsies brain calculates visual direction object based upon position image relative fovea images falling fovea seen directly ahead falling retina outside fovea may seen right left straight ahead depending upon area retina stimulated thus eyes misaligned brain perceives two images one target object target object simultaneously stimulates different noncorresponding retinal areas either eye thus producing double correlation particular areas retina one eye areas known retinal correspondence relationship also gives rise associated phenomenon binocular diplopia although one rarely noted experiencing diplopia fovea one eye corresponds fovea images falling two foveae projected point space thus eyes misaligned two different objects perceived superimposed space phenomenon known visual brain naturally guards double vision attempt avoid double vision brain sometimes ignore image one eye process known suppression ability suppress found particularly childhood brain still developing thus childhood strabismus almost never complain diplopia adults develop strabismus almost always ability suppress might seem entirely positive adaptation strabismus developing child prevent proper development vision affected eye resulting amblyopia adults also able suppress diplopia suppression rarely deep effective takes much longer establish thus risk permanently compromising vision cases diplopia disappears without medical intervention cases cause double vision may still present certain people diplopia achieve fusion yet suppress may display certain type spasmlike irregular movement eyes vicinity fixation point see horror fusionis diplopia also occur viewing one eye called monocular diplopia patient perceives two images monocular polyopia serious causes rarely may behind monocular diplopia symptoms much less often case binocular differential diagnosis multiple image perception includes consideration conditions corneal surface keratoconus subluxation lens structural defect within eye lesion anterior visual cortex nonorganic conditions diffractionbased rather geometrical optical models shown common optical conditions especially astigmatism also produce temporary binocular diplopia caused alcohol intoxication head injuries concussion temporary double vision resolve quickly one

ophthalmologist people able consciously uncouple eyes either overfocusing closely ie going crosseyed unfocusing also looking one object behind another object foremost objects image doubled example placing ones finger front ones face reading text computer monitor sense double vision neither dangerous harmful may even enjoyable makes viewing stereograms monocular diplopia may induced many individuals even normal eyesight simple defocusing experiments involving fine highcontrast appropriate treatment binocular diplopia depends upon cause condition producing symptoms efforts must first made identify treat underlying cause problem treatment options include eye wearing eye patch alternative prism extreme situations botulinum provider diagnoses swelling inflammation around nerve medicines called corticosteroids may used sometimes condition disappears without treatment diabetes youll advised keep tight control blood sugar level provider may prescribe eye patch relieve double
