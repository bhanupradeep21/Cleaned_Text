alopecia animals condition locations body surface typically covered hair contain areas hair absent condition affect animals besides alopecia condition affect wild organisms captive organisms however condition tends prominent captive development alopecia animals usually sign underlying animals may genetically predisposed hair loss may caused hypersensitivity nutritional factors include moluccan cockatoos spectacled bears hedgehogs raccoons squirrels baboons chimpanzees since share human genes others selectively bred baldness include rabbits guinea pigs syrian hamsters mice rats cats environmental enrichment used cases mitigate certain behaviours cause hair loss improve alopecia address welfare canine pinnal alopecia common dachshunds others chihuahuas boston terriers whippets italian greyhounds may also certain skin conditions animals also cause loss ferret adrenal disease extremely common common cause alopecia ferrets typically affecting middleaged specimens three seven

dermatophytic pseudomycetomas may alopecia areata studied mice horses human contact horse rubbing saddle across mane cause patches hair diet nutrition cause andor contribute alopecia animals wild captivity example lack sufficient ingestion protein diet group captive gorillas gabon caused various health issues including development ingestion plants present wild cause alopecia ingested large example presence mimosine amino acid leucaena leucocephala plants led alopecia ringtailed lemurs lemur catta consume plant endocrinological conditions including hyperadrenocorticism hyperthyroidism cause localized alopecia alopecia resulting hyperadrenocorticism common dogs presents often trunk region animals hyperthyroidism second condition cause alopecia contrast hyperadrenocorticism regions experiencing rubbing joints limbs tail tend affected regions presence parasitic load identified source alopecia wild captive organisms among organisms observed experiencing alopecia due ectoparasites wild ungulates moose moose certain regions europe including norway sweden experienced alopecia due high parasitic load lipoptena cervi also known deer high presence chewing lice indirectly led alopecia deer causing behavioural modifications host affected individuals experienced hair loss spent greater amounts time targeting affected areas parasiteinduced dermatological disease named sarcoptic mange occurs dogs infected mites sarcoptes scabiei var canis alopecia often among main symptoms experienced affected individuals alongside disease dogs contagious thus transmitted alopecia associated pregnancy various animals example nonhuman primates severe extensive alopecia observed pregnant rhesus macaques macaca birth postpartum related alopecia also documented factors associated captive environment influence presence andor extent alopecia animals example severity alopecia individuals tends greater primates inhabiting smaller exclusively interior alopecia associated enclosures animal density highest may cause stressinduced physiological behavioural changes lead hair type material used cover ground enclosure also mediated alopecia primates greater hair loss associated gravel surfaces primate social stress animals may increased result characteristics enclosures size density increase engagement among individuals stress lead hair loss two ways alopecia may occur either animals overgroom way reduce stress stress causes hair fall hairpulling identified cause alopecia defined context primates pulling fingers teeth tufts hair one partner coat manipulating chewing hair finally swallowing behaviour often referred different terms depending type organism displaying behaviour example behaviour known hairpulling nonhuman primates barbering mice feather picking captive animals primary performers hairpulling equivalent behaviours behaviour may directed towards body may occur social context hairpulling directed towards another individual overgrooming individuals spend time engaged self social grooming behaviours necessary another behavioural cause alopecia behaviour observed captive primates cases appears stem insufficient access adequate presence overgrooming animals often attributed stress occurs types organisms primates including severity alopecia differs across seasons animals example winter spring seasons associated severe alopecia rhesus substandard
