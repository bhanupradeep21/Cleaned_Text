neurodegenerative diseases disrupt normal human homeostasis result abnormal estrogen example neurodegenerative diseases cause different physiological effects males females particular estrogen studies revealed complex interactions neurodegenerative diseases estrogen initially proposed possible treatment certain types neurodegenerative diseases plethora harmful side effects increased susceptibility breast cancer coronary heart disease overshadowed beneficial outcomes hand estrogen replacement therapy shown positive effects postmenopausal women estrogen estrogenlike molecules form large family potentially beneficial alternatives dramatic effects human homeostasis disease subsequently largescale efforts initiated screen useful estrogen family molecules furthermore scientists discovered new ways synthesize estrogenlike compounds avoid many side effectscitation needed estrogen lipid hormone humans regulate many physiological largely related menstrual estrous biological function mediated binding two receptors estrogen receptor alpha erα estrogen receptor beta erβ two receptors tissue specific different influences downstream decrease estrogen levels lead osteoporosis cognitive disorders affect many important genes related normal physiological functioncitation needed estrogen divided four classes animal estrogens includes estrone estradiol estriol plant estrogens phytoestrogens fungi estrogens mycoestrogens synthetic estrogens xenoestrogens xenoestrogens contain large number compounds synthesized naturally exist estrogens imitate estrogen structure designed satisfy need new drugs may significant impact neurodegenerative disease treatment due ease synthesis targeted specificitycitation needed application estrogen medicine divided number aspects best known
