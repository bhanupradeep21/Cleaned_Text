behavioral cusp behavior change brings organisms behavior contact new contingencies farreaching behavioral cusp special type behavior change provides learner opportunities access new reinforcers new contingencies new environments new related behaviors competition archaic problem behaviors affects people around learner people agree behavior change support development intervention removed concept far reaching implications every individual field developmental psychology provides behavioral alternative concept maturation change due simple passage time developmental milestones cusp behavior change presents special features compared behavior changes concept first proposedwhen sidney w bijou american developmental idea cusp link behavioral principles rapid spurts development see behavior analysis child development behavioral cusp conceptualized jesus rosalesruiz donald baer important behavior change affects future behavior behavioral cusp like reinforcer apprehended effects whereas reinforcer acts single response group related responses effects behavioral cusp regulate large number responses distant future concept compared developmental milestone however cusps milestones example learning play soccer milestone lifechanging pelé result learning kick grapefruits initial important change cusp pelé accessed new environments new reinforcers new soccer moves dropped competing behaviors smoking gained international acclaims skill soccer developmental milestone necessary skill environments following properties special features behavioral change lead change increased likelihood social adaptation independence cultural fitness new reinforcers accessible enrich perspective learner additionally reinforcers may lead increase variety behaviors reinforcers promoting health social behaviors lead improved quality life child learns open door may access swing first time learns use new skill swinging motion reinforcer may lead complex social activities turn taking asking someone share swing taking turns pushing someone turn may provide social opportunities speak interact play partners etc child learns open door walks outside finds ants behind shrubbery watches ants parents looking get worried calling child unusually mesmerized columns ants ground hear calls parents find shortly frantic search accidentally scare going outside nonexample learning open doors lead outside resulted consequences directly benefit child maybe decrease important skills related exploration search case new reinforcers contacted learning open backyard door special latch effectively waste time childs parents dont usually approve alone backyard new contingencies responsible selection novel adaptive behaviors decreasing problematic archaic behaviors contingencies reinforcement r reinforcer produce maintain every learned behavior new contingencies establish control new stimuli behaviors therefore make us sensitive aware medical source new environments geographical andor virtual areas potential change receiving environments new environments regulate maintain set microcultural boundaries reinforcers punishers antecedents include tools stakeholders controlling pace content instruction result regulate boundary learner learns eg school curriculum new environments must contain stakeholders preferences reinforcers create lasting positive reinforcement practices learnercitation needed generativeness describes ability receiving environment regulate novel responses functions values response products derived original cusp response behavior ability recombine merge complex units ability contact child learns phonetic reading recombine english phonemes words recombining individual sounds learned read generative index act learning basic english phonemes approximately one new behavior results potential applications child learns sight reading words new word presented child learns listening teacher memorizes words rather using previously learned thus becoming able read words using method additionally dependent someone learning new vocabulary word behavior competition ability cusp behaviors displace previously established behaviors continuum intensity rate across repertoires environments competing archaic behaviors occur corresponding continuum severity effect others comes learners behavior affecting stakeholders control reinforcers punishers specific environment important identify stakeholders motivations reinforcers selecting potential cusps effect refers changes values behaviors stakeholder resulting cusp learner initial gradually complex behaviors constituted entry point important behavior change initiated profoundly alters displaces transforms ones behavioral repertoire renders preexisting behavioral repertoires obsolete behavioral cusp important behavior change alters probability learners future repertoires interactions stakeholders repertoires social validity indicator social acceptability behavior consequences stakeholders representing communities learner accessing seemingly insignificant changes stakeholder may dramatically affect learner stakeholders eg government officials teachers parents interventionists agree goals methods tools intervention norms local community suggest boundaries learned behavioral cusp implications selection sequencing skills life span milestones mainly concerned chronology behaviors concept behavioral cusp concerned fitness behavior within context receiving environment rosalesruiz baer stated one childs cusp may another childs waste time thus great need empiricallybased guidelines making decisions related initial selection skills applications concepts related prediction selection retention successful adaptive behaviors treatment childhood autism
