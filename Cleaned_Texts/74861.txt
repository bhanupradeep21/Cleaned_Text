pediatric gynaecology pediatric medical practice dealing health vagina vulva uterus ovaries infants children adolescents counterpart pediatric andrology deals medical issues specific penis testes word gynaecology comes greek γυνή gyne woman logia study assessment external genitalia breast development often part routine physical examinations physicians also advise pediatric gynecology patients anatomy sexuality assessment include examination vulva rarely involve introduction instruments vagina many young patients prefer parent usually mother examination room two main positions examination used depending patients preference specific examination performed including frogleg position head examination table raised lowered lithotomy position stirrups either parent holding child hand mirror provided allow child participate educate child anatomy anesthesia sedation used examination performed emergency situation otherwise recommended clinician see reluctant child gynecologic complaint several visits foster examination external genitalia done gently moving labia minora either side gently moving towards anterior front side body expose vaginal routine physical examinations pediatrician typically include visual examination breasts vulva extensive examinations may performed pediatrician response specific complaint rarely internal examination may necessary may need conducted anesthesia cases internal examination may necessary include vaginal bleeding retained foreign bodies potential number common pediatric gynecologic conditions complaints pathological benign pediatric gynecologist care children number intersex conditions including swyer syndrome amenorrhea lack menstrual period may indicate congenital anomaly reproductive tract typically obvious external visual examination childs vulva imperforate hymen presence hymen completely covers introitus anomalies cause amenorrhea include müllerian agenesis affecting uterus cervix andor vagina obstructed uterine horn ohvira syndrome presence transverse vaginal septum ohvira uterine horn obstruction also cause increasingly painful menstruation dysmenorrhea months following vaginal bleeding associated menarche may cause concern child first days life amount vaginal bleeding normal prompted drop transplacental hormones causes vaginal bleeding children include trauma condyloma acuminata lichen sclerosus vulvovaginitis tumors urethral prolapse precocious puberty exogenous hormone exposure retained foreign body causes diagnosed visual examination vulva careful medical history may require vaginoscopy speculum vulvovaginitis children may nonspecific caused irritation known infectious cause infectious caused pathogenic organism nonspecific vulvovaginitis may triggered fecal contamination sexual abuse chronic diseases foreign bodies nonestrogenized epithelium chemical irritants eczema seborrhea immunodeficiency treated topical steroids antibiotics may given cases itching resulted secondary infectious vulvovaginitis caused group betahemolytic streptococcus cases haemophilus influenzae streptococcus pneumoniae staphylococcus aureus shigella yersinia common sti organisms neisseria gonorrhoeae chlamydia trachomatis trichomonas vaginalis herpes simplex virus human papillomavirus symptoms treatment infectious vulvovaginitis vary depending organism causing shigella infections reproductive tract usually coexist infectious gastrointestinal tract cause mucous purulent discharge treated trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole streptococcus infections cause similar symptoms nonspecific vulvovaginitis treated amoxicillin stiassociated vulvovaginitis may caused sexual abuse vertical transmission treated diagnosed like adult vulvitis inflammation vulva variety etiologies children adolescents including allergic dermatitis contact dermatitis lichen sclerosus infections bacteria fungi parasites dermatitis infants commonly caused soiled diaper left extended period time increasing frequency diaper changes topical application emollients sufficient resolve cases dermatitis vulva older children usually caused exposure irritant eg scented products come contact vulva laundry detergent soaps etc treated preventing exposure encouraging sitz baths baking soda vulvar skin heals treatment options vulvar dermatitis include oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride topical lichen sclerosus another common cause vulvitis children often affects hourglass figure eightshaped area skin around anus vulva symptoms mild case include skin fissures loss skin pigment hypopigmentation skin atrophy parchmentlike texture skin dysuria itching discomfort excoriation severe cases vulva may become discolored developing dark purple bruising ecchymosis bleeding scarring attenuation labia minora fissures bleeding affecting posterior fourchette cause unknown likely genetic autoimmune unconnected malignancy children skin changes obvious visual inspection biopsy skin may performed acquire exact diagnosis treatment vulvar lichen sclerosis may consist topical hydrocortisone mild cases stronger topical steroids eg clobetasol propionate preliminary studies show cases resolve organisms responsible vulvitis children include pinworms enterobius vermicularis candida yeast group hemolytic streptococcus though pinworms mainly affect perianal area cause itching irritation vulva well pinworms treated albendazole vulvar candida infections uncommon children generally occur infants antibiotic therapy children diabetes immunodeficiency candida infections cause red raised vulvar rash satellite lesions clear borders diagnosed microscopically examining sample treated potassium hydroxide hyphae treated topical butoconazole clotrimazole miconazole streptococcus infections characterized dark red discoloration vulva introitus cause pain itching bleeding dysuria treated abnormal mass childs developing breast early development breast tissue may prompt concern neonates small breast buds birth white discharge witches milk caused exposure transplacental hormones utero phenomena pathological typically disappear first weeks months life accessory nipples polythelia occur children along embryonic milk line benign cases may removed surgically develop glandular tissue cause pain discharge develop asymmetric breast growth normal early adolescence asymmetry may caused trauma fibroadenoma cysts nonpathological asymmetry resolves spontaneously end puberty surgical intervention possible adolescents may develop tuberous breasts wherein normal fat glandular tissue grows directly away chest due adherence breast fascia underlying muscle hormone replacement therapy oral contraceptives used encourage outward growth breast base hypertrophy breast tissue may may problem individual adolescent back pain kyphosis shoulder pain psychologic distress may cause breast reduction surgery development complete opposite end spectrum breast tissue may develop variety reasons common cause low levels estrogen hypoestrogenism may result chronic disease radiation chemotherapy poland syndrome extreme physical activity gonadal dysgenesis amastia occurs child born without glandular breast tissue breast masses children adolescents benign include fibrocystic breast changes cysts fibroadenomas lymph nodes abscesses fibroadenomas make pediatric breast masses simply observed ensure stability excised symptomatic large andor mastitis infection breast tissue occurs commonly neonates children though rare overall children often caused aureus mastitis children caused variety factors including trauma nipple piercing lactation andor pregnancy shaving periareolar hair development abscesses mastitis common children precocious puberty occurs children younger experience changes indicative puberty including development breast buds thelarche pubic hair growth spurt thelarche considered abnormal though precocious puberty specific pathological cause may indicate serious medical problem thoroughly evaluated cases cause precocious puberty identified central precocious puberty true precocious puberty stems early activation hypothalamicpituitaryovarian axis occurs people caused lesion central nervous system apparent cause peripheral precocious puberty gnrh independent precocious puberty involve hypothalamicpituitaryovarian axis instead involves sources hormones causes peripheral precocious puberty include adrenal ovarian tumors congenital adrenal hyperplasia exogenous hormone premature development breast tissue necessarily indicative precocious puberty occurs without corresponding growth spurt normal bone age represent pubertal development associated low birthweight slightly elevated estradiol premature breast development regresses spontaneously monitoring signs precocious puberty usually necessary labial adhesion fusion labia minora may small posterior generally asymptomatic may involve entire labia seal vaginal introitus entirely generally treated causes urinary symptoms otherwise normally resolves vaginal mucosa becomes estrogenized onset puberty treatments include topical application estrogens betamethasone gentle traction labia followed vitamin vitamin andor petroleum jelly prevent readhesion labia may separated manually local anesthesia surgically general anesthesia procedure called introitoplasty topical treatment unsuccessful followed estrogen treatment prevent ovarian masses children typically cystic malignant ovarian cancers neonates ovaries cysts caused transplacental hormones utero postnatal spike gonadotropins neonatal ovarian cysts usually affect one ovary cause symptoms classed simple disappear age months rare cases neonatal ovarian cysts may result ovarian torsion autoamputation ovary intracystic hemorrhage rupture compression surrounding organs cysts smaller centimeters diameter may monitored ultrasonography larger cysts likely cause complications either drained percutaneous aspiration surgically older children cystic ovarian masses may cause visible change body shape chronic pain precocious puberty complications cysts cause acute severe abdominal pain transabdominal ultrasonography used diagnose image pediatric ovarian cysts transvaginal probes recommended use children complex cysts likely benign mature cystic teratoma whereas common malignancies age group malignant germ cell tumors epithelial ovarian common pediatric gynecologic complaints include vaginal discharge premenarche bleeding itching accounts sexual mass inguinal area may hernia may testis intersex vaginal mucosa prepubertal children markedly different postpubertal adolescents thin red neonates uterus spadeshaped contains fluid time often visible endometrial stripe normal due hormones passed neonate across placenta shape uterus influenced anteroposterior diameter cervix larger fundus age premenarchal age uterus tubular fundus cervix diameter ovaries small neonates grow throughout childhood volume cubic centimeters vaginoscopy prepubertal cervix usually level proximal puberty vaginal mucosa becomes estrogenized becomes dull pink color gains secondary sex characteristics develop influence estrogen hypothalamicpituitarygonadal axis typically ages characteristics include breast buds pubic hair accelerated growth higher body mass index correlated earlier
