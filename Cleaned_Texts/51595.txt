zoology palynivore pəˈlɪnəvɔːɹ meaning pollen eater greek παλύνω palunō strew sprinkle latin vorare meaning devour herbivorous animal selectively eats nutrientrich pollen produced angiosperms true palynivores insects mites category strictest application includes bees kinds pollen often solid food consumed life stages insects however category extended include diverse species example palynivorous mites thrips typically feed liquid content pollen grains without actually consuming exine solid portion grain additionally list expanded greatly one takes consideration species either larval adult stage feeds pollen wasps category well many flies butterflies moths one example bee species consumes pollen larval stage apis mellifera vast array insects feed opportunistically pollen various birds orbweaving nectarivores pollen essential component palynivore diet male formed anther male part flower pollen needed fertilize female part flower gynoecium long history consumption various species evidence suggests palynivory dates back least permian likely coevolution occurred plants palynivores form mutualism process two species individually benefit activity example palynivores benefit receiving nutrients pollen thus structure palynivore eye evolved better interpret visual cues given pollen pollen benefits animalplant interaction spread animal carries flower flower furthering reproductive success respective flower thus pollen evolved visually appealing palynivores changed surface texture readily recognized palynivores tactile sensory earliest evidence palynivory traced back silurian million years ago mya mya early devonian mya mya fossil evidence periods suggests early arthropods unspecialized mandibular mouthparts engaged sporefeeding unlike pollen solely produced flowering plants spores asexual reproductive particles produced primitive organisms ferns fungi bacteria palynivory thought derived early sporefeeders emerged much later pennsylvanian era mya much evidence relating palynivory evolution linked change structure mandibular mouthparts allowing easier pollen evidence found coleoptera beetles diverse group palynivores wherein species developed mouthparts pollen collection addition evolution early mandibular appendages specialized structures assisting pollen furthermore modernday palynivore mouthpart adaptations also tied evolution ancient palynivore mouthparts involved nectar beginnings structures involved nectar uptake found early unrelated insect evolution structures occurred three distinct tracks spongelike labellum flies caddisflies siphon structures butterflies moths glossa wasps within track specialization structures occurred example wasps bees eight variations mouthpart structures incorporating glossa evolution various structural morphological adaptations presentday palynivores also thought coevolved pollen abundance diversity seedbearing plant fossils identified late pennsylvanian suggest greater palynivore evolution adaptations evolving plant fauna furthermore highlights coevolution behavior plant species based morphological features fossil remnants era early palynivores hypothesized belonged diaphanopterodean protorthopteran hemipteroid taxonomic following period evolution specialized adaptations palynivore mouthparts pollen prepollen found gut fossilized insects showed convergence three major lineages orthoptera grasshoppers crickets locusts coleoptera diptera flies hymenoptera wasps sawflies bees currently almost palynivores five insect orders believed come early mesozoic period mya mya coleoptera diptera thysanoptera thrips hymenoptera lepidoptera butterflies numerous species insects bees wasps ants beetles flies butterflies moths mites spiders birds consume pollen food source efficiently collect pollen palynivores evolved various adaptations body parts behavior adaptations include specialized mouthparts hair digestive systems patterns reproduction foraging although palynivores eat pollen varying degrees ways consequently adaptations also differ bees ants example insects place different amounts emphasis pollen diets bees part superfamily apoidea engage palynivory extensively especially providing pollen effectively collect transport consume pollen bees evolved specialized morphological behavioral traits forage pollen bees must first find sources pollen chemical visual tactile signals given coevolved adaptations purpose since flowering plants benefit pollination occurs bees collect transport visual signals especially help guide bees flowers sight adaptations ability see ultraviolet light bees hone color pattern targets flower petals guide bees nectar gather store pollen together nectar specialized hairs evolved scopal corbicular constructions bees also evolved behavioral adaptations involve degree bees also either oligolectic polylectic target specific general groups flowering plants respectively foraging patterns overlap significantly closely day andor seasonally bloom periods targeted nest bees also communicate locations good foraging patches worker bees process called waggle bees often favor certain foraging evidence shows bumblebees instance flexible foraging patterns deciding different types flowers based pollens proteinlipid patterns directly influence genetics flowering plant populations around ants part order hymenoptera related bees similarly forage outside nests transport protein back pollen sole primary food source evidence studies done ants species genera zacryptocerus cephalotes turtle ants camponotus carpenter ants crematogaster acrobat ants odontomachus trapjaw ants show pollen targeted consumption eaten foraging ants fly flowers take pollen instead collect places pollen fallen wind carried pollen ants commonly store liquid food foregut later regurgitate feed offspring home several species neotropical ants turtle ants example collect pollen leaves store bodies later process produce compressed masses pollen called pellets infrabuccal pellets turtle ants allow greater efficiency transporting ant offspring worker ants consume nutrientrich parts pollen pellets membranes pollen unable digested palynivores essential spreading genes flowering plants via use pollen vector genetic diversity plants wind natural resources help process spreading pollen specific provide direct service palynivores
