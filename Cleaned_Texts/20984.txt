senile pruritus one common conditions elderly people years age emerging itch may accompanied changes temperature textural elderly xerosis common cause itch due degradation skin barrier however cause senile pruritus clearly diagnosis based elimination criteria full body examination done either dermatologist nondermatologist type itch one six different ifsi international forum study itch created another classification process pruritus senile three groups within classification first pruritus diseased skin second nondiseased skin pruritus third secondary skin scratch secondary scratch lesions include abrasions pimples bumps crusts lesions caused irritating skin pinching rubbing scratching cause often appears group two group three patients patients fall category two three often pruritus associated classifications listed risk factors senile pruritus may itch caused various reasons cause senile pruritus clearly known type itch elderly patients may result reasons identifying cause

induce pruritus manifest without skin rash happen immediately even months drug used patient neurological disorders postherpetic neuralgia brachioradial pruritus notalgia paraesthetica also lead senile pruritus burning stinging scratching andor psychiatric disorders schizophrenia somatoform disorders dissociative disorders hallucinations delusional parasitosis cause severe lesions burning stinging well sensations bugs crawling skin entire common pathways development senile pruritus may include elderly xerosis common cause itch due degradation skin barrier skin barrier critical protecting body external pathogens maintaining body temperature well homeostatic baseline functions time skin ages permeability barrier function begins decline leading dry skin reduced structural protein levels lipids well critical enzymes contribute strong epidermalskin barrier seen overtime compared young skin surface ph changes also lead chronic itch many properties needed functional barrier must reside acidic ph however aged skin tends accompanied basic increase ph disruptions ph gradient induce itch signaling contribute overall decline barrier intrinsic alterations leads aged skin risk irritant exposure ultimately vulnerable barrier increases risk developing pruritus skin diseases another cause senile pruritus may include neurological changes body ages itch triggered peripheral central nervous system response complex circuit neurons specifically c fibres aÎ´ fibres responsible itch response seen inhibited higher rates addition neurological inhibition skin hydration effect nervous system circuit skin moisture keeps barrier function intact reductions lead decrease itch threshold needed immunosenescence occurs time immune system undergoes changes may impact innate adaptive immune alterations may lead increased immunoreactivity intrinsic extrinsic stimuli cause body become sensitive reactive may result form itch exposed stimuli body reactive past immune system responsible myriad activities defend body foreign substances via various endogenous exogenous pathways within lymphatic system thymus gland produces cells aid immune system recognize attack potential harmful stimuli case aging population thymus gland undergoes physical chemical conformational changes reduce organs size therefore impacting function produce impairment may lead decreased cells responsible antibody response encountering allergens bacteria toxins irritants may lead increase autoreactivitycausing senile senile pruritus caused dry skin common skin become dry back legs arms scalp genitalia areas body commonly affected senile according study people experience pruritus daily increased itching sensations associated symptoms night studies reveal senile pruritus common men common symptoms senile pruritus relationship senile pruritus seasonal weather changes studied results inconsistent studies reveal senile pruritus prevalent winter fall seasons studies correlation found typically senile pruritus diagnosed following exclusion process starting complete physical exam person exhibiting signs symptoms senile pruritus laboratory exam may recommended doctor initial doctors visit unless indicators underlying disease treated xerosis tested scabies senile pruritus persists screening underlying systemic disease treatment usually consists common remedies agerelated xerosis however repeated diagnosis requires evaluation taking account persons laboratory measurements medical medical history typically taken describing severity pruritus scale itchiness unbearable itchiness location medication use also documented narrow cause pruritus complete treatment eradicate chronic itch due uncertainty cause treatment moreso palliative management topical treatments may used reduce inflammation painful itchy sensation flareups locally site skin topical treatments typically safe geriatric topical treatments may include medication benefits risks systemic treatments reviewed elderly people suffering pruritus due various reasons like underlying first generation antihistamines useful due sedating qualities treating pruritus second generation antihistamines used treat allergies help reduce inflammation treating pruritus compared first generation antihistamines second generation antihistamines typically nonsedating however may used elderly people anticholinergic effects like constipation dry mouth common antihistamine medications may include immunosuppressants seen use low doses alongside systemic steroids phototherapy chronic symptoms senile pruritus dermatitis senile pruritus could connections loss tolerance antigens skin result aging skin potentially lead autoimmune disorders like bullous immunosuppressive medications may include anticonvulsants also found use substitute oral antihistamines treat senile pruritus adjusted accordingly individual needs antidepressants opioid agonistsantagonists also drug classes may help dampen itch response people opioid antagonists shown effective relieving pruritus well due antagonizing effects receptors within central nervous system psychotropic agents work similar antihistamines use topical salicylic acids cannabinoids used pruritus well though pathway clearly known need studies shown safe viable removing avoiding certain stimuli surroundings could potentially induce exacerbate itch shown includes avoid wearing clothing wool nylon latex synthetic materials bathing warmer water inhibit itch sensory fibers noninvasive brain stimulation often used treat neuropsychiatric conditions shown successful repressing itch device works sending electrical currents redirect signaling cascade fired peripheral central nervous systems phototherapy considered guidance dermatologist uv light phototherapy used treat various pruritic symptoms pruritus resulting renal disease eczema unknown usually used temporary symptom relief may decrease severity itchiness cooling agents work emollient replacements dry aged skin tend lack skins natural emollients cooling agents like ureabased formulations help attract water skin restoring skins hydration using refrigerated topical products may also option additive cooling effects bathing minutes warm bath followed applying mixture topical steroid heavy moisturizer aquaphor eucerin etc may improve moisture retention skin helps symptom wrapping done onto wet skin maintain effectiveness treatment certain materials promote pruritus avoided minimizes itchiness reaction may helpful decrease contact wool synthetic material soapfree substitutes available avoid soaprelated irritations skin avoiding overuse heating winter humidifier increase humidity allowing skin less dry cold dry seasons shorter fingernails also help minimize scratching reducing chances bacterial severe untreated chronic itch lead skin diseases andor progress skin damage left untreated itching may become intense causing people scratch behavioral coping mechanism recurrent scratching especially area lead skin thickening may prevent medications effectively working treat chronic itch senile pruritus significant impact quality life elderly people condition may feel anxious stressed due physical disposition urge itch may feel severe could affect ability sleep challenges come approaching treatment senile pruritus number potential underlying causes physicians narrow along potential
