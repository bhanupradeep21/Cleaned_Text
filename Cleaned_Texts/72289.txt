virtual reality sickness vr sickness occurs exposure virtual environment causes symptoms similar motion sickness common symptoms general discomfort eye strain headache stomach awareness nausea vomiting pallor sweating fatigue drowsiness disorientation symptoms include postural instability common causes low frame rate input lag virtual reality sickness different motion sickness caused visuallyinduced perception selfmotion real selfmotion also different simulator sickness nonvirtual reality simulator sickness tends characterized oculomotor disturbances whereas virtual reality sickness tends characterized virtual reality sickness may undesirable consequences beyond sickness example crowley argued flight simulator sickness could discourage pilots using flight simulators reduce efficiency training distraction encouragement adaptive behaviors unfavorable performance compromise ground safety flight safety sick disoriented pilots leave similar consequences could expected virtual reality systems although evidence performance decrements due virtual reality sickness research suggest virtual reality sickness major barrier using virtual indicating virtual reality sickness may barrier effective use training tools rehabilitation tools virtual reality estimates multistudy incidence main symptoms virtual reality sickness also called cybersickness virtual reality sickness closely related simulator motion sickness sensory conflict theory provides framework understanding motion sickness however applied virtual reality sickness better understand commonly used sensory conflict theory posits sickness occur users perception selfmotion based incongruent sensory inputs visual system vestibular system nonvestibular proprioceptors particularly inputs odds users expectation based prior applying theory virtual reality sickness minimized sensory inputs inducing selfmotion agreement one anothercitation needed major trigger virtual reality sickness disparity apparent motion visual vestibular stimuli disparity occurs disagreement stimuli eyes inner ear sending brain fundamental cause simulator motion sickness well virtual reality eyes transmit person running jumping dimension however ears transmit movement occurring body sitting still since discord eyes ears form motion sickness occur images projected typical virtual reality headsets major impact sickness refresh rate onscreen images often high enough vr sickness refresh rate slower brain processes causes disconnect processing rate refresh rate causes user perceive glitches screen two components match cause user experience feelings simulator motion sickness mentioned resolution animation also cause users experience phenomenon animations poor causes another type discord expected actually happening screen onscreen graphics keep pace users head movements trigger form motion sickness scientists agree sensory conflict second theory motion sickness also used explain virtual reality sickness theory postural theory holds motion sickness related sicknesses occur poor postural adaptations response unusual coupling visual stimuli motor coordination characteristic markers postural instability occur prior appearance symptoms predict later development theory explain otherwise surprising situations motion sickness occur presence sensory various technical aspects virtual reality induce mismatched field motion viewing additionally amount time spent virtual reality increase presence mismatched motion defined discrepancy motion simulation motion user possible induce motion sickness virtual reality frequencies mismatched motion similar motion sickness reality frequencies experimentally manipulated also propensity arise system errors generally increasing field view increases incidence simulator sickness symptoms relationship shown curvilinear symptoms approaching asymptote fields view altering motion parallax distances less distance human eyes large multiplescreen simulation setups induce oculomotor distress headaches eyestrain blurred fewer reports oculomotor distress smaller screens however simulation setups motion parallax effects still induce eyestrain fatigue general discomfort timecitation needed viewing angle shown increase users sickness symptoms especially extreme one example extreme angle would user must look downwards short distance front virtual feet opposed forward viewing angle extreme downward angle shown markedly increase sickness virtual time spent immersed virtual environment contributes sickness symptom presence due increasing effects fatigue oculomotor symptoms common occur due immersion time nature users movements eg wholebody vs headonly suggested primary cause nausea physical according several studies introducing static frame reference independent visual background may reduce simulation technique called nasum virtualis shows virtual nose fixed frame reference vr techniques reducing nausea involve simulating ways displacement dont create reduce discrepancies visual aspects body movement reducing rotational motions dynamically reducing field movement zero january french startup boarding ring known glasses motion released addon device virtual reality using two small screens users peripheral field view device displays visual information consistent vestibular inputs avoiding sensory conflict galvanic vestibular stimulation creates illusion motion electric stimulation vestibular system another technique explored potential mitigate eliminate visualvestibular integration virtual reality commercial mainstream issues begun arise relation vr sickness headmounted gaming research headmounted vr gaming dates back early potential mass usability become recently realized contemporary vr headsets appear induce minimal none vr certain features known moderate vr sickness headmounted displays playing seated position rather also found merely puts onset sickness rather completely preventing inherently presents issue type interactive vr often involves standing walking fully immersive gaming vr specialists argue unique brand vr sickness minor issue claiming disappears time spent multiple days using headmounted displays relating getting sea however getting users interested sickness multiple days promise probably getting struggle developers headmounted gaming tech surveys shown large percentage people wont develop vr legs particular developers also argue individual game played certain gaming aspects likely create issues change speed walking stairs unfortunately fairly normal
