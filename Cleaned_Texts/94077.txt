evolutionary biology reciprocal altruism behaviour whereby organism acts manner temporarily reduces fitness increasing another organisms fitness expectation organism act similar manner later time concept initially developed robert trivers explain evolution cooperation instances mutually altruistic acts concept close strategy tit tat used game theory trivers told symposium reciprocity originally submitted article title evolution delayed return altruism reviewer w hamilton suggested change title evolution reciprocal altruism trivers changed title examples manuscript led confusion appropriate examples reciprocal altruism last years contribution symposium rothstein pierotti addressed issue proposed new definitions concerning topic altruism clarified issue created trivers hamilton proposed delayed return altruism superior concept used term pseudoreciprocity place dra reason paper rothstein pierotti catch hold remains one best examinations relationship altruism kin selection rothstein pierotti also explain trivers examples reciprocal altruism actually examples delayed return altruism concept reciprocal altruism introduced trivers suggests altruism defined act helping another individual incurring cost act could evolved since might beneficial incur cost chance reverse situation individual helped may perform altruistic act towards individual helped concept finds roots work wd hamilton developed mathematical models predicting likelihood altruistic act performed behalf ones putting form strategy repeated prisoners dilemma would mean cooperate unconditionally first period behave cooperatively altruistically long agent chances meeting another reciprocal altruist high enough game repeated long enough amount time form altruism evolve within population close notion tit tat introduced anatol although still seems slight distinction tit tat cooperates first period thereon always replicates opponents previous action whereas reciprocal altruists stop cooperation first instance noncooperation opponent stay noncooperative thereon distinction leads fact contrast reciprocal altruism tit tat may able restore cooperation certain conditions despite cooperation broken christopher stephens shows set necessary jointly sufficient conditions instance reciprocal two additional conditions necessary reciprocal altruism first two conditions necessary altruism third distinguishing reciprocal altruism simple mutualism fourth makes interaction reciprocal condition number five required otherwise nonaltruists may always exploit altruistic behaviour without consequences therefore evolution reciprocal altruism would possible however pointed conditioning device need conscious condition number six required avoid cooperation breakdown backwards possibility suggested game theoretical following examples could understood altruism however showing reciprocal altruism unambiguous way requires evidence shown later example reciprocal altruism cleaning symbiosis cleaner fish hosts though cleaners include shrimps birds clients include fish turtles octopuses aside apparent symbiosis cleaner host actual cleaning interpreted altruism host displays additional behaviour meets criteria delayed return altruism host fish allows cleaner fish free entrance exit eat cleaner even cleaning host signals cleaner depart cleaners locality even cleaner body host sometimes chases possible dangers following evidence supports hypothesis cleaning cleaners essential host absence cleaners hosts leave locality suffer injuries inflicted difficulty danger finding cleaner hosts leave element get others wait longer seconds searching cleaners key requirement establishment reciprocal altruism two individuals must interact repeatedly otherwise best strategy host would eat cleaner soon cleaning complete constraint imposes spatial temporal condition cleaner host individuals must remain physical location must long enough lifespan enable multiple interactions reliable evidence individual cleaners hosts indeed interact example meets criteria described triverss model cleanerhost system benefit cleaner always immediate however evolution reciprocal altruism contingent opportunities future rewards repeated interactions one study nearby host fish observed cheater cleaners subsequently avoided examples true reciprocity difficult demonstrate since failure means death cleaner however randalls claim hosts sometimes chase possible dangers cleaner correct experiment might constructed reciprocity could actuality one trivers examples delayed return altruism discussed rothstein pierotti warning calls although exposing bird putting danger frequently given birds explanation terms altruistic behaviors given shown predators learn specific localities specialize individually prey types hunting therefore disadvantageous bird predator eat conspecific experienced predator may likely eat alarming another bird giving warning call tends prevent predators specializing callers species locality way birds areas warning calls given selective advantage relative birds areas free warning calls nevertheless presentation lacks important elements reciprocity hard detect ostracize cheaters evidence bird refrains giving calls another bird reciprocating evidence individuals interact repeatedly given aforementioned characteristics bird calling continuous bird emigration immigration environment true many avian species likely partial cheaters since selection selfish another explanation warning calls warning calls bird detected bird prey calls signal bird prey detected use trying attack calling bird two facts support hypothesis redwinged blackbird males help defend neighbors nests many theories males behave way one males defend nests contain extrapair offspring extrapair offspring juveniles may contain male birds dna another titfortat strategy reciprocal altruism third theory males help closely related males study done department fisheries wildlife provided evidence males used titfortat strategy department fisheries wildlife tested many different nests placing stuffed crows nests observing behavior neighboring males behaviors looked included number calls dives strikes analyzing results significance evidence kin selection presence extrapair offspring affect probability help nest defense however males reduced amount defense given neighbors neighbor males reduced defense nests demonstrates titfortat strategy animals help previously helped strategy one type reciprocal vampire bats also display reciprocal altruism described bats feed regurgitating blood since bats feed blood die hours eating food sharing great benefit receiver great cost qualify reciprocal altruism benefit receiver would larger cost donor seems hold bats usually die find blood meal two nights row also requirement individuals behaved altruistically past helped others future confirmed however consistency reciprocal behaviour namely previously nonaltruistic bat refused help requires demonstrated therefore bats seem qualify yet unequivocal example reciprocal altruism grooming primates meets conditions reciprocal altruism according studies one studies vervet monkeys shows among unrelated individuals grooming induce higher chance attending others calls however vervet monkeys also display grooming behaviors within group members displaying would demonstrate vervet monkeys grooming behavior part kin selection since activity done siblings study moreover following criteria study example reciprocal altruism must prove mechanism detecting cheaters numerous species bacteria engage reciprocal altruistic behaviors species typically takes form bacteria providing essential nutrients another species species provides environment bacteria live reciprocal altruism exhibited nitrogenfixing bacteria plants reside additionally observed bacteria species flies bactrocera tryoni flies consume nutrientproducing bacteria found leaves plants exchange reside within flies digestive reciprocal altruistic behavior exploited techniques designed eliminate b tryoni fruit fly pests native comparison animals human altruistic system sensitive unstable therefore tendency give cheat response others acts giving cheating must regulated complex psychology individual social structures cultural traditions individuals differ degree tendencies responses according trivers following emotional dispositions evolution understood terms regulation known individuals pick partners little research choice modeling indicates altruism partner choices unlikely evolve costs benefits multiple individuals therefore time frequency reciprocal actions contributes individuals choice partner reciprocal act
