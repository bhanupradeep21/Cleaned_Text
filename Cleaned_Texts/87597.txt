temperament questionnaire scales jerome kagan colleagues concentrated empirical research temperamental category termed reactivity fourmonthold infants became motorically aroused distressed presentations novel stimuli termed highly reactive remained motorically relaxed cry fret set unfamiliar events termed low high low reactive infants tested months variety unfamiliar laboratory situations highly reactive infants predominantly characterized profile high fear unfamiliar events kagan termed inhibited contrastingly low reactive children minimally fearful novel situations characterized uninhibited profile kagan however observed age modest proportion children maintained expected profile due mediating factors intervening family experiences remained highly inhibited uninhibited age higher risk developing anxiety conduct disorders kagan also used two additional classifications one infants inactive cried frequently distressed one showed vigorous activity little crying aroused followed age years groups children showed differing outcomes including differences central nervous system activity teenagers classed high reactives babies likely subdued unfamiliar

reaction adaptability intensity emotion mood distractibility persistence attention span sensory sensitivity redundancies categories found reduced list normally used psychologists research thomas chess used following nine temperament traits based classification scheme developed dr herbert thomas chess birch hertzig korn found many babies could categorized one three groups easy difficult slowtowarmup thomas chess children placed one groups approximately children fit one patterns fit easy pattern fell difficult pattern slow warm category strength weakness one superior thomas chess birch hertzig korn showed easy babies readily adapt new experiences generally display positive moods emotions also normal eating sleeping patterns difficult babies tend emotional irritable fussy cry lot also tend irregular eating sleeping patterns slowtowarmup babies low activity level tend withdraw new situations people slow adapt new experiences accept repeated exposure thomas chess birch hertzig korn found broad patterns temperamental qualities remarkably stable childhood traits also found children across cultures thomas chess also studied temperament environment one sample consisted white middleclass families high educational status puerto rican workingclass families found several differences among observed traits mary k rothbart views temperament individual personality differences infants young children present prior development higher cognitive social aspects rothbart defines temperament individual differences reactivity selfregulation manifest domains emotion activity attention moving away classifying infants categories mary rothbart identified three underlying dimensions using factor analysis data children three broad factors emerged labeled surgencyextraversion negative affect effortful surgencyextraversion includes positive anticipation impulsivity increased levels activity desire sensation factor reflects degree child generally happy active enjoys vocalizing seeking increased levels smiling laughter observed babies high higher levels surgencyextraversion likely develop externalizing problems like acting however less likely develop internalizing problems shyness low negative affect includes fear frustration sadness factor reflects degree child shy easily anger frustration seen early months age anger frustration together predict externalizing internalizing difficulties anger alone later related externalizing problems fear associated internalizing difficulties fear evidenced behavioral inhibition seen early months age later predicts childrens fearfulness lower levels effortful control includes focusing shifting attention inhibitory control perceptual sensitivity low threshold factor reflects degree child focus attention easily restrain dominant response order execute nondominant response employ planning high effortful control six sevenyearolds tend empathetic lower higher levels effortful control age seven also predict lower externalizing problems age children high negative affect show decreased internalizing externalizing problems also high effortful rothbart suggests effortful control dependent development executive attention skills early years turn executive attention skills allows greater selfcontrol reactive tendencies effortful control shows stability infancy school also predicts solomon diamond described temperaments based

several psychiatrists differential psychologists suggested temperament mental illness represent varying degrees along continuum neurotransmitter imbalances neurophysiological systems behavioral fact original four types temperament choleric melancholic phlegmatic sanguine suggested hippocrates galen resemble mild forms types psychiatric disorders described modern classifications moreover hippocratesgalen hypothesis chemical imbalances factors consistent individual differences also validated research neurochemistry psychopharmacology though modern studies attribute different compounds many studies examined relationships temperament traits impulsivity sensation seeking neuroticism endurance plasticity sociability extraversion various neurotransmitter hormonal systems ie systems implicated mental disorders even though temperament psychiatric disorders presented correspondingly weak strong imbalances within regulatory systems incorrect say temperament weak degree disorders temperament might disposition develop mental disorder treated guaranteed marker disorders experts agree temperament genetic biological basis although environmental factors maturation modify ways childs personality term goodness fit refers match mismatch temperament personal characteristics specific features environment differences temperament behavior styles individuals important family life affect interactions among family members children adapt quickly easily family routines get along siblings others active intense may difficult time adjusting interactions children parents siblings among number factors lead stress friction within family temperament mix parents children also affects family life example slowpaced parent may irritated highly active child parent child highly active intense conflict could result knowledge help parents figure temperaments affect family relationships may appear behavioral problem may actually mismatch parents temperament childs taking closer look nine traits thomas chess revealed study parents gain better understanding childs temperament parents may also notice situational factors cause childs temperament seem problematic example child low rhythmicity cause difficulties family highly scheduled life child high activity level may difficult cope family lives crowded apartment upstairs sensitive neighbors parents encourage new behaviors children enough support slowtowarmup child become less shy difficult baby become easier handle recently infants children temperament issues called spirited avoid negative connotations difficult slow warm numerous books written advising parents raise spirited youngsters understanding childs temperament help reframe parents interpret childrens behavior way parents think reasons behaviors parents access knowledge helps guide child ways respect childs individual differences understanding childrens temperaments helps adults work rather try change opportunity anticipate understand childs reaction also important know temperament excuse childs unacceptable behavior provide direction parents respond making small reasonable accommodations routines reduce tension example child slowpaced mornings may need extra halfhour get ready knowing may affect childs behavior help alleviate potential problems although children obtain temperament behaviors innately large part helps determine childs ability develop act certain ways determined parents parent takes time identify importantly respond temperaments faced positive way help guide child trying figure world recognizing childs temperament helping understand impacts hisher life well others important important parents recognize temperaments recognizing individuals temperament help prevent manage problems may arise differences among family
