neonatal hypoglycemia occurs neonates blood glucose level less newborns body requirements factors cellular energy inconsistency internationally diagnostic thresholds us hypoglycemia blood glucose level mgdl within first hours life mgdl uk however lower variable thresholds used mgdl time baby abnormal clinical signs single value mgdl baby risk impaired metabolic adaptation without abnormal clinical signs measurement mgdl remaining mgdl next neonates gestational age birth weight metabolic needs wellness state newborn substantial impact neonates blood glucose known risk factors maternal treatable treatment depends cause hypoglycemia though treatable fatal gone hypoglycemia common metabolic problem neonatal hypoglycemia occurs births every births hard quantify internationally due lack consensus diagnostic thresholds often occurs premature babies small fullterm babies babies diabetic mothers common neonatal hypoxic asphyxia sclerosis infected sepsis severe hypoglycaemia persistent repeated episodes cause damage central nervous system neonatal hypoglycaemia standalone condition clinical manifestation conditions way neonatal hypoglycemia symptoms may presented vague hard tell apart conditions symptoms confused neonatal hypoglycemia also show symptoms newborns may observed symptoms symptoms may transient reoccurring risk factors mother increased risk developing hypoglycemia shortly birth include babies increased risk developing hypoglycemia shortly birth common cause neonatal hypoglycemia hyperinsulinism also called persistent hyperinsulemic hypoglycemia infancy seen frequently neonates born mothers congenital hyperinsulinism correlated abnormality betacell regulation within isolated islet adenoma focal disease often cause congenital druginduced hyperinsulisim correlated administration insulin use hypoglycemic critical cases drug called diazoxide availed stop secretion limited glycogen storage occurs premature newborns newborns intrauterine growth major causes increased glucose use newborn include hyperthermia polycythemia sepsis growth hormone two major issues cause decreased gluconogeneis inborn errors metabolism adrenal common causes depleted glycogen stores starvation asphyxiaperinatal many types hypoglycemia including transient associated different risk may many underlying causes neonatal hypoglycemia occurs infants brain dependent healthy supply last trimester pregnancy glucose stored liver heart skeletal newborns experience physiological transient fall blood glucose reaching nadir hours age slowly rising next hours newborns ability use alternative form energy especially however newborns able compensate glucose deficiency certain limit infants hyperinsulinism may increase risk develop conditions increase risk infant becoming hypoglycemic see screening hypoglycemia done every neonate admission usa recommended practice developed countries one way screening includes heel stick test blood glucose level diagnosing hypoglycemia neonates requires two consecutive blood glucose readings less mgdl properly diagnose bedside glucose monitoring effective equipment accurate rapid form testing often faster cost laboratory serum glucose testing accurate way testing blood glucose specimens either taken heel arterial venous punctures must store immediately ice order prevent glycolysis altering usa guidelines recommended hypoglycemic neonate glucose test every hours first hours guidelines uk however recommend prefeed screening atrisk infants hours age avoid false positives blood glucose ordinarily lowest hours age subsequent feed blood glucose level mmoll mgdl least two consecutive occasions feeding wellcitation needed medical history maternal diabetes mellitus gestational hypertension neonatal erythrocytosis neonatal haemolysis incompatible blood groups perinatal asphyxia severe infection sclerosis neonatal respiratory distress syndrome etc especially premature babies babies younger gestational age underfed early stages life risk neonatal hypoglycaemia clinical manifestations neonatal hypoglycemia considered atypical clinical manifestations symptoms improve glucose infusion neurological symptoms signs easily explained blood glucose measurement postnatal glucose monitoring main method early detection neonatal hypoglycaemia particular children risk neonatal hypoglycaemia blood glucose monitored within one hour birthcitation needed infants treated dextrose form sugar gel applied directly infants two main ways neonatal hypoglycemia first way includes intravenous infusion less severe borderline asymptomatic hypoglycemic neonates early introduction breast milk effective raising glucose levels healthy infant risk hypoglycemia blood sugar taken one hour oral glucose another option restore normal glucose levels newborn difficulty latching breast breastfeeding option however breast milk proven better source includes glucose recommended american academy pediatrics infants feed within first hour life glucose reading minutes feeding accurate initial feeding raise newborns blood glucose mgdl newborn must receive iv infusion dextrose water mini bolus mlkg following mini bolus continuous infusion dextrose water mlkgday order maintain healthy serum glucose level maintaining newborn thermoregulation large part preventing hypoglycemia biggest nursing concern neonate experiencing hypoglycemia physical assessment potentially find also essential prevent environmental factors cold stress may predispose newborn decreasing blood within physical assessment comorbidities hypoglycemia also assessed intolerance feeding respiratory another important nursing intervention assisting mother successful breastfeeding prevent treat iv infusion dextrose water initiated nurse must monitor infants experienced hypoglycemic episodes requiring treatment within first days life higher chance developing neurological neurodevelopmental diagnoses normoglycemic severity effects resulting hypoglycemic episode depend length hypoglycemic episode low neonates blood glucose levels drop glucose essential nutrient brain untreated neonatal hypoglycemia causes irreversible damage posterior occipital cortex regions areas function cognition adaptability visual long term complications neonatal hypoglycemia may include continuous glucose monitoring devices
