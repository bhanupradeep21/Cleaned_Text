placement eutretauranosuchus remains ambiguous phylogenetic analysis smith et al provides evidence eutretauranosuchus calsoyasuchus sunosuchus closely related findings widely supported however many publications support phylogenetic placement eutretauranosuchus within family goniopholididae debate whether closely related goniopholis sunosuchus alternatively phylogenetic assessment jr foster
