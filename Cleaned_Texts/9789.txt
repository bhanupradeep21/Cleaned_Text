opioid overdose toxicity due excessive consumption opioids morphine codeine heroin fentanyl tramadol preventable pathology fatal leads respiratory depression lethal condition cause hypoxia slow shallow symptoms include small pupils exception pethidine may dilated pupils unconsciousness however onset depend method ingestion dosage individual risk although deaths due opioids individuals survived also faced adverse complications including permanent brain opioid overdoses diagnosed based symptoms risk factors opioid overdose include high levels opioid dependence use opioids via injection high dosed opioid usage mental disorder predisposition one use opioids combination substances alcohol benzodiazepines dependence prescription opioids occur use treat chronic pain additionally following period detoxification allows tolerance level fall risk overdose upon return use initial treatment overdose involves supporting persons breathing providing oxygen reduce risk naloxone recommended reverse opioids effects giving naloxone via nasal administration injection muscle shown equally efforts prevent deaths overdose include increasing access naloxone treatment opioid drug use contributes deaths worldwide opioid overdose resulting approximately deaths deaths approximately million people engaged drug usage least million used drug use disorders affected around million people worldwide estimates deaths due drug use relation opioids due believed opioid epidemic partly caused due assurances prescription opioids safe pharmaceutical industry led unwarranted trust subsequent heavy reliance though treatment interventions effectively reduce risk overdose people opioid dependence less affected individuals receive opiate overdose symptoms signs referred opioid toxidrome triad decreased level consciousness pinpoint pupils respiratory depression symptoms include seizures muscle spasms sometimes opiate overdose lead decreased level consciousness person wake effect part brain regulates breathing opioids cause slow stopped breathing overdoses leading death left hypoxia typically caused respiratory brain uses oxygen regulate homeostasis body animal studies found opioids act specific regions central nervous system associated respiratory regulation including medulla cerebral hypoxia lack sufficient oxygen supply prolonged lack oxygenation respiratory depression lead detrimental damage brain spinal cord leave person unable walk function normally even treatment naloxone alcohol also causes respiratory depression therefore taken opioids increase risk respiratory depression young children opioid overdose may apparent right away due absorption distribution metabolism differences young children adults higher amount opioid ingestion per kilogram body risk factors opioid overdose include opioid dependence injecting opioids using high doses opioids use together alcohol benzodiazepines risk particularly high following dependence prescription opioids occur use treat chronic young children overdose usually due opioids intended parents older siblings mothers take codeine breastfeeding opioid overdoses occurred codeine therefore recommended opioid overdoses often associated benzodiazepines tranquilisers eg xylazine alcohol cns depressants muscle relaxers pain relievers anticonvulsants anxiolytics treatment drugs psychoactive epileptic variety drug active function meant calm mitigate neuronal signaling barbiturates etc additionally cause worsened condition less likelihood recovery cumulative added drug includes drugs less immediately classed slowing metabolism gabaergic like ghb glutamatergic antagonists like pcp ketamine opioids primarily metabolized liver excreted urine opioids metabolized phase andor phase metabolism lead activation inhibition phase metabolism cyp pathway consists different cytochrome set enzymes catalyze hydrolysis reduction oxidation reactions create active contrast phase metabolism causes opioids undergo conjugation little interaction cyp opioids undergo phase phase metabolism hydrophilic enough renally various factors play role opioid metabolized phase metabolism cyp family several polymorphisms account difference therapeutic responses within diversification leads opioids modified varying rates cause drug remain bloodstream either longer shorter period therefore polymorphisms control opioid tolerance facilitate overdose evidence suggests mental health significant facilitator opioid given opioids prescribed pain management mental health disorders depression shown increase use opioids treating conditions associated chronic evidence shown individuals mood anxiety disorders increased likelihood prescribed opioids continuing usage lengthy periods time consequently increasing likelihood affected individuals almost double risk using opioids pain relief additionally mental health challenges associated trauma economic depression social environments conducive substance abuse risktaking behaviours shown increase opioid furthermore mental health challenges associated cardiovascular disease sleep disorders hiv cause opioid dependence subsequent notably cyclic behaviours observed mental illness opioid abuse individuals mental health diagnoses engage opioid use perpetuates mental health challenges increased drug opioids bind neurological opioid receptors provoke analgesic sedative euphoric opioids function stimulating specific gprotein coupled receptors distributed throughout brain skin spinal three major opioid receptors include mu kappa delta nociception playing role eliciting effects associated opioid overdose results overactivation receptors cause permanent brain damage cerebral hypoxia mu receptors analgesic effect brain found various parts nervous system including cerebral cortex found nucleus accumbens pleasure centre brain well kappa receptors hypothalamus produce similar analgesic effect bind dynorphins stimulate antireward effects negative effects withdrawal mu receptors source addiction kappa receptors contribute continued abuse generate dysphoria response increasing stress levels via corticotropinreleasing factor increases erratic shifts mood withdrawal period prompt delta receptors found basal ganglia limbic system shown reduce anxiety binding enkephalins although requires recent addition receptors nociception opioid receptors although determined receptors certain ligands opioids role yet fully opioids ingested ligand binds constitutively active receptors reduce neural accomplished inhibiting adenylyl cyclase cyclic amp necessary communication within central nervous research indicating opioids reduce pain disrupting ion channels vesicle prolonged exposure opioids cause receptors become internalized leading increased tolerance increased opioid opioid overdoses often clear protocols staff emergency departments urgent care centers reduce opioid prescriptions individuals presenting
