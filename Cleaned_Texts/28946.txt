culling process segregating organisms group according desired undesired characteristics animal breeding removing segregating animals breeding stock based specific trait done exaggerate desirable characteristics remove undesirable characteristics altering genetic makeup population livestock wildlife culling often refers killing removed animals based characteristics sex species membership means preventing infectious disease transmission fruits vegetables culling sorting segregation fresh harvested produce marketable lots nonmarketable lots discarded diverted food processing nonfood processing activities usually happens collection centres located close farms word cull comes latin verb colligere meaning gather term applied broadly mean partitioning collection two groups one kept one rejected cull set items rejected selection process culling process repeated selected group proper size consistency desired culling rejection removal inferior individuals breeding act selective breeding used practice breeding pedigree cats refers practice spaying neutering kitten cat measure show standard standard applied breed way culling used responsible breeders signify killing healthy kittens cats fail meet applicable standard breeding pedigreed animals desirable undesirable traits considered choosing animals retain breeding place pets process culling starts examination conformation standard animal often include additional qualities health robustness temperament color preference etc breeder takes things consideration envisioning ideal breed goal breeding program vision selections made animals bred best chance producing ideal breeders pedigreed animals cull based many criteria first culling criterion always health robustness secondary health temperament conformation animal considered filtering process ends breeders personal aesthetic preferences pattern color etc tandem method form selective breeding breeder addresses one characteristic animal time thus selecting animals measure certain threshold particular trait keeping traits constant level quality single trait achieved breeder focus second trait cull based tandem method minimum level quality set important characteristics breeder wishes remain constant breeder focusing improvement one particular trait without losing quality others breeder raise threshold selection trait successive generation progeny thus ensuring improvement single characteristic breeding program example breeder pleased muzzle length muzzle shape eye placement breeding stock wishes improve eye shape progeny produced may determine minimum level improvement eye shape required progeny returned breeding program progeny first evaluated existing quality thresholds place muzzle length muzzle shape eye placement additional criterion improvement eye shape animal meet level improvement eye shape maintaining qualities culled breeding program ie animal used breeding instead neutered placed pet home independent levels method animal falls given standard single characteristic used breeding program successive mating threshold culling criteria raised thus improving breed successive method measures several characteristics progeny fall desired quality one characteristic measured used breeding program regardless level excellence traits successive generation progeny minimum quality characteristic raised thus ensuring improvement traits example breeder view minimum requirements muzzle length muzzle shape eye placement eye shape breeding toward breeder determine minimum acceptable quality traits progeny folded back breeding program animal fails meet quality threshold one criteria culled breeding program total score method selection method breeder evaluates selects breeding stock based weighted table characteristics breeder selects qualities important assigns weight weights traits add evaluating individual selection breeder measures traits scale desirable expression lowest scores multiplied weights added together give total score individuals fail meet threshold culled removed breeding program total score gives breeder way evaluate multiple traits animal total score method flexible three allows weighted improvement multiple characteristics allows breeder make major gains one aspect moderate lesser gains others example breeder willing make smaller improvement muzzle length muzzle shape order moderate gain improvement eye placement dramatic improvement eye shape suppose breeder determines would like see improvement eye shape improvement eye placement improvement muzzle length shape breeder would evaluate characteristics scale multiply weights formula would look something like muzzle length muzzle shape eye placement eye shape total score animal breeder determines lowest acceptable total score animal folded back breeding program animals meet minimum total score culled breeding program livestock bred production meat milk may culled farmers animals

management particularly african game farms australian national parks case large animals elephants adults often targeted orphaned young easily captured transported relocated reserves culling controversial many african countries reintroduction practice recommended recent years use kruger national park south africa experienced swell elephant population since culling banned culling acts strong selection force therefore impact population genetics species example culling based specific traits size enforce directional selection remove traits population longterm effects genetic diversity additionally culling act selection force intentionally implemented humans counteract selection force trophy hunting hunting typically enforces selection towards unfavorable phenotypic traits strong hunting bias specific traits large antler size culling lowquality traits counteract animal rights activists argue killing animals reason including hunting cruel bird species culled populations impact
