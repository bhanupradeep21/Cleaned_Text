incentivisation incentivization practice building incentives arrangement system order motivate actors within based idea individuals within systems perform better coerced also given incentivization aims motivate rather encourage enthusiasm individuals perform better distinguished bribery system sense provides spark motivate stimulate move arouse encourage workers strive personal result motivation proposed incentivization improve efficiency different systems incentivization follows certain notions proposed psychological theories selfdetermination highlights extrinsic intrinsic motivation incentivization highlights human behavior response factors impact extrinsic motivation extrinsic motivation refers individuals changing behavior order meet external goal receive praise approval monetary rewards incentives act extrinsic motivators providing external purpose individual key developing persons psychological health different intrinsic motivators based selfinterest exempt external pressure example wikipedia editors intrinsic incentive contribute website financial reward instead altruism recognition reciprocity different types incentives accounted incentivization strategies economic incentives account material gains losses whereas social incentives account reputational gains losses psychologicalbehavioral incentives refer external stimuli condition object enhance serve motive behavior influenced accordance banduras social cognitive banduras theory suggests likely produce behavior motivated incentives developed social learning example vicarious reinforcements refers individual observes role model receiving positive reactions behavior reinforce must replicate behavior vicarious reinforcement involves people developing incentives empathizing feeling peoples example student may observe teacher praising classmate exceptional creativity incentivized praise recreateimitate behavior however banduras theory allows us draw links social learning incentivization consider human agency suggests people consciously able affect willingness engage behavior therefore biological cultural explanations needed substantiate notion important understand type incentive motivates target group incentivization strategy instance exposure extrinsic monetary incentives may counteract incentivesmotivations lead less overall interest cases like incentivization backfires incentivization strategy leverage existing system measures address interrelated issues involving risk cost performance done adopted multiple fields individuals response incentivization appears controlled ventromedial prefrontal brain express decreased response incentivization experiencing damage near nucleus accumbens however people may become sensitive incentives damage subgenual ventromedial prefrontal biological approach incentivization linked biological explanations regarding human extrinsic motivation emotion learning signals firstly attribute majority learning signals mechanisms occurring within visceral body evolutionary lens known human beings developed brain mechanisms alter direct functions visceral body example slows metabolism order maintain ideal homeostatic levels mechanism weaker certain individuals likely feel lack motivation less affected incentives maintaining body homeostasis individuals able get day feeling less lethargic bored hypothalamus linked aforementioned nucleus accumbens ventromedial prefrontal cortex regulates activity amygdala within brain amygdala involved emotion activation stimulusreenforcement learning therefore people likely consider incentives amygdala functioning optimal level ability regulate emotions limited due research suggesting amygdala allows stimulus reenforcement association information suggests likely turn extrinsic motivators incentives essentially change amygdala activity impacts likelihood undergoing vicarious reinforcement behavioral economics highlights humans two cognitive systems one automatic reflective reflective system seen rational andor cognitive controlled effortful rulefollowing selfaware reflective system allows us analyse available information well incentives offered us act best interests contrasts automatic system takes shortcuts uses heuristics biases two systems also commonly referred fast slow systems thinking reflective slow automatic fast incentives change behaviour changing peoples minds possible rewards highlighted reflective system weighs revised costs benefits actions responds accordingly research shown mixed results regarding impact cultural practices effectiveness incentives institutional theory hofstedes cultural dimension suggested national culture moderate incentive effectiveness however certain research suggested weak relationship influential cultural factors adopting incentives include ingroup collectivism performance orientation uncertainty avoidance however detailed cultural explanation refers individualism vs collectivism debate certain cultures individual success highly valued sought whereas others collective success group prioritized may affect way incentives framed received acted upon example individual prizes incentives cater towards individualistic societies whereas rewards shared amongst ingroup suited collectivist cultural value systems also important consider incentivizing individuals certain forms incentives may suited others example collectivist cultures monetary gains important hold much weight social reputation within ingroup therefore social incentives praise social status approval may beneficial individual receiving lastly cultural dimensions may affect motivated incentives example individualistic societies likely affected extrinsic motivators recognition opposed collectivists seek sense purpose fulfillment learningachieving however think critically suggesting one cultural dimension responsible incentivization far reductionist statement ultimately combination hofstedes cultural dimensions power distance masculinity uncertainty alongside biological cognitive factors explain incentivization factors considered devising analysing incentivisation strategy incentive presented framed known choice context commonly referred choice architecture instance given context information low fun specific task offering respective amount complete task people might think task unenjoyable incentive would fail dislike losses like gains value individuals respond strongly losing something value given reward equivalent value known loss aversion weight loss programme asked participants deposit money would returned targets met lost significantly weight importance context enhanced people understand monetary value categories salary savings expenses differently extrinsic incentives create different responses people depending understand value organise impact also depends type size terms size paying high reward successful completion task could make participant anxious completing task reduce ability concept section discusses economic incentives must matched suitable tasks audiences terms timing value rewards may change time different situations meaning value incentive frequency incentives also important impact effectiveness incentivisation changes behaviour may reverse back original form oneoff incentives used condition us behave new way rewards stop new behaviour also stop incentivisation tends effective forming permanent habits reward us note incentivisation likened operant conditioning association voluntary behaviour consequence take example someone receiving pocket money money given set specific time every week example guaranteed every time behaviour expressed becomes expected money given sometimes behaviour expressed individual unsure whether receive reward makes performing behaviour exciting like gambling incentivisation effective rewards random people overemphasise small probabilities means incentives may skewed based upon unrealistic prefer immediate payoffs rather distant ones even immediate payoffs smaller distant people would rather avoid shortterm pain diabetes blood test rather longterm health incentive theory motivation incentivization criticized psychologists able explain individuals carry behaviors despite little incentive example worker works extremely hard small salary also fails explain situations whereby instead incentive rather threat place example going outside natural disaster order help others secondly incentivization assumes given point individual entirely extrinsically motivated react incentives entirely intrinsically motivated consider cases individuals engaging extrinsic intrinsic motivators developmental psychology account complexities behind human motivation example literature shown children far likely extrinsically motivated young ages therefore fair assume incentives less appealing intrinsic motivation develops repercussions considering developmental focus theory incentivization reductionist lacks ability extrapolated wide range age groups occupational groups cultural demographics certain psychological theories counter incentive motivation skinners theory learning argues individuals behavior directly linked external environment making difficult invision incentivized individual within framework httpsenwikipediaorgwikiincentivisation
