thyroglossal cyst fibrous cyst forms persistent thyroglossal duct thyroglossal cysts defined irregular neck mass lump develops cells tissues left formation thyroid gland developmental thyroglossal cysts common cause midline neck masses generally located caudal hyoid bone neck masses occur anywhere along path thyroglossal duct base tongue suprasternal common causes midline neck masses include lymphadenopathy dermoid cysts various odontogenic thyroglossal cysts develop birth many diagnostic procedures may used establish degree cyst thyroglossal duct cysts often present palpable asymptomatic midline neck mass usually time level hyoid bone mass neck moves swallowing protrusion tongue attachment tongue via tract thyroid descent patients neck throat pain dysphagiacitation needed persistent duct sinus promote oral secretions may cause cysts become infected half thyroglossal cysts diagnosed adult life tract lie dormant years even decades kind stimulus leads cystic dilation infection sometimes cause transient appearance mass enlargement cyst times periodic recurrences spontaneous drainage may also occur differential diagnosis ectopic thyroid enlarged lymph nodes dermoid cysts goitercitation needed thyroglossal cyst usually presents midline neck lump region hyoid bone usually painless smooth cystic though infected pain occur may difficulty breathing dysphagia difficulty swallowing dyspepsia discomfort upper abdomen especially cyst becomes largecitation needed common location thyroglossal cyst midline slightly midline isthmus thyroid hyoid bone hyoid bone thyroglossal

increased incidence ectopic thyroid tissue occasionally lingual thyroid seen flattened strawberrylike lump base infected thyroglossal duct cyst occur left untreated certain amount time simply thyroglossal duct cyst hasnt suspected degree infection examined major rim enhancement occurred located inferior hyoid bone soft tissue swelling occurs along airway obstruction trouble swallowing due rapid enlargement infections rare cases expression fluid projected pharynx causing problems within post surgery infection thyroglossal cyst reaction stitches post removal stitches surgery thyroglossal cyst infection thyroglossal duct cyst may rupture unexpectedly resulting draining sinus known thyroglossal thyroglossal fistula develop removal cyst fully completed usually noticed bleeding neck occurs causing swelling fluid ejection around original wound rarely less cases cancer may present thyroglossal duct tumors generally papillary thyroid arising ectopic thyroid tissue within thyroglossal duct cysts birth defect embryonic development thyroid gland formed beginning base tongue moving towards neck canal known thyroglossal duct thyroid reaches final position neck duct normally disappears individuals portions duct remain behind leaving small pockets known cysts persons life cyst pockets fill fluids mucus enlarging infected presenting thyroglossal thyroglossal tract

thyroglossal cyst lined pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium thyroglossal fistula lined columnar epitheliumcitation needed diagnosis thyroglossal duct cyst requires medical professional usually done physical examination important identify whether thyroglossal cyst contains thyroid tissue define degree cyst dealt diagnostic procedures thyroglossal cyst clinical features found subhyoid

eliminate chance infection development thyroid scans thyroid function studies ordered preoperatively important demonstrate normally functioning thyroid tissue usual areacitation needed surgical management options include sistrunk procedure en bloc central neck dissection sutureguided transhyoid pharyngotomy koempels suprahyoid cystectomy inadequate sistrunk procedure surgical resection central portion hyoid bone along wide core tissue midline area hyoid foramen involves excision cyst also paths tract branches removal central portion hyoid bone indicated ensure complete removal tract original sistrunk papers classic procedure described modified procedure described available online modern general procedure consists three steps several versions sistrunk procedure including procedure relatively safe study pediatric patients maddalozzo et al found major complications observe minor complications patients presented seroma patients local wound recent paper analyzed research studies different treatment complications thyroglossal cyst reported total minor complications rate sistrunk operation classical modified simple cystectomy treatment sistrunk procedure also showed better outcomes concerning rate overall recurrence ie lowest rate sistrunk procedure results cure rate longterm httpsenwikipediaorgwikithyroglossalcyst
