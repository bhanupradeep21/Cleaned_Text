magnesium sulfate magnesium sulphate englishspeaking countries us chemical compound salt formula consisting magnesium cations mass sulfate anions white crystalline solid soluble water ethanol magnesium sulfate usually encountered form hydrate various values n common heptahydrate known epsom salt household chemical many traditional uses including bath main use magnesium sulfate agriculture correct soils deficient magnesium essential plant nutrient role magnesium chlorophyll photosynthesis monohydrate favored use mid production million tons per anhydrous form several hydrates occur nature minerals salt significant component water springs magnesium sulfate crystallize several hydrates including existence decahydrate apparently hydrates lose water upon heating anhydrous form

analgesic migraine chronic magnesium sulfate studied treatment preeclampsia magnesium sulfate usual component concentrated salt solution used isolation tanks increase specific gravity approximately high density allows individual float effortlessly surface water closed tank eliminating many external senses possible uk medication containing magnesium sulfate phenol called drawing paste useful small boils localized removing internally magnesium sulfate may administered oral respiratory intravenous routes internal uses include replacement therapy magnesium treatment acute severe bronchodilator treatment preventing cerebral tocolytic also may used agriculture magnesium sulfate used increase magnesium sulfur content soil commonly applied potted plants magnesiumhungry crops potatoes tomatoes carrots peppers lemons roses advantage magnesium sulfate magnesium soil amendments dolomitic lime high solubility also allows option foliar feeding solutions magnesium sulfate also nearly ph neutral compared slightly alkaline salts magnesium found limestone therefore use magnesium sulfate magnesium source soil significantly change soil contrary popular belief magnesium sulfate able control pests slugs helps seeds germination produce flowers improve nutrient uptake environmentally friendly none purported claims except correcting magnesium deficiency soils magnesium sulfate even pollute water used excessive magnesium sulfate historically used treatment lead poisoning prior development chelation therapy hoped lead ingested would precipitated magnesium sulfate subsequently purged digestive application saw particularly widespread use among veterinarians earlytomid century epsom salt already available many farms agricultural use often prescribed treatment farm animals
