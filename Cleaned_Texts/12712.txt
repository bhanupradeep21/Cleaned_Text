pampaphoneus extinct genus carnivorous dinocephalian therapsid belonging family anteosauridae lived million years ago wordian age guadalupian middle permian period brazil pampaphoneus known almost complete skull lower jaw still articulated discovered lands boqueirão farm near city são gabriel state rio grande sul second specimen locality reported yet described composed skull associated postcranial remains first south american species dinocephalian described group previously known south america isolated teeth jaw fragment reported region brazil phylogenetic analysis conducted cisneros colleagues reveals pampaphoneus closely related anteosaurs european russia indicating closer faunal relationship south america eastern europe previously thought thus promoting pangea b

peculiarity holotype thought diagnostic feature presence four teeth per premaxilla fourth incisor small size however laterally masked maxilla eight however second skull yet undescribed reported showing differences holotype presence five premaxillary teeth seven postcanines since cranial elements similar differences interpreted intraspecific although syodontinae pampaphoneus also shares

african russian anteosaurs suggests dispersal western pangea rather eastern pangea via cathaysian bridge latter included parts northern southern china korea indochina played important role dispersal therapsids late permian triassic however bridge probably yet formed middle permian marine barriers broke different cathaysian blocks making difficult animals disperse cathaysia southern africa via eastern europe cisneros colleagues suggest seemingly easier migration route via western pangea favoring pangea btype continental reconstruction south america juxtaposed appalachia thus closer russia pangea reconstruction latter appalachian mauritanides mountains would difficult natural barriers cross contrast pangea b configuration brazil closer eastern europe mountain barrier along way
