differential susceptibility theory proposed jay another interpretation psychological findings usually discussed according diathesisstress model models suggest peoples development emotional affect differentially affected experiences qualities environment diathesisstress model suggests group sensitive negative environments differential susceptibility hypothesis suggests group sensitive negative positive environments third model vantagesensitivity suggests group sensitive positive environments three models may considered complementary combined general environmental sensitivity idea individuals vary sensitivity environment historically framed dualrisk theories suggested vulnerable individuals due biological temperamental andor physiological characteristics ie diathesis risk vulnerable adverse effects negative experiences ie stress risk resilient individuals affected negative experiences see figure differential susceptibility related notion biological sensitivity suggested individuals thought vulnerable sensitive negative environments also positive environments see figure thus according differential susceptibility hypothesis individuals susceptible plastic influenced others environmental influences better worse belsky suggests evolution might select children plastic others fixed face example parenting styles belsky offers ancestral parents like parents today could known consciously unconsciously childrearing practices would prove successful promoting reproductive fitness thus inclusive fitness result fitness optimizing strategy involving bet natural selection might shaped parents bear children varying way effect parenting proven counterproductive fitness terms children affected parenting would incurred cost developing ways ultimately proved

parenting influenced children ways enhanced fitness would plastic offspring benefited directly following parental leads would parents even less malleable siblings benefit parenting received
