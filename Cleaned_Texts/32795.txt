submerged beneath waters lake village abu hureyra two separate periods occupation epipalaeolithic settlement neolithic settlement epipaleolithic natufian settlement established c years first settlement village consisted small round huts cut soft sandstone terrace roofs supported wooden posts roofed brushwood huts contained underground storage areas food houses lived subterranean pit inhabitants probably accurately described huntercollectors didnt forage immediate consumption built stores longterm food security settled around larder protect animals humans distribution wild food

different accumulation resources consisting rumexpolygonum ryeeinkorn barley emmer wheatfree threshing early part younger dryas first indirect evidence agriculture detected excavations abu hureyra although cereals still wild intentional sowing cereals favourable refuges like mureybet first farmers developed domesticated strains centuries drought cold younger dryas climate abated bce spread middle east new biotechnology abu hureyra grew large village eventually several thousand people second occupation grew domesticated varieties rye wheat barley kept sheep livestock hunting gazelle decreased sharply probably due overexploitation eventually left extinct middle east abu hureyra replaced meat domesticated animals second occupation lasted years evidence found cultivation rye sudden rise pollen weed plants typically infest newly disturbed soil peter akkermans glenn schwartz found claim epipaleolithic rye difficult reconcile absence cultivated cereals abu hureyra elsewhere thousands years could early experiment didnt survive continue suggested drier climate conditions resulting beginning younger dryas caused wild cereals become scarce leading people begin cultivation means securing food supply results recent analysis rye grains level suggest may actually domesticated epipalaeolithic speculated permanent population first occupation fewer individuals occupied several tens square kilometers rich resource base several different ecosystems land hunted harvested food wood made charcoal may cultivated cereals grains food first domesticated morphologic cereals came abu hureyra site around years village abu hureyra impressive agricultural advances time period rapid growth farming led development two different domesticated forms wheat barley rye lentils due part sudden cool period cool period affected supply wild animals gazelle time main source protein since food supply became scarce critical find way provide population led extensive agricultural efforts well domestication sheep goats provide steady protein another helpful factor ability grow legumes fix nitrogen levels soil improved fertility soil allowed crop plants massive increase agriculture cost lived village abu hureyra experienced several injuries skeletal abnormalities injuries mostly came way crops harvested order harvest crops people abu hureyra would kneel several hours end act kneeling long durations would put individuals risk injuring big toes hips lower cartilage damage toe severe metatarsal bones would rub together addition injury another common injury last dorsal vertebra damaged crushed alignment due pressure used grinding skeletal abnormalities also found teeth abu hureyra people since grain stone ground many flakes stone would still left grain time would wear teeth rare cases women would large grooves front teeth suggests used mouth third hand weaving baskets dates basket weaving far back bc fact women grooves shows basket weaving rare skill baskets extremely important success agriculture baskets used collect spread seeds also used collect distribute httpsenwikipediaorgwikitellabuhureyra
