among animals viviparity development embryo inside body mother opposed oviparity reproductive mode females lay developing eggs complete development hatch externally term viviparity adjective form viviparous derive latin vivus meaning living pario meaning give birth five modes reproduction differentiated based relations zygote parents five include two nonviviparous modes ovuliparity external
