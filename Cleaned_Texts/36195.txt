darwinopterus meaning darwins wing genus pterosaur discovered china named biologist charles fossil specimens collected tiaojishan formation dates middle jurassic period type species modularis described february modularis first known pterosaur display features longtailed rhamphorhynchoid shorttailed pterodactyloid pterosaurs described transitional fossil two two additional species linglongtaensis robustodens described fossil beds december june darwinopterus like closest relatives characterized unique combination basal derived pterosaurian features long tail features characteristic rhamphorhynchoids also distinct pterodactyloid features long vertebrae neck single skull opening front eyes nasoantorbital fenestra rhamphorhynchoids antorbital fenestra nasal opening darwinopterus distinguished close relatives greater relative length back portion skull compared jaws thin nasal bone elongated hip bone ilium teeth species spaced widely longest teeth jaw tips teeth spikelike form set tooth sockets raised margins hand bones relatively short even shorter femur tail long vertebrae partially stiffened long thin bony unlike wukongopterids head crest found males supported thin bony extension skull serrated top edge serrations probably helped anchor even larger keratin specimens darwinopterus divided three distinct species based largely size shape teeth first modularis named lü junchang colleagues modularis especially elongated back end skull widely spaced spikelike teeth linglongtaensis named wang xiaolin colleagues later characterized shorter taller skull shorter coneshaped lü another team scientists described named robustodens new specimen robust teeth lü colleagues suggested differences tooth shape may indicate darwinopterus species occupied different ecological niche teeth becoming specialized different food sources robust teeth robustodens example may used feed hardshelled darwinopterus known numerous wellpreserved specimens including

dinosaurs size shape crests change dramatically age noted mrs specimen may simply subadult yet developed crest animals able reproduce fully wang ea reassigned mrs specimen classified specimen new species kunpengopterus antipollicatus furthermore rigorous analysis wukongopterid variation published noted crests among wukongopterids subject large amount individual variation consistent dimorphism pelvic anatomy crested uncrested wukongopterid specimen preserved along egg nicknamed mrs described lü colleagues offers insight reproductive strategies darwinopterus pterosaurs like eggs later pterosaurs modern eggs darwinopterus parchmentlike soft modern birds eggshell hardened calcium completely shielding embryo outside environment softshelled eggs permeable allow significant amounts water absorbed egg development eggs type vulnerable elements typically buried soil eggs darwinopterus would weighed grams oz laid due moisture intake may doubled weight time eggs small compared size mother mrs specimen weighed grams oz grams also like modern reptiles birds david unwin coauthor paper suggested darwinopterus probably laid many small eggs time buried juveniles could fly upon hatching requiring little parental results imply reproduction pterosaurs like modern reptiles significantly differed reproduction however counterplate specimen reported ivpp showed single additional egg present body indicating two active ovaries producing single egg darwinopterus like wukongopterids terrestrial pterosaur lacking speciations piscivory ergo early recognised terrestrial form originally described raptorial hawking however posterior analyses found speciations towards aerial predation instead appears saltatorial insectivore hopping around trees ground akin modern robustidens
