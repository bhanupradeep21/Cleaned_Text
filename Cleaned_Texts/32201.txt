hypersomnia neurological disorder excessive time spent sleeping excessive sleepiness many possible causes seasonal affective disorder cause distress problems fifth edition diagnostic statistical manual mental disorders hypersomnolence several subtypes appears sleepwake hypersomnia pathological state characterized lack alertness waking episodes confused fatigue normal physiological daytime sleepiness appears commonly situations little interaction since hypersomnia impairs patients attention levels wakefulness quality life may impacted especially true people whose jobs request high levels attention healthcare main symptom hypersomnia excessive daytime sleepiness eds prolonged nighttime occurred least months prior sleep drunkenness also symptom found hypersomniac difficulty transitioning sleep individuals experiencing sleep drunkenness report waking confusion disorientation slowness repeated returns also appears nonhypersomniac persons example night insufficient fatigue consumption alcohol hypnotics cause sleep drunkenness also associated irritability people get angry shortly sleeping tend experience sleep according american academy sleep medicine hypersomniac patients often take long naps day mostly researchers found naps usually frequent longer patients furthermore patients report short naps refreshing compared severity daytime sleepiness needs quantified subjective scales least epworth sleepiness scale objective tests multiple sleep latency test stanford sleepiness scale sss another frequentlyused subjective measurement determined excessive daytime sleepiness present complete medical examination full evaluation potential disorders differential diagnosis tedious expensive timeconsuming hypersomnia primary centralbrain origin secondary numerous medical conditions one type hypersomnia coexist single patient even presence known cause hypersomnia contribution cause complaint excessive daytime sleepiness needs assessed specific treatments known condition fully suppress excessive daytime sleepiness additional causes hypersomnia example patient sleep apnea treated cpap continuous positive airway pressure resolves apneas excessive daytime sleepiness necessary seek causes excessive daytime sleepiness obstructive sleep apnea occurs frequently narcolepsy may delay diagnosis narcolepsy several years interfere proper true primary hypersomnias also several genetic disorders may associated primarycentral hypersomnia include following praderwilli syndrome norrie disease disease type c myotonic dystrophy however hypersomnia syndromes may also associated secondary causes important complete full evaluation myotonic dystrophy often associated soremps sleep onset rem periods occur many neurological disorders may mimic primary hypersomnias narcolepsy idiopathic hypersomnia brain tumors strokeprovoking lesions dysfunction thalamus hypothalamus brainstem also neurodegenerative conditions alzheimers disease parkinsons disease multiple system atrophy frequently associated primary hypersomnia however cases one must still rule secondary early hydrocephalus also cause severe excessive daytime additionally head trauma associated primarycentral hypersomnia symptoms similar idiopathic hypersomnia seen within months following trauma however associated symptoms headaches memory loss lack concentration may frequent head trauma idiopathic hypersomnia possibility secondary narcolepsy following head injury previously asymptomatic individuals also secondary hypersomnias extremely numerous hypersomnia secondary disorders clinical depression multiple sclerosis encephalitis epilepsy hypersomnia also symptom sleep disorders like sleep may occur adverse effect taking certain medications withdrawal medications substance genetic predisposition may also cases results physical problem tumor head trauma dysfunction autonomic central nervous sleep apnea second frequent cause secondary hypersomnia affecting middleaged adults mostly men upper airway resistance syndrome uars clinical variant sleep apnea also cause sleep disorders like narcolepsy coexist sleep apnea true uars many cases uars excessive daytime sleepiness persists cpap treatment indicating additional cause causes hypersomnia requiring sleep movement disorders restless legs syndrome rls periodic limb movement disorder plmd plms also cause secondary hypersomnia although rls commonly cause excessive daytime sleepiness plms evidence plms plays role etiology daytime sleepiness fact two studies showed correlation plms objective measures excessive daytime sleepiness addition eds patients best treated dopaminergic agents known suppress neuromuscular diseases spinal cord diseases often lead sleep disturbances due respiratory dysfunction causing sleep apnea may also cause insomnia related sleep alterations periodic limb movement disorders patients spinal cord disease also uncovered widespread use primary hypersomnia diabetes hepatic encephalopathy acromegaly rarely reported medical conditions may also associated hypersomnia secondary sleep apnea periodic limb movement disorder chronic fatigue syndrome fibromyalgia also associated hypersomnia chronic fatigue syndrome characterized persistent relapsing fatigue resolve sleep rest polysomnography shows reduced sleep efficiency may include alpha intrusion sleep eeg likely number cases labeled chronic fatigue syndrome unrecognized cases upper airway resistance sleep disorders narcolepsy sleep apnea plmd chronic fatigue syndrome fibromyalgia may associated anomalous alpha wave activity typically associated arousal states nrem also researchers shown disrupting stage iv sleep consistently young healthy subjects causes significant increase muscle experienced neurasthenic musculoskeletal pain syndrome pain resolved subjects able resume normal sleep chronic kidney disease commonly associated sleep symptoms excessive daytime sleepiness dialysis sleep disturbances sleep apnea occur times often uremic patients general population affect patients dialysis though nighttime dialysis improve dialysis patients hypersomnia severe kidney disease cause uremic encephalopathy increased sleepinducing cytokines impaired sleep efficiency dialysis patients affected insomnia rls plmd affect though may improve dialysis kidney forms cancer therapies cause fatigue disturbed sleep affecting patients often lasting years treatment completion insomnia common predictor fatigue cancer patients polysomnography demonstrates reduced sleep efficiency prolonged initial sleep latency increased wake time night paraneoplastic syndromes also cause insomnia hypersomnia autoimmune diseases especially lupus rheumatoid arthritis often associated hypersomnia morvans syndrome example rarer autoimmune illness also lead celiac disease another autoimmune disease associated poor sleep quality may lead hypersomnia diagnosis also treatment glutenfree also case reports central hypersomnia celiac rls shown frequent celiac disease presumably due associated iron hypothyroidism iron deficiency without irondeficiency anemia also cause secondary hypersomnia various tests disorders done treated hypersomnia also develop within months viral infections whipples disease mononucleosis hiv behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome must considered differential diagnosis secondary hypersomnia disorder occurs individuals fail get sufficient sleep least three months case patient chronic sleep deprivation although may necessarily aware situation becoming prevalent western society due modern demands expectations placed upon many medications lead secondary hypersomnia therefore patients complete medication list carefully reviewed sleepiness fatigue side effects cases careful withdrawal possibly offending medications needed medication substitution mood disorders like depression anxiety disorder bipolar disorder also associated hypersomnia complaint excessive daytime sleepiness conditions often associated poor sleep night sense insomnia eds frequently associated especially cases hypersomnia mood disorders seems primarily related lack interest decreased energy inherent depressed condition rather increase sleep rem sleep propensity cases mood disorders mslt normal short cases hypersomnia caused brain researchers found level sleepiness correlated severity even patients reported improvement sleepiness remained present year quarter patients traumatic brain recurrent hypersomnias defined several episodes hypersomnia persisting days episodes occur weeks months apart subtypes recurrent hypersomnias kleinelevin syndrome menstrualrelated kleinelevin syndrome characterized association episodes hypersomnias behavioral cognitive mood behavioral disturbances composed hyperphagia irritability sexual cognitive disorders consist confusion hallucinations delusions mood symptoms characterized anxiety menstrualrelated hypersomnia characterized episodes excessive sleepiness associated menstrual researchers found degree premenstrual symptoms correlated daytime unlike kleinelevin syndrome hyperphagia hypersexuality reported people menstrualrelated hypersomnia hypophagia could ordinarily episodes appear weeks studies attested hormones prolactin progesterone could responsible menstrualrelated therefore different contraceptive pills could improve sleep architecture decrease slowwave sleep increase slowthetawave polysomnography objective sleep assessment comprises lot electrodes measure physiological variables related polysomnography often includes electroencephalography electromyography electrocardiography muscle activity respiratory polysomnography helpful identify short sleep onset latency period efficient sleep increased slow wave sleep sometimes elevated amount sleep spindles idiopathic hypersomnia multiple sleep latency test mslt objective tool indicates degree sleepiness measuring sleep latency ie speed falling also gives information regarding presence abnormal rem sleep onset test patients series opportunities sleep intervals across day darkened room external alerting mslt often administered day recording polysomnography mean sleep latency score often found around less minutes idiopathic hypersomnia patients might even sleep onset latency minutes less patients often even aware sleeping naps narcolepsy patients actigraphy operates analyzing patients limb movements used record sleep wake order report patient wear continuously device wrist looks like watch contain advantage actigraphy shows polysomnography possible record day furthermore unlike polysomnography less expensive actigraphy several days show longer sleep periods characteristic idiopathic actigraphy also helpful ruling sleep disorders especially circadian disorders leading excess sleepiness day maintenance wakefulness test mwt test measures ability stay used diagnose disorders excessive somnolence hypersomnia narcolepsy obstructive sleep test patients sit comfortably instructed try stay stanford sleepiness scale sss selfreport scale measures different steps statement patients report level sleepiness using scale going
