strongyloides stercoralis human pathogenic parasitic roundworm causing disease strongyloidiasis common name us threadworm uk australia however term threadworm also refer nematodes genus enterobius otherwise known strongyloides stercoralis nematode parasitize humans adult parasitic stage lives tunnels mucosa small intestine genus strongyloides contains stercoralis type species stercoralis reported mammals including cats dogs however seems species dogs typically stercoralis related species canis nonhuman primates commonly infected fuelleborni cebus although stercoralis reported captive primates species strongyloides naturally parasitic humans restricted distributions fuelleborni central africa kellyi papua new guinea stercoralis infection associated fecal contamination soil water hence rare infection developed economies developing countries less prevalent urban areas rural areas sanitation standards poor stercoralis found areas tropical subtropical strongyloidiasis first described century french soldiers returning home expeditions indochina today countries old indochina vietnam cambodia laos still endemic strongyloidiasis typical prevalences less regions japan used endemic strongyloidiasis control programs eliminated disease strongyloidiasis appears high prevalence areas brazil central america endemic africa prevalence typically low less pockets reported rural italy current status unknown pacific islands strongyloidiasis rare although cases reported fiji tropical australia rural remote australian aboriginal communities high prevalences african countries eg congo fuelleborni common stercoralis parasite surveys current status unknown papua new guinea stercoralis endemic prevalence low however areas another species common parasite children new guinea highlands western knowledge geographic distribution strongyloidiasis significance travelers may acquire parasite stays endemic areas strongyloidiasis could theoretically transmittable unsanitary bedclothes care must taken never use unclean hotel bed sheets endemic areas using plastic slippers showering may important travelling tropical regions estimates number people infected vary one estimate putting figure million local prevalence exceed tropical subtropical life cycle parasite complex nematodes alternation freeliving parasitic cycles potential autoinfection parasite ability complete life cycle without involvement another host multiplication within host parasitic cycle homogonic freeliving cycle heterogonic heterogonic life cycle advantageous parasite allows reproduction absence host freeliving cycle rhabditiform larvae passed stool either molt twice become infective filariform larvae direct development molt four times become freeliving adult males females mate produce eggs rhabditiform larvae hatch direct development firststage larvae transform infective larvae il via three molts indirect route results first development freeliving adults mate female lays eggs hatch develop il direct route gives il faster three days versus indirect route seven days however indirect route results increase number il produced speed development il traded increased numbers freeliving males females stercoralis die one generation persist soil latter turn either develop new generation freeliving adults develop infective filariform larvae filariform larvae penetrate human host skin initiate parasitic cycle upon contact contaminated soil infectious larvae contained soil penetrate skin stercoralis attracted chemicals carbon dioxide sodium chloride chemicals specific larvae thought locate hosts via chemicals skin predominant one urocanic acid histidine metabolite uppermost layer skin removed sweat daily skinshedding urocanic acid concentrations five times greater foot part human body enter superficial veins carried blood lungs enter alveoli coughed swallowed gut parasitise intestinal mucosa duodenum jejunum small intestine molt twice become adult female worms females live threaded epithelium small intestine parthenogenesis produce eggs yield rhabditiform larvae females reach reproductive adulthood intestine female strongyloids reproduce parthenogenesis eggs hatch intestine young larvae excreted feces takes two weeks reach egg development initial skin penetration process stercoralis cause respiratory gastrointestinal symptoms worms also participate autoinfection rhabditiform larvae become infective filariform larvae penetrate either intestinal mucosa internal autoinfection skin perianal area external autoinfection either case filariform larvae may follow previously described route carried successively lungs bronchial tree pharynx small intestine mature adults may disseminate widely body date occurrence autoinfection humans helminthic infections recognized strongyloides stercoralis capillaria philippinensis infections case strongyloides autoinfection may explain possibility persistent infections many years persons endemic area hyperinfections immunodepressed individuals dogs act host parasite wild laboratory transmission dog human difficult prove molecular genetic analyses shown two populations parasite dogs one type b exclusive dogs second type common dogs two genotypes may separate species identity genes suggests dog human transmission may occur whereas males grow mm length females grow mm sexes also possess tiny buccal capsule cylindrical esophagus without posterior freeliving stage esophagi sexes rhabditiform males distinguished females two structures spicules gubernaculum unusual feature stercoralis autoinfection one species genus strongyloides felis trait autoinfection development small infective larvae gut host autoinfective larvae penetrate wall lower ileum colon skin perianal region enter circulation travel lungs small intestine thus repeating cycle autoinfection makes strongyloidiasis due stercoralis infection several unusual features persistence infection first important features autoinfection humans known still infected years first exposed parasite eg world war ii vietnam war veterans host infected stercoralis infection lifelong unless effective treatment eliminates adult parasites migrating autoinfective larvae many people infected asymptomatic first symptoms include dermatitis swelling itching larva currens mild hemorrhage site skin penetrated spontaneous scratchlike lesions may seen face elsewhere parasite reaches lungs chest may feel burning wheezing coughing may result along pneumonialike symptoms l√∂fflers syndrome intestines could eventually invaded leading burning pain tissue damage sepsis ulcers stools may yellow mucus recognizable smell chronic diarrhea severe cases edema may result obstruction intestinal tract well loss peristaltic strongyloidiasis immunocompetent individuals usually indolent disease however immunocompromised individuals cause hyperinfective syndrome also called disseminated strongyloidiasis due reproductive capacity parasite inside host hyperinfective syndrome mortality rate close immunosuppressive drugs especially corticosteroids agents used tissue transplantation increase rate autoinfection point overwhelming number larvae migrate lungs many cases prove fatal addition diseases human tlymphotropic virus enhance arm immune system lessen arm increase disease another consequence autoinfection autoinfective larvae carry gut bacteria back body people hyperinfection present bacterial disease due enteric bacteria also unique effect autoinfective larvae larva currens due rapid migration larvae skin larva currens appears red line moves rapidly cm per day quickly disappears pathognomonic autoinfective larvae used diagnostic criterion strongyloidiasis due stercoralis locating juvenile larvae either rhabditiform filariform recent stool samples confirm presence techniques used include direct fecal smears culturing fecal samples agar plates serodiagnosis elisa duodenal fumigation still diagnosis difficult daytoday variation juvenile parasite load ideally prevention improved sanitation proper disposal feces practicing good hygiene washing hands etc used drug regimen administered ivermectin drug choice treatment due low side effect albendazole also effective treating strongyloidiasis mebendazole much higher failure rate clinical practice albendazole however drugs little effect autoinfective larvae hence repeat treatments ivermectin albendazole must administered kill newly matured parasites developed autoinfective larvae means full treatment dose every two weeks larvae capable maturing adults extirpated followup stool samples potential additional treatment blood tests necessary ensure parasite depends chemical cues find potential host uses sensor neurons class afd identify cues excreted stercoralis attracted nonspecific attractants warmth carbon dioxide sodium chloride urocanic acid component skin secretions mammals major chemoattractant larvae stercoralis strongly attracted compound suppressed metal ions suggesting possible strategy preventing infection httpsenwikipediaorgwikistrongyloidesstercoralis
