infection canis despite name occurs commonly domestic cats cat infections organismcitation needed also infect dogs humans however mentagrophytes major reservoir rodents also infect pet rabbits dogs horses gypseum soil organism often contracted gardens places besides humans may infect rodents dogs cats horses cattle treatment requires systemic oral treatment drugs used fluconazole well topical dip usually longer hair shafts pets compared humans area infection possibly longer hair pet must clipped decrease load fungal spores clinging pets hair shafts however close shaving usually done nicking skin facilitates skin infection twiceweekly bathing pet diluted lime sulfur dip solution effective eradicating fungal spores must continue washing household hard surfaces household sodium hypochlorite bleach solution effective killing spores irritating used directly hair skin pet hair must rigorously removed household surfaces vacuum cleaner bag perhaps even vacuum cleaner discarded done repeatedly removal hair important since spores may survive months even long two years hair clinging bovines infestation difficult cure systemic treatment uneconomical local treatment iodine
