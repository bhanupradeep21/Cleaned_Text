suggested participants could stable requires future second study presented idea live terminally ill specifically cancer patients termed older study researchers able suggest patients tested low sustained live died soonest opposed moderate level live lived longest high live could affect individuals direction study needs future replication show effects live terminally ill different diseases age accounts live exist many extreme medical cases patients overcome extraordinary odds survive holocaust provided many instances phenomenon good example proposed mechanism live idea positive mental
