advanced sleep phase disorder aspd also known advanced sleepphase type aspt circadian rhythm sleep disorder condition characterized recurrent pattern early evening eg pm sleepiness early morning awakening eg sleep phase advancement interfere daily social work schedules results shortened sleep duration excessive daytime timing sleep melatonin levels regulated bodys central circadian clock located suprachiasmatic nucleus individuals aspd report unable stay awake conventional bedtime falling asleep early evening unable stay asleep desired waking time experiencing early morning insomnia someone advanced sleep phase disorder melatonin levels core body temperature cycle hours earlier average symptoms must present stable substantial period time correctly diagnosedcitation needed individuals expressing symptoms may diagnosed aspd using variety methods tests sleep specialists measure patients sleep onset offset dim light melatonin onset evaluate horneostberg morningnesseveningness questionnaire results sleep specialists may also conduct polysomnography test rule sleep disorders like narcolepsy age family history patient also taken diagnosed aspd may treated bright light therapy evenings behaviorally chronotherapy order delay sleep onset offset use pharmacological approaches treatment less successful due risks administering sleeppromoting agents early additional methods treatment like timed melatonin administration hypnotics proposed determining safety efficacy require unlike sleep disorders aspd necessarily disrupt normal functioning work day patients may complain excessive daytime sleepiness social obligations may cause individual stay later circadian rhythm requires however still wake early cycle continues lead chronic sleep deprivation sleep disorderscitation needed aspd common among middle older adults estimated prevalence aspd middleage adults believed affect men women equally disorder strong familial tendency affected individuals relatives genetic basis demonstrated one form aspd familial advanced sleep phase disorder fasps implicates missense mutations genes ckidelta producing advanced sleep phase identification two different genetic mutations suggests heterogeneity advanced sleep wake times relatively common especially among older adults extreme phase advance characteristic familial advanced sleep phase syndrome also known familial advanced sleep phase disorder rare individuals fasps fall asleep wake hours earlier average population generally sleeping also free running circadian period hours significantly shorter average human period slightly shortened period associated fasps results shortened period activity causing earlier sleep onset offset means individuals fasps must delay sleep

patients experience normal quality quantity sleep like general aspd syndrome inherently cause negative impacts however sleep deprivation may imposed social norms causing individuals delay sleep socially acceptable time causing losing sleep due earlierthanusual wakeup another factor distinguishes fasps advanced sleep phase disorders strong familial tendency lifelong expression studies
