amblyaudia amblyos blunt audiahearing term coined dr deborah moncrieff characterize specific pattern performance dichotic listening tests dichotic listening tests widely used assess individuals binaural integration type auditory processing skill tests individuals asked identify different words presented simultaneously two ears normal listeners identify words fairly well show small difference two ears one ear slightly dominant majority listeners small difference referred rightear advantage right ear performs slightly better left ear normal individuals produce leftear advantage dichotic tests others perform equal levels two ears amblyaudia diagnosed scores two ears significantly different individuals dominant ear score much higher score nondominant ear researchers interested understanding neurophysiological underpinnings amblyaudia consider brain based hearing disorder may inherited may result auditory deprivation critical periods brain individuals amblyaudia normal hearing sensitivity words hear soft sounds difficulty hearing noisy environments like restaurants classrooms even quiet environments individuals amblyaudia may fail understand hearing especially information new complicated amblyaudia conceptualized auditory analog better known central visual disorder amblyopia term lazy ear used describe amblyaudia although currently known whether stems deficits auditory periphery middle ear cochlea parts auditory system brain characteristic amblyaudia suppression activity nondominant auditory pathway activity dominant pathway may genetically could also exacerbated conditions throughout early development children amblyaudia experience difficulties speech particularly noisy environments sound binaural using interaural cues hear better noise despite normal hearing sensitivity indexed pure tone audiometry symptoms may lead difficulty attending auditory information causing many speculate language acquisition academic achievement may deleteriously affected children amblyaudia significant deficit childs ability use comprehend expressive language may seen children lacked auditory stimulation throughout critical periods auditory system development child suffering amblyaudia may trouble appropriate vocabulary comprehension production use past present future tenses amblyaudia diagnosed many children reported difficulties understanding learning adjudicated adolescents significantly high risk amblyaudia moncrieff et al seminars hearing families report presence amblyaudia several individuals suggesting may genetic nature possible abnormal auditory input first two years life may increase childs risk amblyaudia although precise relationship deprivation timing development amblyaudia still unclear recurrent ear infections otitis media leading cause temporary auditory deprivation young ear infection bouts quality signal reaches auditory regions brains subset children om degraded timing degradation asymmetric worse one ear binaural cues associated sound localization also degraded aural atresia closed external auditory canal also causes temporary auditory deprivation young children hearing restored children ear infections aural atresia surgical intervention although ear infections also resolve spontaneously nevertheless children histories auditory deprivation secondary diseases experience amblyaudia years hearing amblyaudia deficit binaural integration environmental information entering auditory system disorder related brain organization function rather typically considered hearing loss damage cochlea

respond different ways sounds presented deprived nondeprived cases asymmetric deprivation last point particularly important listening tasks require inputs two ears perform well multiple auditory functions rely computation well calibrated inputs two ears chief among ability localize sound sources separate want hear background noise brainstem auditory system compares timing levels sounds two

deficit less able process information nondominant ears competing information arriving dominant ears showed strong highly correlated response dominant nondominant ears among normal children response

processing dichotic material clinical diagnosis amblyaudia made following dichotic listening testing part auditory processing evaluation clinicians advised use newly developed dichotic listening tests provide normative cutoff scores listeners dominant nondominant ears randomized dichotic digits test dichotic words older dichotic listening tests provide normative information right left ears used supplement two tests support diagnosis performance across two dichotic listening tests normal dominant ear significantly normal nondominant ear diagnosis amblyaudia diagnosis also made performance
