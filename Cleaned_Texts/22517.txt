emotional selfregulation emotion regulation ability respond ongoing demands experience range emotions manner socially tolerable sufficiently flexible permit spontaneous reactions well ability delay spontaneous reactions also defined extrinsic intrinsic processes responsible monitoring evaluating modifying emotional emotional selfregulation belongs broader set emotion regulation processes includes regulation ones feelings regulation peoples emotion regulation complex process involves initiating inhibiting modulating ones state behavior given situation example subjective experience feelings cognitive responses thoughts emotionrelated physiological responses example heart rate hormonal activity emotionrelated behavior bodily actions expressions functionally emotion regulation also refer processes tendency focus ones attention task ability suppress inappropriate behavior instruction emotion regulation highly significant function human life every day people continually exposed wide variety potentially arousing stimuli inappropriate extreme unchecked emotional reactions stimuli could impede functional fit within society therefore people must engage form emotion regulation almost generally speaking emotion dysregulation defined difficulties controlling influence emotional arousal organization quality thoughts actions individuals emotionally dysregulated exhibit patterns responding mismatch goals responses andor modes expression demands social example significant association emotion dysregulation symptoms depression anxiety eating pathology substance higher levels emotion regulation likely related high levels social competence expression socially appropriate process model emotion regulation based upon modal model emotion modal model emotion suggests emotion generation process occurs particular sequence time sequence occurs follows emotional response cause changes situation model involves feedback loop response situation feedback loop suggests emotion generation process occur recursively ongoing process model contends four points emotion generation process subjected regulation conceptualization process model posits five different families emotion regulation correspond regulation particular point emotion generation process occur following process model also divides emotion regulation strategies two categories antecedentfocused responsefocused antecedentfocused strategies ie situation selection situation modification attentional deployment cognitive change occur emotional response fully generated responsefocused strategies ie response modulation occur emotional response fully situation selection emotional regulation strategy involves choosing avoid approach future emotional person selects avoid disengage emotionally relevant situationthey decreasing likelihood experiencing emotion alternatively person selects approach engage emotionally relevant situation increasing likelihood experiencing typical examples situation selection may seen interpersonally parent removes child emotionally unpleasant use situation selection may also seen psychopathology example avoidance social situations regulate emotions particularly pronounced social anxiety avoidant personality effective situation selection always easy task instance humans display difficulties predicting emotional responses future events therefore may trouble making accurate appropriate decisions emotionally relevant situations approach situation modification involves efforts modify situation change emotional situation modification refers specifically altering ones external physical environment altering ones internal environment regulate emotion called cognitive examples situation modification may include injecting humor speech elicit extending physical distance oneself another attentional deployment involves directing ones attention towards away emotional distraction example attentional deployment early selection strategy involves diverting ones attention away emotional stimulus towards distraction shown reduce intensity emotional decrease facial responding neural activation amygdala associated well alleviate emotional opposed reappraisal individuals show relative preference engage distraction facing stimuli high negative emotional intensity distraction easily filters highintensity emotional content would otherwise relatively difficult appraise rumination example attentional defined passive repetitive focusing ones attention ones symptoms distress causes consequences symptoms rumination generally considered maladaptive emotion regulation strategy tends exacerbate emotional distress also implicated host disorders including major worry example attentional involves directing attention thoughts images concerned potentially negative events focusing events worrying serves aid downregulation intense negative emotion physiological worry may sometimes involve problem solving incessant worry generally considered maladaptive common feature anxiety disorders particularly generalized anxiety thought suppression example attentional deployment involves efforts redirect ones attention specific thoughts mental images content modify ones emotional although thought suppression may provide temporary relief undesirable thoughts may ironically end spurring production even unwanted strategy generally considered maladaptive associated obsessivecompulsive cognitive change involves changing one appraises situation alter emotional reappraisal example cognitive change late selection strategy involves change meaning event alters emotional encompasses different substrategies positive reappraisal creating focusing positive aspect decentering reinterpreting event broadening ones perspective see bigger fictional reappraisal adopting emphasizing belief event real instance movie reappraisal shown effectively reduce emotional responding opposed distraction individuals show relative preference engage reappraisal facing stimuli low negative emotional intensity stimuli relatively easy appraise reappraisal generally considered adaptive emotion regulation strategy compared suppression including thought suppression expressive suppression positively correlated many psychological reappraisal associated better interpersonal outcomes positively related however researchers argue context important evaluating adaptiveness strategy suggesting contexts reappraisal may furthermore research shown reappraisal influence affect physiological responses recurrent distancing example cognitive change involves taking independent thirdperson perspective evaluating emotional distancing shown adaptive form selfreflection facilitating emotional processing negatively valenced reducing emotional cardiovascular reactivity negative stimuli increasing problemsolving humour example cognitive change shown effective emotion regulation strategy specifically positive goodnatured humour shown effectively upregulate positive emotion downregulate negative emotion hand negative meanspirited humour less effective response modulation involves attempts directly influence experiential behavioral physiological response expressive suppression example response modulation involves inhibiting emotional expressions shown effectively reduce facial expressivity subjective feelings positive emotion heart rate sympathetic activation however research findings mixed regarding whether strategy effective downregulating negative research also shown expressive suppression may negative social consequences correlating reduced personal connections greater difficulties forming expressive suppression generally considered maladaptive emotion regulation strategy compared reappraisal positively correlated many psychological associated worse interpersonal outcomes negatively related requires mobilization relatively substantial amount cognitive however researchers argue context important evaluating adaptiveness strategy suggesting contexts suppression may drug use example response modulation used alter emotionassociated physiological responses example alcohol produce sedative anxiolytic beta blockers affect sympathetic exercise example response modulation used downregulate physiological experiential effects negative regular physical activity also shown reduce emotional distress improve emotional sleep plays role emotion regulation although stress worry also interfere sleep studies shown sleep specifically rem sleep downregulates reactivity amygdala brain structure known involved processing emotions response previous emotional flip side sleep deprivation associated greater emotional reactivity overreaction negative stressful stimuli result increased amygdala activity disconnect amygdala prefrontal cortex regulates amygdala inhibition together resulting overactive emotional due subsequent lack emotional control sleep deprivation may associated depression impulsivity mood swings additionally evidence sleep deprivation may reduce emotional reactivity positive stimuli events impair emotion recognition emotion regulation strategies taught emotion regulation problems treated variety counseling psychotherapy approaches including cognitive behavioral therapy cbt dialectical behavior therapy dbt emotionfocused therapy eft mindfulnessbased cognitive therapy example relevant mnemonic formulated dbt abc intrinsic emotion regulation efforts infancy believed guided primarily innate physiological response systems usually manifest approach towards avoidance pleasant unpleasant stimuli three months infants engage selfsoothing behaviors like sucking reflexively respond signal feelings instance infants observed attempting suppress anger sadness knitting brow compressing three six months basic motor functioning attentional mechanisms begin play role emotion regulation allowing infants effectively approach avoid emotionally relevant infants may also engage selfdistraction helpseeking behaviors regulatory one year infants able navigate surroundings actively respond emotional stimuli greater flexibility due improved motor also begin appreciate caregivers abilities provide regulatory instance infants generally difficulties regulating result often find ways express fear ways attract comfort attention extrinsic emotion regulation efforts caregivers including situation selection modification distraction particularly important emotion regulation strategies employed caregivers attenuate distress upregulate positive affect infants impact infants emotional behavioral development teaching particular strategies methods type attachment style caregiver infant therefore play meaningful role regulatory strategies infants may learn recent evidence supports idea maternal singing positive effect affect regulation singing playsongs wheels bus shell coming round mountain visible affectregulatory consequence prolonged positive affect even alleviation distress addition proven facilitation social bonding combined movement andor rhythmic touch maternal singing affect regulation possible applications infants nicu adult caregivers serious personality adjustment difficulties end first year toddlers begin adopt new strategies decrease negative arousal strategies include rocking chewing objects moving away things upset two years toddlers become capable actively employing emotion regulation apply certain emotion regulation tactics influence various emotional additionally maturation brain functioning language motor skills permits toddlers manage emotional responses levels arousal extrinsic emotion regulation remains important emotional development toddlerhood toddlers learn ways caregivers control emotions example caregivers help teach selfregulation methods distracting children unpleasant events like vaccination shot helping understand frightening emotion regulation knowledge becomes substantial childhood example children aged six ten begin understand display rules come appreciate contexts certain emotional expressions socially appropriate therefore ought regulated example children may understand upon receiving gift display smile irrespective actual feelings childhood also trend towards use cognitive emotion regulation strategies taking place basic distraction approach avoidance regarding development emotion dysregulation children one robust finding suggests children frequently exposed negative emotion home likely display difficulties regulating high levels negative adolescents show marked increase capacities regulate emotions emotion regulation decision making becomes complex depending multiple factors particular significance interpersonal outcomes increases adolescents regulating emotions adolescents therefore likely take account social instance adolescents show tendency display emotion expect sympathetic response additionally spontaneous use cognitive emotion regulation strategies increases adolescence evidenced selfreport neural social losses increase health tends decrease people age people get older motivation seek emotional meaning life social ties tends autonomic responsiveness decreases age emotion regulation skill tends emotional regulation adulthood also examined terms positive negative positive negative affectivity refers types emotions felt individual well way emotions adulthood comes increased ability maintain high positive affectivity low negative affectivity rapidly adolescents response lifes challenges seems become automatized people progress throughout thus individuals age capability selfregulating emotions responding emotions healthy ways additionally emotional regulation may vary young adults older adults younger adults found successful older adults practicing cognitive reappraisal decrease negative internal hand older adults found successful following emotional regulation people age affect way react emotions changes either positively negatively studies show positive affect increases person grows adolescence mid negative affect hand decreases mid studies also show emotions differ adulthood particularly affect positive negative although studies found individuals experience less affect grow older studies concluded adults middle age experience positive affect less negative affect younger adults positive affect also higher men women negative affect higher women men also single people reason older people middle adulthood might less negative affect overcome trials vicissitudes youth may increasingly experience pleasant balance affect least positive affect might rise middle age towards later years life begins decline negative affect also might due failing health reaching end lives death friends addition baseline levels positive negative affect studies found individual differences timecourse emotional responses stimuli temporal dynamics emotion regulation also known affective chronometry include two key variables emotional response process rise time peak emotional response recovery time baseline levels studies affective chronometry typically separate positive negative affect distinct categories previous research shown despite correlation ability humans experience changes categories independently one affective chronometry research conducted clinical populations anxiety mood personality disorders also utilized measurement test effectiveness different therapeutic techniques including mindfulness training emotional development functional magnetic resonance imaging allowed study emotion regulation biological level specifically research last decade strongly suggests neural sufficient evidence correlated emotion regulation particular patterns prefrontal activation regions include orbital prefrontal cortex ventromedial prefrontal cortex dorsolateral prefrontal cortex two additional brain structures found contribute amygdala anterior cingulate structures involved various facets emotion regulation irregularities one regions andor interconnections among affiliated failures emotion regulation implication findings individual differences prefrontal activation predict ability perform various tasks aspects emotion people intuitively mimic facial expressions fundamental part healthy functioning similarities across cultures regards nonverbal communication prompted debate fact universal argued emotion regulation plays key role ability generate correct responses social situations humans control facial expressions consciously unconsciously intrinsic emotion program generated result transaction world immediately results emotional response usually facial well documented phenomenon emotions effect facial expression recent research provided evidence opposite may also notion would give rise belief person may control emotion fact influence well emotion regulation focuses providing appropriate emotion appropriate circumstances theories allude thought emotion serves specific purpose coordinating organismic needs environmental demands cole skill although apparent throughout shown vary successful application different age groups experiments done comparing younger older adults unpleasant stimuli older adults able regulate emotional reactions way seemed avoid negative findings support theory time people
