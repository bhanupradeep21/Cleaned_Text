stages middle late jurassic consists nearly complete articulated skeleton extensive softtissues preserved main counter slab housed nanjing university nanjing specimen first reported unnamed anurognathid december zixiao yang colleagues along another anurognathid specimen description analysis specimens integumentary would fully described yang colleagues wherein diagnosed new genus species cascocauda rong generic name derived latin cascus meaning ancient primitive cauda meaning tail specific name chinese character róng 绒絨 derived phrase máo róng róng 毛绒绒毛絨絨 means fluffy appearance thus full binomial name translates fluffy ancient like anurognathids cascocauda small pterosaur short wide skull froglike jaws large eyes broad wings short tail known specimen wingspan millimetres although individual immature likely finished growing skull wider long mm long vs mm wide poorly preserved although ascending processes jaw separating naris antorbital fenestra orbit appear visible right side teeth long mm thin mm midpoint smooth surfaces curved towards tips least nineteen teeth present upper vertebrae crushed obscured neck visibly short least ten dorsal vertebrae visible short broad sacral vertebrae three rows gastralia also preserved ribcage tail better preserved relatively long compared anurognathids length millimetres bearing least caudal vertebrae vertebrae start around mm long base tail increase length mm near midpoint shortening towards tail tip midcaudals also bear long zygapophyses connecting vertebrae long chevrons least twice length main vertebral centrum similar batrachognathinae sinomacrops unlike shortertailed scapula slightly longer coracoid length ratio together join vshape form angle approximately humerus robust subtriangularly shaped deltopectoral crest unlike batrachognathines slightly curved unlike straight radius ulna radius ulna much longer humerus slightly shorter first phalanx digit bone wingfinger roughly equal length second phalanx remaining

long roughly equal length longest toe bones penultimate phalanges claws fifth toe supporting cruropatagium legs much shorter robust metatarsal first phalanx robust straight second slender slightly curved claws feet wings similar shape sharply curved wing claws larger cascocauda almost entirely covered extensive coat furlike filaments known pterosaurs pycnofibres appear come two types first simple curved filaments range length mm long filaments cover animal including head neck body limbs tail second type consists tufts filaments joined near base similar branching feathers birds coelurosaurian dinosaurs around mm long cover wing membranes studies sampled pycnofibres revealed presence microbodies within filaments resembling melanosome pigments identified fossil integuments specifically phaeomelanosomes furthermore infrared spectral analysis pycnofibres show similar absorption spectra red human hair pycnofibres likely provided insulation may helped streamline body wings identity branching structures pycnofibres feathers challenged unwin martill interpreted bunchedup degraded fibres found wing membrane attributed melanosomes keratin skin rather claims refuted yang colleagues argue unwin martills interpretations inconsistent specimens preservation namely argue consistent structure regular spacing extension filaments beyond wing membrane support identification pycnofibres argue restriction melanosomes keratin fibres occurs fossil dinosaur feathers supports case filaments consistent contamination preserved compared coat pycnofibres wing membranes patagia well preserved locally discernible initially reported anurognathid undetermined species although yang colleagues recognised specimen showed similarities jeholopterus dendrorhynchoides local biota considered likely juvenile one however later analysis anurognathid proportions change growth allometry yang et al demonstrated proportions cascocauda distinct anurognathids irrespective juvenile therefore belonged new phylogenetic analysis performed study found cascocauda member subfamily batrachognathinae clade relatively longtailed anurognathids potentially primitive trait compared shorttailed derived simplified version results shown cladogram cascocauda rong sinomacrops bondei batrachognathus volans luopterus mutoudengensis dendrorhynchoides curvidentatus anurognathus ammoni vesperopterylus lamadongensis jeholopterus ninchengensis known specimen cascocauda believed juvenile based features skeleton indicate immaturity namely articular bones carpals wing scapula coracoid shoulder unfused articular surfaces limb joints rough pitted indicative incomplete bone growth based allometric growth pattern suggested throughout life anurognathids like cascocauda little change lifestyle flying arboreal insectivores possibly consuming preys consistent size ontogenetically consistent lifestyle would retained plesiomorphic traits juvenile later
