moghreberia extinct genus dicynodont predicted lived midtriassic primarily early middle carnian found angara basin moghreberia belonged stahleckeriidae family group anomodont therapsids commonly known species moghreberia name derived arabic phrase almaghrib alaqsa meaning far west term used arabic scholars refer approximate region morocco area animal fossil first extinction many dicynodonts attributed pressures carnian pluvial episode occurred around generated major ecological climate changes years first remains moghreberia included two poorly preserved skulls discovered irohalene member section timezgadiouine formation argana basin modernday irohalene member characterized abundant vertebrate fauna remains footprints including members dinosauromorpha crocodilianstem archosaurs phytosaurs lepidosauromorphs archosauromorphs well actinopterygians argana basin western part high atlas morocco consists three distinct formations known timezgadiouine ikakern bigoudine formations like moghreberia nmachouensis dicynodont remains region found timezgadiouine formation geology formation suggests dry humid climate shallow stillbodied discovery initial two skulls argana basin remains first detailed genus species named jm dutuit emphasized similarities kannemeyerids dutuit detailed genus using wellpreserved partial cranial remains discovered argana basin well using new fossil initially categorized moghreberia kannemeyeridae dutuit however recognize similarities moghreberia north american genus placerias within family observation later supported computerassisted phylogenetic analysis kammerer et al concluded moghreberia closely related placerias placing stahleckeriidae opposed established moghreberia close relative stahleckeria ischigualastia angonisaurus addition based isolated cranial elements complete lack postcranial remains taxonomic validity moghreberia highly debated authors claimed sister taxon placerias previously whereas others claimed merely synonym placerias one taxonomic validity reanalyzed gap phylogenetic positioning closed first postcranial analysis moghreberia nmachouensis made possible due discovery nearly complete skeleton individual analysis concluded moghreberia fact phylogenetically unique likely closely related lisowicia poland north american various examinations analyses cranial postcranial elements outlined characteristics displayed moghreberia fossils initial primary analysis moghreberia skulls dutuit listed multiple unique features moghreberia cranial elements helping distinguish dicynodonts genus characterized low dorsoventrally laterally expanded occipital surface well primarily horizontal lateral mandibular branches dutuit also noted highly pointed tip snout dorsal margin erupted portion canine tusk anterior nasal cavity skull overall relatively large narrow dicynodont measuring cm small lateral expansion squamosals evident genus also characterized highly angled intertemporal bar elongate posterior parietal processes deeply depressed preparietal two cranial elements helping distinguish moghreberia placerias include lack caniniform depression elongate postnarial stahleckeriidae family moghreberia exhibits blunt snout opposed rounded snouts kennemeyeriidae former shape one seen moghreberia common among dicynodonts despite fact family stahleckeriidae defined tuskless moghreberia like close relative placerias fact large tusks protruding anterior naval cavity skull fact moghreberia complete absence teeth besides paired maxillary dicynodont tusks hypothesized display purposes triassic dicynodont implies likely evergrowing composed thick dentine walls enamel cap roots growing deep maxilla larger individuals like moghreberia exhibit narrowing pulp cavity discovery nearly complete skeleton moghreberia postcranial elements could finally observed officially detailed chloe olivier moghreberia overall large dicynodont vertebrae moghreberia determined amphicoelous antiorly posteriorly concave due decreased obtuse angles zygopophyses dorsal vertebrae genus would less flexible lateral movement also confirmed moghreberia five sacral vertebrae accompanied five sacral ribs due large size difference first fifth caudal vertebrae predicted caudal vertebrae size rapidly decreases towards scapula specimen elongate enlarged dorsal even enlarged ventral regions precoracoid coracoid anteriorly fused scapula coracoid foramen clearly noticeable interclavicle characterized triangular anterior region longer posterior region sternum exhibits sternal bosses presenting anterodorsal rounded surface moghreberia member placeriinae displayed distinct posterior projection posterior surface isolated unfused ilium ischium pubis indicate flexible pelvis moghreberia articular process ischia described stout ventrally constricted pubic tubercle made thick process extending pubis members stahlekeriidae like dicynodonts herbivorous postulated stahlekeriidae also browsers opposed grazers feeding head height characteristic broad snout moghreberia stahlekeriidae implies lack precision selectivity feeding possible narrow snouts kannemeyeridae tusks moghreberia thought serve display purposes rather feeding also hypothesized moghreberia endothermic making one earliest endotherms discovered studies rey et al focused oxygen isotopes fibrolamellar bone make determination oxygen occurs two isotopes tissue temperature dependent oxygen isotope occurs greater amounts greater body temperatures moghreberia found high relative levels isotope implying increased body temperature increased metabolic additionally fibrolamellar bone used evidence sustained fast growth moghreberia found possess fibrolamellar bone suggesting relatively high metabolic rate able support olivier conducted similar analysis fibrolamellar bone femur humerus found relatively high levels used compute relatively high metabolic anomodontrelated article stub
