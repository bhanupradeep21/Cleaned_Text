personal information collected point registration subsequently used purely contact potentially infected additionally users able opt time clearing personal information contact tracing mechanism executed locally individuals device using bluetooth storing encounters contact history log chronicling contact past users contact logs identified using anonymous timeshifting temporary ids issued central department health doh server consequently users identity contact patterns determined anyone authorised doh furthermore since temporary ids change regular basis malicious third parties track

closer metres ft app actually indiscriminately logs encounters health authority receives contact log filtered encounters within bluetraces employment centralised reporting architecture created concerns privacy centralised report processing protocol user must upload entire contact log health authority administered server health authority responsible matching log entries contact details ascertaining potential contact ultimately warning users potential contrast exposure notification framework decentralised reporting protocols still central reporting server delegate responsibility processing logs clients network instead client uploading contact history uploads number encounter tokens derived clients check tokens local contact logs determine come contact infected inherent fact protocol never allows government access contact logs approach major privacy benefits however method also presents issues primarily lack human loop reporting leading higher occurrence false decentralised reporting protocols also less mature centralised may senate select committee public hearing covidsafe digital transformation agency dta announced looking transitioning protocol bluetrace google apple developed exposure notification framework change proposed resolve outstanding issues related performance thirdparty protocols ios unlike bluetrace exposure notification frameworks runs operating system level special privileges available thirdparty adoption framework endorsed multiple technology transitioning bluetrace enf presented several issues notably app run protocols protocol change would hard cut versions would result app longer functioning users yet updated enf version app additionally two protocols almost completely meaning vast majority ui covidsafe app would redeveloped similarly change centralised reporting mechanism decentralised one little existing server software would role state territory health authorities process would also change significantly

project held june deputy chief medical officer dr nick coatsworth stated covidsafe would absolutely transition reasoned government would never transition contact tracing solution without humanintheloop something decentralised protocol support versions covidsafe ios scan devices application placed background resulting far fewer recorded contacts possible later corrected version additionally june update bug existed locked ios devices unable fetch new temporary devices collected hour pools temporary ids advance meaning device could easily exhaust pool unless phone unlocked
