metolazone thiazidelike diuretic marketed brand names zytanix metoz zaroxolyn mykrox primarily used treat congestive heart failure high blood pressure metolazone indirectly decreases amount water reabsorbed bloodstream kidney blood volume decreases urine volume increases lowers blood pressure prevents excess fluid accumulation heart failure metolazone sometimes used together loop diuretics furosemide bumetanide highly effective combinations lead dehydration electrolyte abnormalities patented approved medical use one primary uses metolazone treating edema fluid retention associated congestive heart failure chf mild heart failure metolazone another diuretic may used alone combined diuretics moderate severe heart failure addition preventing fluid buildup use metolazone may allow patient relax amount sodium restriction required although thiazide diuretics lose effectiveness kidney failure metolazone remains active even glomerular filtration rate gfr mlmin moderate chronic kidney diseasecitation needed gives considerable advantage thiazide diuretics since renal heart failure often coexist contribute fluid metolazone may also used kidney disease chronic kidney disease nephrotic syndrome chronic kidney disease causes excess fluid retention often treated diet adjustments metolazone may combined diuretics typically loop diuretics treat diuretic resistance congestive heart failure chronic kidney disease nephrotic metolazone loop diuretic synergistically enhance diuresis use either agent alone using combination diuretic effects occur two different segments nephron namely loop diuretic act loop henle metolazone act distal convoluted tubule metolazone frequently prescribed addition loop diuretic metolazone may used edema caused liver cirrhosis well major use metolazone treating hypertension high blood pressure thiazide diuretics though usually metolazone often used alone firstline treatment mild hypertension also used combination drugs difficulttotreat severe hypertension seventh report joint national committee prevention detection evaluation treatment high blood pressure jnc recommends thiazide diuretics initial medication treatment hypertension hydrochlorothiazide far commonly used betterstudied cheaper four times metolazone although mentioned metolazone used patients moderate chronic kidney since thiazide diuretics affect transport electrolytes water kidney responsible abnormalities water balance electrolyte levels removal much fluid cause volume depletion hypotension various electrolyte abnormalities may result including hyponatremia low sodium hypokalemia low potassium hypochloremia low chloride hypomagnesemia low magnesium hypercalcemia high calcium hyperuricemia high uric acid may result dizziness headache heart arrhythmias serious though rare side effects include aplastic anemia pancreatitis agranulocytosis angioedema metolazone like thiazide diuretics may unmask latent diabetes mellitus exacerbate gout especially interacting medicines used treat gout addition thiazide diuretics including metolazone sulfonamides hypersensitivity sulfonamides sulfa allergy may also allergic primary target thiazide diuretics including metolazone distal convoluted tubule part nephron kidney inhibit sodiumchloride symporter kidney blood filtered lumen open space nephron tubule whatever remains tubule travel bladder urine eventually excreted cells lining tubule modify fluid inside absorbing material excreting others one side cell apical side faces lumen opposite side basolateral side faces interstitial space near blood vessels sides tightly joined neighboring cells regions tubule cells distal convoluted tubule possess atppowered sodiumpotassium antiporter nakatpase uses energy atp transfer three sodium ions basolateral surface toward blood vessels simultaneously transferring two potassium ions distal convoluted tubule cells also possess sodiumchloride symporter apical side passively allows one sodium ion one chloride ion diffuse together lumen urine forming cell interior sodium pumped cell atpase intracellular concentration falls additional sodium begins diffuse tubule lumen replacement symporter requires chloride transported well water passively follows maintain isotonicity excess chloride potassium passively diffuse cell basolateral channels interstitial space water accompanies water chloride well sodium pumped atpase absorbed bloodstream metolazone thiazide diuretics inhibit function sodiumchloride symporter preventing sodium chloride therefore water leaving lumen enter tubule cell result water remains lumen excreted urine instead reabsorbed bloodstream since sodium lumen already reabsorbed time filtrate reaches distal convoluted tubule thiazide diuretics limited effects water balance electrolyte nevertheless associated low sodium levels volume depletion low blood pressure among adverse effects metolazone available oral preparations approximately amount ingested becomes available bloodstream halflife approximately fourteen hours similar indapamide considerably longer hydrochlorothiazide metolazone around ten times potent hydrochlorothiazide primary form excretion urine around remaining fifth evenly split biliary excretion metabolism inactive use activated anthranilic acid derivatives facilitates preparation amides cases amines either unreactive

acetic anhydride reaction sodium borohydride presence aluminum chloride selectively reduces double bond yield diuretic agent metolazone metolazone quinazoline derivative similar diuretic quinethazone well sulfonamide related analogs benzothiadiazine drugs called benzothiadiazides thiazides short however terms chemistry metolazone substituted benzothiadiazine therefore technically thiazide since metolazone well drugs like indapamide acts target thiazides behave similar pharmacologic fashion however considered thiazidelike diuretic therefore metolazone similar drugs often categorized thiazide diuretics despite thiazides metolazone developed creator indian born chemist dr bola vithal shetty active helping us food drug administration review drug applications development new metolazone quickly gained popularity due lower kidney toxicity compared diuretics especially thiazides patients chronic kidney disease httpsenwikipediaorgwikimetolazone
