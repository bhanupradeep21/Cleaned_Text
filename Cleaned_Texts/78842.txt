behavioral plasticity refers change organisms behavior results exposure stimuli changing environmental behavior change rapidly response changes internal external stimuli case morphological traits many physiological traits result organisms confronted new conditions behavioral changes often occur advance physiological morphological changes instance larval amphibians changed antipredator behavior within hour change cues predators morphological changes body tail shape response cues required week many years ethologists studied ways behavior change response changes external stimuli changes internal state parallel literature psychologists studying learning cognition spent years documenting many ways experiences past affect behavior individual expresses current interest behavioral plasticity gained prominence recently example type phenotypic plasticity major consequences evolutionary behavioral plasticity broadly organized two types exogenous exogenous plasticity refers changes behavioral phenotype ie observable behaviors caused external stimulus experience environment endogenous plasticity encompasses plastic responses result changes internal cues genotype circadian rhythms menstruation two broad categories broken two important classifications external stimulus elicits activates immediate response immediate effect behavior organism demonstrating contextual form plasticity highlights concept external stimuli given context activate neural hormonal mechanisms pathways already exist inside contrast organisms current behavior altered past experiences animal said exhibiting developmental innate behavioral form plasticity generally thought require new neuronal pathways form developmental behavioral plasticity corresponds commonly used definition plasticity single genotype express one behavioral phenotype result different developmental routes triggered differences past experiences developmental plasticity thus includes referred learning however developmental plasticity also includes developmental changes morphology physiology relevant particular behavior changes muscles limbs bones influence foraging locomotion throughout organisms major difference developmental contextual plasticity inherent tradeoff time interpreting stimulus exhibiting behavior contextual plasticity near immediate response environment underlying hormonal networksneuronal pathways already present matter activating contrast developmental plasticity requires internal changes hormonal networks neuronal pathways result developmental plasticity often although always slower process contextual plasticity instance habituation type learning developmental plasticity occur within short period time one advantages developmental behavioral plasticity occurs extended periods time changes occur concert changes morphological physiological traits cases set external internal stimuli lead coordinated changes suites behavioral morphological physiological traits contextual plasticity typically studied presenting individual different external stimuli recording responses stimulus instance ants rapidly alter running speed response changes external another example contextual plasticity occurs birds change vocalizations response changes pitch intensity background noise contextual plasticity plays major role studies mate preference subject exposed cues different mates response cue quantified case stronger attractive response particular cue assumed reflect preference mates cue developmental plasticity encompasses many ways experiences organisms past affect current behavior developmental plasticity thus includes learning acclimation situation environmental conditions early life affects behavior expressed later life also called ontogenetic since given individual raised one set conditions ontogenetic plasticity studied dividing matched individuals two groups rearing group different set conditions instance experimental design used demonstrate density moth larvae raised affected courtship signals produced endogenous plasticity includes circadian rhythms circannual rhythms agedependent changes behavior good example endogenous plasticity occurs zebrafish danio rerio larval zebrafish exhibit circadian rhythms responsiveness light even maintained continuous darkness fish much responsive changes light ie higher contextual plasticity subjective day subjective another example involves changes individuals behavior hormonal profile around time sexual maturity changes affected changes physiology occurred months years earlier useful distinction make looking behavioral plasticity potential realized plasticity potential plasticity refers ability given phenotypic trait vary response variation stimuli experiences environmental conditions thus potential plasticity theoretical range behavioral plasticity could expressed value never truly known serves baseline plasticity models realized plasticity hand refers extent given phenotype actually varies response changes specific stimulus experience environmental condition recent studies animals documented individual differences virtually different types behavioral plasticities described addition behavioral plasticities may developmentally plastic individual differences type plasticity expressed given age may affected conditions subjects exposed earlier life variety species instance social cues juvenile period affect contextual plasticity responses cues potential mates case many types plasticity researchers studying development individual differences behavioral plasticity found genes prior experiences interactions factors contribute individual differences behavioral plasticity expressed given age lifestage another question currently attracting interest students animal human behavior whether different types behavioral plasticities correlated one another across individuals ie whether individuals generally plastic others although evidence certain types cognitive traits tend positively correlated one another across individuals see g factor humans present scant evidence types plasticity eg contextual plasticity ontogenetic plasticity correlated one another across individuals genotypes humans animals behavioral plasticity major impacts evolutionary fitness individual developmental contextual plasticity influence fitness animal novel environment increasing probability animal survive environment developmental plasticity particularly important terms survival novel environments trialanderror processes learning encompass phenotype sampling environmental feedback ability immediately shift entire population close new adaptive norm ability express level behavioral plasticity advantageous fluctuating environments animals
