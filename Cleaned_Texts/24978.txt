rectal foreign bodies large foreign items found rectum assumed inserted anus rather reaching rectum via mouth gastrointestinal tract clinical relevance patient remove way intended smaller ingested foreign bodies bones eaten food sometimes found stuck rectum upon xray rarely clinical relevance rectal foreign bodies subgroup foreign bodies alimentary foreign body big allow feces colon pass mechanical ileus may occur distension rectum disruption peristasis reinforce effect foreign body may cause infections destroying intestinal wall depending location perforation may lead peritonitis due feces abscess retroperitoneal space smaller objects injure intestinal wall perforate may encapsulated foreign body granuloma may remain rectum pseudotumor without effects common still rare complication perforation rectum caused foreign object attempts remove diagnosed perforations operated immediately opening abdomen removal suturing perforated area order suppress infections antibiotics often temporary ileostomy necessary protect contrast medium applied enema proves complete healing perforated area ileostomy reversed usually takes three six average hospitalization medical literature describes deaths due rectal foreign bodies rare usually classified autoerotic fatality patient died due rectal perforation caused mentally ill person using another middleaged patient died due rectal perforation vibrator perforation sutured patient received intensive medical care contracted acute respiratory distress syndrome systemic inflammatory response syndrome due trauma resulting multiple organ dysfunction syndrome paper describing death perforation rectum nursed surgical procedure healing complete man operated twice order remove foreign body cucumber parsnip died due peritonitis inserted two apples rectum wound reasons foreign rectal bodies vary wildly cases sexual criminal foreign body inserted voluntarily vast majority cases especially includes sexually motivated behaviour encompassing majority cases bodypacking ie illegal transport drugs within body orifice inside rectum another potentially voluntary reason insertion foreign rectal includes attempts transport objects like weapons including knives ammunition according one study sexual stimulation responsible clinically relevant foreign rectal bodies cases due sexual rare cases patient inserted object rectum without way remove intending receive attention pity doctors nurses behaviour categorized munchausens another cause may attempted selftreatment diseases one patient attempted treat chronic diarrhea inserting ear maize another patient tried soothe itching due hemorrhoids pruritus ani toothbrush toothbrush went control disappeared inside accidents torture may cause involuntary insertion foreign mercury medical thermometer inserted anus order measure temperature broke inside example foreign rectal body due ancient greece knew rhaphanidosis punishment male adulterers involved insertion radish anus many selfinserted rectal bodies stated accidentally patients due feelings shame several reasons contribute jamming rectal bodies inside rectum many objects used sexual stimulation conical tip order facilitate penetration base flat extraction user may impossible base object passed anus towards rectum order receive stronger stimulation object may inserted deeper intended case sphincter prevents mechanical means extraction foreign way foreign body travel digestive system oral intake passage entire intestines happens often rarely medically relevant constrictions esophagus cardia pylorus ileocecal valve tend cause issues organs provided foreign body large enough issue foreign bodies may still pass narrows may cause medically relevant issues ie toothpicks bones especially ie chickens cause two thirds intestinal plantbased food especially seeds like watermelon sunflower pumpkin seed may clump together inside lower intestines form bezoars may grow big normal anal passage thus becoming clinically relevant kind rectal foreign body happens chiefly children especially northern africa middle east seeds form elemental part rare cases seeds inside bezoar may germinate inside lower intestines rectum causing type size foreign rectal bodies diverse may exceed anatomicalphysiological objects documented literature include objects solid case documented patient administered cement enema solidified impacted resulting block surgically another extreme case occurred november depressed man inserted cm long cardboard tube rectum tossed lighted firecracker tubes opening resulting large hole many patients feel ashamed anamnesis provide information reluctantly may lead missing information may important therapy reason patients may visit doctor late trusting sensitive care ashamed uncomfortable patients paramount successful may usually several radiological images recorded order pinpoint precise place depth foreign body usually done xray foreign bodies made lowcontrast material eg plastics may necessitate medical ultrasound ct magnetic resonance imaging contraindicated especially foreign body unknown foreign rectal bodies may penetrate deep colon certain circumstances right colic endoscopy may also use therapy facilitates identification localisation object inside information foreign body obtained ways high importance therapy perforation rectum anus absolutely avoided therapeutic measures remove foreign body diverse objects inside rectum many instances foreign bodies consist fragile materials glass patients wait several hours even days visit doctor often repeatedly try remove object layperson often worsens situation successful extraction cases foreign body removed endoscopically vibrators example often removed using large sling usually used remove polyps flexible endoscope help large jammed objects may preferable use rigid tools several cases instruments used child birth proven worth removal foreign bodies suction wooden objects retrieved corkscrews drinking glasses filling spoon used anchor leaving inside glass plaster filling removing together light bulbs encased gauze shroud shattered inside rectum successful cases using argonplasma coagulation object question green apple wrapped cellophane inside rectum patient argonbeam coagulation shrunk apple enabling removal previous extraction attempts using endoscopic tools failed due flat surface object far area colon sigmoideum removed using one methods bed rest sedation cause object descend back rectum retrieval extraction difficult cases laparotomy may necessary statistically case percent large intestine manipulated inside abdominal cavity making possible wander direction anus grabbed surgical opening large intestines indication difficult cases especially manipulation object may pose serious health risk may case jammed drug mild cases may need sedation local spinal anaesthesia find common use difficult interventions may need general anaesthesia surgical opening abdominal cavity colon require general anaesthesia beneficial relaxation surgery sigmoidoscopy colonoscopy focused first cm colon good practice order rule possible perforation injury rectum colon stationary aftercare may indicated reliable data incidence clinically meaningful foreign rectal bodies may increased long observed often recent incident rate significantly higher men women gender ratio area metastudy year found ratio median age patients years standard deviation rectal foreign bodies unusual occurrence hospital emergency first documented case dates foreign rectal
