advised physical therapists keep new findings stay close contact orthopaedic surgeon best idea approach patients following surgery crutches used six weeks expectation return activities running least period six things note rehabilitation occurs important know size placement tear usually four phases rehabilitation process noted phase initial exercises weeks phase ii intermediate exercises weeks phase iii advanced exercises weeks phase iv return sports weeks physical therapy regimens individualized person person based adequate phase rehabilitation process first objective minimize pain inflammation important begin conducting small motion exercises weight bearing capacity patient symmetrical gait pattern imperative create imbalance muscles hip aquatic therapy highly encouraged looked upon due ability help patient move freely without pressure gravity progress phase ii rehabilitation process patients able complete straight leg raises lying side strengthen sartorius tensor fasciate latae muscles build support leg phase ii physical therapist trying promote flexibility soft tissue emphasis beginning aspects strength training adding resistance time order progress phase iii patient able demonstrate normal gait pattern minimal pain exercises like single leg bridging help strengthen hamstring muscles help leg equality phase iii focus begin building functional strength movements include single leg exercises build muscle challenge strength hip order progress phase iv flexibility patient adequate phase iv final stage physical therapist would assess prescribe exercise patient ready return usually therapist would start using complex movements like squatting kicking running therapist would look symmetrical movements sides body without pain patient demonstrates symmetrical movements without pain physical therapist would use discretion patients clearance things avoid rehabilitating sitting knees lower hips legs crossed hip rotated sitting edge seat contracting hip flexor

labrum allowing fluid leak deform applied load significant viscoelasticity hip labrum acts shock absorber joint lubricator stabilizer pressure essential warm possible better prepared prevent hip labrum tear body weight squats great example stretching warming body induce creep exercise stretch right hip flexor iliopsoas make sure weight bearing knee left go past toes want lean forward good stretch hold seconds b starting position side lying hip abduction want comfortable position slowly lift top leg right straight perform one set repetitions man body weight squat added weights body allowing warm legs properly great way induce creep cartilage muscles prepare intense exercise strain vs time graph three stages creep strain slowly rises almost becomes constant constant stress
