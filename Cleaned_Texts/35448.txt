sexual selection arabidopsis thaliana mode natural selection flowering plant arabidopsis thaliana selects mates maximize reproductive success arabidopsis thaliana small flowering land plant family brassicaceae utilized model organism genetic plants genomics well understood little known sexual selection processes sexbiased genes species found genes associate sexually dimorphic traits males females considering sexes species similar genes preferentially expressed different sexes within species tend provide accelerated rate evolution resulting specific sex expressing optimum phenotype maximize thaliana selffertilizing plant without sex chromosomes capable utilizing sexbiased genes potentially aid adaptive little knowledge sexbiased genes function thalianas thaliana discovered harz mountains native range stretches rough terrain across eurasia also established north america thaliana identified model organism genomic studies due small genome consisting thaliana relatively short life cycle taking approximately weeks reach full maturity short life cycle makes ideal candidate model organism genomic studies sexbiased genes genes expression exclusive one sex provide potential means rapid evolution male female sexbiased genes thaliana major differences expression male genes expressed pollen tube regions plant struggle initiation protein result newly developed mutations acted upon positive female gametophytes differ significantly utilized number sexually expressed genes compared looking types gametophytes males females shared approximately genes expressed similar also found genes thaliana associated male gametophyte consisting linked sperm cells pollen pollen hand approximately genes identified associate female genes identified tissues thaliana able separated categorized based location function male female reproductive male reproductive organs plant much easier utilized experimental procedures due capability easily isolated plant compared female genes linked pollen pollen production show strong coexpression due classification duplicated genes across various identified genes associated pollen pollen tubes relatively high number expressed polymorphisms purifying identifiable features adaptive evolution expressed pollen associated genes comparable increased levels adaptive evolution comparable adaptation regulated mutation rates sexbiased genes associated male organs plant could show higher adaptation rates due presence haploid haploid state mutations directly exposed opportunity rapid pollen interactions associated sporophytic tissue expressed genes linked female reproductive organs mechanisms involved pollen formation development pollen tube important pollen selection well protein composition pollen surface proteins produced sporophytic tissue anther expressed higher levels purified selection increase adaptive evolution oleopollenins thaliana selfpollinating plant compared closely related species meaning require pollen plants selfpollination provides effective means plants colonize new habitats effectively rely pollen another member carrying male female reproductive organs effort sexual reproduction greatly diminished comes implementation selfpollination significantly reduces genetic variation population established population identical progeny presents limited opportunity evolution genomic level throughout plant combats utilization male female sex organs provides environment low rates outcrossing sexbiased result low genetic variations thaliana gametophytes selffertilization comes low rates low rates outcrossing overcome variations heterogeneity happen based rare occurrence outcrossing thaliana occurs wild found rare occurrences outcrossing high given researchers believe even occurrence high enough rate initiate genetic consistencies associate sexual selection presence pollen competition outcrossing occurs plant utilizes selffertilization allows recognition selection different pollen grains fertilize ovule thaliana closely related arabidopsis lyrata one diverged although speciation separated species still capable providing means outcrossing initiating pollen competition within although competition occur among male gametophytes species lyrata low instances adaptive evolution compared evidence usually case instance pollen competition across similar species generally results increased rates outcrossing occurs generally much higher rates genetic variation little data lyrata results little knowledge whole genome determined interactions associated sporophytic tissue pollen exclusively expressed male gene therefore evidence suggests importance interactions understanding pollen selection potential factors play role pollen selection could secreted pollen proteins well protein major identified differences pollen associated genes compared reproductive tissues potentially underlying mechanisms correlated sexual selection occurring prezygotic stage underlies correlation selective pressure interactions pollen grains well pollen tube formation provide example established sexual thaliana provides effective means understand even organisms may appear limited genetic variation based reproductive strategies still maintain means evolution sexbiased genes sexual selection outcrossing httpsenwikipediaorgwikisexualselectioninarabidopsisthaliana
