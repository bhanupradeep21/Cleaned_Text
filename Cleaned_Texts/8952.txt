sauropod inhabited north america nearly year absence north american fossil record probably represents immigrant south america alamosaurus gigantic quadrupedal herbivore long neck long tail relatively long body least partly covered bony thomas holtz gave total length meters ft approximate weight tonnes short tons though complete remains come juvenile small adult specimens three fragmentary

relationships within group far certain issue complicated researchers rejecting name titanosauridae replacing saltasauridae one major analysis unites alamosaurus opisthocoelicaudia subgroup opisthocoelicaudiinae major competing analysis finds alamosaurus sister taxon pellegrinisaurus genera located outside scientists also noted particular similarities saltasaurid neuquensaurus brazilian trigonosaurus peiropolis titanosaur used many cladistic morphologic analyses recent analysis published anthony fiorillo ron tykoski indicates alamosaurus sister taxon lognkosauria therefore species futalognkosaurus mendozasaurus laying outside saltasauridae possibly descended close relations saltasauridae based synapomorphies cervical vertebral morphologies two cladistic study also suggests

sauropod hiatus nearly interval definite sauropod fossils known continent earliest fossils alamosaurus date maastrichtian age around million years ago rapidly became dominant large herbivore southern origins alamosaurus highly controversial three hypotheses proposed first termed austral immigrant proposes alamosaurus descended south american titanosaurs alamosaurus closely related south american titanosaurs alamosaurus appears north america time hadrosaurs closely related north american species first appear south america suggesting alamosaurus lineage crossed north america routes hadrosaurs crossed south austral immigrant hypothesis challenged grounds routes connecting north south america maastrichtian may consisted separate islands would presented challenges dispersal second scenario termed inland herbivore suggests titanosaurs present north america throughout late cretaceous apparent absence reflects relative rarity fossil sites preserving upland environments titanosaurs favored rather true absence however evidence sauropods north america midcenomanian early maastrichtian even strata preserve upland environments sauropods lived north america hiatus basal titanosauriforms sonorasaurus sauroposeidon lithostrotian third option austral immigrant scenario alamosaurus native north america originated asia instead south alamosaurus commonly considered closely related asian titanosaur opisthocoelicaudia based analyses take alamosauruss south american relative pellegrinisaurus though many dinosaurs crossed asia north america across bering land bridge sauropods poorly adapted highlatitude environments beringia would inhospitable environment furthermore order reach southern laramidia asia alamosaurus would cross northern laramidia contains known sauropod fossils
