autoregulation system disrupted hypertensives also increased cerebrovascular resistance puts greater risk developing cerebral ischemia blood flow decreases normotensive range hand sudden rapid rises blood pressure may cause hyperperfusion increased cerebral blood flow causing increased intracranial pressure cerebral edema increased risk intracranial heart increased arterial stiffness increased

hypertensive urgency treated parenterally whereas urgency recommended use oral anti hypertensives reduce risk hypotensive complications parenteral agents classified betablockers calcium channel
