quantitative behavioral new discipline uses mathematical statistical methodology understand behavioral biases conjunction valuation research grouped following areas prevalent theory financial markets second half century efficient market hypothesis emh states public information incorporated asset prices deviation true price quickly exploited informed traders attempt optimize returns restores true equilibrium price practical purposes market prices behave though traders pursuing selfinterest complete information rationality toward end century theory challenged several ways first number large market events cast doubt basic assumptions october dow jones average plunged single day many smaller stocks suffered deeper losses large oscillations ensuing days provided graph resembled famous crash crash provided puzzle challenge economists believed volatility exist age information capital flows much efficient decade continued japanese market soared heights far realistic assessment valuations priceearnings ratios soared triple digits nippon telephone telegraph achieved market valuation stock market price times number shares exceeded entire market capitalization west germany early nikkei index stood nearly doubled two years less year nikkei dropped nearly half peak meanwhile us growth new technology particularly internet spawned new generation high tech companies became publicly traded long profits japanese stock market bubble decade earlier stocks soared market valuations billions dollars sometimes even revenue bubble continued consequent bust reduced many stocks percent prior market value even large profitable tech companies lost value period large bubbles crashes absence significant changes valuation cast doubt assumption efficient markets incorporate public information accurately book irrational exuberance robert shiller discusses excesses plagued markets concludes stock prices move excess changes valuation line reasoning also confirmed several studies eg jeffrey pontiff closedend funds trade like stocks precise valuation reported frequently see seth anderson jeffrey born closedend fund pricing review papers relating issues addition world developments challenges classical economics emh came new field experimental economics pioneered vernon l smith nobel prize economics experiments collaboration gerry suchanek arlington williams david porter others featuring participants trading asset defined experimenters network computers series experiments involved single asset pays fixed dividend periods becomes worthless contrary expectations classical economics trading prices often soar levels much higher expected payout similarly experiments showed many expected results classical economics game theory borne experiments key part experiments participants earn real money consequence trading decisions experiment actual market rather survey opinion behavioral finance bf field grown past two decades part reaction phenomena described using variety methods researchers documented systematic biases eg underreaction overreaction etc occur among professional investors well novices behavioral finance researchers generally subscribe emh consequence biases however emh theorists counter emh makes precise prediction market based upon data bf usually go beyond saying emh wrong attempt quantify basic biases use mathematical models subject quantitative behavioral finance caginalp collaborators used statistical mathematical methods world market data experimental economics data order make quantitative predictions series papers dating back caginalp collaborators studied asset market dynamics using differential equations incorporate strategies biases investors price trend valuation within system finite cash asset feature distinct classical finance assumption infinite arbitrage one predictions theory caginalp balenovich larger supply cash per share would result larger bubble experiments caginalp porter smith confirmed doubling level cash example maintaining constant number shares essentially doubles magnitude bubble using differential equations predict experimental markets evolved also proved successful equations approximately accurate human forecasters selected best traders previous experiments caginalp porter smith challenge using ideas forecast price dynamics financial markets focus recent work merged two different mathematical methods differential equations used conjunction statistical methods provide short term forecasts one difficulties understanding dynamics financial markets presence noise fischer black random world events always making changes valuations difficult extract deterministic forces may present consequently many statistical studies shown negligible nonrandom component example poterba summers demonstrate tiny trend effect stock prices white showed using neural networks days ibm stock unsuccessful terms short term forecasts examples level noise changes valuation apparently exceeds possible behavioral effects methodology avoids pitfall developed past decade one subtract valuation varies time one study remaining behavioral effects early study along lines caginalp greg consantine studied ratio two clone closedend funds since funds portfolio traded independently ratio independent valuation statistical time series study showed ratio highly nonrandom best predictor tomorrow price today price suggested emh halfway price price trend subject overreactions also important behavioral finance phd duran examined data points daily prices closedend funds terms deviation net asset value nav funds exhibiting large deviation nav likely behave opposite direction subsequent day even interesting statistical observation large deviation opposite direction preceded large deviations precursors may suggest underlying cause large absence significant change due positioning traders advance anticipated news example suppose many traders anticipating positive news buy stock positive news materialize inclined sell large numbers thereby suppressing price significantly previous levels interpretation inconsistent emh consistent asset flow differential equations afde incorporate behavioral concepts finiteness assets research continues efforts optimize parameters asset flow equations order forecast near term prices see duran caginalp important classify behavior
