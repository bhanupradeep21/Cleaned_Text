chemotherapyinduced nausea vomiting cinv common sideeffect many cancer treatments nausea vomiting two feared cancer treatmentrelated side effects cancer patients families coates et al found patients receiving chemotherapy ranked nausea vomiting first second severe side effects respectively patients receiving highly emetogenic agents era postponed even refused potentially curative since several novel classes antiemetics developed commercialized becoming nearly universal standard chemotherapy regimens helping better manage symptoms large portion patients efficient mediation unpleasant sometimes debilitating symptoms results increased quality life patient better overall health patient due better patient tolerance effective treatment cycles several subtypes cinv classifications nausea vomiting emesis defense mechanism controlled area postrema medulla oblongata various sources input vomiting center receptors floor fourth ventricle brain represent chemoreceptor trigger zone chemoreceptor trigger zone contains dopamine receptors serotonin receptors opioid receptors acetylcholine receptors receptors substance p stimulation different receptors involved different pathways leading emesis final common pathway substance p activates receptor appears additionally vagal enteric nervous system inputs transmit information regarding state gastrointestinal system chemotherapy interferes cell division particularly affects rapidly dividing cells like gastrointestinal mucosa immune cells irritation gi mucosa chemotherapy radiation distention acute infectious gastroenteritis activates receptors widely known cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents cause enterochromaffin cells produce serotonin response free radical damage leading detectable increase blood levels serotonin major metabolite acid presence chemicals blood activate receptors chemoreceptor trigger zone turn releasing substance p activates receptors cause emetic response vomiting risk chemotherapyinduced nausea vomiting varies based type treatment received well several outside factors types chemotherapy prone causing nausea vomiting others chemotherapeutic agents may cause nausea vomiting may used combination regimens linked high incidence higher nausea vomiting referred highly emetogenic chemotherapy causing moderate incidence nausea vomiting referred moderately emetogenic highly emetogenic agents chemotherapy regimens moderately emetogenic agents regimens besides type treatment personal factors may put patient greater risk cinv risk factors several treatment methods available help prevent cinv pharmaceutical treatment generally separated two types prophylactic preventative treatment given dose chemotherapy agents rescue treatment given treat breakthrough nausea vomiting receptor antagonists effective antiemetics constitute great advance management cinv drugs block one nerve signals cause nausea vomiting first hours chemotherapy effective approach appears blocking nerve approved inhibitors include dolasetron anzemet granisetron kytril sancuso ondansetron zofran antiemetic effect due blockade receptor vagal afferent gut addition also block receptors ctz stn newest inhibitor palonosetron aloxi also prevents delayed nausea vomiting occur days treatment since patients trouble swallowing pills drugs often available injection orally disintegrating tablets transdermal patches newer class drugs known antagonists recently developed class efficacious drugs controlling cinv drugs often used alongside inhibitors corticosteroids form potent cocktail antiemetics verge achieving nearly complete patient response completely stopping substance p inhibitor aprepitant emend became available highly effective controlling nausea vomiting associated cancer aprepitant shown inhibit acute delayed emesis induced cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs blocking substance p landing receptors brains neurons indeed positron emission tomography pet studies shown aprepitant penetrate brain receptors aprepitant also shown increase activity receptor antagonists ondansetron corticosteroid dexamethasone also used prevent nausea vomiting caused netupitant recently approved usfda also marketed combination palonosetron rolapitant newest addition approved antagonist list advantage long half life duration action around hours rolapitant got approval usfda olanzapine well several neuroleptic drugs also investigated control study demonstrated olanzapines successful potential use achieving complete response acute prevention nausea vomiting patients treated moderately highly emetogenic chemotherapy used combination palonosetron neuroleptic agents indicated rescue treatment control breakthrough nausea patient groups say use cannabinoids derived cannabis chemotherapy greatly reduces associated nausea vomiting enables patient eat synthesized tetrahydrocannabinol also one main active substances marijuana marketed marinol may practical application natural medical cannabis also used recommended oncologists though use regulated legal however marinol less effective megestrol acetate helping cancer patients regain lost phase iii study found difference effects oral cannabis extract thc appetite quality life qol patients cancerrelated anorexiacachexia syndrome cacs source needed dexamethasone corticosteroid often used alongside antiemetic drugs synergistic action many although specific antiemetic mechanism action fully understood metoclopramide dopamine receptor antagonist possible mechanisms older drug sometimes used either combination others histamine blockers diphenhydramine meclozine may used rescue treatment lorazepam diazepam may sometimes used relieve anxiety associated cinv administration chemotherapy also often used case rescue several compounds identified within ginger shown possess properties likely beneficial treatment cinv includes substance p antagonism modulation gastrointestinal motility antioxidant multiple clinical trials investigated use ginger supplementation treatment cinv however due conflicting results methodological issues systematic review seven clinical trials summarized current evidence stating despite widespread use ginger treatment nausea contexts gestational nausea current literature provides mixed support use ginger standard part anticinv control patients undergoing nonpharmacological approaches remedy cinv typically involve small lifestyle alterations using unscented deodorants soaps avoiding strong scents altogether dietary modifications eating several small meals throughout day eating highprotein highcalorie food drinking many clear liquids removing spicy fatty fried acidic foods patients may also participate alternative practices selfhypnosis relaxation
