iliotibial band syndrome itbs second common knee injury caused inflammation located lateral aspect knee due friction iliotibial band lateral epicondyle pain felt commonly lateral aspect knee intensive degrees knee risk factors women include increased hip adduction knee internal risk factors seen men increased hip internal rotation knee itb syndrome associated longdistance running cycling weightlifting military itbs symptoms range stinging sensation knee outside knee lateral side knee joint swelling thickening tissue area band moves femur stinging sensation knee joint felt outside knee along entire length iliotibial band initial symptom onset pain typically occurs following activity condition progresses pain frequently felt activities may present pain may also present knee itb attaches pain frequently worsened running downhill stride itbs associated various risk factors including training habits anatomical abnormalities muscular training habits abnormalities legfeet anatomy muscle imbalance iliotibial band syndrome one leading causes lateral knee pain runners iliotibial band thick band fascia composing tendon tensor fascia latae muscle located lateral aspect knee

iliotibial band itbs pain acute iliotibial band treated conservatively rest ice compression elevation rice reduce pain inflammation followed utilization corticosteroid injections use oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids topical nsaids painful area possible treatments itb syndrome corticosteroid injections shown decrease running pains significantly days initial similar results found use antiinflammatory medication analgesicantiinflammatory medication physical therapy effective treatment modality goal stretching iliotibial band tensor fascia latae gluteus noninvasive treatments include modalities flexibility strength training neuromusculargait training manual therapy training volume reduction myofascial release changes running muscular training gluteus maximus hip external rotators stressed highly muscles associated many risk factors runners specifically neuromusculargait training may needed success muscular training interventions ensure trained muscles used properly mechanics strength training alone result decrease pain due itbs however gait training result running form modification reduces prevalence risk surgery treatments utilized several conservative approaches fail produce months conservative treatments generally used surgical surgery typically involves removal small piece iliotibial band release excessive tension procedures utilized include resection iliotibial band bursa zlengthening zlengthening procedure two horizontal incisions made band connected vertical incision forming z resulting sections reattached together lengthened position increasing length itbs symptoms typically improve treatment estimated patients symptom resolution weeks conservative treatment surgical patients also generally good complications itbs include recurrence exacerbation return activity following treatment well possible progression patellofemoral pain itbs commonly affects athletes reported runners cyclists rowers skiers triathletes well basketball soccer field hockey significant association diagnosis itbs occupational background patients thoroughly determined occupations require extensive use iliotibial band susceptible develop itbs
