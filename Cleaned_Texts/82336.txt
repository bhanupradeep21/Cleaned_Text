ability diagnose prenatally rates birth longer measuring number cases birth may practical way accurate way would include stillbirths studies calculate prevalence rates include data live births stillborn children normally exclude data abortions abortions huge contributing factor prevalence rates one study found quarter pregnancies identified ntd aborted number already doubled data clear excluding data abortions could greatly affect prevalence rates could also possibly explain prevalence rates appeared drop abortions included data half identified cases aborted data could show prevalence rates dropping actually however unclear much impact could prevalence rates due fact abortion rates advances technology vary greatly many maternal factors also play role prevalence rates factors include things like maternal age obesity way things like socioeconomic status along many maternal age shown huge impact prevalence rates relationship identified older mothers along young mothers increased maternal age may huge impact mothers body mass index greater double risk child studies also shown mothers three previous children show moderate risk next child
