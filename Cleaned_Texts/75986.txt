deciduous forests second growth forest edges insectivorous often sharing foraging habitats warblers found feeding mid lower regions tree shrub wide range habitats occupied migration including many shrubby areas wintering grounds central south america redstart may found nearly woody habitats tends avoid nonforested agricultural areas often found shadegrown coffee plantations provide native trees

part bush laying eggs neat cupshaped nest clutch incubated female days young fledge days nest may remain one parent weeks afterwards firstyear males able reproduce first breeding season retain femalelike plumage may contribute low reproductive success less firstyear males year contrast firstyear females successfully reproduce first breeding season evidence skewed sex ratio results surplus unmated american redstarts display mixed mating strategy predominantly monogamous around males maintain multiple territories polygynous even within monogamous pairs high proportion many fathered male
