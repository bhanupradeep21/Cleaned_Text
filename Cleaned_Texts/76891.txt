ediacara hills recent research concentrated numerous finds near white sea russia cover interval time million years many fossils time evolutionary relationships organisms hotly debated paleontologists

mollusc generally accepted least classification kimberella important scientific understanding cambrian explosion mollusc least protostome would mean two dominant nephrozoan lineages would diverged
