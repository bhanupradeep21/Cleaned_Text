tooth pl teeth hard calcified structure found jaws mouths many vertebrates used break food animals particularly carnivores omnivores also use teeth help capturing wounding prey tearing food defensive purposes intimidate animals often including carry prey young roots teeth covered gums teeth made bone rather multiple tissues varying density hardness originate outermost embryonic germ layer ectoderm general structure teeth similar across vertebrates although considerable variation form position teeth mammals deep roots pattern also found fish crocodilians teleost fish however teeth attached outer surface bone lizards attached inner surface jaw one side cartilaginous fish sharks teeth attached tough ligaments hoops cartilage form monophyodonts animals develop one set teeth diphyodonts grow early set deciduous teeth later set permanent adult teeth polyphyodonts grow many sets teeth example sharks grow new set teeth every two weeks replace worn teeth extant mammals including humans diphyodonts exceptions including elephants kangaroos manatees polyphyodonts rodent incisors grow wear away continually gnawing helps maintain relatively constant length industry beaver due part qualification many rodents voles guinea pigs mice well leporidae like rabbits continuously growing molars addition also tusks tusked mammals grow almost throughout teeth always attached jaw mammals

likely evolutionary origin indeed teeth appear first evolved sharks found primitive jawless fish lampreys toothlike structures tongue fact composed keratin dentine enamel bear relationship true though modern teethlike structures dentine enamel found late conodonts supposed evolved independently later vertebrates living amphibians typically small teeth none since commonly feed soft foods reptiles teeth generally simple conical shape although variation species notably venominjecting fangs snakes pattern incisors canines premolars molars found mammals varying extents evolutionary ancestors numbers types teeth vary greatly species zoologists use standardised dental formula describe precise pattern given word tooth comes protogermanic tanþs derived protoindoeuropean composed root eat plus

showmanship humans primates usually primary also baby milk teeth later permanent teeth four may third molars wisdom teeth although present adults may removed surgically later among primary teeth usually found maxilla ie upper jaw mandible ie lower jaw among permanent teeth found maxilla mandible teeth uniquely distinguishing features adult horse teeth enamel dentin layers horse teeth horses premolars molars generally male equines also four canine teeth called tushes molars incisors however female horses less canines usually one two many times partially horses one four wolf teeth vestigial premolars one two equally common male female horses much likely upper jaw present cause problems interfere horses bit contact therefore wolf teeth commonly horse teeth used estimate animals age birth five years age closely estimated observing eruption pattern milk teeth permanent teeth age five permanent teeth usually erupted horse said full mouth age five age conjectured studying wear

animal reaches old age crowns teeth short teeth often lost altogether old horses lacking molars may need fodder ground soaked water create soft mush eat order obtain adequate nutrition elephants tusks specialized incisors digging food fighting elephant teeth similar manatees elephants believed undergone aquatic phase evolution birth elephants total molar platelike grinding teeth including tusks organized four sets seven successively larger teeth elephant slowly wear lifetime chewing rough plant material four teeth used chewing given time tooth wears another tooth moves forward take place

rabbits lagomorphs usually shed deciduous teeth shortly birth usually born permanent teeth rabbits complement diet consists wide range vegetation since many foods abrasive enough cause attrition rabbit teeth grow continuously throughout rabbits total incisors three upper premolars three upper molars two lower premolars two lower molars side canines three four millimeters tooth worn away incisors every week whereas posterior teeth require month wear away incisors cheek teeth rabbits called aradicular hypsodont teeth sometimes referred elodent dentition teeth grow erupt continuously

aradicular teeth unlike humans whose ameloblasts die tooth development rodents continually produce enamel must wear teeth gnawing various enamel dentin produced enamel organ growth dependent presence

polyphyodont mandibular molars developing separately jaw encased bony shell separated soft walrus tusks canine teeth grow continuously throughout fish sharks may go many teeth lifetime replacement multiple teeth known polyphyodontia class prehistoric shark called cladodonts strange forked teeth unlike continuous shedding functional teeth seen modern majority stem chondrichthyan lineages retained tooth generations developed throughout life replacement mechanism exemplified tooth whorlbased dentitions include oldest known toothed vertebrate qianodus amphibians pedicellate teeth modified flexible due connective tissue uncalcified dentine separates crown base amphibians exhibit teeth slight attachment jaw acrodont teeth acrodont teeth exhibit limited connection dentary little ideal organisms mostly use teeth grasping crushing allows rapid regeneration teeth low energy cost teeth usually lost course feeding prey struggling additionally amphibians undergo metamorphosis develop bicuspid shaped teeth reptiles replaced constantly throughout lives crocodilian juveniles replace teeth larger ones rate high one new tooth per socket every month mature tooth replacement rates slow two years even longer overall crocodilians may use teeth birth death new teeth created within old skull ichthyornis discovered suggests beak birds may evolved teeth allow chicks escape shells earlier thus avoid predators also penetrate protective covers hard earth access underlying true teeth unique although many invertebrates analogous structures often referred teeth organisms
