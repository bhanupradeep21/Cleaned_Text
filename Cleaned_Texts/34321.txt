fish gills organs allow fish breathe underwater fish exchange gases like oxygen carbon dioxide using gills protected gill covers operculum sides pharynx throat gills tissues like short threads protein structures called filaments filaments many functions including transfer ions water well exchange oxygen carbon dioxide acids filament contains capillary network provides large surface area exchanging oxygen carbon dioxide fish exchange gases pulling oxygenrich water mouths pumping gills within gill filaments capillary blood flows opposite direction water causing countercurrent exchange gills push oxygenpoor water openings sides pharynx fish like sharks lampreys possess multiple gill openings however bony fish single gill opening side opening hidden beneath protective bony cover called operculum juvenile bichirs external gills primitive feature share larval amphibians previously evolution gills thought occurred two diverging lines gills formed endoderm seen jawless fish species form ectoderm seen jawed fish however recent studies gill formation little skate leucoraja erinacea shown potential evidence supporting claim gills current fish species fact evolved common air breathing

remains located base operculum however often greatly reduced consisting small mass cells without remaining gilllike fish transfer oxygen sea water blood using highly efficient mechanism called countercurrent exchange countercurrent exchange means flow water gills opposite direction flow blood capillaries lamellae effect blood flowing capillaries always encounters water higher oxygen concentration allowing diffusion occur way along lamellae result gills extract oxygen available water marine teleosts also use gills excrete osmolytes eg gills large surface area tends create problem fish seek regulate osmolarity internal fluids seawater contains osmolytes fishs internal fluids marine fishes naturally lose water gills via osmosis regain water marine fishes drink large amounts sea water simultaneously expend energy excrete salt nakatpase ionocytes formerly known mitochondrionrich cells chloride conversely freshwater less osmolytes fishs internal fluids therefore freshwater fishes must utilize gill ionocytes attain ions environment maintain optimal blood primitive bony fishes amphibians larvae bear external gills branching gill reduced adulthood function taken gills
