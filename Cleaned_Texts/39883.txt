inhaler also known puffer pump allergy spray medical device used delivering medicines lungs work persons breathing allows medicines delivered absorbed lungs provides ability targeted medical treatment specific region body well reduction side effects oral medications wide variety inhalers commonly used treat numerous medical conditions asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd among common types inhalers include metereddose inhalers dry powder inhalers soft mist inhalers nebulizers device advantages disadvantages selected based individually specific patient needs well age pathological conditions coordination lung proper education inhaler use important ensure inhaled medication creates proper effects inhalers designed deliver medication directly lungs persons breathing may benefit patient providing medicines directly areas disease allowing medication take greater effect intended target limit side effects medications administered inhalers used variety different medical conditions diseases lungs respiratory system among common individuals diseasesconditions need medications designed decrease airway inflammation obstruction allow easier comfortable antibiotic medications even developed inhalers allow direct delivery areas infection within two common conditions warrant inhaler therapy asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary asthma condition intermittent airway obstruction due inflammatory processes lungs inhaled medications used calm inflammation present lungs allow relief airway obstruction common inhaled medications used treatment asthma bronchodilators salbutamol corticosteroids salmeterol medications allow patients relief airway obstruction symptoms reduced people unable use inhalers nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids may used caution since may cause immunological hypersensitivity nsaids resulting respiratoryrelated symptoms bronchospasms acute asthma exacerbation severe asthma copd obstructive lung disease due longterm damage airways lungs longterm damage leads inability airways open properly causing airway obstruction inhaled medications allow patients see improvement symptoms better function daily living commonly used inhaled
