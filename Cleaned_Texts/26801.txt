testicular torsion occurs spermatic cord testicle suspended twists cutting blood supply common symptom children sudden severe testicular testicle may higher usual scrotum vomiting may newborns pain often absent instead scrotum may become discolored testicle may disappear usual affected obvious prior underlying health testicular tumor prior trauma may increase risk factors include congenital malformation known bellclapper deformity wherein testis inadequately attached scrotum allowing move freely thus potentially cold temperatures may also risk diagnosis usually made based presenting symptoms requires timely diagnosis treatment avoid testicular ultrasound useful diagnosis treatment physically untwisting testicle possible followed pain treated outcome depends time successfully treated within six hours onset often good however delayed hours testicle typically people require removal common birth occurs males years age children testicular pain rapid onset testicular torsion cause complications may include inability condition first described louis testicular torsion usually presents severe testicular pain pain groin lower pain generally begins suddenly typically involves one often associated nausea testicle may lie higher scrotum due twisting subsequent shortening spermatic may positioned horizontal orientation mild warmth redness overlying area may present elevation testicle may worsen pain urinary symptoms pain increased frequency urination also typically symptom onset often follows physical activity trauma testes scrotum children testicular torsion may awaken testicular abdominal pain middle night may history previous similar episodes scrotal pain due prior transient testicular torsion spontaneous affected testicular torsion prior underlying health problems predisposing however certain factors may increase risk testicular torsion larger testicle either due normal variation testicular tumor increases risk similarly presence mass malignancy involving spermatic cord also predispose age also important risk factor torsion torsion commonly occurs either newborn testicular torsion often occurs puberty prior complete testicular descent epididymitis commonly postpubertal several congenital anatomic malformations variations testicle surrounding structures may allow increased scrotal rotation increase risk testicular congenital malformation processus vaginalis known bellclapper deformity accounts condition rather testes attaching posteriorly inner lining scrotum mesorchium mesorchium terminates early testis free floating tunica vaginalis anatomic risk factors include horizontal lie testicle spermatic cord long intrascrotal cryptorchidisim also risk factor studies proposing higher testicular torsion may also caused trauma scrotum exercise particular bicycle however cases result thought possible genetic basis predisposition torsion based multiple published reports familial testicular controversy whether cold weather months associated increased testicular torsion occurs mechanical twisting spermatic cord suspends testicle within scrotum contains testicular artery vein twisting cord reduces eliminates blood flow degree arterial venous obstruction depends duration severity torsion event typically venous blood flow compromised increase venous pressure subsequently causes decreased arterial blood flow leading decreased oxygen supply testicle untreated testicular also believed torsion occurring fetal development lead socalled neonatal torsion vanishing testis one causes infant born monorchism one intermittent testicular torsion itt less serious chronic variant torsion characterized intermittent scrotal testicular pain followed eventual spontaneous detorsion resolution pain nausea vomiting may also though less pressing individuals significant risk complete torsion possible subsequent orchiectomy recommended treatment elective bilateral orchiopexy ninetyseven percent patients undergo surgery experience complete relief torsion occurring outside tunica vaginalis testis gubernaculum rotate freely termed extravaginal testicular torsion type occurs exclusively newborns however newborns affected testicular torsion variants neonates experiencing torsion typically present painless scrotal discoloration firm painless mass scrotum testes usually necrotic birth must removed exact cause specific risk factors extravaginal torsion population remain intravaginal testicular torsion occurs testicle rotates spermatic cord within tunica variant commonly occurs older children adults bellclapper deformity inappropriately high attachment tunica vaginalis spermatic cord failure normal posterior attachment testicle inner scrotum allows testicle move freely within tunica vaginalis predisposes intravaginal testicular testicular appendix located upper pole testicle embryonic remnant known function risk torsion type torsion common cause acute scrotal pain boys ages appearance similar testicular torsion onset pain typically gradual palpation reveals small firm nodule upper portion testis displays characteristic blue dot sign appendix testis become discolored noticeably blue skin unlike torsions however cremasteric reflex still active typical treatment involves use overthecounter analgesics condition resolves within undescended testis increased risk testicular mechanism torsion undescended testicle fully understood though may due abnormal contractions cremaster muscle covers testicle spermatic cord responsible raising lowering testicle regulate scrotal temperature undescended testicle also higher risk testicular tumor due increased weight size compared healthy testicle predispose diagnosis generally made based presenting ultrasound useful diagnosis however imaging delay surgical intervention complications develop prolonged immediate surgery recommended regardless imaging findings high degree suspicion based history physical given treatment implications testicular torsion important distinguish testicular torsion causes testicular pain epididymitis present similarly conditions cause testicular pain pain epididymitis typically localized epididymis rear pole testicle epididymitis may also characterized discoloration swelling testis fever cremasteric reflex epididymitis usually present testicular torsion probably impending testicular infarction also produce lowgrade often absent decreased cremasteric absence cremasteric reflex acutely painful testicle indicative testicular torsion twisting spermatic cord testicle makes reflexive responses impossible cremasteric reflex normally causes elevation testicle stroking inner absence especially common children presence exclude diagnosis testicular physical examination testis swollen tender highriding abnormal transverse prehns sign classic physical exam finding reliable distinguishing torsion causes testicular pain individual usually fever though nausea commoncitation needed doppler ultrasound scan scrotum identify absence blood flow twisted testicle nearly accurate also help distinguish torsion radionuclide scanning scintigraphy scrotum accurate imaging technique routinely available particularly urgency might agent choice purpose initially provides radionuclide angiogram followed static image radionuclide perfused tissue healthy patient initial images show symmetric flow testes delayed images show uniformly symmetric testicular torsion images may show heterogenous activity within affected testicular torsion surgical emergency requires immediate intervention restore flow blood treated either manually surgically within six hours high chance approximately saving testicle hours rate decreases hours drops hours ability save testicle approaches although salvage testicle reported beyond cases result loss prompt diagnosis treatment testicle often typically torsion takes place surface testicle rotated towards midline body nonsurgical correction sometimes accomplished manually rotating testicle opposite direction ie outward towards thigh initially unsuccessful forced manual rotation direction may correct success rate manual detorsion known confidencecitation needed salvage testicle accomplished longterm testicular damage common testicular size often diminished injury unaffected testicle effect torsion event longterm fertility fully repeat doppler ultrasound scan may confirm restoration blood flow testicle following manual detorsion however surgical exploration often performed order assess health viability testicle orchiopexy performed affected unaffected testicles order prevent recurrence testis viable removed torsion frequent among adolescents cases presenting years common cause rapid onset testicular pain swelling
