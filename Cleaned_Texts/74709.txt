century discovery addition several closely related titanosaurs thus raising possibility opisthocoelicaudia originally opisthocoelicaudia classified member family camarasauridae together camarasaurus euhelopus classification based several shared features skeleton importantly forked neural spines back vertebrae borsukbiałynicka considered opisthocoelicaudia closer euhelopus camarasaurus placing subfamily study walter coombs ralph molnar hand considered member subfamily camarasaurinae therefore close relative today euhelopus opisthocoelicaudia classified outside camarasauridae leonardo salgado rodolfo coria showed opisthocoelicaudia represent titanosaur classified within family name titanosauridae currently considered invalid many instead name lithostrotia often used within lithostrotia opisthocoelicaudia found closely related genera alamosaurus neuquensaurus rocasaurus saltasaurus together forming family saltasauridae interrelationships genera contested many scientists considered opisthocoelicaudia closely related alamosaurus genera forming monophyletic group opisthocoelicaudiinae scientists concluded opisthocoelicaudiinae paraphyletic forming natural contradicting studies upchurch colleagues argued alamosaurus placed outside saltasauridae close relative pellegrinisaurus therefore related opisthocoelicaudia cladogram based calvo colleagues shows monophyletic

leading suspicions may represent synonym nemegtosaurus according international code zoological nomenclature iczn oldest name priority younger synonyms opisthocoelicaudia would shown synonym

crew believed finds belong species borsukbiałynicka deemed opisthocoelicaudia nemegtosaurus represent separate genera nemegtosaurus time considered member dicraeosauridae opisthocoelicaudia seemed representative different group currently opisthocoelicaudia nemegtosaurus classified within titanosauria jeffrey wilson stated synonymy ruled currie colleagues argued synonymy probable light new fossil discoveries nemegt relocating original nemegtosaurus quarry researchers excavated postcranial bones nemegtosaurus holotype including centrum caudal vertebra hind limb bones allowed first time direct comparison nemegtosaurus opisthocoelicaudia type specimens based overlapping elements postcranial elements found similar corresponding parts opisthocoelicaudia holotype importantly discovered caudal centrum opisthocoelous diagnostic feature opisthocoelicaudia suggesting genera either closely related synonymous furthermore authors noted none known sauropod localities nemegt formation revealed evidence presence one species alexander averianov alexey v lopatin reported nemegt sauropod vertebrae discovered femora differed bones opisthocoelicaudia stated probably belonged nemegtosaurus thereby supporting two genera description borsukbiałynicka argued different sauropod genera sharing habitat nothing unusual evident north american morrison currie colleagues however stressed dinosaur fauna nemegt formation fundamentally different larger dinosaurs present species per clade indicating harsh geographically restricted habitat definitive proof suggested synonymy however still missing additional overlapping elements would required opisthocoelicaudia nemegtosaurus formally declared originally borsukbiałynicka assumed standard position neck horizontal slanted slightly downward based reconstruction nuchal ligament runs atop cervical dorsal vertebrae serves support weight head although scurved swanlike ascending neck envisaged several subsequent reconstructions following similar depictions better known sauropods recent studies argue sauropod necks relatively straight carried back also reconstructed less horizontal orientation followed subsequent depictions study daniela schwarz colleagues suggested back dipped towards rear according researchers shoulder blade would inclined horizontal angle much steeper previously thought resulting elevated shoulder vertebral column trunk neck held relatively straight line would result elevated position opisthocoelicaudia may able rear hindlimbs foraging using tail third leg borsukbiałynicka cited several skeletal features might related rearing including opisthocoelous vertebrae anterior part tail according author would made tail flexible sauropods features pelvis thickened shelf acetabulum flaring ilia fused pubic symphysis may allowed pelvis withstand stress heinrich mallison argued opisthocoelicaudia may able angle anterior part tail posterior part producing buckle midsection thus anterior part would straight rearing wilson assumed rearing innovation opisthocoelicaudia also related genera within subfamily saltasaurinae common features genera shortened tail may evolved adaptations footprints nemegt formation unknown several examples described nemegt locality currie colleagues footprints belonged hadrosaurids probably saurolophus two left large theropod
