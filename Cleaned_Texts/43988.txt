dysfibrinogenemias consist three types fibrinogen disorders critical blood clotting factor fibrinogen circulates normal levels dysfunctional congenital dysfibrinogenemia inherited disorder one parental genes produces abnormal fibrinogen fibrinogen interferes normal blood clotting andor lysis blood clots condition therefore may cause pathological bleeding andor acquired dysfibrinogenemia nonhereditary disorder fibrinogen dysfunctional due presence liver disease autoimmune disease plasma cell dyscrasias certain cancers associated primarily pathological hereditary fibrinogen aαchain amyloidosis subcategory congenital dysfibrinogenemia dysfunctional fibrinogen cause bleeding thrombosis rather gradually accumulates disrupts function congenital dysfibrinogenemia commonest three disorders different genetic mutations occurring families found cause mutations well causing hereditary fibrinogen aαchain amyloidosis exhibit partial penetrance ie family members one mutant genes

dysfibrinogenemia disorders may highly underdiagnosed conditions due isolated thrombotic events appreciated reflecting underlying fibrinogen congenital dysfibrinogenemia distinguished similar inherited disorder congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia disorders involve circulation dysfunctional fibrinogen congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia plasma fibrinogen levels low congenital dysfibrinogenemia normal furthermore two disorders involve different gene mutations inheritance patterns well somewhat different fibrinogen glycoprotein made secreted blood primarily liver hepatocyte cells endothelium

polysaccharides ie complex sugars sialic acid added respective glycosylation sialylation enzyme pathways thereby converting heximer functional fibrinogen glycoprotein final circulating glycoprotein notated arranged long flexible rod nodules ends termed domains central nodule termed e normal process blood clot formation involves coordinated operation two separate pathways feed final common pathway primary hemostasis ie adhesion activation aggregation circulating blood platelets sites vascular injury secondary hemostasis ie cleavage aα bβ chains fibrinogen thrombin form individual fibrin strands plus respective fibrinopeptides b formed cleavage final common pathway fibrin crosslinked activated clotting factor xiii termed factor xiiia form mature gellike fibrin clots subsequent fibrinolysis pathways act limit clot formation dissolve clots longer needed fibrinogen aα fibrin chain several functions based fibrinogen functions fibrinogen mutation may act either inhibit promote
