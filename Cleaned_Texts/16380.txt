food developed increased nutrient value genetic engineering direct manipulation organisms genome using certain biotechnology techniques existed since human directed genetic manipulation occurring much earlier beginning domestication plants animals artificial selection dog believed first animal domesticated possibly arising common ancestor grey archeological evidence dating carnivores domesticated prehistoric times include cat cohabited human years archeological evidence suggests sheep cattle pigs goats domesticated bc bc fertile first evidence plant domestication comes emmer einkorn wheat found prepottery neolithic villages southwest asia dated fertile crescent western asia egypt india sites earliest planned sowing harvesting plants previously gathered wild independent development agriculture occurred northern southern china africas sahel new guinea several regions eight neolithic founder crops emmer wheat einkorn wheat barley peas lentils bitter vetch chick peas flax appeared horticulture first appears levant chalcolithic period due soft tissues archeological evidence early vegetables scarce earliest vegetable remains found egyptian caves date back millennium selective breeding domesticated plants main way early farmers shaped organisms suit needs charles darwin described three types selection methodical selection wherein humans deliberately select particular characteristics unconscious selection wherein characteristic selected simply desirable natural selection wherein trait helps organism survive better passed early breeding relied unconscious natural selection introduction methodical selection common characteristics bred domesticated plants include grains shatter allow easier harvesting uniform ripening shorter lifespans translate faster growing loss toxic compounds plants like banana able propagated vegetative cloning offspring often contain seeds therefore sterile however offspring usually juicier larger propagation cloning allows mutant varieties cultivated despite lack hybridization another way rapid changes plants makeup introduced often increased vigor plants combined desirable traits together hybridization likely first occurred humans first grew similar yet slightly different plants close triticum aestivum wheat used baking bread allopolyploid creation result two separate hybridization grafting transfer chloroplasts mitochondrial dna entire cell nucleus containing genome potentially make new species making grafting form natural genetic xrays first used deliberately mutate plants genetically mutated plant
