sputnik russian pronunciation ˈsputʲnʲɪk russian satellite prosteyshiy sputnik russian простейший спутник simplest satellite launched november second spacecraft launched earth orbit first carry animal orbit soviet space dog named laika launched soviet union via modified intercontinental ballistic missile sputnik ft coneshaped capsule base diameter metres ft weighed around kilograms lb though designed separate rocket core brought orbit bringing total mass orbit tonnes lb contained several compartments radio transmitters telemetry system programming unit regeneration temperaturecontrol system cabin scientific instruments separate sealed cabin contained dog laika though laika died shortly reaching orbit sputnik marked another huge success soviet union space race lofting time huge payload sending animal orbit first time returning scientific data earths atmosphere extended period satellite reentered earths atmosphere april engineer mikhail tikhonravov created proposal object satellite massing kg lb kg lb fourth would devoted scientific instruments upon learning spacecraft would outmass announced american satellite nearly times soviet leader nikita khrushchev advocated proposal approved government resolution january work began project february launch date latter time international geophysical year design finalized end become clear neither complicated object satellite launch vehicle version icbm development launch would finished time launch thus december head sergei korolev proposed development two simpler satellites ps prosteishy sputnik preliminary satellite two ps satellites would simple spheres massing kg lb equipped solely radio antenna project approved government january choice launch two instead waiting advanced object would eventually become sputnik finished largely motivated desire launch satellite orbit us first satellites sputnik successfully launched october became worlds first artificial immediately following launch nikita khrushchev asked sergei korolev prepare sputnik time anniversary bolshevik revolution early november three weeks details conversation vary appears likely korolev suggested idea flying dog khrushchev emphasised importance three weeks prepare scramble assemble new satellite built ball identical fortunately sounding rocket recently used launch series suborbital missions carrying dogs payloads korolev simply requisitioned payload container used missions installed upper stage launching rocket directly beneath upon reaching orbit final stage blok would detach provision made dogs sputnik ft coneshaped capsule base diameter metres ft weighed around kilograms lb though designed separate rocket core brought orbit bringing total mass orbit tonnes laika barker formerly kudryavka little curly partsamoyed terrier chosen fly sputnik due shortness time frame candidate dog could trained mission borrowed sounding rocket program choosing ten candidates provided air force institute aviation medicine already trained suborbital missions laika chosen primarily even temperament backup albina flown missions june laika weighed kg laika albina telemetry wires surgically attached flight monitor respiration frequency pulse blood pressurized cabin sputnik padded allowed enough room laika lie stand air regeneration system provided oxygen food water dispensed gelatinized form laika chained place fitted harness bag collect waste electrodes monitor vital signs television camera mounted passenger compartment observe laika camera could transmit video frames sputnik first platform capable making scientific measurements orbit potentially significant biological payload earths atmosphere blocks suns xray ultraviolet output ground observation moreover solar output unpredictable fluctuates rapidly making suborbital sounding rockets inadequate observation task thus satellite required longterm continuous study complete solar accordingly sputnik carried two spectrophotometers one measuring solar ultraviolet rays one measuring xrays instruments provided professor sergei mandelstam lebedev institute physics installed nose cone spherical ps addition sergei vernov completed cosmic ray detector using geiger counters object demanded instrument moscow university team including naum grigoriev alexander chudakov yuri logachev built also carried flight korolev agreed room satellite proper

well american vanguard yet day sputnik went orbit gaither committee met president eisenhower brief current situation demanding urgent dramatic response smaller sputnik clear soviets missiles far superior american fact whose demonstration sputnik eagerly propounded soviet premier khrushchev every opportunity ussr six days launch sputnik anniversary october revolution khrushchev boasted speech first sputnik lonely space travels nevertheless unlike us president eisenhower kept calm time afterward sputnik launched according one presidents aides presidents burning concern keep country going hogwild embarking foolish costly schemes mission sparked debate across globe mistreatment animals animal testing general advance united kingdom national canine defence league called dog owners observe minutes silence day laika remained space royal society prevention cruelty animals rspca received protests even radio moscow finished announcing launch animal rights groups time called members public protest soviet others demonstrated outside united nations new laboratory researchers us offered support soviets least news laikas cosmic ray detector transmitted one week going silent november battery exhausted experiment reported unexpected results day launch noting increase highenergy charged particles normal pulsessec pulsessec highest latitudes orbit per two articles soviet newspaper pravda particle flux increased altitude well likely sputnik detecting lower levels van allen belt reached apogee orbit however sputnik telemetry could received flying soviet union data set insufficient draw conclusions particularly time sputnik traveled additional observational data received australian observers satellite overhead soviet scientists asked secrecyminded soviets willing give australians code would give ability descramble use data result australians declined turn thus soviet union missed chance get credit scientific discovery ultimately went james van allen state university iowa whose
