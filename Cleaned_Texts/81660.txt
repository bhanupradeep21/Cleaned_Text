neurotransmitters specifically adrenaline noradrenaline selectively binding antagonizing adrenergic receptors body adrenaline epinephrine noradrenaline norepinephrine released nerve endings secreted adrenal glands bind adrenergic receptors found primarily cardiac tissues heart binding activates receptors leading various physiological responses including increase heart rate force contraction inotropic effect conduction speed electrical pathways heart release renin kidneys metoprolol competes adrenaline noradrenaline binding sites receptors occupying receptor sites without activating
