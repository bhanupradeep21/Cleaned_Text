cysteinylleukotriene type receptor antagonists also known antagonists class drugs hinder action leukotriene binding receptor antagonistic action without agonistic drugs used treat asthma relieve individuals seasonal allergies prevention exerciseinduced currently three different types drugs within family first market released released released medical uses cysteinylleukotriene type receptor antagonists chronic prophylactic treatment indications approved fda montelukast used prevention exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction eib relief symptoms allergic rhinitis ar relief seasonal allergic rhinitis perennial allergic rhinitis par actions receptor antagonists montelukast zafirlukast pranlukast competitive hinder actions leukotrienes prevent different types asthmatic responses well effects bronchoconstriction inflammation adverse effects often follow use montelukast tested clinical trials different conditions observe different adverse effects common side effects montelukast example respiratory infection fever headache cough abdominal pain otitis media rhinorrhea sinusitis adverse effects zafirlukast similar montelukast database safety incorporates volunteers patients asthmatic side effects similar montelukast example headache infection abdominal pain fever multiple cysteinyl leukotrienes powerful inflammatory inducing eicosanoids produced released various cells immune leukotrienes produced arachidonic acid made phospholipids cell membrane various cells immune system release leukotrienes basophils eosinophils mast cells macrophages following various stimuli example bind cysteinyl leukotriene receptors cyslt one receptors cyslt found many different parts human airway well proinflammatory cells cyslt receptors linked pathophysiology allergic rhinitis zafirlukast montelukast powerful cyslt receptor antagonists primary actions drugs block action leukotrienes binding receptor antagonistic action without agonistic effect primary purpose antagonists block actions leukotriene competing result reduced effect leukotrienes example bronchoconstriction vasoconstricting effect well bronchial asthma comparing pharmacokinetic properties montelukast zafirlukast two drugs many similarities peak plasma concentrations around hours depending form given drugs plasma proteinbound vitro studies rats indicated low distribution across bloodbrainbarrier metabolism montelukast zafirlukast extensive montelukast mainly metabolized zafirlukast halflife montelukast hours zafirlukast looking leukotriene receptor antagonists researchers began without assistance ligandreceptor binding data approached issue three different ways approaches included structural design leukotriene analogues quinoline analogues randomized screening compounds combined efforts led simple sar lipophilic tetraene tail imitated several stable aromatic rings sulfide glycylcysteine dipeptide supplanted alkyl carboxylic acid carboxylate must maintained research prioritizing threedimensional demands antagonist binding cyslt receptors elucidated pharmacophore requires acidic negative ionizable usable group hydrogenbond acceptor role three hydrophobic regions research synthetic endeavours lead development montelukast zafirlukast cysteinylleukotriene type receptor quinolines shown good moiety receptor antagonist weak antagonistic derivatives quinolines montelukast developed several changes structure made without loss activity among changes reducing quinoline ring replacing chlorine fluorine inserting ether linkage two aromatic rings instead double bound adding amide group sulfur replacement quinoline benzothiazole dichlorothienopyridines alkylsubstituted thiazoles possible none zafirlukast indole derivative satisfies pharmacophore need ionizable moiety sulfonamide group numerous analogues organized nonetheless everyone resulted diminishing antagonistic activity like montelukast zafirlukast antagonizes bronchoconstrictive selectively antagonising receptor affects leukotrienes qualitative structural requirements pharmacophore antagonists designed structural similarity agonist limitations agonist antagonist necessarily bind manner site importance certain moiety may overestimated moieties may example synthesis montelukast example synthesis receptor cysteinyl leukotrienes viable target importance cysteinyl leukotrienes mediating responses discovered two types said receptor exist receptor well leukotrienereceptor antagonists special class drug formulated tablets antiinflammatory effect well bronchodilating development leukotriene receptor antagonist started screening large number compounds designing quinoline structural example receptor antagonists montelukast quinoline derivative zafirlukast indole derivative selective zafirlukast first approved receptor antagonist usa september main medications approved across world example montelukast approved february pranlukast approved march interest receptor also
