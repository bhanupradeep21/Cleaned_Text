eating also known consuming ingestion food natural biological world typically provide heterotrophic organism energy nutrients allow growth animals heterotrophs must eat order survive carnivores eat animals herbivores eat plants omnivores consume mixture plant animal matter detritivores eat detritus fungi digest organic matter outside bodies opposed animals digest food inside bodies humans eating complex typically activity daily living physicians dieticians consider healthful diet essential maintaining peak physical condition individuals may limit amount nutritional intake may result lifestyle choice part diet religious fasting limited consumption may due hunger famine overconsumption calories may lead obesity reasons behind myriad prevalence led declare obesity epidemic many homes large kitchen area devoted preparation meals food may dining room dining hall another designated area eating societies also restaurants food courts food vendors people may eat away home lacking time prepare food social highest level sophistication places become theatrical spectacles global cosmopolitanism picnics potlucks food festivals eating fact primary purpose social gathering many social events food beverages made available attendees people usually two three meals snacks smaller amounts may consumed meals doctors uk recommend three meals day kcal per four six hours three wellbalanced meals described half plate vegetables protein food meat carbohydrates pasta amount kcal average requirement regular jurisdictions sharia law may proscribed muslim adults daylight hours newborn babies eat adult foods survive solely breast milk small amounts pureed food sometimes fed young infants young two three months old infants eat adult food six eight months old young babies eat pureed baby foods teeth immature digestive systems months age digestive system improves many babies begin eating finger foods diet still limited however babies lack molars canines age often limited number incisors months babies often enough teeth sufficiently mature digestive system eat foods adults learning eat messy process children children often master neatness eating etiquette five six years old eating positions vary according different regions world culture influences way people eat meals example middle eastern countries eating sitting floor common believed healthier eating sitting eating reclining position favored ancient greeks celebration called symposium custom adopted ancient ancient hebrews also adopted posture traditional celebrations compulsive overeating emotional eating tendency eat response negative empirical studies indicated anxiety leads decreased food consumption people normal weight increased food consumption many laboratory studies showed overweight individuals emotionally reactive likely overeat distressed people normal weight furthermore consistently found obese individuals experience negative emotions frequently intensively normal weight naturalistic study lowe fisher compared emotional reactivity emotional eating normal overweight female college students study confirmed tendency obese individuals overeat findings applied snacks meals means obese individuals tend eat meals rather amount snacks ate meals greater one possible explanation lowe fisher suggest obese individuals often eat meals others eat average due reduction distress presence people another possible explanation would obese individuals eat others meals due social desirability conversely snacks usually eaten many physiological mechanisms control starting stopping meal control food intake physiologically complex motivated behavioral system hormones cholecystokinin bombesin neurotensin anorectin calcitonin enterostatin leptin corticotropinreleasing hormone shown suppress food numerous signals given initiate hunger environmental signals signals gastrointestinal system metabolic signals trigger hunger environmental signals come bodys senses feeling hunger could triggered smell thought food sight plate hearing someone talk signals stomach initiated release peptide hormone ghrelin ghrelin hormone increases appetite signaling brain person environmental signals ghrelin signals initiate hunger metabolic signals well time passes meals body starts take nutrients longterm glucose levels cells drop glucoprivation body starts produce feeling hunger body also stimulates eating

satiety arise head stomach intestines liver longterm signals satiety come adipose taste odor food contribute shortterm satiety allowing body learn stop eating stomach contains receptors allow us know full intestines also contain receptors send satiety signals brain hormone cholecystokinin secreted duodenum controls rate stomach hormone thought satiety signal brain peptide yy hormone released small intestine also used satiety signal insulin also serves satiety signal brain brain detects insulin blood indicates nutrients absorbed cells person getting full longterm satiety comes fat stored adipose tissue adipose tissue secretes hormone leptin leptin suppresses appetite longterm satiety signals adipose tissue regulates shortterm satiety brain stem control food intake contains neural circuits detect hunger satiety signals parts brain stems involvement food intake researched using rats rats motor neurons brain stem disconnected neural circuits cerebral hemispheres decerebration unable approach eat instead obtain food liquid form research shows brain stem fact play role eating two peptides hypothalamus produce hunger melanin concentrating hormone mch orexin mch plays bigger role producing hunger mice mch stimulates feeding mutation causing overproduction mch led overeating orexin plays greater role controlling relationship eating sleeping peptides hypothalamus induce eating neuropeptide npy agoutirelated protein satiety hypothalamus stimulated leptin leptin targets receptors arcuate nucleus suppresses secretion mch orexin arcuate nucleus also contains two peptides suppress hunger first one cocaine amphetamineregulated transcript cart second αmsh αmelanocytestimulating physiologically eating generally triggered hunger numerous physical psychological conditions affect appetite disrupt normal eating patterns include depression food allergies ingestion certain chemicals bulimia anorexia nervosa pituitary gland malfunction endocrine problems numerous illnesses eating disorders chronic lack nutritious food cause various illnesses eventually lead starvation happens locality massive scale considered famine eating drinking possible often case recovering surgery alternatives nutrition parenteral maintain high constant body temperature energy therefore need nutritious plentiful diet earliest mammals probably predators different species since adapted meet dietary requirements variety ways eat carnivorous diet includes insectivorous diets mammals called herbivores eat plants contain complex carbohydrates cellulose herbivorous diet includes subtypes granivory seed eating folivory leaf eating frugivory fruit eating nectarivory nectar eating gummivory gum eating mycophagy fungus eating digestive tract herbivore host bacteria ferment complex substances make available digestion either housed multichambered stomach large mammals coprophagous consuming feces absorb nutrients digested food first omnivore eats prey plants carnivorous mammals simple digestive tract proteins lipids minerals found meat require little way specialized digestion exceptions include baleen whales also house gut flora multichambered stomach like terrestrial size animal also factor determining diet type allens rule since small mammals high ratio heatlosing surface area heatgenerating volume tend high energy requirements high metabolic rate mammals weigh less ounces g lb mostly insectivorous tolerate slow complex digestive process herbivore larger animals hand generate heat less heat lost therefore tolerate either slower collection process carnivores feed larger vertebrates slower digestive process furthermore mammals weigh ounces g lb usually collect enough insects waking hours sustain large insectivorous mammals feed huge colonies insects ants mammals omnivores display varying degrees carnivory herbivory generally leaning favor one since plants meat digested differently preference one bears species may mostly carnivorous others mostly grouped three categories mesocarnivory meat hypercarnivory greater meat hypocarnivory less meat dentition hypocarnivores consists dull triangular carnassial teeth meant grinding food hypercarnivores however conical teeth sharp carnassials meant slashing cases strong jaws bonecrushing case hyenas allowing consume bones extinct groups notably machairodontinae sabershaped physiological carnivores consume plant matter physiological herbivores consume meat behavioral aspect would make omnivores physiological standpoint may due zoopharmacognosy physiologically animals must able obtain energy nutrients plant animal materials considered omnivorous thus animals still able classified carnivores herbivores obtaining nutrients materials originating sources seemingly complement example well documented ungulates giraffes camels cattle gnaw bones consume particular minerals also cats generally regarded obligate carnivores occasionally eat grass regurgitate indigestible material hairballs aid hemoglobin production birds diets varied often include nectar fruit plants seeds carrion various small animals including digestive system birds unique crop storage gizzard contains swallowed stones grinding food compensate lack species pigeons psittacine species birds highly adapted rapid digestion aid migratory birds adapted use protein stored many parts bodies including protein intestines additional energy birds employ many strategies obtain food feed variety food items called generalists others concentrate time effort specific food items single strategy obtain food considered avian foraging strategies vary widely species many birds glean insects invertebrates fruit seeds hunt insects suddenly attacking branch species seek pest insects considered beneficial biological control agents presence encouraged biological pest control combined insectivorous birds eat million metric tons arthropods nectar feeders hummingbirds sunbirds lories lorikeets amongst others specially adapted brushy tongues many cases bills designed fit coadapted kiwis shorebirds long bills probe invertebrates shorebirds varied bill lengths feeding methods result separation
