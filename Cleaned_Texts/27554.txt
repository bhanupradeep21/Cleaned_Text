respiration abnormal pattern breathing characterized progressively deeper sometimes faster breathing followed gradual decrease results temporary stop breathing called apnea pattern repeats cycle usually taking seconds oscillation ventilation apnea hyperpnea crescendodiminuendo pattern associated changing serum partial pressures oxygen carbon respiration periodic breathing two regions spectrum severity oscillatory tidal volume distinction lies observed trough ventilation respiration involves apnea since apnea prominent feature original description periodic breathing involves hypopnea abnormally small absent breaths phenomena occur wakefulness sleep called central sleep apnea syndrome may caused damage respiratory physiological abnormalities congestive heart also seen newborns immature respiratory systems visitors new high altitudes one example breathing pattern joubert syndrome related disorders causes may include heart failure kidney failure narcotic poisoning intracranial pressure hypoperfusion brain particularly respiratory center pathophysiology breathing summarized apnea leading increased causes excessive compensatory hyperventilation turn causing

necessary simply return system towards steady state instead ventilation overshoots generate opposite disturbance original disturbance secondary disturbance larger original next response even larger large oscillations developed shown figure cycle enlargement disturbances reaches limit successive disturbances longer larger occurs physiological responses longer increase linearly relation size stimulus obvious example ventilation falls zero lower thus respiration maintained periods many minutes hours repetitive pattern apneas hyperpneas end linear decrease ventilation response falls however apnea occurs ventilation small air breathed never reaches alveolar space inspired tidal volume larger volume large airways trachea consequently nadir periodic breathing ventilation alveolar space may effectively zero easily observable counterpart failure time point endtidal gas concentrations resemble realistic alveolar concentrations many potential contributory factors identified clinical observation unfortunately interlinked covary extensively widely accepted risk factors hyperventilation prolonged circulation time reduced blood gas buffering physiologically interlinked given patient circulation time decreases cardiac output increases likewise given total body production rate alveolar ventilation inversely proportional endtidal concentration since mutual product must equal total body production rate chemoreflex sensitivity closely linked position steady state chemoreflex sensitivity increases things equal steadystate ventilation rise steadystate fall ventilation easy observe commonly measured clinical variables require particular experiment conducted order observe abnormalities variables likely reported literature however variables chemoreflex sensitivity measured
