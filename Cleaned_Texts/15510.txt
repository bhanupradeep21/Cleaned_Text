squirrel monkeys new world monkeys genus saimiri saimiri genus subfamily saimirinae name genus tupi origin saimirím çaimbirín sai meaning monkey mirím meaning also used english name early squirrel monkeys live tropical forests central south america canopy layer species parapatric allopatric ranges amazon oerstedii found disjunctly costa rica panama two main groups squirrel monkeys recognized differentiated based shape white coloration eyes total recognized squirrel monkeys short close fur colored black shoulders green purple fur along back extremities white squirrel monkeys determined breeding seasons involve large fluctuations hormones evidence sexual dimorphism squirrel monkeys sweat palms hands feet effect making hands feet feel damp touch squirrel monkeys must make use thermoregulation techniques behavioral changes urine washing monkeys live habitats high temperatures high humidity making essential maintain proper osmoregulation conditions pass certain color vision studies also performed squirrel monkeys purpose better understanding vision ailments common squirrel monkey commonly captured pet trade medical threatened two squirrel monkey species endangered central american squirrel monkey black squirrel monkey listed vulnerable south american squirrel monkeys considered part single widespread species many zoologists considered central american squirrel monkey member single species two main groups currently recognized separated white eyes shaped gothic pointed arch sciureus group shaped roman rounded arch boliviensis mammal species world recognized five subsequent taxonomic research recognized saimiri sciureus cassiquiarensis separate species saimiri cassiquiarensis also recognized additional species collins squirrel monkey saimiri collinsi previously considered within recent taxonomies also recognize saimiri sciureus macrodon separate species saimiri macrodon others recognize macrodon synonym saimiri crown group extant squirrel monkeys appears diverged around million years diversification squirrel monkey species appears occurred pleistocene epoch likely due climatic changes associated interglacial periods south america time origin squirrel monkeys central america unclear possible hypothesis human transport genetic work needs done subject reveal true boliviensis appears first diverging species group oerstedii sciureus sister

centimetres long plus centimetres tail male squirrel monkeys weigh grams oz females weigh grams oz males females equipped long hairy tails flat nails pointed female squirrel monkeys pseudopenises use display dominance smaller monkeys much way male squirrel monkeys display dominancecitation needed like new world monkey relatives squirrel monkeys diurnal arboreal unlike new world monkeys tail used climbing kind balancing pole also tool movements branches rapid squirrel monkeys live together multimalemultifemale groups members large groups however occasionally break smaller troupes groups number vocal calls including warning sounds protect group large falcons natural threat small body size also makes susceptible predators snakes felids marking territory squirrel monkeys rub tail skin urine squirrel monkeys omnivores eating primarily fruits insects occasionally also eat seeds leaves flowers buds nuts eggs squirrel monkey mating subject seasonal influences squirrel monkeys reach sexual maturity ages years females age years males females give birth young rainy season gestation mothers care young saimiri oerstedti weaned months age boliviensis fully weaned months old squirrel monkeys live years old wild years captivity menopause females probably occurs studies show saimiri collinsi time weaning young period time maximum fruit availability environment reduces energetic struggles newly weaned juveniles face transitioning milk diet dependent mother food diverse diet forage evidence squirrel monkeys show sexual dimorphism breeding season months leading breeding months breeding sexually mature adult males recorded increase size significant amounts relative females size changes caused seasonal fluctuations androgen hormones synthesized hypothalamus pituitary adrenal gonadal axes fluctuations include increases concentrations testosterone androstenedione dehydroepiandrosterone levels sexually mature males breeding season peaking january following breeding season androgen concentrations evolutionary reasoning size changes sexually mature males suggested intrasexual selections among males also female choice selection larger males likely preferred females partake copulations clear evidence yet females choose larger males leading hypothesis larger males likely better vigilance squirrel monkeys sweat palms hands soles feet sweating areas alone provide enough cooling monkeys survive high temperature environments south central america requiring use methods thermoregulate use behavioral tactics seeking shaded areas sheltered sun also make use postural changes better dissipate heat body also make use technique maximize evaporative cooling known urine washing monkeys urinate hands rub urine soles feet urine evaporated body cooling process studies shown behavior maximized times high temperature highlighting importance thermoregulatory squirrel monkeys subject high temperatures high humidity natural habitat humidity range saturation dry season wet season squirrel monkeys able tolerate humidity small adjustments behavior physiology increase significance humidity goes reaching approximately humidity monkeys drastic changes osmoregulation order maintain homeostasis evaporative water loss decreases high levels saturation monkeys take less water create concentrated urine order maintain proper ion water levels inside cooperation largely evident human primates squirrel monkeys often display cooperation wild many nonhuman primates studies done suggest female squirrel monkeys show disadvantageous inequity aversion pertains food rewards however could said male squirrel monkeys studies need done squirrel monkey behavior yield information regarding squirrel monkeys rarely show cooperation disadvantageous inequity aversion relevant colour vision squirrel monkeys extensively studied standin human humans two genes colour vision found x chromosome typically one gene produces pigment sensitive nm wavelength gene produces pigment sensitive nm squirrel monkeys one gene x chromosome exists three varieties one sensitive nm one nm one nm since males one x chromosome dichromatic although different sensitivities females two x chromosomes copies two different alleles three alleles seem equally common leading onethird females dichromatic twothirds recently gene therapy given human gene adult male squirrel monkeys producing
