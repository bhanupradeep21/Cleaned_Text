test may performed determine presence specific type antibody people cold agglutinin disease coombs test almost always positive immunoglobulin treatment rituximab treatment cold agglutinin disease depends many factors including severity condition signs symptoms present person underlying cause example affected secondary cold agglutinin disease important diagnose treat underlying condition may include certain types cancer bacterial viral parasitic infections andor autoimmune disease people symptoms andor mild anemia may require specific treatment cases often managed simply avoiding exposure severe cases hemolysis medical interventions may necessary rituximab antibody selectively reduces specific types immune cells effective cases severe cold agglutinin disease medical researchers found response rituximab seen average within months treatment effect treatment lasts years rituximab may used second even third relapse however success rate less combined treatment rituximab fludarabine resulted higher response rates cases longer periods remissions average years however combined treatment may include serious side effects presently recommended rituximab worked alone finally plasmapheresis involves filtering blood remove antibodies may useful acute hemolytic crisis surgery requiring hypothermia however effect short term removing spleen recommended cold agglutinin disease addition severe cold agglutinin disease requires high doses corticosteroids levels considered safe corticosteroid treatment longer recommended treatment severe several possible therapies reported case
