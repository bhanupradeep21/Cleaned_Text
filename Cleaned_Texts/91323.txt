scientific worldview feyerabend argued schrödingers demand scientific theories present anschaulich ie intuitively visualizable restrictive using example development bohrs atomic theory claims theories originally unvisualizable develop new ways making phenomena unpublished paper philosophers physicists argues naturalistic understanding philosophy philosophy petrified without physics physics liable become dogmatic without feyerabends early career also defined focus technical issues within philosophy quantum mechanics feyerabend argues von neumanns nogo proof shows copenhagen interpretation consistent fundamental theorems quantum mechanics logically follow therefore causal theories quantum mechanics like bohmian mechanics logically ruled von neumanns meeting david bohm feyerabend became outspoken defender bohms interpretation argued hidden variable approaches quantum mechanics pursued increase testability copenhagen feyerabend also provided solution measurement problem although soon came abandon solution tries show von neumanns measurement scheme made consistent without collapse postulate solution anticipates later developments decoherence much feyerabends work late late devoted methodological issues science specifically feyerabend offers several criticisms empiricism offers brand theoretical pluralism feyerabend offers several criticisms empiricism one concerns distinction observational theoretical terms observational term understood one whose acceptance determined immediate perception counts observational theoretical changes throughout history patterns habituation change ability directly perceive entities another definition observation terms known directly certainty whereas theoretical terms hypothetical feyerabend argues statements hypothetically since act observation requires theories justify replace empiricism feyerabend advances theoretical pluralism methodological rule scientific progress view proliferating new theories increases testability previous theories might wellestablished observations tests unearthed without invention alternative one example feyerabend uses repeatedly brownian motion test second law classical become test must first explained alternative theory namely einsteins kinetic theory gases formally contradicts accepted theory proliferating new theories increase number indirect tests theories makes theoretical pluralism central feyerabends conception scientific method eventually feyerabends pluralism incorporates calls principle principle tenacity allows scientists pursue theories regardless problems may possess examples problems might include recalcitrant evidence theoretical paradoxes mathematical complexity inconsistency neighboring theories feyerabend learned idea kuhn argued without tenacity theories would prematurely principle complements principle proliferation admonishes us invent many theories possible invented theories become plausible empiricism reduction experience feyerabend outlines theory incommensurability theory appears year thomas kuhns discussion incommensurability structure scientific revolutions two developed according feyerabend instances theory change history science involve successor theory retains predecessor limiting case words scientific progress always involve producing theory generalization previous theory successor theory formally inconsistent previous theory attempting explain domain moreover two theories share empirical content therefore compared set observation statements example buridans impetus principle analogue classical mechanics closest analogue would momentum two notions qualitatively distinct impetus causes motion whereas momentum result motion furthermore feyerabend claims parallel notion impetus explicable within classical mechanics parallel notion gives nonzero values must assume inertial movements happen resisting medium inconsistent assumption classical mechanics inertial motion happens empty space therefore concept impetus fixed usage established impetus theory defined reasonable way within newtons theory since usage involves laws inconsistent newtonian response criticisms feyerabends position clarifies ways theories compared comparing structures infinite sets elements detect comparing local grammars building model theory within incommensurability however arises scientists make choice interpret theories realistically theories interpreted instrumentally incommensurable feyerabends view feyerabends pluralism supported calls pragmatic theory meaning developed explicitly resuscitates neurath carnaps physicalism according pragmatic theory meaning language consists two parts first characteristic language series noises produced specific experimental situations feyerabends views human observation special epistemic status another kind measuring apparatus characteristic language comes placing observers presence phenomena instructing make specific noises phenomenon sensed noises become statements parts language meaning must interpreted interpretation comes theory whose meaning given learned though necessarily interpreted characteristic statements used test theories beginning least midtolate feyerabend distanced popper professionally intellectually great amount controversy source nature feyerabends distancing joseph agassi claims caused student revolutions berkeley somehow promoted feyerabends move towards epistemological anarchism defended feyerabends friend roy edgley claims feyerabend became distanced popper early went bristol berkeley influenced thomas kuhn marxism david feyerabends first paper explicitly repudiates popper twopart paper niels bohrs conception according popper bohr followers accepted complementarity consequence accepting positivism one repudiates positivism philosophical doctrine popper claims one undermines principle complementarity feyerabend claims bohr pluralist attempting pursue realistic interpretation quantum mechanics bohrkramerslater conjecture abandoned due conflict bothegeiger comptonsimon feyerabend concedes many bohrs follows notably leon rosenfeld accept principle complementarity philosophical dogma contends bohr accepted complementarity entangled empirically adequate physical theory microphysics feyerabend outlines anarchistic theory knowledge captured slogan anything goes phrase anything goes first appears feyerabends paper experts free society famously proclaimed end first chapter feyerabends epistemological anarchism source contention amongst scholars claim epistemological anarchism positive view scientific method conclusion reductio ad absurdum rationalism view universal unchanging rational rules scientific reasoning feyerabends words anything goes principle hold terrified exclamation rationalist takes closer look interpretation feyerabend aims show methodological view held fixed universal therefore fixed universal rule would anything goes would useless another interpretation feyerabend claiming scientists unscrupulous opportunists choose methodological rules make sense within given view universal methodological rules local rules scientific reasoning followed use phrase opportunism comes denotes inquirer changes beliefs techniques fit situation hand rather prejudge individual events welldefined methods convictions feyerabend thinks justified two individuals two scientists two pieces apparatus two situations ever exactly alike procedures therefore able vary third interpretation epistemological anarchism generalization pluralism developing throughout view feyerabend anarchist turn merely generalized positive philosophy general view epistemological anarchism synonymous pluralism without limits one proliferate theory one wishes one tenaciously develop theory long one wishes relatedly methods depend empirical theories utility one employ method one wishes attempt make novel discoveries mean believe anything wish beliefs must still stand critical scrutiny scientific inquiry intrinsic constraints scientific practice materially forced upon scientists moreover feyerabend also thought theoretical anarchism desirable humanitarian systems organization imposing rigid rules scientists possible science know today search truth style traditional philosophy create monster possible objective approach frowns upon personal connections entities examined harm people turn miserable unfriendly selfrighteous mechanisms without charm humour possible asks kierkegaard activity objective criticorational observer nature weaken strength human suspect answer many questions affirmative believe reform sciences makes anarchic subjective kierkegaards sense urgently needed method ed p according existential methodological rules tested kinds lives suggest feyerabends position seen radical implies philosophy neither succeed providing general description science devising method differentiating products science nonscientific entities like myths support position methodological rules generally contribute scientific success feyerabend analyzed counterexamples claim good science operates according methodological standards invoked philosophers feyerabends time namely inductivism falsificationism starting episodes science generally regarded indisputable instances progress eg copernican revolution argued episodes violated common prescriptive rules science moreover claimed applying rules historical situations would actually prevented scientific primary case study galileos hypothesis earth rotates axis feyerabends later work especially conquest abundance feyerabend articulates metaphysical theory universe around us abundant sense allows many realities accepted simultaneously according feyerabend world calls pliable enough change accordance ways causally engage laboratories example scientists simply passively observe phenomena actively intervene create phenomena help various techniques makes entities like electrons genes real stably used life one may live since choices lives live depend ethics desires real depends plays role life think worth living feyerabend calls aristotles principle believes aristotle held therefore pliable enough manipulated transformed make many realities conform different ways living however realities possible resists attempts live certain ways entity declared real mere stipulation feyerabends words assert form life lead wellarticulated livable world material humansface must approached right way offers resistance constructions incipient cultures cargo cults example find point attack simply leads feyerabend defend disunity world thesis articulated many members stanford school many realities reduced one common reality contain different entities makes possible realities contain gods others purely materialistic although feyerabend thought materialistic worldviews deficient many unspecified along number century philosophers notably wilfrid sellars willard van orman quine richard rorty feyerabend influential development eliminative materialism radical position philosophy mind definitions eliminative materialism holds exists material processes therefore ordinary commonsense understanding mind folk psychology false described modern proponent paul churchland follows eliminative materialism thesis commonsense conception psychological phenomena constitutes radically false theory theory fundamentally defective principles ontology theory eventually displaced rather smoothly reduced completed feyerabend wrote eliminative materialism three short papers published early common interpretation papers early forerunner eliminative materialism major influence patricia paul churchland keeley paul churchland spent much career carrying feyerabend mantle forward recent scholarship claims feyerabend never eliminative materialist merely aimed show common criticisms eliminative materialism methodologically faulty specifically interpretation feyerabend defended eliminative materialism arguments acquaintance intuitive understanding mind explicitly claim eliminative materialism true feyerabend leaves open possibility dualism true would shown scientific arguments rather philosophical case feyerabend explicitly disavows materialism later philosophical writings feyerabend briefly entertains sympathetic hypothesis innate cognitive limitations imposed upon human brain meant intrinsic limitations conceive understand spread feyerabends writings passages suggest confirmed evidence time mindbrain sciences specifically claims two three per cent inbuilt

supervised committees lay thought citizens use principles making decisions matters rejected view science especially rational grounds single common rational ingredient unites sciences excludes modes
