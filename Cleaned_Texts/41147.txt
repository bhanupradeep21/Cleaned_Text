anna sergeevna akhmanova born may russianborn professor cell biology utrecht university best known research regarding microtubules proteins called tips stabilize one specific end tubules among awards one recipients spinoza prize highest honor dutch scientists anna akhmanova born may moscow russia family grandmother english linguistics professor father physics professor mother brother hold phds physics well cites interest nature early age career science natural choice attended moscow state university studied biology countrys thenstandard fiveyear program receive masters program studied basic biology along cell biology biochemistry fifthyear research thesis completed alexander mankins laboratory researched halophilic archaebacteria credits mankin person learned molecular biology knowledge received masters degree graduating moscow state akhmanova left russia continue studies netherlands originally looked doctorate programs russia however salaries low absolutely funding research country whole experiencing time soviet policy perestroika negatively affecting university research programs led akhmanovas decision go netherlands young daughter obtain phd worked radboud university nijmegen ru lab wolfgang hennig research focused obtaining mutants histone received phd completed two postdoctoral projects first ru worked anaerobic organisms department microbiology second postdoc done erasmus university rotterdam worked niels galjarts lab department cell biology frank grosveld headed research focused gene regulation transcription worked one transcription factor using twohybrid screening asked casper hoogenraad help screening microtubulebinding protein hoogenraad working akhmanova hoogenraad created clones proteins clasp bicaudald akhmanova describes proteins defined akhmanova hoogenraad continued collaborate research moved laboratories utrecht university began running division cell still cell biology professor utrecht university continues research intracellular transportation especially involving microtubule akhmanova team study cell cytoskeleton effect human diseases cell polarization vertebrate development main focus microtubules form part cytoskeleton essential many processes especially cell division research important battling disease processes cancer neurodegeneration spread pathogens throughout terms methods team uses high resolution images cells studying utilize specific assays measure protein dynamics reconstitute cytoskeleton processes vitro identify interactions different team studies specific proteins interact plus minus ends microtubules specifically plus end tracking proteins tips associate plus end microtubule regulate dynamics tips interact structures cell recently started researching biochemical properties functional roles proteins organize minus end tracking proteins far less information still fully understood however recent research camsap type shown plays important role organizing stabilizing microtubules interphase akhmanovas group focus finding camsap contributes organization stabilization noncentrosomal microtubules cell another projects concerns mechanisms involved microtubulebased vesicle transport identified several structures link microtubule motors kinesin dynein vesicles developed procedures show function linkers gatheringclarification needed motor proteins associate membrane organelles inside cell kinesin dynein protein motors required longrange transport along microtubules akhmanovas team focuses mainly dynein motor moves toward minus end microtubule linked various organelles vesicles transfers also study dynein coordinates kinesin motor moves toward plus end microtubule attached organelle vesicle study different signaling pathways affect motors examining protein bicaudal role dyneindependent transport found important dyneindependent transport mrna flies exocytotic vesicles mammals bicaudal also found important positioning centrosomes nucleus mitosis positioning facilitated dynein akhmanova team use constitutive exocytosis model system study kinesin dynein exocytotic carriers move golgi plasma membrane along microtubules team found cortical complexes used attach microtubule plasma membrane used attach vesicles team plans study cortical complexes made regulated affect attachments dynamics microtubules mechanism allows fuse vesicles also would like find information nfÎºb signaling pathway found proteins called elks found cortical complex plan research pathways components interact affects microtubule stabilization vesicle akhmanova
