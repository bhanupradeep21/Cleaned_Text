lower gastrointestinal bleeding commonly abbreviated lgib form gastrointestinal bleeding lower gastrointestinal tract lgib common reason seeking medical attention hospitals emergency lgib accounts gastrointestinal bleeding less common upper gastrointestinal bleeding estimated ugib accounts per cases versus per cases approximately lower gastrointestinal bleeding involves colon bleeds actually upper gastrointestinal bleeds involve small lower gastrointestinal bleed defined bleeding originating distal ileocecal valve includes colon rectum lgib previously defined bleed occurs distal ligament treitz included aforementioned parts intestine also included last duodenum entire area jejunum divided middle gastrointestinal bleeding ligament treitz ileocecal valve lower gastrointestinal bleeding involves bleed anywhere ileocecal valve stool person lower gastrointestinal bleed good infallible indication bleeding occurring black tarry appearing stools medically referred melena usually indicates blood gi tract least melena fourtimes likely come upper gastrointestinal bleed lower gi tract however also occur either duodenum jejunum occasionally portions small intestine proximal bright red stool called hematochezia sign fast moving active gi bright red maroon color due short time taken site bleed exiting anus presence hematochezia sixtimes greater lgib occasionally person lgib present signs internal bleeding especially chronic bleed ongoing low levels blood loss cases diagnostic assessment preassessment watch signs symptoms patient may present include limited hypotension tachycardia angina syncope weakness confusion stroke myocardial infarctionheart attack shock following possible causes lgib diagnostic evaluation must performed patients adequately resuscitated upper gi source

factors could associated potential causes blood coating stool suggests hemorrhoidal bleeding blood mixed stool implies proximal source bloody diarrhea tenesmus associated inflammatory bowel disease

masses enlargement liver spleen additional key elements include careful thorough inspection anus palpation rectal masses characterization stool color stool guaiac card test evaluate presence

obstruction case administered subcutaneously full effect vitamin k obtained hours unlike fresh frozen plasma immediately reverses clotting abnormalities intravenous formulation vitamin k reverses coagulopathy quickly may used cases severe bleeding however patients monitored anaphylaxis effects fresh frozen plasma last hours large volumes l may required completely reverse clotting abnormalities

acute lower gi bleeding limited patients undergo colonoscopycitation needed colonoscopy test choice majority patients acute lower gi bleeding diagnostic therapeutic diagnostic accuracy colonoscopy lower gi bleeding ranges urgent colonoscopy appears increase diagnostic yield wide range yield partially explained different criteria diagnosis often active bleeding nonbleeding visible vessel adherent clot found bleeding attributed lesion blood present area presence fresh blood terminal ileum presumed indicate non colonic source bleeding overall complication rate colonoscopy acute lower gi bleeding bowel preparation safe well tolerated patients complication rate colonoscopy unprepped colon may higher colonoscopy preparations acute lower gi bleeding poor l golytely administered orally via nasogastric tube effluence cases requiring emergency hospital admission bleeding resolve patient suspected severe blood loss likely placed vital sign monitor administered oxygen either nasal cannula simple face mask intravenous catheter placed easily accessible area iv fluids administered replace lost blood endoscopic evaluation colonoscopy possibly esophagogastroduodenoscopy exclude ugib typically occur within hours hospital person lgib lowdose aspirin prevention first heart attack ie person never heart attack stopping aspirin contrast person previously heart attack aspirin continued despite active lgib due benefits preventing another heart attack consequent death outweighing risk dual antiplatelet therapy eg use aspirin clopidogrel continue person lgib underwent stenting hearts coronary arteries within last days recent acute coronary syndrome episode eg unstable angina myocardial infarction within days lgib individuals high risk another heart attack meeting criteria continue aspirin lgib event stop antiplatelet medication days following cessation predicting patients develop adverse outcomes complications severe bleeding difficult one recent study identified poor kidney function creatinine Î¼m age years abnormal haemodynamic parameters presentation low blood pressure persistent bleeding within first hours risk factors worse surgical intervention warranted cases lgib persist despite attempts stop bleeding endoscopic interventional radiology likely surgical consult ordered patient unable stabilized noninvasive techniques perforation found requires surgery eg
