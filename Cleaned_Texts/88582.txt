vascular anomaly range lesions simple birthmark large tumor may disfiguring caused disorder vascular vascular anomaly localized defect blood lymph vessels defects characterized increased number vessels vessels enlarged sinuous vascular anomalies congenital others appear within weeks years birth others acquired trauma pregnancy inherited vascular anomalies also described often present number lesions increase age vascular anomalies also part syndromecitation needed estimated prevalence vascular anomalies vascular anomalies occur throughout whole body patients localized head neck vascular anomalies present various ways situated deep skin appear blue often called cavernous superficial vascular anomalies appear redcoloured stains associated vascular anomalies affecting dermis historically vascular anomalies labeled descriptive terms according food resembled port wine strawberry cherry salmon patch imprecise terminology caused diagnostic confusion blocked communication even caused incorrect treatment differentiate various vascular however mulliken introduced classification replaced descriptive terms gave direction management various vascular anomalies classification based clinical features natural history cellular characteristics divides vascular anomalies two groups vascular tumors vascular although vascular tumors vascular malformations resemble important differences vascular tumors include hemangiomas common tumors infants occurring higher premature infants low birth vascular tumors characterized overgrowth normal vessels show increased endothelial proliferation typically present birth appear within couple weeks birth infancy four common types infantile hemangioma congenital hemangioma kaposiform hemangioendothelioma pyogenic granulomacitation needed infantile hemangioma common vascular tumor benign tumor occurs caucasian infants rarely dark skinned occurs low weight premature infants times frequently ih commonly presents head neck region also involves trunk extremities one third lesions present birth telangiectatic stain ecchymotic area first four weeks life appear lesions situated beneath skin may appear months age tumor large enough first months ih undergoes rapid growth faster growth child called proliferating phase months growth tumor decrease equal growth child months months tumor start involute might even disappear involution occurs onethird patient age years age years age involution may result residual telangiectasias pallor atrophy textural changes sometimes fibrofatty residuum since ih small localized asymptomatic treatment mainly consists observation awaiting involution complete ih treated corticosteroids accelerate involution patients growth stabilized tumors decrease size intralesional corticosteroids effective may require additional injections effect temporarily systemic corticosteroids may cause number sideeffects used problematic ih large treat intralesional injections proliferating phase tumor highly vascular patients undergo operative treatment period risk blood loss moreover surgery phase often leads inferior aesthetic outcome however patients may require intervention childhood ih leave residual fibrofatty tissue redundant skin damaged structures involution waiting involution completed ensures least amount fibro fatty residuum excess skin resected giving smallest possible another option treatment pulseddye laser involution residual telangiectasias treated laser therapycitation needed congenital hemangioma distinguished infantile hemangioma fully developed birth forms prenatal

observed involution completed involuted rich may leave behind atrophic tissue reconstructed autologous often best postpone excision regression complete effective pharmacologic treatments include intralesional corticosteroid injection systemic corticosteroid injection interferon angiogenic inhibitors use corticosteroids leads accelerated regression stabilization growth lightening color softening tumor however shows minimal response another drug treatment interferon often used patients respond corticosteroids although response rate much slower successful children serious side effect interferon spastic diplegia therapeutic options embolization pulseddye laser improves residual telangiectasias rich nichcitation needed kaposiform hemangioendothelioma khe rare vascular neoplasm locally aggressive without metastatic potential occurs particularly skin deep soft tissue retroperitoneum mediastinum rarely bone although lesions occur solitary often involve large areas body headneck region trunk extremity usually present birth flat reddishpurple tense edematous lesion although half lesions congenital khe develop infancy age years years age moreover adult onset described mainly males affected sexes affected equally children lesions often greater cm diameter cause visible deformity pain early childhood khe may enlarge years age may partially regress though usually persists longterm addition patients coagulopathy due thrombocytopenia presenting petechiae bleeding called syndrome caused trapping platelets clotting factors within tumor kasabachmerritt phenomenon less likely patients lesions less cm twothirds adultonset khe tumors less cm khe adults rarely associated kasabachmerritt patients khe kasabachmerritt phenomenon present petechiae ecchymosis khe tumors diffuse involving multiple tissue planes important structures resection khe thus often difficult treatment kaposiform hemangioendothelioma therefore medical primary drug interferon alfa successful another option vincristine many sideeffects response rate drug therapy often used shrinking tumor treating coagulopathy however many kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas completely regress remain much smaller asymptomatic tumor however khe still high mortality rate although complete surgical removal large margin best reported outcome usually done risk bleeding extensiveness anatomic site operative management may possible small localized lesions removal larger areas also may indicated symptomatic patients patients failed pharmacotherapy resection required lesions causing functional problems khe benign resection could cause deformitycitation needed pyogenic granuloma small benign vascular tumor primarily involves skin mucous pyogenic granuloma appears red macule grows rapidly turns papule eventually becomes pedunculated attached narrow average diameter lesions although lesions small often complicated bleeding crusting ulceration microscopically pyogenic granulomas characterized vascular proliferation amidst granulation tissue chronic inflammatory pyogenic granulomas rarely congenital commonly develops infants develops within first years vascular tumor twice common males females lesions seem associated trauma underlying cutaneous condition pregnancy hormonal alterations pyogenic granulomas also arise within capillary malformation pyogenic granulomas distributed head neck occurring mainly cheek oral cavity lesions face may cause visible deformitycitation needed numerous treatment methods described pyogenic granuloma lesions involving reticular dermis may reach pulseddye laser cautery shave excision therefore recurrence rate definitive management requires fullthickness skin excision options curettage laser therapy furthermore thorough curettage cauterization often used small lesions fullthickness excision larger lesioncitation needed vascular malformation collective term different disorders vasculature errors vascular development
