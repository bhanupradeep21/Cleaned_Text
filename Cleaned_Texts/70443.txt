highdensity lipoprotein hdl one five major groups lipoproteins complex particles composed multiple proteins transport fat molecules lipids around body within water outside cells typically composed proteins per particle organized one two three apoa hdl particles enlarge circulating blood aggregating fat molecules transporting hundreds fat molecules per lipoproteins divided five subgroups densitysize inverse relationship also correlates function incidence cardiovascular events unlike larger lipoprotein particles deliver fat molecules cells hdl particles remove fat molecules cells lipids carried include cholesterol phospholipids triglycerides amounts increasing concentrations hdl particles associated decreasing accumulation atherosclerosis within walls reducing risk sudden plaque ruptures cardiovascular disease stroke vascular hdl particles commonly referred good cholesterol transport fat molecules artery walls reduce macrophage accumulation thus help prevent even
