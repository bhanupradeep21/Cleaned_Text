almost total soybeans cultivation genetic makeup soybean gives wide variety uses thus keeping high demand first manufacturers wanted use transgenics able grow soybeans minimal cost meet demand fix problems growing process eventually found could modify soybean contain healthier components even focus one aspect soybean produce larger quantities phases became known first second generation genetically modified gm foods peter celec describes benefits first generation gm foods oriented towards production process companies second generation gm foods offers contrary various advantages added
