rich countries declining year midlife mortality fell per black nonhispanics per hispanics infamous aids epidemic brought control people received hiv diagnosis usa dependent areas overall decrease compared year cardiovascular disease cancer two biggest killers middle age also even though still growing problem obesity getting control yet despite satisfactory numbers white nonhispanic population exhibits increase premature deaths especially caused suicide drug overdose alcoholic liver disease two main factors driving trend firstly data show us white nonhispanic population significantly differs populations countries example drug alcohol suicide mortality two times higher among us white nonhispanics comparison people united kingdom sweden australia comparison us black nonhispanics mortality morbidity rates still lower nevertheless gap groups narrowing quickly example people aged difference two ethnicities almost completely diminished also white nonhispanics aged high school diploma reached almost premature deaths per year whereas average white nonhispanics regardless education around deaths per therefore factor education probably negatively correlates probability developing disease despair means higher education correlates lower probability developing disease secondly excess premature deaths stated caused primarily suicide poisonings drug overdoses causes
