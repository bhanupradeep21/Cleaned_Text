growth produce larger established seedlings seeds serve several functions plants produce key among functions nourishment embryo dispersal new location dormancy unfavorable conditions seeds fundamentally means reproduction seeds product sexual reproduction produces remixing genetic material phenotype variability natural selection acts plant seeds hold endophytic microorganisms perform various functions important protection seeds protect nourish embryo young plant usually give seedling faster start sporeling spore larger food reserves seed multicellularity enclosed embryo unlike animals plants limited ability seek favorable conditions life growth result plants evolved many ways disperse offspring dispersing seeds see also vegetative reproduction seed must somehow arrive location time favorable germination growth fruits open release seeds regular way called dehiscent often distinctive related groups plants fruits include capsules follicles legumes silicles siliques fruits open release seeds regular fashion called indehiscent include fruits achenes caryopses nuts samaras seeds enclosed fruit structures aid wind dispersal similar ways myrmecochory dispersal seeds ants foraging ants disperse seeds appendages called eg bloodroot trilliums acacias many species proteaceae elaiosomes soft fleshy structures contain nutrients animals eat ants carry seeds back nest elaiosomes eaten remainder seed hard inedible ants germinates either within nest removal site seed discarded dispersal relationship example mutualism since plants depend upon ants disperse seeds ants depend upon plants seeds food result drop numbers one partner reduce success south africa argentine ant linepithema humile invaded displaced native species ants unlike native ant species argentine ants collect seeds mimetes cucullatus eat elaiosomes areas ants invaded numbers mimetes seedlings seed dormancy two main functions first synchronizing germination optimal conditions survival resulting seedling second spreading germination batch seeds time catastrophe eg late frosts drought herbivory result death offspring plant seed dormancy defined seed failing germinate environmental conditions optimal germination normally environment suitable temperature proper soil moisture true dormancy innate dormancy therefore caused conditions within seed prevent germination thus dormancy state seed induced dormancy enforced dormancy seed quiescence occurs seed fails germinate external environmental conditions inappropriate germination mostly response conditions dark light cold hot dry seed dormancy seed persistence soil plant though even scientific publications dormancy persistence often confused used often seed dormancy divided four major categories exogenous endogenous combinational secondary recent system distinguishes five classes morphological physiological morphophysiological physical combinational exogenous dormancy caused conditions outside embryo including endogenous dormancy caused conditions within embryo including following types seed dormancy involve seed dormancy strictly speaking lack germination prevented environment characteristics seed see germination seeds undergo period dormancy seeds mangroves viviparous begin germinate still attached parent large heavy root allows seed penetrate ground falls many garden plant seeds germinate readily soon water warm enough though wild ancestors may dormancy cultivated plants lack many generations selective pressure plant breeders gardeners dormancy selected annuals seeds way species survive dry cold seasons ephemeral plants usually annuals go seed seed six seed germination process seed embryo develops seedling involves reactivation metabolic pathways lead growth emergence radicle seed root plumule shoot emergence seedling soil surface next phase plants growth called seedling three fundamental conditions must exist germination occur embryo must alive called seed viability dormancy requirements prevent germination must overcome proper environmental conditions must exist germination far red light prevent seed viability ability embryo germinate affected number different conditions plants produce seeds functional complete embryos seed may embryo often called empty seeds predators pathogens damage kill seed still fruit dispersed environmental conditions like flooding heat kill seed germination age seed affects health germination ability since seed living embryo time cells die replaced seeds live long time germination others survive short period dispersal die seed vigor measure quality seed involves viability seed germination percentage germination rate strength seedlings germination percentage simply proportion seeds germinate seeds subject right conditions growth germination rate length time takes seeds germinate germination percentages rates affected seed viability dormancy environmental effects impact seed seedling agriculture horticulture quality seeds high viability measured germination percentage plus rate germination given percent germination certain amount time germination days example dormancy covered many plants produce seeds varying degrees dormancy different seeds fruit different degrees possible seeds dormancy dispersed right away dry seeds dry go physiological dormancy great variation amongst plants dormant seed still viable seed even though germination rate might low environmental conditions affecting seed germination include water oxygen temperature light three distinct phases seed germination occur water imbibition lag phase radicle emergence order seed coat split embryo must imbibe soak water causes swell splitting seed coat however nature seed coat determines rapidly water penetrate subsequently initiate germination rate imbibition dependent permeability seed coat amount water environment area contact seed source water seeds imbibing much water quickly kill seed seeds water imbibed germination process stopped drying becomes fatal seeds imbibe lose water times without causing ill effects drying cause secondary dormancy seed dormancy often associated unpredictable stressful environments dna damage accumulates seeds
