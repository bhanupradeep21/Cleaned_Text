patients water intake increased especially waking order expand blood volume reducing eight ten cups water daily increasing salt intake adding salt food taking salt tablets drinking sports drinks electrolyte solutions effective way raise blood pressure helping body retain water different physicians recommend different amounts sodium combining techniques gradual physical training enhances cases increasing oral fluids salt intake enough intravenous saline drug desmopressin used help increase fluid large meals worsen symptoms people people may benefit eating small meals frequently throughout day alcohol food high carbohydrates also exacerbate symptoms orthostatic excessive consumption caffeine beverages avoided promote urine production leading fluid loss consequently exposure extreme heat may also aggravate prolonged physical inactivity worsen symptoms techniques increase persons capacity exercise endurance training graded exercise therapy relieve symptoms aerobic exercise performed
