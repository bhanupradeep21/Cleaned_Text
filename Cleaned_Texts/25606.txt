blood glucose monitoring use glucose meter testing concentration glucose blood glycemia particularly important diabetes management blood glucose test typically performed piercing skin typically via fingerstick draw blood applying blood chemically active disposable teststrip main option continuous glucose monitoring cgm different manufacturers use different technology systems measure electrical characteristic use determine glucose level blood skinprick methods measure capillary blood glucose ie level found capillary blood whereas cgm correlates interstitial fluid glucose level blood glucose level measurements may occur fasting random nonfasting intervals random glucose tests informs diagnosis monitoring different ways healthcare professionals advise patients diabetes mellitus appropriate monitoring regimen condition people type diabetes test least per day mayo clinic generally recommends diabetics use insulin type diabetics many type diabetics test blood sugar often times per day type diabetics times per day type assess effectiveness prior insulin dose help determine next insulin dose purpose blood glucose monitoring reveals individual patterns blood glucose changes helps planning meals activities time day take also testing allows quick response high blood sugar hyperglycemia low blood sugar hypoglycemia might include diet adjustments exercise insulin instructed health care blood glucose meter electronic device measuring blood glucose level relatively small drop blood placed disposable test strip interfaces digital meter within several seconds level blood glucose shown digital display needing small drop blood meter means time effort required testing reduced compliance diabetic people testing regimens improved significantly cost using blood glucose meters believed costbenefit relative avoided medical costs complications recent advances includecitation needed continuous glucose monitor determines glucose levels continuous basis every typical system consists continuous glucose monitors measure concentration glucose sample interstitial fluid shortcomings cgm systems due fact patients therefore require traditional fingerstick measurements calibration typically twice per day often advised use fingerstick measurements confirm hypo hyperglycemia taking corrective action lag time discussed reported anecdotally users various systems report lag times minutes lag time insignificant blood sugar levels relatively consistent however blood sugar levels changing rapidly may read normal range cgm system reality patient already experiencing symptoms outofrange blood glucose value may require treatment patients using cgm therefore advised consider absolute value blood glucose level given system well trend blood glucose levels example patient using cgm blood glucose mgdl cgm system might take action blood glucose consistent several readings patient blood glucose level whose blood glucose dropping steeply short period time might advised perform fingerstick test check hypoglycemia continuous monitoring allows examination blood glucose level reacts insulin exercise food factors additional data useful setting correct insulin dosing ratios food intake correction hyperglycemia monitoring periods blood glucose levels typically checked eg overnight help identify problems insulin dosing basal levels insulin pump users longacting insulin levels patients taking injections monitors may also equipped alarms alert patients hyperglycemia hypoglycemia patient take corrective actions fingerstick testing necessary even cases feel symptoms either condition technology limitations studies demonstrated patients continuous sensors experience smaller number hyperglycemic hypoglycemic events reduction glycated hemoglobin levels decrease glycemic compared intermittent testing likely help reduce hypertensive complications continuous blood glucose monitoring automatically covered health insurance united states way diabetic supplies covered eg standard glucose testing supplies insulin insulin pumps however increasing number insurance companies cover continuous glucose monitoring supplies receiver disposable sensors casebycase basis patient doctor show specific need lack insurance coverage exacerbated fact disposable sensors must frequently replaced sensors us food drug administration fda approved use although patients wear sensors longer recommended period receiving meters likewise finite lifetimes less years little months one factor slow uptake use sensors marketed united statescitation needed principles history recent

sufficient glucose result secondary diseases caused excessive glucose levels significant improvement diabetes therapy might achieved implantable sensor would continuously monitor blood sugar levels within body transmit measured data outside burden regular blood testing would taken patient would instead follow course glucose levels intelligent device like laptop smartphonecitation needed glucose concentrations necessarily measured blood vessels may also determined interstitial fluid levels prevail time lag minutes due connection capillary system however enzymatic glucose detection scheme used singleuse test strips directly suitable implants one main problem caused varying supply oxygen glucose converted glucono lactone glucose oxidase since implantation sensor body accompanied growth encapsulation diffusion oxygen reaction zone continuously diminished decreasing oxygen availability causes sensor reading drift requiring frequent recalibration using fingersticks test strips one approach achieving longterm glucose sensing measure compensate changing local oxygen approaches replace troublesome glucose oxidase reaction reversible sensing reaction known affinity assay scheme originally put forward schultz sims number different affinity assays fluorescent assays proving mems technology recently allowed smaller convenient alternatives fluorescent detection via measurement
