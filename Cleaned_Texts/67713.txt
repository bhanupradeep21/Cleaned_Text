pandemic often referred asiatic russian flu worldwide respiratory viral pandemic last great pandemic century among deadliest pandemics pandemic killed million people world population billion reported effects pandemic took place october december recurrences march june november june northern winter early according researchers estimates excess mortality russian influenza russian empire period could people lethality virus little although contemporaries described pandemic influenza scholars identified several influenza strains possible pathogen several authors early suggest may caused human coronavirus modern transport infrastructure assisted spread pandemic largest european countries including russian empire km railroads transatlantic travel sea took less six days significantly different current travel time air given timescale global spread first pandemic spread region eurasia conventionally believed disease first reported central asian city bukhara russian empire modern uzbekistan may goes back publications local physician follower miasma theory oskar heyfelder ignored lack catarrhal symptoms local independent commission four doctors august historians identified infectious agent bukhara may august influenza malaria endemic region latter suggested anomalously cold snowy winter anomalously high ground water levels possible reasons severeness likely first outbreak russian flu occurred western siberia tomsk province preceded epizootic pneumonia also conventionally believed newly built transcaspian railway enabled disease spread farther samarkand august tomsk km away however russian military detected flu samarkand august despite significant military presence along railway first flu cases diagnosed turkestan military district late despite fact transsiberian railway yet constructed often cited reason slow transmission virus european russia anomalous rise flu cases detected military second half october multiple european cities way meridian november pandemic reached saint petersburg infecting citys one million inhabitants midnovember kyiv infected next month lake baikal region well followed rest siberia sakhalin end st petersburg infection spread via baltic shipping trade vaxholm early november stockholm rest sweden infecting population within eight norway denmark followed soon german empire first received posen december

grenoble toulon toulouse lyon mainland ajaccio point spain also infected killing day reached london time spread quickly within great britain ireland birmingham glasgow edinburgh first case american soil reported december quickly spread throughout east coast way chicago kansas first american death thomas smith canton massachusetts reported san francisco cities also reached month total us death toll spread mexico south america reaching buenos aires india received february singapore dutch east indies indonesia followed japan australia new zealand april china may infection continued spread reaching original starting point central cases africa began appear port cities late december january although may early outbreak durban south africa november four months spread throughout northern hemisphere deaths peaked saint petersburg december united states week january median time first reported case peak mortality five malta asiatic flu took hold january march fatality rate deaths resurgence january may fatalities case fatality flu began debated whether fact humantohuman contagious disease virulence rapid spread across climates terrains demonstrated standard treatment flu quinine phenazone used well small doses strychnine larger ones whisky brandy cheaper treatments linseed salt warm water many people also thought fasting would starve fever based belief body would produce much heat less food fact poor medical furthermore many doctors still believed miasma theory disease rather infectious example notable professors university vienna hermann nothnagel otto kahler considered disease us public health departments little prevention advance even though knew transoceanic telegraph cable reports russian influenza result asiatic flu malta influenza became first time compulsorily notifiable researchers tried many years identify subtypes influenza responsible initially work primarily based detection antibodies influenza infection sera elderly thought pandemic caused influenza subtype epidemic subtype pandemic subtype confirmation cause flu pandemic following identification antibodies exhumed reanalysis seroarcheological data suggested influenza subtype possibly subtype likely cause view corroborated converging seroarcheological mortality data blood sera collected birth cohorts likely exposed early life pandemic highest percentages detectable antibodies strain later responsible pandemic correspondingly excess mortality decreased sharply pandemic cohorts years old older sars outbreak virologists started sequencing human animal coronaviruses comparison two virus strains betacoronavirus species bovine coronavirus human coronavirus indicated two recent common ancestor late century several methods yielding probable dates around authors speculated introduction former strain human population rather influenza might caused belgian team performed similar analysis identifying crossover date late examination contemporary medical reports noted pandemics clinical manifestations resembled rather influenza notable similarities including multisystem disease loss taste smell perception central nervous system symptoms sequelae similar long scientists pointed fact mortality curve russian flu jshaped found little mortality young high mortality old rather ushaped mortality found influenza infections high mortality young small sample dental remains tested lends weight still scientific consensus outbreak caused coronavirus one analysis literature suggesting evidence causality still first outbreak russian influenza tomsk province experiencing epizootic pneumonia cattle every year june november cattle mostly kulunda steppes barnaul district semipalatinsk region brought tomsk slaughter autumn pneumonia recorded among cattle tomsk despite outbreak cattle isolated moved freely streets city meat prices dropped ruble per pood resulting disease inhabitants city either slaughtered cattle sold animals cheaply cow cost rubles inhabitants siberia hoped drop temperature epizootic would subside newspapers wrote siberians obediently waited onset cold weather appearance however epizootic even intensified yes addition came obnoxious influenza notes relationship influenza animal diseases found newspaper physician Ð³ connection influenza epizootics horses dogs cats undoubted epizootics much common influenzathese data favour theory russian influenza could caused coronavirus transmitted cattle unlike influenza pandemics flu primarily elderly people died due generally lower standards living worse hygiene poorer standard medicine proportion vulnerable people higher modern
