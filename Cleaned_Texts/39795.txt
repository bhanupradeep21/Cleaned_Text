group traditional prosauropods form monophyletic sistergroup sauropoda anchisaurus instead closer family anchisauridae first proposed othniel charles marsh later defined clade consisting anchisaurus nearest relatives however clear genera included family many dinosaurs included since moved elsewhere group used current fossils anchisaurus originally discovered portland formation newark supergroup connecticut river valley formation preserves arid environment strong wet dry seasons hettangian age sinemurian age million years ago lived alongside theropods like dilophosaurus coelophysis digesting plant matter much intensive biochemical process digesting meat herbivore swallowed gastroliths gizzard stones help break food herbivorous dinosaurs needed huge gut since positioned front pelvis balancing two legs became increasingly difficult dinosaurs became larger gradually evolved quadrupedal position characterizes later sauropods prosauropods represented middle phase earliest bipedal herbivores later giant sauropods prosauropod anchisaurus mostly typical group flourished briefly late triassic early jurassic anchisaurus teeth used rip food shaped like fewer widely spaced teeth true prosauropods peter galton michael cluver observed narrower anchisaurus would spent time four legs could reared hind legs reach higher plants facultative biped anchisaurus multipurpose front legs hands could turned inwards used grasping simple reversible first finger similar thumb feet five toes could placed flat floor strong ankle unspecialized design typical early dinosaurs
