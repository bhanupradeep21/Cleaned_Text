oral pigmentation asymptomatic usually cause alteration texture thickness affected area colour uniform speckled appear solitary multiple depending site depth quantity pigment appearance vary oral pigmentation found following places oral pigmentation affects likely seen dark however people light skin average local pigmented areas circumstances present intraorally often found females typical age

accumulation oral bacteria build keratin tongue surface black hairy tongue also associated use certain medications antibiotics prolonged coffeetea drinking habit amalgam tattoo mostly found alveolar gingival mucosa however sometimes found buccal mucosa commonly found females older patients appears painless bluegrayblack nonulcerated soft macule without erythematous reaction surrounding tattoos greatest diameter usually less cm lesions containing larger particles may identifiable certain radiographscitation needed patients exhibit longterm inflammatory response may produce discoloured small papules discoloured patch may enlarge time patients demonstrating strong macrophage response amalgam deposits found within bone occasionally caused surgical procedure eg tooth extraction endodontic surgery caused material become inadvertently dislodged restoration adjacent tooth deposits become blackened lead blackening adjacent autosomal dominant disorder syndrome characterized intestinal hamartomatous polyps association mucocutaneous melanocytic macules macules often vary shades brown size confluent although oral site affected almost cases pigmented macules appear buccal mucosae lips around mouth pigmented macules face less common extent oral involvement degree pigmentation varies individual casecitation needed individual syndrome relative risk fifteen times greater developing

located basal layer epithelium melanin transferred keratinocytes melanosomes nevus cells skin oral mucosa also produce melanin oral melanosis present black gray blue brown lesions depending site amount melanin deposition increased melanin production without increase increased production melanin without increase number decrease blood adrenocortical hormone level causes increased levels adrenocorticotropic hormone secreted anterior pituitary gland result melanocytestimulating hormone induced causes oral increased melanin production defend damage tobacco increased number dendritic

management lesions typically close clinical monitoring photographs measuring tools biopsy may indicated following features present large newpigmented lesions papular appearance irregular physiological pigmentation considered normal variation however individuals brownblack discolouration may aesthetically displeasing may cause embarrassment discomfort particularly smiling talking methods used eliminate reduce pigmentation include gingivectomy laser therapy cryosurgery pros cons type management strategycitation needed cryotherapy one successful popular treatments oral melanosis cryotherapy damages tissue freezing internal components thereby jeopardising cells optimum temperature leading denaturation enzymes proteins required cell function minimum temperature needed cell damage cell specific melanocytes sensitive low temperatures cell death procedure relatively pain free local anaesthesia generally needed immediately slight erythema gingiva becomes apparent superficial necrosis observed next days whitish slough could separated underlying tissue leaving clean pink ulcer bed within week gingiva returns normal fully healed next weeks minus conclusion cryotherapy described suitable treatment options physiological oral melanosis simple yet effective method treating oral pigmentation minimal trauma alternatively lasers used treat physiological oral melanosis many different lasers available market purchase individual benefits disadvantages lasers expensive therefore commonly available hospital clinical setting however lasers allow controlled cutting limited depth necrosis studies shown diode laser safe method preferred laser short pulse lasers diode laser specific absorbed melanin meaning selective destruction less damage surrounding normal tissue comparison oral melanosis caused systemic diseases may first sign dentist medical professional may pick cause suspicion underlying systemic disease diseases treated relevant medications leads gradual decrease oral melanosis example addisons disease causes hyperpigmentation mouth may noticed exam followed alongside systemic symptoms oral biopsy alongside relevant tests ie bloods taken confirmed diagnosis type oral melanosis suspect caused underlying disease addisons specific treatment option would treat glucocorticoids mineralocorticoidscitation needed alternatively continuous exposure high concentrations corticosteroids increases susceptibility cushings syndrome also cause oral melanosis patterns pigmentation similar addisons management depend severity removed surgical radiation drug therapy ie regards oral melanosis caused systemic diseases important thing refer patient gmp suspicion underlying systemic cause suitable would appropriate carry relevant investigation come definitive diagnosis easier manage cause relevant medication variety different treatment options kaposi sarcoma appropriate therapy options may vary depending variation disease patients immune lesion localised
