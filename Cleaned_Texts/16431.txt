vertebrate anatomy ribs latin costae long curved bones form rib cage part axial tetrapods ribs surround chest enabling lungs expand thus facilitate breathing expanding chest cavity serve protect lungs heart internal organs thorax animals especially snakes ribs may provide support protection entire body human ribs flat bones form part rib cage help protect internal organs humans usually ribs people extra rib known cervical rib people may cervical rib right left attached back thoracic vertebrae numbered according vertebrae attach first rib attached thoracic vertebra front body ribs joined costal cartilage sternum ribs connect vertebrae costovertebral parts rib includes head neck body shaft tubercle angle head rib lies next vertebra ribs connect vertebrae two costovertebral joints one head one

articulating one nonarticulating articular facet small oval lower medial two connects transverse costal facet thoracic vertebra rib transverse costal facet end transverse process lower two vertebrae head connected nonarticular portion rough elevation affords attachment ligament tubercle tubercle much prominent upper ribs lower ribs first seven sets ribs known true ribs attached sternum costal cartilages first rib unique easier distinguish ribs short flat cshaped bone attaches vertebral attachment found neck first thoracic vertebra majority bone found level clavicle ribs become longer less curved progress following five sets known false ribs three sharing common cartilaginous connection sternum last two eleventh twelfth ribs termed floating attached vertebrae sternum cartilage coming sternum general human ribs increase length ribs decrease length rib along change size ribs become progressively oblique slanted ribs less slanted rib rib cage separated lower abdomen thoracic diaphragm controls breathing diaphragm contracts thoracic cavity expanded reducing intrathoracic pressure drawing air lungs happens one two actions mix two lower ribs diaphragm connects stabilized muscles central tendon mobile muscle contracts central tendon drawn compressing cavity underneath expanding thoracic cavity downward central tendon stabilized lower ribs mobile contraction diaphragm elevates ribs works conjunction muscles expand thoracic indent upward early developing embryo somites form soon subdivide three mesodermal components myotome dermatome sclerotome vertebrae ribs develop fourth week fertilization age costal processes formed vertebral bodies processes small lateral protrusions mesenchyme develop association vertebral arches fifth week costal processes thoracic vertebrae become longer form ribs sixth week costovertebral joints begin develop separate ribs vertebrae first seven pairs ribs true ribs join front sternal bars fetal stage sternal bars completely ribs begin cartilage later ossifies process called endochondral ossification primary ossification centers located near angle rib ossification continues direction away head neck adolescence secondary ossification centers formed tubercles heads jawed fish often two sets ribs attached vertebral column one set dorsal ribs found dividing septum upper lower parts main muscle segments projecting roughly sideways vertebral column second set ventral ribs arise vertebral column dorsal ribs enclose lower body often joining tips species possess types rib dorsal ribs commonly absent sharks example dorsal ribs short ventral ribs teleosts may additional riblike bones within muscle tetrapods however ever single set ribs probably homologous dorsal ribs fishes earlier choanates every vertebra bore pair ribs although thoracic vertebrae typically longest sacral ribs stout short since formed part pelvis connecting backbone hip true tetrapods many early ribs lost living amphibians reptiles great variation rib structure number example turtles eight pairs ribs developed bony cartilaginous carapace plastron snakes numerous ribs running along full length trunk frogs typically ribs aside sacral pair form part birds ribs present distinct bones thoracic region although small fused ribs present cervical vertebrae thoracic ribs birds possess wide projection rear uncinate process attachment shoulder usually dogs ribs mammals usually also distinct ribs thoracic vertebra although fixed cervical ribs also present monotremes therian mammals cervical lumbar ribs found tiny remnants fused vertebrae referred transverse processes general structure number true ribs humans similar mammals unlike reptiles caudal ribs never found ribs food widely used many animals cows pigs hogs sheep pandas ribs less meaty part meat chop often cooked part slab five known rack rack lamb short ribs ribs beef either served singly several plate rib steak beef popular choice used many cuisines pork ribs
