speech science phonetics formant broad spectral maximum results acoustic resonance human vocal acoustics formant usually defined broad peak local maximum harmonic sounds definition formant frequency sometimes taken harmonic augmented resonance difference two definitions resides whether formants characterise production mechanisms sound produced sound practice frequency spectral peak differs slightly associated resonance frequency except luck harmonics aligned resonance frequency room said formants characteristic particular room due resonances ie way sound reflects walls objects room
