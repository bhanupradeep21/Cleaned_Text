iodomethane also called methyl iodide commonly abbreviated mei chemical compound formula dense colorless volatile liquid terms chemical structure related methane replacement one hydrogen atom atom iodine naturally emitted rice plantations small also produced vast quantities estimated greater tons annually algae kelp worlds temperate oceans lesser amounts land terrestrial fungi bacteria used organic synthesis source methyl groups iodomethane formed via exothermic reaction occurs iodine added mixture methanol red iodinating reagent phosphorus triiodide formed situ alternatively prepared reaction dimethyl sulfate potassium iodide presence calcium iodomethane also prepared reaction methanol aqueous hydrogen iodide generated iodomethane distilled reaction mixture iodomethane may also prepared treating iodoform potassium hydroxide dimethyl sulfate like many organoiodide compounds iodomethane typically stored dark bottles inhibit degradation caused light give iodine giving degraded samples purplish tinge commercial samples may stabilized copper silver purified washing remove iodine followed distillation iodomethane produced microbial methylation iodide oceans major source rice paddies also iodomethane excellent substrate substitution reactions sterically open attack nucleophiles iodide good leaving group used alkylating carbon oxygen sulfur nitrogen phosphorus unfortunately high equivalent weight one mole iodomethane weighs almost three times much one mole chloromethane nearly times much one mole bromomethane hand chloromethane bromomethane gaseous thus harder handle also weaker alkylating agents iodide act catalyst reacting chloromethane bromomethane nucleophile iodomethane formed situ iodides generally expensive relative common chlorides bromides though iodomethane reasonably affordable commercial scale toxic dimethyl sulfate preferred since cheap higher boiling point iodide leaving group iodomethane may cause unwanted side reactions finally highly reactive iodomethane dangerous laboratory workers related chlorides bromides example used methylation carboxylic acids examples base removes acidic proton form carboxylate phenoxide anion serves nucleophile substitution iodide soft anion means methylation mei tends occur softer end ambidentate nucleophile example reaction thiocyanate ion favours attack sulfur rather hard nitrogen leading mainly methyl thiocyanate rather methyl isothiocyanate behavior relevant methylation stabilized enolates derived compounds methylation related enolates occur harder oxygen atom usually desired carbon atom iodomethane calkylation nearly always predominates monsanto process cativa process mei forms situ reaction methanol hydrogen iodide reacts carbon monoxide presence rhodium iridium complex form acetyl iodide precursor acetic acid hydrolysis cativa process usually preferred less water required use less byproducts mei used prepare grignard reagent methylmagnesium iodide memgi common source use
