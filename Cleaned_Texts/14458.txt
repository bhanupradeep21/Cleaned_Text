hemifacial spasm hfs rare neuromuscular disease characterized irregular involuntary muscle contractions spasms one side hemi face facial muscles controlled facial nerve seventh cranial nerve originates brainstem exits skull ear separates five main branches disease takes two forms typical atypical typical form twitching usually starts lower eyelid orbicularis oculi muscle time progresses

cause multiple three theories exist explain facial nerve dysfunction found hemifacial spasm first proposed theory ephaptic transmission electrical activity crossing one demyelinated neuron another resulting false second theory involves abnormal activity axons facial nerve root end zone secondary compressive third theory kindling theory involves increased excitability facial nerve nucleus due
