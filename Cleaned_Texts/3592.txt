bird species penis paleognathes tinamous anatidae ducks geese bird penis different structure mammal penises erectile expansion cloacal wall erected lymph usually partially feathered species features spines brushlike filaments flaccid state curls inside cloaca male birds external genitalia male waterfowl anatidae phallus birds mate males balancing top females touching cloacas cloacal kiss makes forceful insemination difficult phallus male waterfowl evolved everts bodies clockwise coil aids inseminating females without male waterfowl evolution phallus forcefully copulate females led counteradaptations females form vaginal structures called dead end sacs clockwise coils structures make harder males achieve intromission clockwise coils significant male phallus everts body counterclockwise spiral therefore clockwise vaginal structure would impede forceful copulation studies shown longer males phallus elaborate vaginal structures lake duck notable possessing relation
