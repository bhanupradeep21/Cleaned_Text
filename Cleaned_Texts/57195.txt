morvans syndrome rare lifethreatening autoimmune disease named nineteenth century french physician augustin marie morvan la chor√©e fibrillaire first coined morvan describing patients multiple irregular contractions long muscles cramping weakness pruritus hyperhidrosis insomnia normally presents slow insidious onset months approximately cases spontaneously go remission cases lead morvan described patient myokymia muscle twitching associated muscle pain excessive sweating disordered rare disorder characterized severe insomnia amounting less complete lack sleep agrypnia weeks months row associated autonomic alterations consisting profuse perspiration characteristic skin miliaria also known sweat rash tachycardia increased body temperature hypertension patients display remarkable hallucinatory behavior peculiar motor disturbances morvan reported term fibrillary chorea best described modern terms neuromyotonic association disease thymoma tumour autoimmune diseases autoantibodies suggests autoimmune paraneoplastic besides immunemediated etiology also believed occur gold mercury manganese one reported cases subject presented muscle weakness fatigue muscle twitching excessive sweating salivation small joint pain itching weight loss subject also developed confusional episodes spatial temporal disorientation visual auditory hallucinations complex behavior

may used determine two diseases subject amnesia seizures mesial temporal lobe structural abnormalities features le whereas myokymia hyperhydrosis insomnia favor morvans reported cases treatment options similar plasmapheresis alone combination steroids sometimes also thymectomy azathioprine frequently used therapeutic approach treating morvans syndrome however always work failed response steroids subsequently added plasmapheresis reported intravenous immunoglobulin effective one one case dramatic response highdose oral prednisolone together pulse methylprednisolone almost complete disappearance symptoms within short period induce consideration another case subject treated haloperidol mgday improvement psychomotor agitation hallucinations even high doses carbamazepine given subject failed improve spontaneous muscle activity plasma exchange pe initiated third session itching sweating mental disturbances complex nocturnal behavior improved symptoms completely disappeared sixth session improvement insomnia reduced muscle twitching however one month sixth pe session progressive worsening insomnia diurnal drowsiness promptly disappeared another two pe one case high dose steroid treatment resulted transient improvement aggressive immunosuppressive therapy cyclophosphamide necessary control disease result dramatic clinical another case subject treated prednisolone mgkg body weight carbamazepine propranolol amitriptyline two weeks improvement decreased stiffness spontaneous muscle activity improved sleep observed another days abnormal sleep behavior disappeared another case symptomatic improvement plasmapheresis thymectomy chronic immunosuppression provide support autoimmune paraneoplastic although thymectomy believed key element proposed treatment reported case morvans syndrome presenting reported cases morvans syndrome english limited number reported cases complete spectrum central nervous system cns symptomatology well natural history morvans highly variable two cases reported remit spontaneously others required combination plasmapheresis long term immunosuppression although one cases patient died shortly receiving plasma exchange pe fatalities without remission described amongst others morvan disease
