alioramus ˌælioʊˈreɪməs meaning different branch genus tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaurs late cretaceous period asia currently contains two species type species remotus known partial skull three foot bones recovered mongolian nemegt formation deposited humid floodplain million years ago remains named described soviet paleontologist sergei kurzanov second species altai known much complete skeleton also nemegt formation named described stephen l brusatte colleagues relationships tyrannosaurid genera first unclear evidence supporting hypothesis alioramus closely related contemporary species tarbosaurus bataar however discovery qianzhousaurus indicates belongs distinct branch tyrannosaurs namely tribe alioramini alioramus bipedal like known theropods sharp teeth indicate carnivores known specimens smaller tyrannosaurids like tarbosaurus bataar tyrannosaurus rex adult size difficult estimate since alioramus species known juvenile subadult remains genus alioramus characterized row five bony crests along top snout greater number teeth genus tyrannosaurid lower skull tyrannosaurids holotype pin alioramus partial skull associated three metatarsals joint sovietmongolian expedition gobi desert early found remains locality known nogontsav mongolian province bayankhongor nemegt formation alioramus named described russian paleontologist sergei kurzanov crests low skull profile looked different tyrannosaurids kurzanov believed find far removed members family accordingly gave generic name alioramus derived latin alius ramus branch specific name remotus means removed second species altai discovered back tsagan khushu locality also nemegt formation however several faunal differences may suggest respective locations remotus altai differ age holotype igm partial skeleton includes complete partial vertebrae pelvic girdle hindlimbs name species altai reference altai alioramus remotus estimated ft length originally described sergei kurzanov paul gave similar length ft weight kg molinapérez larramendi estimated remotus ft kg lb altai ft kg kurzanov however correct lengthening skull deformation fossilization may indicate shorter overall body length individual specimen juvenile adult alioramus would reached greater lengths confirmed adult specimens skull remotus approximately cm ft general long low shape typical basal tyrannosauroids juveniles larger tyrannosaurids premaxillary bones tip snout alioramus remotus found taller wide tyrannosauroids nasal bones fused ornamented row five irregular bony crests protrude upwards midline nasal bones sutured together crests measure cm back skull protrusion called nuchal crest arising fused parietal bones feature shared tyrannosaurids alioramus nuchal crest greatly thickened similarly tarbosaurus tyrannosaurus like rest skull lower jaw alioramus long slender another possible juvenile tarbosaurus ridge outer surface angular bone lower jaw articulated rear dentary bone locking two bones together removing much flexibility seen tyrannosaurids four premaxillary teeth dshaped cross section side including maxilla dentary alioramus teeth braincase altai intermediate basal theropod avialan rest skeleton alioramus remotus completely unknown except three metatarsals bones upper foot discovery altai known substantially complete remains shed light anatomy paleontologists long classified alioramus within superfamily tyrannosauroidea remains many years poorly known precise classification remained elusive discovery cladistic analysis published found alioramus could classified family tyrannosauridae subfamily tyrannosaurinae alongside tyrannosaurus tarbosaurus study supported result suggested equally probable alioramus belonged outside family tyrannosauridae entirely supposed juvenile characters actually reflecting basal position within another study omitted alioramus altogether due specimens fragmentary description altai confirmed placement genus within tarbosaurus alioramus shared several skull features including locking mechanism lower jaw dentary angular bones lacked prong nasal bones connected lacrimal bones tyrannosaurids except adult daspletosaurus two genera may closely related representing asian branch specimens tarbosaurus row bumps nasal bones like alioramus although much lower long low shape known alioramus remotus skull indicated immature died might even juvenile tarbosaurus lived time place prominent nasal crests much higher tooth count alioramus however suggested separate taxon even known juvenile confirmed discovery specimens identified immature tarbosaurus tooth count description qianzhousaurus erected new branch tyrannosaur family named alioramini consisting longsnouted q sinensis two known species alioramus clade uncertain placement relative members tyrannosaur branch initial analysis discovered primary phylogenetic analysis found alioramini closer tyrannosaurus albertosaurus therefore member group tyrannosaurinae however second analysis paper found located outside clade including albertosaurinae tyrannosaurinae therefore sister group tyrannosauridae first analysis found gorgosaurus albertosaurus qianzhousaurus alioramus altai alioramus remotus teratophoneus daspletosaurus tyrannosaurus tarbosaurus brusatte colleagues indicated alioramus lacks many robust brute skull traits deep maxilla robust lower jaws peglike teeth necessary employ puncturepull feeding characteristic large tyrannosaurids suggested alioramus may exploited different feeding style focusing smallsized prey would also suggest alioramus remains also collected tsagan khushu locality making different feeding strategies avoiding foster team hypothesized due slim gracile build alioramin genera may hunters small particularly fast nimble prey would allowed alioramins avoid competition larger tyrannosaurs specialized killing larger animals long delicate snouts alioramins like alioramus qianzhousaurus may also prevented killing prey species juvenile adult tyrannosaurids tyrannosaurids like tarbosaurus hunted though larger tyrannosaurs may hunted alioramins prey occasion alioramins may also different feeding strategy tyrannosaurids jaws seem weaker larger genera even juveniles larger species proportionately higher bite forces alioramins equivalent size furthermore alioramins seemingly remained confined asia suggesting factor prevented colonizing bettersampled fossil deposits north america may remains mystery evidence histological analyses performed holotype altai igm brusatte colleagues determined individual internal bone structure corresponding nine yearold actively growing tyrannosaurus team however noted terms body size individual closer seveneight yearold albertosaurus gorgosaurus fivesix yearold daspletosaurus tyrannosaurus may suggest alioramus attained comparably smaller adult size lastly brusatte team argued skull shape cranial ornamentation alioramus juvenile traits given igm smaller slender comparably aged tyrannosaurus longer snout known juvenile large tyrannosaurids albertosaurus tarbosaurus several welldocumented ontogenic growth series dinosaurs evidence ornamentation increases throughout growth latter may suggest adult alioramus possessed rather elaborate cranial examinations qianzhousaurus comparisons species alioramus published suggests alioramus species known juvenile specimens different growth stages qianzhousaurus represents adult example alioramini examinations also suggest variation seen various species consistent growth trends seen tyrannosaurid genera though specimens could constitute full growth series infant adult species recovered tyrannosaurs one part growth series across specimens study discovered remain unique alioramin tyrannosaurs rugose process jugal starts small conical early life becomes massive indistinct animals grow study also suggests alioramins undergo secondary metamorphosis slender juveniles robust adults like tyrannosaurs tarbosaurus
