lateral flow test assay also known lateral flow device lfd lateral flow immunochromatographic assay rapid test simple device intended detect presence target substance liquid sample without need specialized costly equipment lfts widely used medical diagnostics home point care laboratory instance home pregnancy test lft detects specific hormone tests simple economical generally show results around five thirty many labbased applications increase sensitivity simple lfts employing additional dedicated target substance often biological antigen many lateral flow tests rapid antigen tests rat art lfts operate principles affinity chromatography enzymelinked immunosorbent assays elisa essence tests run liquid sample along surface pad reactive molecules show visual positive negative result pads based series capillary beds pieces porous microstructured sintered pads capacity transport fluid eg urine blood saliva sample pad acts sponge holds excess sample fluid soaked fluid flows second conjugate pad manufacturer stored freeze dried bioactive particles called conjugates see matrix conjugate pad contains reagents required optimized chemical reaction target molecule eg antigen chemical partner eg antibody immobilized particles surface marks target particles pass pad continue across test control lines test line shows signal often color pregnancy tests control line contains affinity ligands show whether sample flowed biomolecules conjugate pad active passing reaction zones fluid enters final porous material wick simply acts waste container lfts operate either competitive sandwich

starting principle colored particle used latex blue color nanometersized gold red color commonly used gold particles red color due localized surface plasmon labelled particles also used require use electronic reader assess test result sandwich assays generally used larger analytes tend multiple binding sample migrates assay first encounters conjugate antibody specific target analyte labelled visual tag usually colloidal gold antibodies bind target analyte within sample migrate together reach test line test line also contains immobilized antibodies specific target analyte bind migrated analyte bound conjugate molecules test line presents visual change due concentrated visual tag hence confirming presence target molecules majority sandwich assays also control line appear whether target analyte present ensure proper function lateral flow rapid lowcost sandwichbased assay commonly used home pregnancy tests detect human chorionic gonadotropin hcg urine pregnant women competitive assays generally used smaller analytes since smaller analytes fewer binding sample first encounters antibodies target analyte labelled visual tag colored particles test line contains target analyte fixed surface target analyte absent sample unbound antibody bind fixed analyte molecules meaning visual marker show conversely target analyte present sample binds antibodies prevent binding fixed analyte test line thus visual marker shows differs sandwich assays band means analyte lfts intended operate purely qualitative basis however possible measure intensity test line determine quantity
