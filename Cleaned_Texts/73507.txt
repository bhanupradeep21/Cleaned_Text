tourism periods red tides important source revenue often lost impacted coastal communities florida often scale tens millions particular protist known harmful humans large fish marine mammals found survival scleractinian coral negatively affected brevetoxin scleractinian coral exhibits decreased rates respiration high concentration k brevetoxins group neurotoxic compounds released k brevis high concentration brevetoxins fatal fish marine mammals brevetoxis also pose threat large nearshore fish fatalities caused redtide shorebirds also get infected brevetoxins consuming thus redtide blooms major level effects impacting whole ecosystem additionally infected fish shellfish pose threat fishing industry k brevis red tides also found significant factor mortality multiple species sea specifically kemps ridleys loggerheads green turtles hawksbills particularly along west florida since red tide major cause stranded sea turtles contributes vulnerability endangered k brevis blooms pose lethal health risks marine animals like manatees extended occurrences red tide blooms gulf mexico associated substantial instances mortality manatee brevetoxins lower manatee immune systems
