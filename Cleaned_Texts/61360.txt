bullacephalus extinct genus biarmosuchian therapsids belonging family burnetiidae type species b jacksoni named known relatively complete skull lower jaw discovered late permian tapinocephalus assemblage zone beaufort group south genus therapsida lived late permian period approximately million years ago name bullacephalus comes latin words bullatus meaning bossed knobbed cephalus meaning head name refers distinctive bony knob top therapsids skull contributes history genus stem based taxon includes ictidorhinus hippasaurs bullacephalus even characterized skull moderately greatly pachyostotic swollen boss present postorbital bar formed postfrontal postorbital deep linear sculpturing snout exclusion jugal lateral temporal fenestra day et al therapsids spongy bone skull roof palatal process premaxilla long diverticulum naris adding burnetiamorph furthermore discovery bullacephalus helped refine taxonomic classification therapsids prior discovery uncertainty regarding relationship different groups therapsids particularly burnetiamorpha biarmosuchia however distinctive features bullacephalus suggest member burnetiamorpha provides bridge group biarmosuchia discovery bullacephalus also highlighted importance continued exploration excavation areas yielded therapsid fossils beaufort group south africa bullacephalus discovered important site therapsid fossils much

burnetiamorpha liu j rubidge b li j research morphology phylogenetics ecology bullacephalus burnetiamorpha likely continue yield insights evolution therapsids complex history life earth despite limited amount fossil material available bullacephalus generated considerable interest among paleontologists due unique morphology uncertain taxonomic classification part burnetiamorpha suborder currently burnetiamorpha comprise nine genera bullacephalus burnetia lemurosaurus lobalopex lophorhinus paraburnetia pachydectes south africa kruger et al researchers suggested bullacephalus type therapsida biarmoschia related successful tetrapod anomadontia helping researchers understand basic morphology specific therapsid could distinguished short snout septomaxilla short facial exposure nasal maxilla along many skull characteristics unique morphology particularly short snout septomaxilla led researchers speculate feeding habits ecological niche specimen bullacephalus moderately complete skull lower jaw missing anterior portions snout lower jaw badly weathered left side skull roof posterior pineal foramen temporal opening situated posteroventral orbit three pachyostosis bony

valuable information morphology classification position temporal opening posteroventral orbit common feature among therapsids presence three pachyostosis bony bosses distinguishing characteristic burnetiamorpha rugose surface anterior portion maxilla suggests bullacephalus may powerful bite nasal boss prominent supraorbital boss prefrontal also notable features bullacephalus skull may served attachment points powerful jaw muscles rectangular fossa anterodorsal side lacrimal another interesting feature bullacephalus skull fossa may site attachment lacrimal gland alternatively may site
