sexual differentiation humans process development sex differences humans defined development phenotypic structures consequent action hormones produced following gonadal sexual differentiation includes development different genitalia internal genital tracts body hair plays role sex development sexual differences begins xy sexdetermination system present humans complex mechanisms responsible development phenotypic differences male female humans undifferentiated females typically two x chromosomes males typically chromosome x chromosome early stage embryonic development sexes possess equivalent internal structures mesonephric ducts paramesonephric ducts presence sry gene chromosome causes development testes males subsequent release hormones cause paramesonephric ducts regress females mesonephric ducts regress divergent sexual development known intersex result genetic hormonal mammals including humans xy sexdetermination system chromosome carries factors responsible triggering male development absence chromosome fetus undergo female development presence sexdetermining region chromosome also known sry thus male mammals typically x chromosome xy female mammals typically two x chromosomes xx chromosomal sex determined time fertilization chromosome sperm cell either x fuses x chromosome egg cell gonadal sex refers gonads testicles ovaries depending genes expressed phenotypic sex refers structures external internal weeks elapse fertilization first signs sex differentiation observed human embryo subsequent early fetus appear sexually indifferent looking neither like male female next several weeks hormones produced cause undifferentiated tissue transform either male female reproductive organs process called sexual differentiation precursor internal female sex organs called müllerian system differentiation sexes sex organs occurs throughout embryological fetal later life males females sex organs consist two structures internal genitalia external genitalia males gonads testicles females ovaries organs produce gametes egg sperm reproductive cells eventually meet form fertilized egg zygote zygote divides first becomes embryo means growing within typically zero eight weeks eighth week birth considered fetus means unborn offspring internal genitalia accessory glands ducts connect gonads outside environment external genitalia consist external reproductive structures sex early embryo determined reproductive structures differentiate seventh week prior child considered bipotential identified male female internal genitalia consist two accessory ducts mesonephric ducts male paramesonephric ducts female mesonephric system precursor male genitalia paramesonephric female reproductive development proceeds one pairs ducts develops regresses depends presence absence sex determining region chromosome also known sry presence functional sry gene bipotential gonads develop testes gonads histologically distinguishable weeks gestation subsequent development one set degeneration depends presence absence two testicular hormones testosterone antimüllerian hormone amh disruption typical development may result development neither duct system may produce morphologically intersex individuals males sry gene transcribed processed produces sry protein binds dna directs development gonad testes male development occur fetal testis secretes key hormones critical period early gestation testes begin secrete three hormones influence male internal external genitalia secrete antimüllerian hormone amh testosterone dihydrotestosterone dht antimüllerian hormone causes paramesonephric ducts regress testosterone converts mesonephric ducts male accessory structures including epididymis vas deferens seminal vesicle testosterone also control descending testes abdomen many genes found autosomes including also play role gonadal females without testosterone amh mesonephric ducts degenerate disappear paramesonephric ducts develop uterus fallopian tubes upper still remains broad lack information genetic controls female development much remains unknown female embryonic weeks fetus genital tubercle urogenital groove sinus labioscrotal folds females without excess androgens become vulva clitoris labia males become externally distinct weeks androgens enlarge phallus cause urogenital groove sinus fuse midline producing unambiguous penis phallic urethra thinned rugate scrotum dihydrotestosterone differentiate remaining male characteristics external sufficient amount androgen cause external masculinization potent dihydrotestosterone dht generated testosterone skin genital tissue action male fetus may incompletely masculinized enzyme deficient diseases circumstances androgens may present high enough concentrations cause partial rarely complete masculinization external genitalia genetically female fetus testes begin secrete three hormones influence male internal external genitalia secrete antimüllerian hormone testosterone dihydrotestosterone antimüllerian hormone amh causes paramesonephric ducts regress testosterone secreted converts mesonephric ducts male accessory structures epididymis vas deferens seminal vesicle testosterone also control descending testes abdomen scrotum dihydrotestosterone also known dht differentiate remaining male characteristics external sex differentiation external genitalia occurs puberty androgen levels become disparate male levels testosterone directly induce growth penis indirectly via dht prostate alfred jost observed testosterone required mesonephric duct development regression paramesonephric duct due another substance later determined paramesonephric inhibiting substance mis kd dimeric glycoprotein produced sertoli cells mis blocks development paramesonephric ducts promoting visible differentiation occurs puberty estradiol hormones cause breasts develop typical females human adults children show many psychological behavioral sex differences eg dress learned cultural others demonstrable across cultures biological learned determinants example studies claim girls average verbally fluent boys boys average better spatial observed may due two different patterns parental communication infants noting parents likely talk girls likely engage physical play following variations associated atypical determination
