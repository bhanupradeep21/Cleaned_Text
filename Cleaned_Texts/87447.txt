offered patients early stage nsclc palliative treatment patients metastatic disease various types ablation used treating lung malignancies including radiofrequency ablation rfa cryoablation microwave ablation thermal ablation typically recommended patients higher risk surgical patients due cardiopulmonary disease ablation generally lower risk procedure compared surgery requires local anesthesia
