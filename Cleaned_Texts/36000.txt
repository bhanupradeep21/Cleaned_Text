hiv drug resistance occurs microevolution causes virions become tolerant antiretroviral treatments art art used successfully manage hiv infection number factors contribute virus mutating becoming resistant drug resistance occurs bacterial viral populations evolve longer respond medications previously worked case hiv recognized cases treatment resistant strains since drug resistance major contributor treatment global incidence varies greatly region region general increase overall hiv drug resistance two main types resistance primary induced differ mostly causation biggest cause resistance lack adherence specific details treatment newly created resistant strains hiv pose public health issue infect growing number people harder treat spread reason reaction growing number cases resistant hiv strains mostly try increase access treatment implement measures make sure people stay care well look development hiv vaccine hiv considered resistant longer respond known currently known cure hiv goal treatment reduce infected individuals viral load point longer detectable order alleviate symptoms reduce risk infecting hiv drug resistance poses issue reduces possible hiv medications person take due cross resistance cross resistance entire class medication considered ineffective lowering patients hiv viral load drugs given class share mechanism therefore development resistance one medication class precludes use medications class blood test done determine drugs may effective prior initiation treatment treatment ensure resistance one two types hiv drug resistance induced resistance induced resistance refers resistance occurs result drug therapy hiv retrovirus replicates quickly using reverse transcriptase known lack error correcting mechanisms resulting high mutation rate mutations confer substantial selective advantage hiv survival therefore quickly replicate within individual creating new resistant mutations accumulate generations populations resulting great genetic variation within populations hiv increased probability virion developing evolutionary selective advantage natural selection acts hiv selecting virions higher fitness others eventually killed drug virions able escape harmful effects drug create entirely new drug resistant population selectedfor virions continue reproducing patients viral load returns pretreatment levels creating cycle treatment initially successful reducing viral load becomes less effective virus becomes resistant virion levels type hiv drug resistance primary resistance primary resistance refers resistance incurred result art therapy thought strains naturally resistant art drugs prevalence strains varies across primary resistance acquired individuals initial infection hiv comes already resistant individual infected resistant strain begins course treatment already limited drug options pose problems later line develop additional previously described mutations occur result random mutations especially prevalent hiv due characteristic elements viral reproductive process namely use reverse transcriptase several mechanisms resistance identified including mutations block incorporation nucleosides class hiv drug viral one known cause hiv drug resistance lack adherence prescribed drug regiment low levels adherence attributed lack access healthcare stigmatization hiv lack availability drugs due prohibitive cost factors missing doses medication taking late poses major issue allow virus begin replicate inside body proper adherence also greatly reduces risk spread virus thereby improving general public health lowering health care drugs known lower incidencesspelling resistance may preferable individuals known difficulty adhering drug routine benefits weighed potential risks including severity side one study estimated percentage american hiv positive population form drug resistance recent study south korea estimated hiv positive population multidrug resistant strains hiv multiclass resistant strains multiclass resistant strains pose larger problem class includes many drugs eliminating use entire class drugs severely limits treatment studies indicate incidence resistance varies greatly based geographic locationcitation needed hiv drug resistance report world health organization conducted surveys countries estimate prevalence resistance hiv medications one subgroup included hivpositive patients initiated antiretroviral therapy order assess prevalence hiv drug resistance treatmentnaive patients deemed pretreatment drug resistance resistance nnrtis patient population ranged myanmar uganda resistance nrtis ranged namibia nicaragua resistance protease inhibitors ranged cameroon myanmar mexico resistance nnrti nrti combination therapy ranged myanmar current medical scientific opinion mixed effective treatment methods focused drug cocktails importance firstline world health organization advocates publichealth approach hiv treatment order make treatment uniform available patients around july implementing global action plan hiv drug resistance initiative intended help countries around world manage hiv drug among treatment methods world health organization acknowledges importance successful firstline firstline treatments known affect virus future response treatments making effectiveness firstline treatments issue vital successful treatments combinations three drugs used simultaneously greatly reduces probability virus developing shortly advent art therapy much controversy make drugs accessible developing world countries disease widespread strict regimen followed taking drugs critics hesitant distribute drugs underresourced countries worried patients would unwilling unable follow however studies comparing drug regimen adherence rates high low income countries showed individuals low income countries less likely correctly follow drug instructions one study african patients found satisfy standard adherence compared north american patients high adherence rates resourcepoor countries attributed success communitybased approaches like hiv equity initiative haiti employed local workers trained safely distribute hiv medication well programs brazil generic drugs able massproduced distributed little number people resistant strains hiv growing making matter pressing issue health care officials current trends continue infection rates rise government spending hiv drug resistance also potential disrupt progress made global fight aids target diagnose cases provide treatment infected individuals successfully suppress viral load treated new classes drugs constantly researched produced help address issue resistance well try alleviate steep costs associated managing however unaids believes issue currently control art treatment effective majority patients instead support research developing vaccine cure central mission reducing spread httpsenwikipediaorgwikihivdrugresistance
