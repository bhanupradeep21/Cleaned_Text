teeth common vertebrates mammalian teeth distinctive variety shapes functions feature first arose among early therapsids permian continued present day therapsid groups exception mammals extinct groups possessed different tooth patterns aids classification fossils extant mammals including humans diphyodonts ie early set deciduous teeth later set permanent adult teeth notable exceptions elephants kangaroos manatees polyphyodonts ie teeth continuously replaced mammal teeth include incisors canines premolars molars present mammals various evolutionary modifications occurred lack canines glires development tusks either incisors elephants canines pigs walruses adaptation molars fleshshearing carnassials carnivora others extant mammalian infraclasses set dental formula eutheria placental mammals commonly three pairs molars four premolars per jaw whereas metatheria marsupials generally four pairs molars three two premolars example tiger quoll dasyurus maculatus dasyurid marsupial native australia quoll possesses four upper incisors three lower incisors per left righthand side two upper premolars pm two lower premolars per side pm four upper four lower molars per side giving animal complement thirtyeight teeth tiger quolls dental formula therefore follows rabbits lagomorphs usually shed deciduous teeth shortly birth usually born permanent teeth rabbits complement diet consist wide range vegetation since many foods abrasive enough cause attrition rabbit teeth grow continuously throughout rabbits dental formula canines three four millimeters tooth worn away incisors every week whereas posterior teeth require month wear away anatomy rabbit teeth incisors cheek teeth rabbits called aradicular hypsodont teeth aradicular teeth never form true root apex hypsodont teeth high crown root ratio providing room wear sometimes referred elodont dentition meaning evergrowing teeth grow erupt continuously growth eruption held balance dental abrasion chewing diet high fiber like rabbits rodents incisors grow continuously throughout lives aradicular hypsodont unlike humans whose ameloblasts die tooth development rodents continually produce enamel must wear teeth gnawing various teeth used cutting wood biting skin fruit defense teeth enamel outside exposed dentin inside selfsharpen gnawing hand continually growing molars found rodent species sibling vole guinea variation dentition rodents generally rodents lack canines premolars space incisors molars called diastema region elephants tusks specialized incisors digging food fighting elephants polyphyodonts whose teeth similar manatees notable elephants believed undergone aquatic phase evolution elephants four molars one side upper lower jaw age replaced larger molars new molars shift forward back jaw old wear final set molars last twenty manatees polyphyodonts mandibular molars developing separately jaw encased bony shell separated soft tissue aardvarks teeth lack enamel many pulp tubules hence name order tubulidentata adult horse teeth horses twelve premolars twelve molars twelve generally male equines also four canine teeth called tushes molars incisors however female horses less canines usually one two many times partially horses one four wolf teeth vestigial premolars one two equally common male female horses much likely upper jaw present cause problems interfere horses bit contact therefore wolf teeth commonly horse teeth used estimate animals age birth five years age closely estimated observing eruption pattern milk teeth permanent teeth age five permanent teeth usually erupted horse said full mouth age five age conjectured study wear patterns incisors shape angle incisors meet factors wear teeth may also affected diet natural abnormalities cribbing two horses age may different wear patterns horses incisors premolars molars fully developed continue erupt grinding surface worn chewing young adult horse teeth inches long majority crown remaining gumline dental socket rest tooth slowly emerge jaw erupting year horse ages animal reaches old age crowns teeth short teeth often lost altogether old horses lacking molars may need fodder ground soaked water create soft mush eat order obtain adequate nutrition tusks grow larger males wild boars derived canine teeth trait shared warthogs toothed whales comprising odontoceti suborder cetaceans differentiated baleen whales presence teeth number teeth function vary widely species dolphins hundred teeth jaws narwhal two functional teeth upper jaw grow long tusks males tusk used feeding navigation mating contains millions sensory pathways making neurologically complex tooth known contrast sperm whale forty teeth bottom jaw none functional upper order carnivora many different diets always meat carnivores possess diverse carnassial teeth carnassials specialized teeth different diets different animals teeth used cut flesh either molars premolars molars combination may adapted shearing carnassials tooth roots great indicators study done bear tooth root area found amount space tooth root took indicator bite force required species example panda teeth deepest root systems bamboo diet ursidae bears carnivorous family whose root area studied found general carnivore tooth roots highly dependent diets walrus tusks canine teeth grow continuously throughout dogs teeth less
