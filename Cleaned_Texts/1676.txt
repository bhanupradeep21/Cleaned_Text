lagotrix monkeys native south central american forests famous loud howls heard three miles away dense rain fifteen species recognized previously classified family cebidae placed family atelidae primarily folivores also significant frugivores acting seed dispersal agents digestive system locomotion threats include human predation habitat destruction illegal wildlife trade capture pets zoo animals howler monkeys short snouts wideset round nostrils noses keen smell food primarily fruit nuts km away noses usually roundish snouttype nostrils many sensory hairs growing interior range size cm excluding tails equally long fact cases tail found almost five times body lengthcitation needed prime characteristic like many new world monkeys prehensile tails use picking fruit nuts trees unlike new world monkeys male female howler monkeys trichromatic color evolved independently new world monkeys due gene lifespans years howler species dimorphic also dichromatic ie alouatta caraya males typically kg heavier females males experience evolutionary trade investments precopulatory traits larger hyoids smaller testes postcopulatory traits larger testes smaller hyoidsthe hyoid alouatta pneumatized one cases postcranial pneumaticity outside saurischia volume hyoid male howler monkeys negatively correlated dimensions testes number males per group larger hyoids decrease space formant offers impression larger body flat cranial shape due folivorous diet advanced vocal system brain growth posterior rather superior inferior howler monkeys generally move quadrupedally tops branches usually grasping branch least two hands one hand tail times strong prehensile tails able support entire body weight fully grown adult howler monkeys often rely tails fullbody support juveniles frequently significant amount travel done ground sitting resting frequent howler species live groups six animals one three adult males multiple females mantled howler monkeys exception commonly living groups individuals three adult males number males given group inversely correlated size hyoids positively correlated testes size results two distinct groups wherein one male larger hyoid smaller testes copulates exclusively group females suggesting precopulatory vocal competition group males smaller hyoids larger testes larger number males smaller hyoid larger female howler monkeys breed multiple males within group males neighboring groups solitary males central males tie fellowship cycling unlike new world monkeys one sex remains natal groups juveniles sexes emigrate natal howler monkeys could spend majority adult lives association unrelated monkeys physical fighting among group members infrequent generally short duration serious injuries result males females rarely fight physical aggression even rare group size varies species location approximate ratio one male four name suggests vocal communication forms important part social behavior enlarged basihyal hyoid bone helps make loud vocalizations group males generally call dawn dusk well interspersed times throughout day main vocals consist loud deep guttural growls howls howler monkeys widely considered loudest land animals according guinness book world records vocalizations heard clearly mi function howling thought relate intergroup spacing territory protection well possibly mateguarding howlers call usually areas major feeding sites sort lead advertise major feeding sites willingness defend locally available fruit trees black howler monkeys incorporate information resource availability along neighbors current location abundance flowers found important factor influenced behavior neighbors likely move towards calls resource scarce reverse large slowmoving monkeys folivores new world monkeys howlers eat mainly top canopy leaves together fruit buds flowers nuts need careful eat many leaves certain species one sitting contain toxins poison howler monkeys also known occasionally raid birds nests chicken coops consume smaller groups twelve individuals low rainfall mm frugivorous larger groups increased rainfall frugivory decreases result competition fast food digest fruit fruits seeds excreted without damage results seed dispersal distribution tropical howlers use uppermiddle part sleeping tree use large branches nights potentially allow grouped sleeping resistance weather
