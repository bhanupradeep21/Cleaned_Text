biotic ethics also called lifecentered ethics branch ethics values species biospheres life basis biotic ethics defines human purpose secure propagate lifecitation needed principles related bioethics environmental ethics seek conserve existing species however biotic ethics value generally organic geneprotein life structures processes shared biota processes result selfpropagation effective purpose humans share life belonging life implies human purpose safeguard propagate purpose defines basic moral values acts sustain life good acts destroy life evil panbiotic ethics extends principles space

biotic ethics may approve help continue geneprotein reproduction however biotic ethics permit replacing biological life robots even hardy intelligent humans biotic ethics eliminating organic life

ethics value geneprotein life biological form including future lifeforms general view biotic ethics commends require human survival long life continues however technological humans secure life beyond duration sun possibly trillions therefore biotic ethics require human posthuman survival secure life also humans wish continue sentient life enjoy conscious existence motivation propagate life biotic
