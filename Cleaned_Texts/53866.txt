relational frame theory rft psychological theory human language cognition behaviour developed originally steven c hayes university nevada extended research notably dermot barnesholmes colleagues ghent relational frame theory argues building block human language higher cognition relating ie human ability create bidirectional links things contrasted associative learning discusses animals form links stimuli form strength associations memory however relational frame theory argues natural human language typically specifies strength link stimuli also type relation well dimension along related example tennis ball could associated orange virtue shape different edible perhaps different color preceding sentence different cues environment specify type relation stimuli shape colour edible specify dimension along relation made relational frame theory argues arbitrary number types relations number dimensions along stimuli related core unit relating essential building block much commonly referred human language higher cognition several hundred studies explored many testable aspects implications emergence specific frames individual frames combined create verbally complex phenomena metaphors rigidity automaticity relating within certain domains related attempting describe fundamental building block human language higher cognition rft explicitly states goal provide general theory psychology provide bedrock multiple domains levels analysis relational frame theory focuses humans learn language ie communication interactions environment based philosophical approach referred functional relational frame theory rft behavioral theory human language rooted functional contextualism focused predicting influencing verbal behavior precision scope relational framing relational responding based arbitrarily applicable relations arbitrary stimulus functions relational responding subject mutual entailment combinatorial mutual entailment transformation stimulus functions relations stimulus functions controlled contextual human language word sentence symbol eg stimulus different meaning eg functions depending context terms rft said human language stimulus different stimulus functions depending contextual take two sentences example sentences stimulus cake two different functions stimulus cake figurative function presence contextual cues task piece whereas presence contextual cues would like delicious youve made stimulus cake literal function functions stimuli called stimulus functions cfunc stimulus function refer physical properties stimulus quantity colour shape etc called nonarbitrary stimulus stimulus function refers nonphysical properties stimulus value called arbitrary stimulus example one dollar bill value one dollar bill arbitrary stimulus function colour green nonarbitrary stimulus function one dollar bill arbitrarily applicable relational responding form relational relational responding response one stimulus relation available example lion picks largest piece meat deer picks strongest male pack contrast animal would always pick drinking spot relational responding related stimuli sense bestworstlargersmaller etc examples relational responding based physical properties stimuli relational responding based physical properties stimuli shape size quantity etc called nonarbitrarily relational responding arbitrarily applicable relational responding refers responding based relations arbitrarily applied stimuli say relations applied stimuli supported physical properties said stimuli example based social convention social example sound cow refers animal english language another language animal referred totally different sound example dutch called koe pronounced coo word cow koe nothing physical properties animal social convention animal named way terms rft said relation word cow actual animal arbitrarily applied even change arbitrarily applied relations look history language meanings words symbols complete sentence change time place arbitrarily applicable relational responding responding based arbitrarily applied mutual entailment refers deriving relation two stimuli based given relation two stimuli given relation b relation b example joyce standing front peter relation trained stimulus front stimulus b one derive peter behind joyce derived relation stimulus b behind stimulus another example jared older jacob one could derive jacob younger jared relation trained stimulus older stimulus b relation derived stimulus b younger stimulus combinatorial mutual entailment refers deriving relations two stimuli given relations two stimuli third stimulus given relation b b c relations c c go examples joyce standing front peter peter standing front lucy relations trained example stimulus front b stimulus b front c derived joyce standing front lucy lucy standing behind joyce derived relations front c c behind john older jared jared older jacob stimulus older stimulus b stimulus b older stimulus c derived jacob younger jared jared younger john derived relation becomes stimulus older stimulus c stimulus c younger stimulus notice relations c never given derived relations stimulus different functions depending contextual cues however stimulus function change based arbitrary relations example relational frame b b c stimulus functions letters rather neutral soon c would labeled valuable nice would become attractive c based relations stated anything c valuable rather neutral stimulus function giving c attractive stimulus function become attractive attractive stimulus function transferred c relations b c transformation stimulus function neutral attractive done aversive stimulus function danger instead valuable saying c dangerous becomes dangerous c based relations rft

behavioristic interpretations complex human behavior empirical advances also made rft researchers analysis understanding topics metaphor perspective taking proponents rft often indicate failure establish vigorous experimental program language cognition key reason behavior analysis fell mainstream psychology despite many contributions argue rft might provide way forward theory still somewhat controversial within behavioral psychology however current time controversy primarily empirical since rft publish regularly mainstream behavioral journals empirical studies yet claimed contradict rft findings rather controversy seems revolve around whether rft positive step forward especially given implications seem go beyond many existing interpretations extensions within intellectual rft argued
