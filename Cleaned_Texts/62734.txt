herpes simplex often known simply herpes viral infection caused herpes simplex herpes infections categorized area body infected two major types herpes oral herpes genital herpes though forms also exist oral herpes involves face mouth may result small blisters groups often called cold sores fever blisters may cause sore genital herpes involves genitalia may minimal symptoms form blisters break open result small typically heal two four tingling shooting pains may occur blisters herpes cycles periods active disease followed periods without first episode often severe may associated fever muscle pains swollen lymph nodes time episodes active disease decrease frequency herpetic whitlow typically involves fingers herpes simplex keratitis involves herpesviral encephalitis involves neonatal herpes involves part body newborn among two types herpes simplex virus type type commonly causes infections around mouth commonly causes genital transmitted direct contact body fluids lesions infected transmission may still occur symptoms genital herpes classified sexually transmitted may spread infant infection viruses transported along sensory nerves nerve cell bodies reside causes

difficult diagnose oral herpes since people none classical confusing diagnosis several conditions resemble genital herpes including fungal infection lichen planus atopic dermatitis laboratory testing

risk infected male female believed due increased exposure mucosal tissue potential infection sites transmission risk infected female male around suppressive antiviral therapy reduces risks antivirals also help prevent development symptomatic hsv infection scenarios meaning infected partner seropositive symptomfree condom use also reduces transmission risk condom use much effective preventing maletofemale transmission vice previous infection may reduce risk acquisition infection among women factor three although one study states small sample size transmissions however asymptomatic carriers virus still contagious many infections first symptom people infections horizontal transmission sexual partner vertical transmission neonatal herpes newborn term since asymptomatic individuals unaware infection considered high risk spreading october antihiv drug tenofovir used topically microbicidal vaginal gel reported reduce herpes virus sexual transmission condoms offer moderate protection men women consistent condom users risk acquisition compared never use female condom provide greater protection male condom covers virus pass synthetic condom male condoms effectiveness herpes ulcers may
