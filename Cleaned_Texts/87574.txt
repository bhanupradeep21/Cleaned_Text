lung cancer screening refers cancer screening strategies used identify early lung cancers cause symptoms point likely curable lung cancer screening critically important incidence prevalence lung cancer new cases lung cancer expected united states approximately deaths expected addition time diagnosis lung cancers discovered advanced stages iii iv meaning widespread aggressive substantially higher probability longterm survival following treatment localized versus advanced stage lung cancer lung cancer screening aims diagnose disease localized stage results large randomized studies recently prompted large number professional organizations governmental agencies us recommend lung cancer screening select populations main types lung cancer screening lowdose computerized tomographic
