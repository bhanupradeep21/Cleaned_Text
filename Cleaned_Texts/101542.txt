acanthamoeba keratitis ak rare disease amoebae genus acanthamoeba invade clear portion front cornea eye affects roughly people united states acanthamoeba protozoa found nearly ubiquitously soil water cause infections skin eyes central nervous infection cornea acanthamoeba difficult treat conventional medications ak may cause permanent visual impairment blindness due damage cornea damage structures important recently ak recognized orphan disease funded project orphan diseases acanthamoeba keratitis odak tested effects diverse range drugs biocides united states acanthamoeba keratitis nearly always associated soft contact lens acanthamoeba spp commonly introduced eye contact lenses exposed organism use contaminated lens solution using homemade salinebased solution tap water wearing contact lenses bathing however may also introduced eye exposure soil vegetation fact first case acanthamoeba keratitis described due ocular contact lens acanthamoeba able survive space contact lens surface soft contact lenses adherent corneal surface hard lenses allows acanthamoeba organism bind mannosylated glycoproteins corneal expression proteins corneal surface increased contact lens increase glycoprotein content along microtrauma corneal epithelial surface due contact lens use increases risk organism gained access surface eye able invade epithelium bowmans layer cases infection group around corneal nerves producing radial deposits radial keratoneuritis causing extreme pain features also seen viral bacterial keratitis may organism also capable invading deeper cornea using metalloproteases able penetrate deep stroma disease progresses may penetrate cornea rarely causes infection inside eye endophthalmitis due robust neutrophil response anterior vast majority cases acanthamoeba keratitis occur contact lens wearers many cases acanthamoeba described wear contact lenses especially outside united noncontact lens users greatest risks developing acanthamoeba infection trauma exposure contaminated predisposing factors include contaminated home water supply low socioeconomic status infection also commonly seen tropical subtropical beyond route inoculation eye external risk factors host factors also likely play significant role development acanthamoeba keratitis fact studies contact lens users united kingdom japan new zealand found per asymptomatic contact lens users lens storage cases contaminated acanthamoeba however rate acanthamoeba keratitis among patients per contact lens although exact host factors fully described likely corneal epithelial defects tear film composition eye surface ph level antiacanthamoeba iga antibodies tear film play role development acanthamoeba species within genus acanthamoeba generally freeliving trophozoites trophozoites relatively ubiquitous live restricted tap water freshwater lakes rivers addition trophozoite stage organism also form doublewalled cyst may also present environment difficult eradicate medical treatment stages usually nonnucleated reproduce means binary due relative rarity acanthamoeba keratitis ak compared causes keratitis bacterial viral etc often misdiagnosed especially early stages ak considered patients use contact lenses following corneal abrasions trauma thorough history obtained especially relating contact lens use recent changes contact lens solution exposure eyes water foreign objects symptoms patient experiencing symptoms classically attributed ak include decreased blurred vision sensitivity light photophobia redness eye conjunctival hyperemia pain proportion physical exam another clinical feature distinguish acanthamoeba bacterial causes keratitis lack discharge physical exam findings depend stage disease early manifestations cornea seen punctate keratopathy pseudodendrites epithelial subepithelial corneal features lead examiner confuse ak viral keratitis caused varicella zoster virus herpes simplex disease progresses infiltrates corneal stroma classic ring infiltrate may present examination although seen corneal ulceration severe cases perforation also occur may accompanied cases keratitis diagnosis typically achieved evaluation corneal scrapings scrapings taking cornea plated agar culture also stained using gram stain giemsa stain differentiate bacterial keratitis ak culture acanthamoeba scrapings placed nonnutrient agar saline plate seeded gramnegative bacteria e coli acanthamoeba present reproduce readily become visible plate times objective inverted microscope polymerase chain reaction pcr used confirm diagnosis acanthamoeba keratitis especially contact lenses confocal microscopy noninvasive technique allows visualization acanthamoeba vivo cases corneal scraping culture cytology yield acanthamoeba keratitis diagnosed initiation timely appropriate treatment significant impact visual outcomes medical therapy aims eradicate trophozoite cystic forms acanthamoeba also control inflammatory responsecitation needed multiple classes drugs found effective killing trophozoite form acanthamoeba including antibacterial antifungal antiprotozoal antineoplastic agents however single therapy found eliminate trophozoite cystic forms eradicate corneal one class medications used treatment biguanides include polyhexamethylene biguanide phmb drops chlorhexidine medications disrupt cell wall trophozoite organism leading death however agents shown limited efficacy cystic due efficacy drugs acanthamoeba well low toxicity cornea commonly used first line medications treatment biguanides also found act synergistically used combination diamidines propamidine isethionate hexamidine commonly limitation diamidine use relative corneal toxicity long term combined regimen propamidine miconazole nitrate neomycin also due potential negative longterm visual outcomes ak therapy usually started combination biguanide diamidine early use high dose dual therapy helps eliminate trophozoite cyst forms organism also preventing deep penetration cysts corneal stroma cysts eradicated cornea cause treatment often initiated instilling drops onto surface eye every hour hours day least first hours appropriate response therapy may reduced hourly administrations day continued several weeks beyond antiamoebic therapies also role topical steroids antiinflammatory medications treatment acanthamoeba keratitis infection severe inflammation cornea anterior chamber cause severe symptoms including pain visual topical steroids may used reduce inflammation thereby alleviate however role steroids typically limited dampening immune response may lead worsening additionally steroids increase number trophozoites cornea inducing therefore typically recommended steroids used briefly aid symptom resolution antiamoebic agents used several weeks topical steroid surgical debridement infected cornea also used reduce organism load excise devitalized tissue cornea may also improve efficacy medical therapy promoting penetration medication deeper layers cases corneal ulceration perforation corneal scarring severe corneal transplant may typically involves full thickness transplantation cornea healthy donor eye size graft kept small possible larger grafts carry great risk host rejection due possibility graft revision surgery surgery capable restoring vision replacing damaged cornea also carries risks recurrent acanthamoeba infection graft failure reason antiamoebic medications started prior surgery continued several weeks afterward suspicion evidence recurrent infection cultures sent cultures positive antiamoebic therapy continued outcomes following surgery typically much better patients receive surgery vision improvement following infection resolution therefore efforts made maximize medical management attempting study austria reported total cases acanthamoeba keratitis period age ak ranged years old people female data showed infected patients contact lens wearers almost
