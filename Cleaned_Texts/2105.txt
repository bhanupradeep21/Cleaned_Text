treatments influenza include range medications therapies used response disease influenza treatments may either directly target influenza virus instead may offer relief symptoms disease bodys immune system works recover main classes antiviral drugs used influenza neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir oseltamivir polymerase acidic endonuclease inhibitors baloxavir marboxil inhibitors viral protein amantadine rimantadine drugs reduce severity symptoms taken soon infection also taken decrease risk infection however virus strains emerged show drug resistance classes drug united states authority
