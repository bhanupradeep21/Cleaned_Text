strongyloidiasis human parasitic disease caused nematode called strongyloides stercoralis sometimes closely related fülleborni helminths belong group nematodes called roundworms intestinal worms cause number symptoms people principally skin symptoms abdominal pain diarrhea weight loss also many specific vague symptoms disseminated disease severe lifethreatening conditions hyperinfection people particularly require corticosteroids immunosuppressive medication strongyloides cause hyperinfection syndrome lead death untreated diagnosis made blood stool tests medication ivermectin widely used

extrapolate infection upwards million belongs group neglected tropical diseases worldwide efforts aimed eradicating strongyloides infection occurs five forms infection continues larvae matures may respiratory symptoms löfflers syndrome infection may become chronic mainly digestive symptoms reinfection larvae migrate body skin lungs finally small intestine may respiratory skin digestive symptoms finally hyperinfection syndrome causes symptoms many organ systems including central nervous frequently asymptomatic gastrointestinal system symptoms include abdominal pain diarrhea andor conversely constipation pulmonary symptoms including löfflers syndrome occur pulmonary migration filariform larvae pulmonary infiltrate may present radiological investigation dermatologic manifestations include urticarial rashes buttocks waist areas well larva eosinophilia generally present strongyloidiasis become chronic become completely asymptomaticcitation needed disseminated strongyloidiasis occurs patients chronic strongyloidiasis become immunosuppressed distinction made dissemination hyperinfection mainly semantic distinction mild dissemination worm burden relatively lower yet causes insidious symptoms extreme dissemination term hyperinfection used describe thus hyperinfection varying levels severe dissemination may present abdominal pain distension shock pulmonary neurologic complications sepsis haemorrhage malabsorption depending combination degree number severity symptoms potentially fatal worms enter bloodstream bowel wall simultaneously allowing entry bowel bacteria escherichia coli may cause symptoms sepsis bloodstream bacteria may spread organs may cause localized infection dissemination without hyperinfection may present lesser degree many symptomscitation needed dissemination occur many decades initial associated high dose corticosteroids organ transplant instances causes immunosuppression lepromatous leprosy tertiary syphilis aplastic anemia malnutrition advanced tuberculosis radiation often recommended patients started immunosuppression screened chronic strongyloidiasis however often impractical screen tests often unavailable developed countries prevalence chronic strongyloidiasis small screening usually costeffective except endemic areas reality global travel need modern advanced healthcare even socalled developed world necessitates

diagnoses addition many palpable gastrointestinal varied symptoms drastic cachexia amidst lassitude often present although severe disseminated infections occur individuals without weight loss regardless body mass indexcitation needed diagnosis rests microscopic identification larvae rhabditiform occasionally filariform stool duodenal fluid examination many samples may necessary always sufficient direct stool examination relatively insensitive single sample able detect larvae take weeks initial infection passage larvae stoolcitation needed stool examined wet mountscitation needed culture techniques sensitive routinely available west uk culture available either schools tropical medicine liverpool london direct examination must done stool freshly collected allowed cool hookworm eggs hatch cooling larvae difficult distinguish strongyloidescitation needed finding strongyloides stool negative tests important undergo frequent stool sampling well duodenal biopsy bad infection suspected duodenal fluid examined using techniques enterotest string duodenal larvae may detected sputum patients disseminated strongyloidiasiscitation needed given poor ability stool examination diagnose strongyloides detecting antibodies elisa serology crossreact parasites remain positive years successful treatment falsely negative immunocompromised infected patients also often elevated eosinophil count average absolute eosinophil count one eosinophilia gastrointestinal infection may fluctuate response larval output may permanently lacking disseminated infections hence lack

sensitivity means diagnosis would also solve challenging problem proof cure definitive diagnosis solved stands reason proof cure becomes easily consensus drug choice treatment uncomplicated strongyloidiasis ivermectin however even considered main drug choice recent studies illustrated challenges ivermectin curing ivermectin kill strongyloides larvae adult worms therefore repeat dosing may necessary properly eradicate infection autoinfective cycle roughly two weeks ivermectin readministered however additional dosing may still necessary kill strongyloides blood larvae deep within bowels drugs effective albendazole thiabendazole mgkg twice daily mg maximum patients risk disseminated strongyloidiasis treated optimal duration treatment patients disseminated infections treatment strongyloidiasis difficult ceasing treatment entirely cleared strongyloides via autoinfective cycle known live individuals even initial inadequate sustained treatment continued treatment blood stool monitoring thus may necessary even symptoms temporarily resolve cited earlier due fact infections insidiously asymptomatic relatively expensive bloodwork often inconclusive via falsepositives stool samples unreliable yet unfortunately real gold standard proof cure mirroring lack efficient reliable methodology objective eradication standard strongyloidiasis elusive given high degree suspicion
