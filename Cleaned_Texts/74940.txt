remarkably aminoacid several distinguished scientists unsure whether long linear macromolecules could stable doubts polypeptide nature proteins arose enzymes observed cleave proteins peptides whereas enzymes cleave peptides folded attempts synthesize proteins test tube unsuccessful mainly due chirality amino acids naturally occurring proteins composed lefthanded amino acids hence alternative chemical models proteins considered diketopiperazine hypothesis emil however alternative model yet explained proteins yield amino acids peptides upon hydrolysis proteolysis clarified proteolysis data

crystallography begun discipline advanced relatively rapidly simple salt crystals crystals complex molecules however even smallest proteins atoms makes determining structure far dorothy crowfoot hodgkin taken crystallographic data structure small protein insulin although structure proteins solved late however pioneering xray fiber diffraction data collected early many natural fibrous proteins wool hair william astbury suggested globular proteins general might folded elements essentially like elements fibrous since protein structure poorly understood physical interactions responsible

covalent crosslinking peptide bonds cyclol reaction cyclol crosslink draws two peptide groups close together n c atoms separated å whereas separated å typical hydrogen bond idea intrigued j bernal suggested mathematician dorothy wrinch possibly useful understanding protein structurecitation needed wrinch developed suggestion fullfledged model protein structure basic cyclol model laid first paper noted possibility polypeptides might cyclize form closed rings true rings might form internal crosslinks cyclol reaction also true although rare assuming cyclol form peptide bond could stable amide form wrinch concluded certain cyclic peptides would naturally make maximal number cyclol bonds cyclol figure cyclol molecules would hexagonal symmetry chemical bonds taken length roughly å comparison nc cc bonds lengths å å rings extended indefinitely form cyclol fabric figure fabrics exhibit longrange quasicrystalline order wrinch felt likely proteins since must pack hundreds residues densely another interesting feature molecules fabrics aminoacid side chains point axially upwards one face opposite face side chains thus one face completely independent primary sequence peptide wrinch conjectured might account sequenceindependent properties initial article wrinch stated clearly cyclol model merely working hypothesis potentially valid model proteins would goals article successors propose welldefined testable model work consequences assumptions make predictions could tested goals succeeded however within years experiments modeling showed cyclol hypothesis untenable model globular two tandem letters editor wrinch frank addressed question whether cyclol form peptide group indeed stable amide form relatively simple calculation showed cyclol form significantly less stable amide form therefore cyclol model would abandoned unless compensating source energy could identified initially frank proposed cyclol form might stabilized better interactions surrounding

cyclols wrinch noted many physiologically active substances steroids composed fused hexagonal rings carbon atoms thus might sterically complementary face cyclol molecules without aminoacid side chains wrinch proposed steric complementarity one chief factors determining whether small molecule would bind proteincitation needed wrinch speculated proteins responsible synthesis biological molecules noting cells digest proteins extreme starvation conditions wrinch speculated life could exist without proteinscitation needed beginning cyclol reaction considered covalent analog hydrogen bond therefore natural consider hybrid models types bonds subject wrinchs fourth paper cyclol model written together dorothy jordan lloyd first proposed globular proteins stabilized hydrogen followup paper written referenced researchers hydrogen bonding proteins maurice loyal huggins linus wrinch also wrote paper william astbury noting possibility ketoenol isomerization cαhα amide carbonyl group co producing crosslink cαcohα converting oxygen hydroxyl reactions could yield fivemembered rings whereas classic cyclol hypothesis produces sixmembered rings ketoenol crosslink hypothesis developed much fifth paper cyclols wrinch identified conditions two planar cyclol fabrics could joined make angle planes respecting chemical bond angles identified mathematical simplification nonplanar sixmembered rings atoms represented planar median hexagons made midpoints chemical bonds median hexagon representation made easy see cyclol fabric planes joined correctly dihedral angle planes equals tetrahedral bond angle δ needed large variety closed polyhedra meeting criterion constructed simplest truncated tetrahedron truncated octahedron octahedron platonic solids semiregular polyhedra considering first

ultracentrifugation results theodor svedberg suggested molecular weights proteins fell classes related cyclol model consistent general properties attributed folded centrifugation studies shown folded proteins significantly denser water gml thus tightly packed wrinch assumed dense packing imply regular packing despite large size proteins crystallize readily symmetric crystals consistent idea symmetric faces match upon association proteins bind metal ions since metalbinding sites must specific bond geometries eg octahedral plausible assume entire protein also similarly crystalline geometry
