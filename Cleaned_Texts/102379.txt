aggressive lymphoma also known highgrade lymphoma group fast growing nonhodgkin common symptoms aggressive lymphoma weight loss night sweats nausea recurrent feversmedical citation needed since tumors fast grow spread immediate intervention required diagnosiscitation needed several subtypes aggressive lymphoma include aidsassociated lymphoma angioimmunoblastic lymphoma burkitt lymphoma central nervous system cns lymphoma diffuse large bcell lymphoma dlbcl mantle cell lymphoma mcl peripheral tcell diffuse large bcell lymphoma common subtype well common type nonhodgkin aggressive lymphoma accounts approximately percent nonhodgkin cases united common types high grade nonhodgkin lymphoma diffuse large bcell lymphoma dlbcl type highgrade nhl common type nhl worldwide affecting percent nhl prevalent elderly patients median age years patients often present rapidly growing tumor mass single multiple nodal extranodal sites commonly diagnosed versions dlbcl germinal center bcell like gcb activated bcell like abc immunohistochemical flow cytometry analysis also necessary diagnosis disease dlbcl cells found express bcell antigens well transcription factors especially relevant diagnostics well therapeutics target rituximab humanized monoclonal antibody used common treatment addition majority cells also express surface cytoplasmic immunoglobulins specifically igm igg iga analyses allow diagnosis displaying proof bcell lineage also used treatment strategy give insight prognosis specific case consideredcitation needed burkitt lymphoma named british surgeon denis burkitt burkitt identified disease children africa burkitt lymphoma common children also infected malaria viruscitation needed outside africa burkitt lymphoma less common us people diagnosed year disease disproportionately affects younger age burkitt lymphoma especially likely develop people infected hiv virus causes aids highly active antiretroviral therapy haart became widespread treatment hivaids incidence burkitt lymphoma estimated times higher hivpositive people general peripheral tcell lymphomas less common accounting approximately nonhodgkin lymphoma represents diverse group diseases lacks clear definition diseases may involve extranodal sites liver bone marrow intestinal tract due difficulties classification diagnosis treatment often regarded orphan diseasescitation needed risk factors increase risk factor aggressive lymphoma symptoms aggressive lymphoma similar lowgrade lymphomas patients may come painless swollen lymph nodes neck armpits groin also describe symptoms abdominal pain chest pain persistent fatigue fever night sweats unexplained weight loss depending stage tumor since presentation aggressive lymphoma similar types nonhodgkin lymphoma important analyze tumors morphologically run immunohistochemical tests ensure correct diagnosis aggressive lymphoma swift specific treatment dependent upon correct diagnosis difference life death patientcitation needed limited high grade lymphoma typical treatment chemotherapy targeted drug followed radiotherapy advanced high grade aggressive lymphoma patients receive similar treatments duration extendedcitation needed advanced diffuse large bcell lymphoma standard therapy patients dlbcl combination use rituximab cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine prednisone commonly used regimen results percent patients dlbcl cured disease also group patients relapse respond well rchop patients current treatment strategies insufficient treating cancer addition alternative treatments continue research due highly toxic nature contrast mature bcell neoplasms therapeutic advances peripheral tcell lymphoma generally lagged behind particularly regard introduction immune therapies impacted significantly favorably prognosis aggressive b cell lymphomas diffuse large bcell lymphoma remains heterogeneous entity generally unfavorable way definitively predicting outcome individuals diagnosis aggressive lymphoma ways best guessing prognosis patient prognostic factors divided three categories first category depends patient age overall health second category dependent upon tumor includes stage tumor burden extranodal involvement finally last category dependent aggressiveness indicators factors ldh serum level proliferative fraction give insight tumor microenvironment proliferation potential may impact two promising immunotherapy approaches diffuse large bcell lymphoma chimeric antigen receptor car cell therapy therapeutic blocking programmed cell death protein pathway car tcells shown promising efficacy patients dlbcl unexpected toxicity related issues come one proposal improve research treatment aggressive lymphoma use canines model animals canine lymphoma prevalence increasing years similar incidence human lymphoma cases lymphoma represents frequent hematopoietic cancer dogs canine nonhodgkin lymphoma cnhl highest incidence hematopoietic addition diffuse large bcell lymphoma commonly seen subtype nhl advantages using canines model animals include spontaneous disease occurring without isogenic background genetic engineering chronology disease adapted lifespan shared environmental societal status allows dogs treated patients time able ethically explore translational innovations possible human subjects organization dogs breeds relatively homogeneous genetic
