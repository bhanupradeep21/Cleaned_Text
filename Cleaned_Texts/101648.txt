diffuse optical sources must following characteristics emission wavelength optical window ie nanometre nm narrow full width half maximum fwhm ideally delta function high repetition rate mhz finally sufficient laser power mw achieve good signal noise ratio past bulky tunable tisapphire used provided wide wavelength range nm narrow fwhm ps high average power high repetition mhz frequency however bulky expensive take long time wavelength swapping recent years pulsed fiber lasers based super continuum generation provide wide spectral range ps typical average power w fwhm repetition frequency tens mhz however generally quite expensive lack stability super continuum generation hence limited use wide spread sources pulsed diode fwhm around ps repetition frequency mhz average power milliwatts even though lack tunability low cost compactness allows multiple modules used single system single photon detector used timedomain diffuse optics require high photon detection efficiency wavelength range optical window also large active area well large numerical aperture na maximize overall light collection efficiency also require narrow timing response low noise background traditionally fiber coupled photomultiplier tubes pmt detector choice diffuse optical measurements thanks mainly due large active area low dark count excellent timing resolution however intrinsically bulky prone electromagnetic disturbances quite limited spectral sensitivity moreover require high biasing voltage quite expensive single photon avalanche diodes emerged alternative pmts low cost compact placed contact needing much lower biasing voltage also offer wider spectral sensitivity robust bursts light however much lower active area hence lower photon collection efficiency larger dark count silicon photomultipliers sipm arrays spads global anode global cathode hence larger active area maintaining advantages offered spads however suffer larger dark count broader timing timing electronics needed
