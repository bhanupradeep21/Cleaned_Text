abruptly rapidly stopping benzodiazepines dangerous withdrawing gradual reduction dosage recommended professional benzodiazepines highly effective short term adverse effects associated longterm use including impaired cognitive abilities memory problems mood swings overdoses combined drugs may make riskbenefit ratio unfavourable addition benzodiazepines reinforcing properties individuals thus

affected benzodiazepine dependence possible adverse effects sleep include induction worsening sleep disordered breathing like alcohol benzodiazepines commonly used treat insomnia short term prescribed
