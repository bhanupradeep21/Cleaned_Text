individualized cancer immunotherapy also referred individualized immunooncology novel concept therapeutic cancer vaccines truly personalized single individual human immune system generally able recognize fight cancer cells however ability usually insufficient cancer continues cancer immunotherapy based harnessing potentiating ability immune system fight cancer tumor individual genetic
