surface remnant areas volcanic material caused much destruction led preservation fossils within florissant formations shales mudstones ash deposited landscape carried water streams lahars lake lahars covered base redwoods living time trunks trees became harder fossilized permineralization precipitates ground water flowed tree trunks replacing original matter siliceous minerals replacing organic matter silica process mineralization led preservation stumps within lake volcanic deposits periodically deposited lake either direct deposition though weathering volcanic material rich silica living lake time diatoms whose shells also composed silica influx silica caused diatoms bloom lake population diatoms massively increased stress volcanic episodes time caused large dieoffs local biota plants animals died leaves bodies fell lake eventually large amounts organic matter accumulated bottom lake process repeated often possibly yearly runoff rain collected lake causing cyclical diatom blooms dieoffs diatom blooms dieoffs created layers ashclay deposits called couplets resulting many thin layers microlayer ash clay compacted overlaying sediments create paper shales usually mm thick within

redwoods grew time sediment deposition would even favorable current climate redwoods california grow average ring width one year growth larger width redwoods central towards end eocene global temperature began decrease however episode global cooling indicated fossil record fossilized algae aquatic angiosperms indicate lake freshwater shallow near streams shore moisture plentiful allowing lush vegetation grow however hillsides dryadapted vegetation base valley trees sequoias dominated landscape understory forest would composed smaller trees shrubs would gradual transition different habitats base valley hillsides overlap insects area indicate different habitats well exclusively aquatic insects dragonflies would lived entire lives near lake meanwhile bees butterflies would preferred open spaces surrounding hillsides early estimates elevation florissant beds determined meters much lower modern elevation meters however recent estimates based paleoflora put elevation eocene much higher ranges meters proposed would indicate global climate change rather tectonic uplift would main cause changing environments actual elevation florissant area eocene still determined
