molecular biology short linear motifs slims linear motifs minimotifs short stretches protein sequence mediate first definition given tim sequences many proteins contain short conserved motifs involved recognition targeting activities often separate functional properties molecule occur motifs linear sense threedimensional organization required bring distant segments molecule together make recognizable unit conservation motifs varies highly conserved others example allow substitutions retain certain pattern charge across motif slims generally situated intrinsically disordered regions known slims however upon interaction structured partner secondary structure often induced majority annotated slims consist contiguous amino acids average residues however hotspot residues average hotspot residues motif contribute majority free energy binding determine affinity specificity interaction although motifs positional preference several required localized protein termini order key
