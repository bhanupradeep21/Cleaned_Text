sensory nerve afferent nerve anatomic term nerve contains exclusively afferent nerve nerves containing also motor fibers called mixed afferent nerve fibers sensory nerve carry sensory information toward central nervous system cns different sensory receptors sensory neurons peripheral nervous system motor nerve carries information cns pns afferent nerve fibers link sensory neurons throughout body pathways relevant processing circuits central nervous afferent nerve fibers often paired efferent nerve fibers motor neurons travel cns pns mixed nerves stimuli cause nerve impulses receptors alter potentials known sensory afferent nerve fibers leave sensory neuron dorsal root ganglia spinal cord motor commands carried efferent fibers leave cord ventral roots dorsal ventral fibers join spinal nerves mixed nerves damage sensory nerve causes wide range symptoms number functions performed nerve traumatic injuries damages sensory nerves may lead peripheral neuropathy problems reduced position sense causing poorer coordination balance addition reduced sensitivity temperature change pain leading problems ability feel pain changes temperature affected damage fibers sensory nerve cause failure notice injuries cut wound becoming infected may also lack detection heart attacks serious conditions lack detection pain sensations particularly large problem diabetes contributes rate lower limb amputations among population overall poor sensation detection may lead changes skin hair joint bone damage years many people httpsenwikipediaorgwikisensorynerve
