procedure easily established considering keyandlock relation various aminoacids rhombshaped holes formed various nucleotides deoxyribonucleic acid chain one speculate free aminoacids surrounding

discussing rna could produced dna since contain fundamentally similar nucleotide compositions wrote suspect answer staring us solve riddle protein synthesis gamow synthesiser created informal team scientists called rna tide club prediction denote amino acids club could members designated officers crick pessimist rich lord privy seal watson optimist among meant partly coming across gamows paper crick immediately noticed issues scheme first watson never counted amino acids possible nucleotide although gamow subsequently proven correct model first prediction genetic issue rna protein synthesis appeared exclusively take place cytoplasm nucleus indicating dna protein pathway requires direct chemical binding kind mediator must crick began think solution problem line watsons idea role rna overlooked rejected gamows assumption molecules like amino acids different chemically nucleic acid would structurally impossible bind dna instead visualised certain kind unknown molecule linked nucleic acids carry amino acids ribosomes form peptide discussed colleague sydney brenner features molecule brenner impressed idea named concept adaptor adaptor hypothetical molecule apparently help indirect interaction dna rna amino acids protein crick explained dont think anybody looking dna rna would think templates amino acids indirect evidence one possible scheme amino acid would combine chemically special enzyme small molecule specific hydrogenbonding surface would combine specifically nucleic acid template combination would also supply energy necessary polymerisation simplest form would different kinds adaptor molecule one amino acid different enzymes join amino acid adaptors sydney brenner discussed idea calls adaptor hypothesis since amino acid fitted adaptor go template adaptor hypothesis implies actual set twenty amino acids found proteins due either historical accident biological selection extremely primitive crick admitted way knowing kind chemical substance adaptor prudently suggested composed nucleotides sort rna common features dna even speculated insulin example probably rnamade proteins perhaps special class dnamade proteins exists almost always small quantities thus normally template could consist perhaps single chain adaptor molecule containing say di trinucleotide would joined amino acid special enzyme molecules would diffuse microsomal particles attach proper place basis rna basepairing article circulated members rna tie club january degenerate templates adaptor hypothesis note rna tie club described one important unpublished

biology symposium biological replication macromolecules held university college london lecture expanded published protein synthesis science historian horace freeland judson remarked paper permanently altered logic first comprehensive insight genetic information later called central dogma molecular biology protein synthesis known sequence hypothesis role rna adaptor hypothesis well existence genetic adaptor hypothesis framed explain information could extracted nucleic acid used put together string amino acids specific sequence sequence determined nucleotide sequence nucleic acid dna rna template crick proposed amino acid first attached specific adaptor piece nucleic acid enzymecatalysed reaction order assembly amino acids determined specific recognition adaptor nucleic acid serving informational template way amino acids could lined template specific order coupling adjacent amino acids would lead synthesis polypeptide whose sequence determined template nucleic acid cricks thinking behind proposal based general consideration chemical properties two classes molecule nucleic acids proteins amino acids characterised variety side chains vary hydrophilic hydrophobic individual characters reside different properties side chains contrast nucleic acid composed string nucleotides whose sequence presents geometrically defined surface hydrogen bonding makes nucleic acids good recognising poor distinguishing varied side chains amino acids apparent lack possibility specific recognition amino acid side chains nucleotide sequence led crick conclude amino acids would first become attached small nucleic acid adaptor basepairing template presumably occurs dna strands double helix would carry amino acids lined template gamow entirely wrong although concept direct synthesis amino acid dna double strands proven false prediction nature amino acids coded dna sequences triplet nucleotides confirmed key components protein broad concept known genetic code crick along js griffith leslie orgel member rna tie club describing acid prediction magic number introduced proper concept order amino acids determined order nucleotides nucleic acid twenty naturally occurring amino acids commonly found proteins usually four different nucleotides problem sequence four things nucleotides determine sequence twenty things amino acids known coding crick lecturing hypothesis adaptors exist nature already discovered team mahlon hoagland paul zamecnik whose paper published following year march soluble rnas called transfer rnas mediate translation messenger rnas ribosomes
