extracellular phototropic digestion process saprobionts feed secreting enzymes cell membrane onto food enzymes catalyze digestion food ie diffusion transport osmotrophy phagocytosis since digestion occurs outside cell said extracellular takes place either lumen digestive system gastric cavity digestive organ completely outside body extracellular digestion food broken outside cell either mechanically acid special molecules called enzymes newly broken nutrients absorbed cells nearby humans use extracellular digestion eat teeth grind food enzymes acid stomach liquefy additional enzymes small intestine break food parts cells use extracellular digestion form digestion found saprobiontic annelids crustaceans arthropods lichens chordates including fungi heterotrophic organisms heterotrophic nutrition means fungi utilize extracellular sources organic energy organic material organic matter maintenance growth reproduction energy derived breakdown chemical bond carbon either
