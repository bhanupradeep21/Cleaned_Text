psychology appointed elliot valenstein collegiate professor behavioral neuroscience since elliot valenstein distinguished university professor psychology neuroscience university michigan ann robinson maintained research program focusing psychological neurobiological basis addiction especially persistent effects repeated psychostimulant drug use behavior neurobiology colleague kent c berridge also contributed highly cited theoretical articles role incentivesensitization early robinson initiated studies using amphetamineinduced rotational behavior model explore mesostriatal dopamine systems function influence sex gonadal hormones jill becker studies revealed behavioral sensitization single amphetamine injection increased subsequent behavioral responses indicating druginduced brain launched long series studies characterize behavioral neurobiological basis sensitization initially emphasizing model amphetamine psychosis studies include first reports sex differences gonadal steroid modulation sensitization enhanced amphetaminestimulated dopamine release vitro vivo sensitization cocaine single injection crosssensitization stress persistence lasting year postdrug treatment dopamine believed mediate pleasure derived reward consumption however kent berridge along robinson reported complete dopamine depletions effect rats hedonic reactions leading hypothesis dopamine mediates motivation wanting rather pleasure liking building proposed addiction may result neural sensitization causing pathological wanting drugs even particularly liked concept gave rise incentivesensitization theory influencing subsequent research role incentive motivational processes addiction paper ranked among cited articles listed single cited paper addiction research papers cited widely earned grawemeyer award psychology continuing studies behavioral neural sensitization robinson aldo badiani observed environmental factors significantly influenced induction expression sensitization animals tested novel drug context often failed express behavioral sensitization termed contextspecific sensitization simultaneously drugs context played crucial role sensitization induction leading research context modulates behavioral neurobiological consequences stimulant opiate exposure affecting dopamine neurotransmission gene additionally discovered speed drug delivery brain greatly influences sensitization induction findings led hypothesis rapidly reaching brain enhances addiction potential promoting sensitizationrelated collaborating bryan kolb robinson hypothesized longlasting behavioral effects drug exposure involve changes synaptic connectivity would reflected changes dendritic structure late published first paper structural plasticity amphetamine administration followed studies cocaine morphine also established patterns changes brain regions eg dorsal vs ventral striatum prefrontal cortical subregions areas neocortex similarity experimenter selfadministered drugs impact past experience context along features robinson focused individual differences extent reward cues including drug cues acquire motivational value incentive salience initial studies shelly flagel showed animals signtrackers attribute incentive salience reward cues makes attentiongrabbing desirable right established reward cues act incentive stimuli come attract incite provoke spur motivate leading potentially maladaptive behavior notably signtracking dopaminedependent whereas goaltracking observed animals fail attribute motivational value cues dopaminedependent furthermore martin sarter colleagues shown signtrackers deficient choline transporters leading poor executiveattentional control behavior relative goaltrackers robinson speculated combination enhanced bottomup motivational processes poor topdown inhibitory control may render signtrackers especially prone finally robinson initiated investigation impact pharmacokinetic factors emergence addictionlike behavior using intermittent access inta selfadministration procedure findings demonstrated inta cocaine selfadministration especially effective inducing addictionlike behavior
