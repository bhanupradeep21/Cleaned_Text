sulfacetamide sulfonamide antibiotic sulfacetamide topical lotion sold brand name klaron ovace approved treatment acne seborrheic combined sulfur sold brand names plexion clenia prascion avar contain sulfacetamide sulfacetamide investigated use treatment pityriasis also antiinflammatory properties used treat blepharitis conjunctivitis eyedrop solution believed work limiting presence folic acid bacteria need survive suggested sulfacetamide may also serve treatment mild forms hidradenitis suppurativacitation needed sulfacetamide antibacterial activity used control acne products containing sulfacetamide sulfur keratolytic commonly promoted treatment acne rosacea rosacea papules pustules several prescription topical products containing sulfacetamide foams shampoos cream washes research indicates sulfacetamide derivatives may act antifungals organic compounds containing benzenesulfonamide moiety amine group attached benzene molecular formula scientific name room temperature appears white sulfacetamide stable normal temperatures pressures dangerous reactions occur known conditions normal important bacteriostatic agent commonly used human veterinary medicine therefore accumulate environment mostly surface long lifetime environment different degradation reactions researched photocatalytic degradation sulfacetamide water solutions illumination uv radiation examined found sulfacetamide resistant biodegradation toxic green alga chlorella vulgaris undergoes photocatalytic degradation toxicity intermediate products significantly lower initial toxicity intermediates mineralized contrast sulfonamide organic intermediate products degradation presence higher temperatures sulfacetamide solutions degrade hydrolysed product sulphanilamide firstorder rate also oxidation sulfacetamide diperiodatocuperateiii aqueous alkaline medium occur copperiii used involved many biological electron transfer sulphanilamide oxidise blue product first order reaction form azo dye second order sulfacetamide medicine available solution eye drops lotion also found form sodium salt sulfacetamide available fixeddose combinations sulfacetamide sulfonamide sulfonamides synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics active grampositive gramnegative bacteria blocks synthesis dihydrofolic acid inhibiting enzyme dihydropteroate synthase competitive inhibitor bacterial paraaminobenzoic acid paba paba required bacterial synthesis folic acid essential component bacterial multiplication bacteria therefore inhibited action sulfacetamide sulfacetamide absorbed orally oral absorption sulfacetamide found plasma protein binding liver metabolized inactive plasma halflife sulfonamides usually metabolized several oxidative pathways acetylation conjugation sulfate glucuronic however differences biotransformation certain species acetylation reduces solubility sulfonamides example poor developed dogs acetylated hydroxylated conjugated forms little antibacterial activity furthermore hydroxylated conjugated forms less likely precipitate urine hydrolysis takes place action excreted primarily secretory routes less significance bile feces milk glomerular filtration active tubular secretion tubular reabsorption main processes involved sulfacetamide sulfonamide antibiotic used cream treat skin infections eye drops treat eye infections skin used treat acne seborrheic cream form used treat bacterial infections skin also used orally treat urinary tract kills bacteria restricting production folic acid essential bacterial mainly inhibits multiplication bacteria acts competitive inhibitor common side effects irritation stinging burning skin side effects include nausea vomiting dizziness tiredness however also severe side effects including severe allergic reactions like nettle rash itch tightness chest difficult breathing swelling either face mouth lips tongue severe side effects include bloody severe diarrhea fever joint pain red blistered swollen skin stomach eye cause conjunctivitis also lifethreatening conditions produced antibiotic like stevens johnson syndrome erythema higher exposure also cause one case showed sulfacetamide eyedrops rarely cause lifethreatening skin condition toxic epidermal necrolysis however side effects information health care provider contacted sulfacetamide used individuals sensitivity sulfur sulfa acute oral toxicity mouse falls within toxicity category iv toxicity category rating oral administration practically nontoxic also irritant taken orally however hazardous case skin contact irritant ingestion inhalation research proved toxic presence light dark sulfacetamide slightly irritant uva light present presence light sulfacetamide gets sensitized degraded might cause irritation lead toxicity used continuously dark slight irritation shown therefore stored known carcinogenic mutagenic effects moderate toxicity according chemwatch hazard first aid observe patient give liquid patient sleepy awareness reduced flush least

attention lay patient keep warm let patient rest wellventilated area make sure nothing blocks airway apply artificial respiration patient breath perform cpr necessary sulfonamides generally effective
