usher syndrome also known hallgren syndrome syndrome retinitis syndrome dystrophia retinae dysacusis rare genetic disorder caused mutation one least genes resulting combination hearing loss visual impairment major cause deafblindness present incurable usher syndrome classed three subtypes ii iii according genes responsible onset deafness three subtypes caused mutations genes involved function inner ear retina mutations inherited autosomal recessive pattern occurrence usher syndrome varies across world across different syndrome types rates high low type common ashkenazi jewish acadian populations type iii rarely found outside ashkenazi jewish populations usher syndrome named scottish ophthalmologist charles usher examined pathology transmission syndrome people usher born profoundly deaf begin lose vision first decade life also exhibit balance difficulties learn walk slowly children due problems vestibular systemcitation needed usher syndrome type caused mutations one several different genes genes function development maintenance inner ear structures hair cells stereocilia transmit sound motion signals brain alterations genes cause inability maintain balance vestibular dysfunction hearing loss genes also play role development stability retina influencing structure function rod photoreceptor cells supporting cells called retinal pigmented epithelium mutations affect normal function genes result retinitis pigmentosa resultant vision losscitation needed worldwide estimated prevalence usher syndrome type per people general population type found common people ashkenazi jewish ancestry central eastern european frenchacadian populations among acadians research haplotype data consistent one single mutation responsible cases usher syndrome type people usher ii born deaf generally hardofhearing rather deaf hearing degrade moreover seem noticeable problems also begin lose vision later second decade life may preserve vision even middle agecitation needed usher syndrome type ii may caused mutations three different genes protein encoded gene usherin located supportive tissue inner ear retina usherin critical proper development maintenance structures may help explain role hearing vision loss location function two proteins yet knowncitation needed usher syndrome type ii occurs least frequently type type ii may underdiagnosed difficult detect could three times common type icitation needed people usher syndrome iii born deaf experience progressive loss hearing roughly half balance difficultiescitation needed mutations one gene linked usher syndrome type iii encodes protein important development maintenance inner ear retina however proteins function structures mutation causes hearing vision loss still poorly understoodcitation needed frequency usher syndrome type iii significant finnish well population birmingham individuals ashkenazi jewish heritage noted rarely ethnic groupscitation needed usher syndrome characterized hearing loss gradual visual impairment hearing loss caused defective inner ear whereas vision loss results retinitis pigmentosa rp degeneration retinal cells usually rod cells retina affected first leading early night blindness nyctalopia gradual loss peripheral vision cases early degeneration cone cells macula occurs leading loss central acuity cases foveal vision spared leading doughnut vision central peripheral vision intact annulus exists around central region vision impairedcitation needed usher syndrome inherited autosomal recessive pattern several genes associated usher syndrome using linkage analysis patient families table dna sequencing identified mutation one genes likely result usher syndromecitation needed clinical subtypes usher ii associated mutations one six three cd genes respectively whereas one gene linked usher iii far two genes initially associated usher syndrome verified incorrectly determined research area ongoing using interaction analysis techniques identified gene products could shown interact one another one larger protein complexes one components missing protein complex fulfil function living cell probably comes degeneration function protein complex suggested participate signal transduction cell adhesion sensory study shows three proteins related usher syndrome genes also involved auditory cortex development mouse macaque lack expression induces decrease number parvalbumin interneurons patients mutations genes could consequently auditory cortex progressive blindness usher syndrome results retinitis photoreceptor cells usually start degenerate outer periphery center retina including macula degeneration usually first noticed night blindness nyctalopia peripheral vision gradually lost restricting visual field tunnel vision generally progresses complete blindness qualifier pigmentosa reflects fact clumps pigment may visible ophthalmoscope advanced stages hearing impairment associated usher syndrome caused damaged hair cells cochlea inner ear inhibiting electrical impulses reaching brain form dysacusis since usher syndrome incurable present helpful diagnose children well develop characteristic night blindness preliminary studies suggested many children congenital severe profound deafness may usher however misdiagnosis bad consequencescitation needed simplest approach diagnosing usher syndrome test characteristic chromosomal mutations alternative approach electroretinography although often disfavored children since discomfort also make results parental consanguinity significant factor diagnosis usher syndrome may indicated child profoundly deaf birth especially slow walking thirteen syndromes may exhibit signs similar usher syndrome including alport syndrome alström syndrome syndrome cockayne syndrome spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita syndrome friedreich ataxia hurler syndrome syndrome cpeo norrie syndrome osteopetrosis disease refsum disease phytanic acid storage disease zellweger syndrome cerebrohepatorenal syndromecitation needed although usher syndrome classified clinically several prevailing approach classify three clinical subtypes called usher ii iii order decreasing severity although previously believed usher syndrome type iv researchers university iowa recentlywhen confirmed ush type ivcitation needed described clinical subtypes may subdivided particular gene mutated people usher ii may one six three genes mutated respectively whereas one gene associated usher iii function genes still poorly understoodcitation needed usher syndrome variable condition degree severity tightly linked whether usher ii iii example someone type iii may unaffected childhood go develop profound hearing loss significant loss sight earlytomid adulthood similarly someone type therefore profoundly deaf birth may keep good central vision sixth decade life even beyond people type ii useful hearing hearing aid experience wide range severity rp may maintain good reading vision others see read still needed since usher syndrome inherited autosomal recessive pattern males females equally likely inherit consanguinity parents risk factor since usher syndrome results loss gene gene therapy adds proper protein back gene replacement may alleviate provided added protein becomes functional recent studies mouse models shown one form associated mutation myosin alleviated replacing mutant gene using however mutated genes associated usher syndrome encode large notably proteins roughly aminoacid residues gene replacement therapy large proteins may difficultcitation needed usher syndrome responsible
