sexual stimulation stimulus including bodily contact leads enhances maintains sexual arousal may lead orgasm although sexual arousal may arise without physical stimulation achieving orgasm usually requires term sexual stimulation implies stimulation genitals may also include stimulation areas body stimulation senses sight smell hearing mental stimulation eg reading sufficient stimulation penis clitoris usually results stimulation self eg masturbation sexual partner sexual intercourse sexual activity use objects tools combination people practice orgasm control whereby person partner controls level stimulation prolong experience leading orgasm physical sexual stimulation consists touching genitals erogenous zones masturbation erotic massage manual sex types physical stimulation involving genitals arousal triggered sensitive nerves body cause release pleasurecausing chemicals endorphins act mental rewards pursue stimulation person may also become aroused simply touching another person though bulbocavernosus reflex triggered stimulation glans penis one study found women benefit pleasurable sex committed partner gender impact relationship purpose sex toys provide pleasure stimulation alternative route using peoples bodies used someone partnered sex group sex exciting provide new types stimulation body produce vibrations sex toys used source sexual stimulation thousands years dildos found palaeolithic made siltstone polished high gloss dildos also made camel dung coated historians uncertain whether used religious rituals personal pleasure known dildos used fertility however ancient greeks created dildos carved penis covered leather animal intestines create natural romans created doubleended dildos use partner ancient chinese dildos made bronze metals hollow

large stone dildo ritual also used confirm virginity many areas person sexually stimulated genitals nipples thighs lips neck provide sexual stimulation touched shows sex differences erogenous zones includes top ten arousing areas sexes body part rated ten arousing touched apart body parts exclusive one gender penis clitoris many erogenous zones similar contain many nerve endings excitationtransfer theory states existing arousal body transformed another type arousal example sometimes people sexually stimulated residual arousal arising something exercise transformed another type arousal sexual arousal one participants performed physical exercise different stages recovery watch erotic film rate aroused made feel found participants still experiencing excitatory residues exercise rated film arousing fully recovered exercise suggests remaining arousal exercise transformed sexual arousal without external stimulation human sexual response dynamic combination cognitive emotional physiological processes whilst common forms sexual stimulation discussed fantasy physical stimulation genitals erogenous areas sexual arousal may also mediated alternative routes visual olfactory auditory means perhaps researched nontactile form sexual stimulation visual sexual apparent example act voyeurism practice individual covertly watches another undress engage sexual behaviour although seen sociohistorically unacceptable form sexual deviation highlights human tendency find sexual stimulation purely visual routes multibilliondollar porn industry another example common presumption men respond strongly visual sexual stimuli women perhaps best exemplified kinsey hypothesis men prone sexual arousal visual stimulation nonetheless sexes sexually aroused visual stimulation one study visual stimulation tested means erotic video although significantly higher male group sexual arousal main emotional reaction reported sexes physiological responses video also showed characteristics sexual arousal increased urinary excretions subsequent study investigating male arousal showed men able achieve rigid erections visual stimulation erotic film studies use visual stimulation means sexual stimulation find sexual arousal predominantly correlated activation limbic paralimbic cortex subcortical structures along deactivation several parts temporal cortex areas activated physical sexual stimulation highlighting powerful visual stimulation means sexual olfactory information critical human sexual behavior one study investigating olfactory sexual stimulation found heterosexual men experience sexual arousal response female perfume individuals rated odourant stimulation perceived sexual arousal also functional mri scans taken experiment results showed olfactory stimulation womens perfume produces activation specific brain areas associated sexual arousal another study found homosexual men displayed similar hypothalamic activation heterosexual women smelling testosterone derivate present male sweat suggesting sexual orientation plays role humans experience olfactory sexual evolutionary analysis sex differences reproductive strategies help explain importance smell sexual arousal due link immunological profile offspring olfactory cues may able trigger incest avoidance mechanism reflecting parts individuals genetic equipment one study males rated visual olfactory information equally important selecting lover females considered olfactory information single important variable mate choice additionally considering sexual activity females singled body odour sensory experiences able negatively affect auditory stimulants may also serve intensify sexual arousal experience pleasure making sounds sexual arousal sexual activity widespread among primates humans include sighs moans strong expirations inspirations increased breathing rate occasionally orgasm screams ecstasy many sounds highly exciting people act strong reinforcers sexual arousal creating powerful positive feedback thus copulatory vocalisations likely serve mutual sexual stimulation mating even coupled touching sounds highly sexually arousing commercial erotic material mainly produced male market uses sounds extensively early several genres singers turned low moans erotic effect vaudeville jazz singers often incorporated sex sounds narrative lyrics even contemporary music princes orgasm marvin gayes sure love ball includes sounds female research shown music auditory sexual stimulant one mood induction study exposure certain music resulted significantly greater penile tumescence subjective sexual arousal similar experiment women show significant physiological responses certain types music report higher levels sexual studies looked connection auditory stimulation experience sexual pleasure whilst highest levels physiological subjective arousal found visual stimuli spokentext found elicit sexual arousal men implicating sounds means sexual phone sex one type arousal inducer makes use effect sexual arousal includes feelings attractions desires well physiological elicited physical also mental stimulations fantasy erotic literature dreams roleplay imagination sexual fantasy form mental sexual stimulation many people engage person imagines sexual experience awake fantasy less social safety limits real life situations gives people freedom experiment think things could necessarily try real life anything imagining spouse naked imagining sexual experience mythical creature common sexual fantasies include imagining activities loved partner reliving past experiences experiences multiple partners opposite also common fantasies things would real life taboo illegal activities forcing another forced another sex intercourse stranger sex boy girl older useful research makes differences male female heterosexual preferences clearer studies behaviour many sexual fantasies shared men women possibly cultural however still gender differences found men likely women imagine dominant active role whereas women likely imagine passive womens fantasies significantly affection whereas men likely fantasise using visual imagery explicit one explanation difference comes evolutionary perspective women higher minimum parental investment males months gestation prior birth main care givers whereas men provide sperm ensure genes passed therefore likely want commitment partner order gain resources improve offsprings chance fantasies benefits increasing arousal forms sexual stimuli erotic story increasing sexual individuals disclose sexual fantasies partners also higher sexual satisfaction however whether people willing open partner generally depends content negative effect sexual fantasy linked sexual crimes indeed sexual offenders often report fantasies related however fantasies also common among involved criminal nonoffenders use fantasies guide therefore fantasy alone used sign someone become nocturnal emission orgasms wet dreams erotic dreams people ejaculate orgasm occur rem rapid eye movement phases main stage humans implies erotic dreams alone enough stimulate men erections accompany rem according
