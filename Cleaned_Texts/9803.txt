peduncular hallucinosis ph rare neurological phenomenon causes vivid visual hallucinations typically occur dark environments last several minutes unlike kinds hallucinations hallucinations patients ph experience realistic often involve people environments familiar affected individuals content hallucinations never exceptionally bizarre patients rarely distinguish hallucinations french neurologist jean lhermitte documented case patient experiencing visual hallucinations suggestive localized damage midbrain pons similar case studies published syndrome labeled peduncular hallucinosis accumulation additional cases lhermitte others influenced academic medical debate hallucinations behavioral neurology lhermitte provided full account work area book les hallucinations clinique et physiopathologie published paris doin publishing contemporary researchers access new technologies medical brain imaging confirmed brain localization unusual hallucinations hallucinations normally colorful vivid images occur wakefulness predominantly lilliputian hallucinations also called alice wonderland syndrome hallucinations people animals appear smaller would real life common cases peduncular patients exhibit abnormal sleep patterns characterized insomnia daytime peduncular hallucinosis described release phenomenon due damage ascending reticular activating system supported sleep disturbance characteristic cases people aware hallucinations real however people experience agitation delusion mistake hallucinations peduncular hallucinosis attributed range various pathologies vascular infectious midbrain pontine thalamic lesions local subarachnoid hemorrhage compression tumors basilar migraine basilar vascular hypoplasia following regional surgical angiographic pathologies mainly near base brain hallucinations gone away patients pathology corrected removal commonly reported hallucinations animals people age scary deformed faces heads landscapes people walking lesions disturb brainstem reticular formation thalamic targets seem source behind peduncular example lesions affecting dorsal raphe system lead hallucinations preventing ascending inhibition dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus inhibition may hyperexcite lgn inducing visual hallucinations lesions retina areas proximal remove alter inputs coming external environment visual peduncular hallucinosis therefore might emanate disturbances distal portions visual system lesions frontal temporal lobes also lead complex visual hallucinations lobes connect visual system via lateral geniculate nucleus medial addition visual processing salience disrupted thalamic lesions affect important structures effect lesions brainstem ascending reticular activating system aras also hypothesized proposed since aras plays role consciousness waking lesions brainstem common peduncular hallucinosis may disrupt aras impulses brainstem reticular formation consequence lead sleep disturbances characteristic peduncular use drugs olanzapine may help treat sleep disturbances found improve sleep continuity sleep quality increase slow wave sleep people diagnosed parkinsons disease narcolepsycataplexy syndrome delirium tremens lewy body dementia temporal lobe epilepsy prone complex visual hallucinations peduncular peduncular hallucinosis common patients long duration parkinsons disease also long treatment history depression cognitive paranoid delusions common patients even though hallucinations occur clear visual hallucinations tend stem psychological disorders whereas person psychological disorder thinks hallucinations real people peduncular hallucinosis normally know visual hallucinations see real peduncular hallucinations independent seizures unlike visual hallucinations diagnosis made multimodal approach detailed history regarding sleep pattern vividness images intact reality testing association brain pathology particularly brain stem areas pons mid brainclarification needed evidence tumor parkinsonism lewy body dementiacitation needed treatment kind complex visual hallucination requires understanding different pathologies order correctly diagnose treat person taking prohallucinogenic medication first step stop taking sometimes improvement occur spontaneously pharmacotherapy necessary lot evidence effective pharmacological treatment antipsychotics anticonvulsants used cases control since peduncular hallucinosis occurs due excess serotonin modern antipsychotics used block dopamine serotonin receptors preventing overstimulation lateral geniculate nucleus carbamazepine increases gaba prevents lgn firing thereby increasing inhibition regular antipsychotics well antidepressants also helpful reducing eliminating peduncular hallucinosis invasive treatments include corrective surgery cataract surgery laser photocoagulation retina use optical correcting tumor removal also help relieve compression brain decrease eliminate peduncular hallucinosis hallucinations may due underlying cardiovascular disease cases appropriate treatment includes control hypertension described type treatment varies widely depending causation behind complex visual hallucinations first documented case peduncular hallucinosis french neurologist neuropsychiatrist jean lhermitte described woman visual hallucinations occurred normal conscious state patient neurological signs associated characteristic infarct midbrain von bogaert lhermitte colleague named type hallucination peduncular reference cerebral peduncles well midbrain von bogaert first describe pathophysiology peduncular hallucinosis autopsy autopsy revealed infarction many areas brain including inferolateral red nucleus superior colliculus periaqueductal gray third nerve nucleus superior cerebellar peduncle substantia nigra later lhermitte levy trelles discovered association peduncular hallucinosis pigmentary degeneration periaqueductal gray degeneration occulomotor nucleus posterior thalamic lesions also found linked
