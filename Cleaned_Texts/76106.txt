knucklewalking helps actions locomotion ground gorilla fingers used manipulation food chimpanzees manipulation food climbing anteaters pangolins fingers large claws opening mounds social insects platypus fingers webbing extend past fingers aid swimming thus knucklewalking used prevent stumbling gorillas move around knucklewalking although sometimes walk bipedally short distances carrying food defensive situations mountain gorillas use knucklewalking plus parts use knuckles using backs hand using palms anthropologists thought common ancestor chimpanzees humans engaged knucklewalking humans evolved upright walking knucklewalking view thought supported reanalysis overlooked features hominid since scientists discovered ardipithecus ramidus humanlike hominid descended common ancestor chimpanzees humans ar ramidus engaged upright walking knucklewalking leads conclusion chimpanzees evolved knucklewalking split humans six million years ago humans evolved upright walking without would
