mixed transcortical aphasia least common three transcortical aphasias behind transcortical motor aphasia transcortical sensory aphasia respectively type aphasia also referred isolation aphasia type aphasia result damage isolates language areas brocas wernicke arcuate fasciculus brain regions brocas wernickes arcuate fasiculus left intact however isolated brain stroke one leading causes disability united following stroke stroke patients left moderate functional impairment severe disability result neurogenic cognitivecommunicative disorder one result stroke neuro meaning related nerves nervous system genic meaning resulting caused aphasia one type neurogenic cognitivecommunicative disorder presents impaired comprehension production speech language usually caused damage languagedominant left hemisphere aphasia disorder language causes patient inability communicate whether writing speaking sign mixed transcortical aphasia characterized severe speaking comprehension impairment preserved people suffer mixed transcortical aphasia struggle greatly produce propositional language understand said yet repeat long complex utterances finish song hear first part persons mixed transcortical aphasia often nonfluent cases speak unless spoken comprehend spoken language name objects read write however often ability repeat said fact persons mixed transcortical aphasia often repeat parrotlike patients disorder experience many different types neurological symptoms including bilateral paralysis lack voluntary speech difficulty producing spontaneous conversation clinician person transcortical mixed aphasia would similar characteristics conversation rare type aphasia brocas area wernickes area arcuate fasciculus intact watershed region around damage isolates areas rest brain frequent etiology mixed transcortical aphasia stenosis narrowing internal carotid artery mixed transcortical aphasia also occur cerebral hypoxia cerebral swelling stroke affects cerebral often lesions cause mixed transcortical aphasia affect anterior posterior perisylvian border times type aphasia determined knowing lesion order patient diagnosed mixed transcortical aphasia forms transcortical must ruled using wab bdae rule global aphasia ability repeat verbal fluency depressed transcortical aphasia gets ruled auditory processing comprehension weak transcortical motor stroke many patients feel devastating impacts loss language studies looked ways enhance verbal communication therapy one treatment approaches proved successful drawing therapy drawing offers alternative route access semantic information provides adults lost language means access express ideas emotions feelings drawing also shown activate right hemisphere regions makes drawing nonlinguistic intervention access semantic knowledge right study conducted drawing therapy found increased naming abilities patients acute chronic aphasia also produced fewer error attempts naming study also found act drawing quality critical activation semanticlexical network required naming studies also reported family members seen effects therapy gains made drawing therapy ones could made spontaneous drawing therapy especially found useful individuals global anomic aphasia individuals found produced verbalizations reinforces idea drawing provides mean recruiting areas networks otherwise sufficient producing speech across majority patients quality drawing improved well written output sentence drawing therapy proved effective even periods although therapy aimed patients aphasia implemented patient expressive drawing therapy implemented following hierarchy drawing therapy also made harder type prompt given task difficulty prompts questions opened ended broad semantic categories going harder conceptualize harder task client asked draw abstract concepts sequenced actionsevents overall drawing therapy offers means accessing language patients aphasia difficulty expressing different patients formal informal language assessments initially administered hisher acute hospital stay licensed speechlanguage pathologist however standardized assessment may provide information regarding aphasia classification different classifications aphasia ie brocas wernickes conduction anomia hallmark deficits research shown patient presenting mixed transcortical aphasia impairments communicative areas exception preserved ability repeat persons words patients mixed transcortical aphasia demonstrate similar deficits seen patients global aphasia therefore assessment repetition critical order differentially diagnose specifically language based standardized assessments western aphasia battery wab folstein mini mental state exam include repetition subtest amongst languagerelated areas possible assessments provide differentiation include magnetic resonance imaging mri magnetic resonance angiography mra ct scan informal observation important remain diligent providing therapy regardless aphasia classification brain damage minimal patient may recover language skills time without treatment however damage severe may necessary receive speech language recovery type brain injury slow process patients regain level language communication skills injury patients aphasia usually undergo speech therapy relearn practice supplementary communication speech therapy cure aphasia instead helps patients use skills remain considering prognosis individuals aphasia necessary consider internal factors patient specific factors external factors factors considered critical poststroke internal factors factors related stroke aphasia severity lesion site lesion size individuals milder forms aphasia lesions insignificantly impact language function smaller lesions tend higher degree aphasia lesions superior temporal gyrus stg produce persistent global aphasia associated poor aphasia patient specific factors relate patients age onset education level motivation recovery younger patients reported demonstrate higher recovery rate older years education less vulnerable language disruption external factors include environmental factors type amount language treatment stroke patients generally aware handicap receive good support show motivation likely better httpsenwikipediaorgwikimixedtranscorticalaphasia
