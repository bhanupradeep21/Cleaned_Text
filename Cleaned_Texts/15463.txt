combination tone also called resultant subjective psychoacoustic phenomenon additional tone tones artificially perceived two real tones sounded time discovery credited violinist giuseppe although first see georg andreas sorge also called tartini tones two types combination tones sum tones whose frequencies found adding frequencies real tones difference tones whose frequencies difference frequencies real tones combination tones heard two pure tones ie tones produced simple harmonic sound waves overtones differing frequency cycles per second hertz sound together sufficient combination tones also produced electronically combining two signals circuit nonlinear distortion amplifier subject clipping ring modulator one way difference tone heard two tones fairly complete sets harmonics make fifth explained example missing fundamental f displaystyle f missing fundamental frequency f displaystyle would frequency lower tone harmonics would f f f displaystyle etc since fifth corresponds frequency ratio higher tone harmonics would f f f displaystyle etc tones sounded components frequencies f f f f f f displaystyle etc missing fundamental heard many components refer specific phenomenon tartini discovered physical sum difference tones thought caused sometimes nonlinearity inner ear causes intermodulation distortion various frequencies enter ear combined linearly generating relatively faint components frequencies equal sums differences whole multiples original frequencies components heard usually lower commonly heard frequency difference tone f f displaystyle though may consequence phenomena although much less common following frequencies may also heard time thought inner ear solely responsible whenever sum difference tone heard however experiments show evidence even using headphones providing single pure tone ear separately listeners may still hear difference tonecitation needed since peculiar nonlinear physics ear doesnt come play case thought must separate neural phenomenon compare binaural beats heinz bohlen proposed known scale basis combination well cents scale resultant tone produced two loud sustained musical sounds heard pipe done two pipes one pipe note played another harmonically related typically fifth sounded time result pitch common subharmonic pitches played one octave first pitch second fifth two octaves second major third effect useful especially lowest ranks pipe organ cost space could prohibit rank low pitch example pipe would costly take much vertical space capped commonly openended pipe using resultant tone low pitches reduces cost space factor sound full true pipe effect enhanced using ranks harmonic series desired resultant tone effect often used lowest octave organ vary highly effective disappointing depending several factors primarily skill organ voicer acoustics room instrument installed possible produce melody resultant tones multiple harmonics played two instruments example seven saxophones httpsenwikipediaorgwikicombinationtone
