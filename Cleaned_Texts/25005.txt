osteoarthritis treatment strategy appear change acl tears also occur animals dogs common knee injury dogs acl ccl rupture individual acl injury likely hear pop knee followed pain swelling may also experience instability knee resume walking activities ligament longer stabilize knee joint keep tibia sliding reduced range motion knee tenderness along joint line also common signs acute acl injury pain swelling may resolve however knee remain unstable returning sport without treatment may result damage causes may include movements cause tibia shift away femur rapidly placing strain knee joint potentially leading rupture acl acl injuries occur without direct risk factors include female anatomy specific sports poor conditioning fatigue playing turf female athletes two eight times likely strain acl sports involve cutting jumping compared men play particular ncaa data found relative rates injury per athlete exposures followscitation needed highest rate acl injury women occurred gymnastics rate injury per athlete exposures four sports highest acl injury rates three womens gymnastics basketball differences males females identified potential causes active muscular protection knee joint differences legpelvis alignment relative ligament laxity caused differences hormonal activity estrogen birth control pills also appear decrease risk acl studies suggested four neuromuscular imbalances predispose women higher incidence acl injury female athletes likely jump land knees relatively straight collapsing towards bodyweight falls single foot upper body tilts one several theories described explain imbalances include ligament dominance quadriceps dominance leg dominance trunk dominance theoriescitation needed ligament dominance theory suggests females athletes land jump muscles sufficiently absorb impact ground result ligaments knee must absorb force leading higher risk quadriceps dominance refers tendency female athletes preferentially use quadriceps muscles stabilize knee given quadriceps muscles work pull tibia forward overpowering contraction quadriceps place strain acl increasing risk injurycitation needed leg dominance describes observation women tend place weight one leg finally trunk dominance suggests males typically exhibit greater control trunk performance situations evidenced greater activation internal oblique female athletes likely land upper body tilted one side weight one leg therefore placing greater rotational force puberty observed difference frequency acl tears sexes changes sex hormone levels specifically elevated levels estrogen relaxin females menstrual cycle hypothesized causing predisposition acl ruptures may increase joint laxity extensibility soft tissues surrounding knee ongoing research observed greater occurrence acl injuries females ovulation fewer injuries follicular luteal phases menstrual study results shown female collegiate athletes concentration levels relaxin greater pgml four times higher risk acl tear lower additionally female pelvises widen puberty influence sex hormones wider pelvis requires femur angle toward knees angle towards knee referred q angle average q angle men degrees average women degrees steps taken reduce q angle using relatively wider female hip widened q angle may lead increased likelihood acl tears puberty sex hormones also affect remodeled shape soft tissues throughout body tissue remodeling results female acls smaller fail ie tear lower loading forces differences ligament muscular stiffness men women womens knees less stiff mens muscle activation force applied less stiff knee likely result acl addition quadriceps femoris muscle antagonist acl according study undertaken female athletes university michigan female athletes recruited quadriceps femoris muscle first compared males elevated contraction quadriceps femoris muscle physical activity increased strain placed onto acl due tibial translation knee joint formed three bones femur thighbone tibia shinbone patella kneecap bones held together ligaments strong bands tissue keep joint stable individual walking running jumping etc two types ligaments knee collateral ligaments cruciate ligamentscitation needed collateral ligaments include medial collateral ligament along inside knee lateral fibular collateral ligament along outside knee two ligaments function limit sideways movement cruciate ligaments form x inside knee joint anterior cruciate ligament running front tibia back femur posterior cruciate ligament running back tibia front femur anterior cruciate ligament prevents tibia sliding front femur provides rotational also two cshaped structures made cartilage called medial meniscus lateral meniscus sit top tibia knee joint serve cushion acl injuries diagnosed examining knee comparing noninjured knee doctor suspects acl injury person reports popping sound knee followed swelling pain instability knee joint perform several tests evaluate damage knee tests include pivotshift test anterior drawer test lachman test pivotshift test involves flexing knee holding onto ankle slightly rotating tibia anterior drawer test examiner flexes knees degrees sits persons feet gently pulls tibia towards lachman test performed placing one hand persons thigh tibia pulling tibia tests meant test whether acl intact therefore able limit forward motion tibia lachman test recognized authorities reliable sensitive though clinical examination experienced hands accurate diagnosis usually confirmed magnetic resonance imaging provides images soft tissues like ligaments cartilage around may also permit visualization structures may coincidentally involved menisci collateral xray may performed addition evaluate whether one bones knee joint broken mri perhaps used technique diagnosing state acl always reliable technique acl obscured blood fills joint mri particularly useful cases partial tear acl anteromedial band commonly injured compared posterolateral another form evaluation may used case physical examination mri inconclusive laximetry testing ie arthrometry stress imaging involve applying force leg quantifying resulting displacement medical devices basically replicate manual tests offer objective gnrb arthrometer example knee arthrometer considered effective lachman injury ligament called sprain american academy orthopedic surgeons defines acl injury terms severity classifies grade grade sprains occur ligament stretched slightly stability knee joint affected grade sprains occur ligament stretched point becomes loose also referred partial tear grade sprains occur ligament completely torn two pieces knee joint longer stable common type acl injurycitation needed around half acl injuries occur conjunction injury structures knee including ligaments menisci cartilage surface bones specific pattern injury called unhappy triad also known terrible triad odonoghues triad involves injury acl mcl medial meniscus occurs lateral force applied knee foot fixed interest reducing noncontact acl injury intense international olympic committee comprehensive review preventive strategies stated injury prevention programs measurable effect reducing programs especially important female athletes bear higher incidence acl injury male athletes also children adolescents high risk second acl researchers found female athletes often land knees relatively straight collapsing inwards towards bodyweight single foot upper body tilting one side four factors put excessive strain ligaments knee thus increase likelihood acl evidence engaging neuromuscular training nmt focus hamstring strengthening balance overall stability reduce risk injury enhancing movement patterns high risk movements programs beneficial athletes particularly adolescent female injury prevention programs ipps reliable reducing risk factors acl inquiries referring dominance theories ligament dominance theory reduced peak knee abduction moment focused
