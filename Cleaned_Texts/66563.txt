pyrenean ibex capra pyrenaica pyrenaica aragonese spanish common name bucardo basque common name bukardo catalan common name herc french common name bouquetin one four subspecies iberian ibex iberian wild goat species endemic pyrenees pyrenean ibex common cantabrian mountains southern france northern pyrenees species common holocene upper pleistocene morphology primarily skulls pyrenean ibex found larger capra subspecies southwestern europe time january last pyrenean ibex died making species extinct subspecies survived western spanish gredos ibex southeastern spanish beceite ibex portuguese ibex already become extinct since last pyrenean ibex became extinct scientists could adequately analyze taxonomy particular subspecies controversial following several failed attempts revive subspecies cloning living specimen born july however died several minutes birth due lung pyrenean ibex remains animal ever brought back also one go extinct twice multiple theories given regarding evolution historical migration c pyrenaica iberian peninsula relationship different subspecies one possibility c pyrenaica evolved ancestor related c caucasica middle east beginning last glacial period c pyrenaica probably moved northern alps southern france pyrenees area beginning magdalenian period kya case c caucasica praepyrenaica may different three ibex species lived iberian peninsula scientists currently know example would mean c pyrenaica possible migration c ibex ky earlier migration would evolved different ancestors morphologically different separate known four subspecies lived together upper pleistocene time scientists unsure much genetic exchange could occurred problem theory genetics suggest c pyrenaica c ibex may shared common origin possibly c many versions c pyrenaica c ibex first migrated evolved iberian peninsula related c pyrenaica possibly already living iberian peninsula ibex began migrate alps genetic evidence also supports theory multiple capra subspecies migrated iberian region around time hybridization may possible results pyrenean ibex short hair varied according seasons summer hair short winter hair grew longer thicker hair ibexs neck remained long seasons male female ibex could distinguished due color fur horn differences male faded grayish brown summer decorated black several places body mane forelegs forehead winter ibex less colorful male transformed greyish brown dull grey spots black became dull faded female ibex though could mistaken deer since coat brown throughout summer unlike male ibex female lacked black coloring young ibex colored like female first year male large thick horns curving outwards backwards outwards downwards inwards upwards surface horn ridged ridges developing progressively age ridges said represent year total would correspond ibexs age female short cylindrical horns ibex fed vegetation grasses pyrenean ibex migrated according seasons spring ibex would migrate elevated parts mountains females males would matecitation needed spring females would normally separate males could give birth isolated areas kids typically born may usually singularly winter ibex would migrate valleys covered snow valleys allowed eat regardless change species often seen parts france portugal spain andorra much northern areas iberian peninsula areas like andorra france mainland pyrenean ibex became extinct first northern tip iberian peninsula pyrenean ibex estimated peak population individuals subgroups ranged sierra nevada sierra morena muela de cortesclarification many subgroups lived mountainous terrain extending spain portugal last remaining pyrenean ibex seen areas middle eastern pyrenees metres ft altitude however areas southern france surrounding areas ibex found metres ft metres pyrenean ibex quite abundant century numbers dwindle region pyrenean ibex tended live rocky habitats cliffs trees interspersed scrub pine trees however small patches rocks farmland various areas along iberian coast also formed suitable habitat ibex able thrive well environment long appropriate habitat available able disperse rapidly colonize quickly pyrenean ibex formed useful resource humans may cause eventual researchers say eventual downfall pyrenean ibex may caused continuous hunting even perhaps animal could compete livestock area however definite reasons extinction animal still subspecies ranged across pyrenees france spain surrounding area including basque country navarre north aragon north catalonia hundred years ago numerous numbers fallen fewer onwards numbers never rose subspecies found small part ordesa national park huesca pyrenean ibex one four subspecies iberian ibex first become extinct portuguese ibex capra pyrenaica lusitanica pyrenean ibex second last individual female called celia found dead middle ages pyrenean ibex abundant pyrenees region decreased rapidly centuries due hunting pressure second half century small population survived ordesa national park situated spanish central competition domestic wild ungulates also contributed extinction pyrenean ibex much range shared sheep domestic goats cattle horses especially summer high mountain pastures led interspecific overgrazing particularly affected ibex dry years addition introduction nonnative wild ungulate species areas occupied ibex eg fallow deer mouflon sierras de cazorla segura las villas natural park increased grazing pressure well risk transmission native exotic last natural pyrenean ibex female named celia found dead january killed fallen tree reason subspecies decline extinction fully understood hypotheses include inability compete species food infections diseases poaching pyrenean ibex became first taxon ever become unextinct july cloned female ibex born alive survived several

advanced cell technology inc announced spanish government would let try clone act intended work alongside scientists clone celia nuclear transfer expected easier cloning experiment endangered gaur bos gaurus reproductive biology goats better known normal gestation period five months addition certain extinct animals candidates cloning need suitable proxy surrogate carry clone term act agreed government aragon future cloned pyrenean ibex would returned original habitat celia provided suitable tissue samples cloning however attempts clone highlighted major problem even possible produce another healthy pyrenean ibex males available female clone breed produce viable population previously extinct animal genetic samples many individuals would needed create genetic diversity cloned major obstacle reestablishing extinct species population cloning one solution could cross celias clones males another subspecies although offspring would pure pyrenean ibex ambitious plan would remove one x chromosome add chromosome another stillexisting subspecies creating male pyrenean ibex technology yet exist known whether feasible without irreparable damage cell three teams scientists two spanish
