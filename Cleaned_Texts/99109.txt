given injection common side effects include bone marrow suppression hearing problems including total irreversible hearing loss usually restricted one ear kidney damage serious side effects include numbness trouble walking allergic reactions electrolyte problems heart use pregnancy cause harm developing cisplatin platinumbased antineoplastic family works part binding dna inhibiting cisplatin discovered licensed medical use world health organizations list essential cisplatin administered intravenously shortterm infusion normal saline treatment solid haematological malignancies used treat various types cancers including sarcomas carcinomas eg small cell lung cancer squamous cell carcinoma head neck ovarian cancer lymphomas bladder cancer cervical germ cell tumors widespread use cure
