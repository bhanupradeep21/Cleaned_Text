tactile hallucination false perception tactile sensory input creates hallucinatory sensation physical contact imaginary caused faulty integration tactile sensory neural signals generated spinal cord thalamus sent primary somatosensory cortex si secondary somatosensory cortex tactile hallucinations recurrent symptoms neurological diseases schizophrenia parkinsons disease ekboms syndrome delirium tremens patients experience phantom limb pains also experience type tactile hallucination tactile hallucinations also caused drugs cocaine ancient greek times touch considered unrefined perceptual system differed senses basis distance timing perception stimulus unlike vision audition one perceives touch simultaneously medium stimulus always proximal century british empiricist john locke attributed word feeling two types weber distinctly identified two types sensation sense touch common bodily distinction helped century psychiatrists distinguish tactile hallucinations cenesthopathy century tactile hallucinations classified symptoms associated insanity organic toxic syndromes delusional parasitosis yet identification hallucinations neuroscientists dr oliver sacks dr vs ramachandran analyzed attributed tactile hallucinations dysfunctional perception brain opposed symptom related insanity contributed significantly propose tactile hallucinations false perception tactile sensory input creating sensation touch imaginary object hallucinations pain touch rare schizophrenic disorders patients schizophrenia experience sort tactile hallucinations along visual auditory common tactile hallucination patients schizophrenia sensation patch skin stretched elastically across vary intensity range speed feel stretching painful sensation usually triggered emotional cues guilt anger fear types tactile hallucinations takes sexual form patients schizophrenia patients schizophrenia may sometimes experience feeling kissed feeling someone lying side response emotion additionally occasionally hallucinate feeling small animals snakes crawling vivid tactile sensation object present results unsuccessful attempt brain trying perceive objects novel represent unreal situations usually triggered guilt patients schizophrenia also hard time portraying emotions divert energy control pain tactile olfactory tactile hallucinations correlate one another terms prevalence patients one particular study conducted langdon et al prevalence olfactory hallucinations tactile hallucinations analyzed two distinct clinical samples patients schizophrenia one samples contained patients schizophrenia tactile hallucinations reported world health organization sample contained cases negative positive types tactile hallucinations patients schizophrenia concluded patients schizophrenia experience olfactory tactile study reported sociocultural factors influenced selfreporting tactile hallucinations since hallucinations general feared symptoms insanity patients reluctant seek help moreover study concluded tactile hallucinations usually accompanied several hallucinations associated different modalities taste however study failed recognize pathophysiology tactile hallucinations individuals schizophrenia individuals parkinsons disease pd also experience mild severe types tactile hallucinations based sensation particular kind several case studies conducted fénelon colleagues patients pd tactile hallucinations one patients described sensed spiders cockroaches chewing lower limb rather several patients felt parasitic infestation skin caused lesions skins due obsessive need fénelon also analyzed particular types tactile hallucinations experienced timing experience certain drugs could eliminate experience concluded patients pd tactile hallucinations experienced sensations elicited insects skin also vivid tactile sensations hallucinations aggravated evening times due altered arousal states alleviated dopaminergic treatment intake study also explains pathophysiology tactile hallucinations uncertain however hallucinations attributed narcoleptic rapid eye movement sleep disorders due concordance visual moreover emphasizes individuals pd longer period time severe form tactile hallucinations individuals succumbed disease short period clinical drugs used antiparkinsonian agent trihexyphenidyl known create tactile hallucinations patients restless legs syndrome rls causes unpleasant uncomfortable sensations legs irresistible urge move tactile hallucinations rls include feelings itching pulling crawling creeping mainly legs accompanying overwhelming urge move symptoms prominent late afternoon night often causing causes rls generally unknown though three major hypotheses iron deficiency dopamine insufficiency genetic rls also occur due nerve damage treatments rls typically focus symptom relief supplementing iron blocking nerve receptors use delta drugs gabapentin use opioids phantom limb pain type tactile hallucination creates sensation excruciating pain limb vs ramachandran conducted research several amputees pinpoint neural reasons behind illusionary pains amputees unbearable phantom limb pain reported patients whose limb paralyzed amputation vs ramachandran proposed learned paralysis hypothesis hypothesis suggested every time patients tried move paralyzed limb received sensory feedback vision proprioception limb move feedback hardwired brain circuitry even limb longer present brain learned phantom limb treatment phantom limb pains vs ramachandran devised mirror box would superimpose mirror image normal arm place missing arm patient would immediately relieved pain suggested brain plastic nature somatosensory system brain reorganized somatosensory region accommodate new patients experience phantom limb pain important research studies role determining brain plasticity vivid tactile sensation arm longer present suggest highly complex nature brain reorganize different functions thought hardwired specific regions localization organic toxic syndromes also induce tactile hallucinations use cocaine recreational purposes reported induce tactile usually sensations moving itches crawling insects cocaine alcohol induce rapid firing neuronal cells somatosensory region brain leading vivid perception illusionary bugs additionally mentioned trihexyphenidyl antiparkinsonian drug creates tactile hallucination mechanism drugs induce tactile hallucinations still unknown cenesthopathy rare medical term used refer feeling ill feeling localized one region cenesthopathic hallucinatory experiences caused hyperactive neuronal stimulation primary somatosensory cortex due disorder damage area two theories established portray sensation unified bodily feeling one theories called associationism states cenesthesia amalgamation propioceptive interoceptive faculty psychology theory states particular brain region sensory information converged integration information gives one cenesthetic sensation latter theory became predominant established two types cenestopathic hallucinations namely painful paraesthetic patients experience painful type cenesthopathic hallucination felt organs stretched apart hand patients paraesthetic cenesthopathic hallucination experience severe hallucinatory tactile hallucinations result dysfunctional somatosensory dysfunctional awareness regions tactile sensory input produced conducted spinal cord thalamus received primary somatosensory cortex reached primary somatosensory cortex distributed across brain processed unless important one pays close attention information based specific context consciousness specific tactile sensations generated multiple feedback loops passing higher cortical areas secondary somatosensory area parietal insular cortex premotor intensity tactile stimulus directly proportional area primary somatosensory region feedback mechanism different cortical areas results awareness touch even complete sensory deprivation discrete tactile memories trigger spontaneous firing impaired therefore individuals various psychiatric disorders prone tactile hallucinations normal individuals tactile hallucinations especially possible due faulty sensory integration neuronal signals primary secondary somatosensory system neuronal signals parietal cortex insular cortex premotor cortex moreover posterior insula
