treatment may involve surgery remove dead tissue antibiotics treat infection efforts address underlying surgical efforts may include debridement amputation use maggot efforts treat underlying cause

gangrene caused critically insufficient blood supply eg peripheral vascular disease associated longterm tobacco dry gangrene form coagulative necrosis develops ischemic tissue blood supply inadequate keep tissue viable disease symptom term dry used referring limb gut locations type necrosis called infarction myocardial dry gangrene often due peripheral artery disease due acute limb ischemia result people atherosclerosis high cholesterol diabetes smokers commonly dry limited oxygen ischemic limb limits putrefaction bacteria fail survive affected part dry shrunken dark reddishblack line

streptococci environmental bacteria may enter muscle wound subsequently proliferate necrotic tissue secrete powerful toxins destroy nearby tissue generating gas time gas composition hydrogen carbon dioxide nitrogen oxygen reported one clinical gas gangrene cause necrosis gas production sepsis progression toxemia shock often treatment varies based severity type exercises walking massage therapy may medications may include pain management medications promote circulation circulatory system antibiotics since gangrene associated periodic pain caused little blood flow pain management important patients continue exercises promote circulation pain management medications include opioids opioidlike analgesics since gangrene result ischemia circulatory system management important medications include antiplatelet drug anticoagulant fibrinolytics infection often associated gangrene antibiotics often critical component treatment lifethreatening nature gangrene requires treatment intravenous antibiotics inpatient antibiotics alone effective may penetrate infected tissues surgical removal dead tissue however mainstay treatment gangrene often gangrene associated underlying infection thus gangrenous tissue must debrided hinder spread associated infection extent surgical debridement needed depends extent gangrene may limited removal finger toe ear severe cases may involve limb dead
