pituitary gland hypothalamus located thalamus part limbic terminology neuroanatomy forms ventral part diencephalon vertebrate brains contain humans size almond hypothalamus responsible regulating certain metabolic processes activities autonomic nervous system synthesizes secretes certain neurohormones called releasing hormones hypothalamic hormones turn stimulate inhibit secretion hormones
