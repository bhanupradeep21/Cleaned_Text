nerve agents sometimes also called nerve gases class organic chemicals disrupt mechanisms nerves transfer messages organs disruption caused blocking acetylcholinesterase ache enzyme catalyzes breakdown acetylcholine neurotransmitter nerve agents irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used poison poisoning nerve agent leads constriction pupils profuse salivation convulsions involuntary urination defecation first symptoms appearing seconds exposure death asphyxiation cardiac arrest may follow minutes due loss bodys control respiratory muscles nerve agents readily vaporized aerosolized primary portal entry body respiratory system nerve agents also absorbed skin requiring likely subjected agents wear full body suit addition respirator nerve agents generally colorless tasteless liquids may evaporate gas agents sarin vx odorless tabun slightly fruity odor soman slight camphor nerve agents attack nervous system agents function way resulting cholinergic crisis inhibit enzyme acetylcholinesterase responsible breakdown acetylcholine ach synapses nerves control whether muscle tissues relax contract agent broken muscles prevented receiving relax signals effectively compounding paralysis throughout body quickly leads severe complications including heart muscles used breathing first symptoms usually appear within seconds exposure death occur via asphyxiation cardiac arrest minutes depending upon dose received agent initial symptoms following exposure nerve agents like sarin runny nose tightness chest constriction pupils soon victim difficulty breathing experience nausea salivation victim continues lose control bodily functions involuntary salivation lacrimation urination defecation gastrointestinal pain vomiting experienced blisters burning eyes andor lungs may also phase followed initially myoclonic jerks muscle jerks followed status epileptic seizure death comes via complete respiratory depression likely via excessive peripheral activity neuromuscular junction effects nerve agents long lasting increase continued exposure survivors nerve agent poisoning almost invariably develop chronic neurological damage related psychiatric possible effects last least years exposure include blurred vision tiredness declined memory hoarse voice palpitations sleeplessness shoulder stiffness eye strain people exposed nerve agents serum erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase longterm noticeably lower normal tend lower worse persisting symptoms normally functioning motor nerve stimulated releases neurotransmitter acetylcholine transmits impulse muscle organ impulse sent enzyme acetylcholinesterase immediately breaks acetylcholine order allow muscle organ relax nerve agents disrupt nervous system inhibiting function enzyme acetylcholinesterase forming covalent bond active site acetylcholine would normally broken undergo hydrolysis acetylcholine thus builds continues act nerve impulses continually transmitted muscle contractions stop action also occurs gland organ levels resulting uncontrolled drooling tearing eyes lacrimation excess production mucus nose rhinorrhea reaction product important nerve agents including soman sarin tabun vx acetylcholinesterase solved us army using xray crystallography reaction products confirmed subsequently using different sources acetylcholinesterase closely related
