obstetrical dilemma hypothesis explain humans often require assistance humans childbirth avoid complications whereas nonhuman primates give birth unassisted relatively little difficulty occurs due tight fit fetal head maternal birth canal additionally convoluted meaning head therefore body infant must rotate childbirth order fit unlike nonupright walking mammals consequently unusually high incidence cephalopelvic disproportion obstructed labor obstetrical dilemma claims difference due biological tradeoff imposed two opposing evolutionary pressures development human pelvis smaller birth canals mothers larger brains therefore skulls babies proponents believe bipedal locomotion ability walk upright decreased size bony parts birth canal also believe hominids humans skull brain sizes increased millennia women needed wider hips give birth wider hips made women inherently less able walk run men babies born earlier fit birth canal resulting socalled fourth trimester period newborns born baby seems less developed recent evidence suggested bipedal locomotion part strong evolutionary pressure constraining expansion maternal birth canal addition bipedal locomotion reduced strength pelvic floor due wider maternal pelvis also leads fitness detriments mother pressuring birth canal remain relatively idea widely accepted first published since criticized term obstetrical dilemma coined sherwood larned washburn prominent early american physical anthropologist order describe evolutionary development human pelvis relation childbirth pregnancy hominids nonhuman intervening decades term used broadly among anthropologists biologists scientists describe aspects hypothesis related topics obstetrical dilemma hypothesizes hominids began develop bipedal locomotion conflict two opposing evolutionary pressures became greatly exacerbated humans currently recognized extant obligately bipedal primates meaning body shape requires use two legs major evolutionary developments occur order alter shape female human males evolved narrower hips optimized locomotion whereas female hips evolved wider optimization childbirthing human pelvises distinguishing skeletal markers sex puberty meanwhile maturation hormones obstetrical demands alter shape pelvis females overall evolution species number structures body changed size proportion location order accommodate bipedal locomotion allow person stand upright face forward help support upper body number structural changes made pelvis ilial pelvic bone shifted forward broadened ischial pelvic bone shrank narrowing pelvic canal changes occurring time humans developing larger craniums examination pelvis useful method identifying biological sex skeleton distinguishing features human male female pelvis stem selective pressures childbearing birth females must able carry process childbirth also able move bipedally human female pelvis evolved wide possible still able allow bipedal locomotion compromise two necessary functions female pelvis especially seen comparative skeletal anatomy males diagram human pelvis needed human pelvis made three sections hip bones ilium ischium pubis sacrum coccyx three segments articulate dimensions key differentiation males females females acquired characteristic overall pelvic bone thinner denser pelvic bones males female pelvis also evolved much wider allow greater room order safely deliver child sexual maturation observed pubic arch females generally obtuse angle degrees males tend acute angle approximately difference angles attributed fact overall pelvis female preferred wider open male pelvis another key difference seen sciatic notch sciatic notch females tend wider sciatic notches males pelvic inlet also key difference pelvic inlet observed ovalshaped females heartshape difference inlet shape related distance ischium bones pelvis allow wider ovalshaped inlet female ischium bones apart one another ischium bones male differences sacrum males females also attributed needs child birth female sacrum wider male sacrum female sacrum also observed shorter sacrum male difference width explained overall wider shape female pelvis female sacrum also curved posteriorly could explained need much space possible birthing canal articulating coccyx females also generally observed straighter flexible coccyx male female pelvic bones general apart one another male pelvis acetabula female positioned medially apart one another orientation allows stereotypical swinging motion females hips acetabula differ distance depth well found female acetabula greater depth males also paired smaller femoral head turn creates stable hip one last key differences seen auricular surface pelvic bones auricular surface sacroiliac joint articulates seen females generally rougher texture compared surfaces seen difference texture articulating surface may due differences shape sacrum males females key differences examined used determine biological sex two different sets pelvic bones due need bipedal locomotion need childbearing childbirth females early human ancestors hominids originally gave birth similar way nonhuman primates early obligate quadrupedal individuals would retained similar skeletal structure great apes nonhuman primates today neonatal heads close size mothers birth canal evidenced observing female primates need assistance birthing often seeking seclusion away others modern humans parturition childbirth differs greatly rest primates pelvic shape mother neonatal shape infant adaptations evolved cope bipedalism larger craniums also important neonatal rotation infant shorter gestation length assistance birth malleable neonatal head neonatal rotation solution humans evolving larger brain sizes comparative zoological analysis shown size human brain anomalous humans brains significantly larger animals similar proportions even among great apes humans distinctive regard brains three four times larger chimpanzees humans nearest relatives although close correspondence neonatal cranium maternal pelvis monkeys also characteristic humans orientation pelvic diameters differs average human fetus nearly twice large relation mothers weight would expected another similarly sized extremely close correspondence fetal head maternal pelvic dimensions requires dimensions line points inlet midplane outlet birth delivery neonatal rotation occurs body gets rotated align head shoulders transversely entering small pelvis otherwise known internal rotation fetus rotates longitudinally exit birth canal known external rotation humans long axes inlet outlet obstetric canal lie perpendicular important mechanism growth size cranium well width shoulders makes difficult infant fit enables largest dimensions fetal head align largest dimensions plane maternal pelvis labor differs nonhuman primates need neonatal rotation nonhuman primates birth canal wide enough accommodate elaborate mechanism labor requires constant readjustment fetal head relation bony pelvis may vary somewhat depending shape pelvis question completely different obstetrical mechanics higher primates whose infants generally drop pelvis without rotation contrast narrow shoulders monkeys higher primates able pass birth canal without rotation modern humans broad rigid shoulders generally require series rotations head undergoes order travel due evolution bipedalism humans pelvis evolved shorter forward curved ilium broader sacrum order support ambulating two legs caused birth canal shrink form oval shape thus infant must undergo specific movements rotate certain position able pass pelvis movements referred seven cardinal movements infant rotates widest diameter pelvis allow narrowest aspect fetal body align narrowest diameter movements include engagement descent flexion internal rotation extension external rotation expulsion seven cardinal movements considered normal mechanism labor delivery human pelvic sizes shapes vary among female humans increase risk errors rotations delivery especially since movements done completely baby one biggest issues pelvic shape childbirth ischial spine since ischial spines support pelvic floor spines far apart lead weakened pelvic floor muscles cause issues pregnancy progresses difficulty carrying fetus full term another complication occur human childbirth shoulder dystocia shoulder stuck birth lead fractured humerus clavicle fetus hemorrhaging mother thus neonatal rotations important allowing baby safely pass pelvic ensure health mother well gestation length humans believed shorter primates comparable size gestation length humans days eight days short nine months counted first day womans last menstrual period gestation mothers must support metabolic cost tissue growth fetus mother well everincreasing metabolic rate growing comparative data across mammals primates suggest metabolic constraint large energetically expensive fetus grow must leave mothers thought shorter gestation period adaptation ensure survival mother child leads altriciality neonatal brain body size increased hominin lineage human maternal investment greater expected primate similar body obstetrical dilemma hypothesis suggests order successfully undergo childbirth infant must born earlier earlier thereby making child increasingly developmentally concept infant born underdeveloped called altriciality humans born underdeveloped brain brains fully developed birth opposed nonhuman primates infant born brain scientists believed shorter gestation period attributed narrower pelvis baby must born head reaches volume accommodated obstetric canal human infants also almost always born assistance humans way pelvis shaped since pelvis opening birth canal face backwards humans difficulty giving birth guide baby canal nonhuman primates seek seclusion giving birth need help due pelvis opening human infants depend parents much much longer humans spend lot time caring children develop whereas species stand born faster infant develops higher reproductive output female humans cost slow development infants humans reproduce relatively slowly phenomenon also known cooperative breeding humans born malleable fetal head fully developed infant exits soft spot crown infant allows head compressed order better fit birth canal without obstructing allows head develop birth cranium continue growing without affecting birthing process obstetrical dilemma hypothesis several challenges data collected analyzed several different fields study taken interest understanding human birth process human ancestor species studies shown higher brain growth rates happen earlier ontogeny previously challenges idea explanation obstetrical dilemma humans born underdeveloped brains brain growth rates largest early development brain size would increase premature birth would allow much larger head size growth already happened also suggested maternal pelvic dimensions sensitive ecological factors lot evidence linking body mass brain mass leading determination maternal metabolism key factor growth fetus maternal constraints could largely due thermal stress energy availability larger brain mass neonate corresponds energy needed sustain takes much energy mother brain fully develops womb maternal energy limiting factor infant grow much mother sustain also fetal size positively correlated maternal energy use thermal stress issue larger fetus mother suffer heat additional studies suggest factors may complicate obstetrical dilemma hypothesis one dietary shifts possibly due emergence agriculture due change diet well increase population density since agriculture developed people leads studies also done twins show pelvic size may due environment live another study disproves thought narrower hips optimized locomotion found late stone age population southern africa survived largely terrestrial mobility women uncharacteristically small body size large pelvic energetics gestation growth egg hypothesis offers direct challenge obstetrical dilemma hypothesis equating constraints gestation parturition energy restrictions mother shown studies using professional athletes pregnant women upper limitation amount energy woman produce causes deleterious effects approximately basal metabolic rate pregnancy growing brain mass length neonate correspond energy needed sustain results competing balance fetuss demand energy maternal ability meet demand approximately nine months gestation fetuss energy needs surpasses mothers energy limitation correlating average time newly born infant sustained breast milk efficient less energy demanding mechanism nutrient transfer mother additionally hypothesis demonstrates contrary obstetrical dilemma increased pelvic size would deleterious bipedalism studying running mechanics males females shown increased pelvic size related neither increased metabolic structural demand obstetrical dilemma hypothesis also challenged conceptually based new studies authors argue obstetrical dilemma hypothesis assumes human therefore hominid childbirth painful dangerous experience species assumption may fundamentally false many early analyses focused maternal death data primarily females europeandescent western europe united states century limited recent study covariation human pelvis shape stature head size reported said females large head possess birth canal better accommodate largeheaded neonates mothers large heads usually give birth neonates large heads therefore detected pattern covariation contributes ease
