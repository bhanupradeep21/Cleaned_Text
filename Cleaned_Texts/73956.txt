phantom pain perception individual experiences relating limb organ physically part body either removed never first place however phantom limb sensations also occur following nerve avulsion spinal cord injury phantom eye syndrome occur eye loss sensations recorded frequently following amputation arm leg may also occur following removal breast tooth internal organ phantom limb pain feeling pain absent limb portion limb pain sensation varies individual individual phantom limb sensation sensory phenomenon except pain felt absent limb portion limb known least amputees experience phantom sensations time lives experience level phantom pain feeling missing limb rest lives term phantom limb first coined american neurologist silas weir mitchell mitchell described thousands spirit limbs haunting many good soldiers every tormenting however french military surgeon ambroise paré recorded first documentation phantom limb pain reported patients long amputation made say still feel pain amputated phantom pain involves sensation pain part body removed onset phantom pain occur within first days amputation sensation may come go continuous sensation often affects part limb farthest body foot amputated leg body parts closer brain arm hand still experience similar sensations sensations smaller limbs digits toes fingers tend less severe sometimes sensation feels phantom part forced uncomfortable position sensations described shooting stabbing boring squeezing throbbing burning sensations described also still attached limbs following theory removing limb due trauma andor surgery long term everyday intensive movements pain level desires smashing limb overall sensations may triggered pressure remaining part limb emotional various types sensations may felt neurological basis mechanisms phantom limb pain derived experimental theories observations little known true mechanism causing phantom pains many theories highly overlap historically phantom pains thought originate neuromas located stump tip traumatic neuromas nontumor nerve injuries often arise surgeries result abnormal growth injured nerve fibers although stump neuromas contribute phantom pains sole cause patients congenital limb deficiency sometimes although rarely experience phantom pains suggests central representation limb responsible painful currently theories based altered neurological pathways cortical reorganization neuromas formed injured nerve endings stump site able fire abnormal action potentials historically thought main cause phantom limb pain although neuromas able contribute phantom pain pain completely eliminated peripheral nerves treated conduction blocking physical stimulation neuromas increase c fiber activity thus increasing phantom pain pain still persists neuromas ceased firing action potentials peripheral nervous system thought modulation effect phantom limb addition peripheral mechanisms spinal mechanisms thought influencing role phantom pains peripheral nerve injury lead degeneration c fibers dorsal horn spinal cord terminating fibers may subsequently branch occurs fiber inputs could reported noxious stimuli substance p involved transmission pain signals usually expressed aδ c fibers following peripheral nerve damage substance p expressed aβ leads hyperexcitability spinal cord usually occurs presence noxious stimuli patients complete spinal cord injury experienced phantom pains must underlying central mechanism responsible generation phantom pains ordinary circumstances genetically determined circuitry brain remains largely stable

incorporates conscious awareness oneself theory proposes conscious awareness perception self generated brain via patterns input modified different perceptual network genetically predetermined modified throughout one lifetime various sensory inputs create neurosignature neurosignature specific body part determines consciously input systems contributing neurosignature primarily somatosensory limbic thalamocortical systems neuromatrix theory aims explain certain activities associated pain lead conscious perception phantom pain persistence neurosignature even limb amputation may cause phantom sensations pain phantom pain may arise abnormal reorganization neuromatrix preexisting pain opposition neuromatrix theory exists largely fails explain relief phantom sensations rarely eliminates phantom pains also address sensations spontaneously end amputees experience phantom sensations addition major limitation neuromatrix theory broadly accounts various aspects phantom limb perception also likely difficult tested empirically especially testing painless phantom various methods used treat phantom limb pain doctors may prescribe medications reduce pain antidepressants antiepileptics shown beneficial effect reducing phantom limb pain often physical methods light massage electrical stimulation hot cold therapy used variable results many different treatment options phantom limb pain actively researched treatments take account mechanisms underlying phantom pains therefore ineffective however treatment options shown alleviate pain patients treatment options usually success rate less important note rate success exceed placebo effect also important note degree cortical reorganization proportional phantom limb pains perturbations amputated regions may increase pain mirror box
