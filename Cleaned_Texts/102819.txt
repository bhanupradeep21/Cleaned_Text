arterial blood pressure commonly measured via sphygmomanometer historically used height column mercury reflect circulating blood pressure values generally reported millimetres mercury mmhg though aneroid electronic devices contain mercury heartbeat blood pressure varies systolic diastolic pressures systolic pressure peak pressure arteries occurs near end cardiac cycle ventricles contracting
