otoacoustic emission oae sound generated within inner ear predicted austrian astrophysicist thomas gold existence first demonstrated experimentally british physicist david kemp otoacoustic emissions since shown arise number different cellular mechanical causes within inner studies shown oaes disappear inner ear damaged oaes often used laboratory clinic measure inner ear health broadly speaking two types otoacoustic emissions spontaneous otoacoustic emissions soaes occur without external stimulation evoked otoacoustic emissions eoaes require evoking stimulus oaes considered related amplification function cochlea absence external stimulation activity cochlear amplifier increases leading production sound several lines evidence suggest mammals outer hair cells elements enhance
