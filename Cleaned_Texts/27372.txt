identification successful identification individual requires comparing image individual database contains images many people however comparing image entirety pixel pixel would extremely slow expensive process solve problem biometrics used biometrics rather comparing entire image biometric points placed key locations measurements taken points results compiled score score easily obtained every image file stored database new individuals image obtained requirement successful identification system needs compile score based images biometrics compare new score scores easy task modern computer laptop
