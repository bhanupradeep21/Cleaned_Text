pleural empyema collection pus pleural cavity caused microorganisms usually often happens context pneumonia injury chest one various kinds pleural effusion three stages exudative increase pleural fluid without presence pus fibrinopurulent fibrous septa form localized pus pockets final organizing stage scarring pleura membranes possible inability lung expand simple pleural effusions occur bacterial pneumonias usually small resolve appropriate antibiotic therapy however empyema develops additional intervention required clinical presentation adult pediatric patient pleural empyema depends upon several factors including causative microorganism cases present setting pneumonia although one third patients clinical signs pneumonia many cases associated trauma including symptoms include fever dry cough sweating difficulty breathing unintentional weight elderly often classic symptoms instead anemia inflammation pleural space fluid produced greater level disease progresses

pediatric population almost always parapneumonic need chest tube drainage made clinical grounds british guidelines management pleural infection children recommend diagnostic pleural fluid blood sputum culture often already performed setting community acquired pneumonia needing hospitalization however noted microorganism responsible development empyema necessarily organism causing pneumonia especially adults already mentioned sensitivity pleural fluid culture generally low often partly due prior administration antibiotics shown culture yield increased pleural fluid injected blood culture bottles aerobic anaerobic immediately furthermore diagnostic rates improved specific pathogens using polymerase chain reaction antigen detection especially streptococcus pneumoniae streptococcus pyogenes staphylococcus aureus study including children pleural empyema causative microorganism could identified using direct culture fresh pleural fluid patients additional using pcr pleural fluid
