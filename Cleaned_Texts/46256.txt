interstellar space opera epic star wars uses science technology settings storylines series showcased many technological concepts movies expanded universe novels comics forms media star wars movies primary objective build upon drama philosophy political science less scientific knowledge many onscreen technologies created borrowed star wars universe used mainly plot devices iconic status star wars gained popular culture science fiction allows used accessible introduction real scientific concepts many features technologies used star wars universe yet considered possible despite concepts still probable past scientists thought planets would unlikely form around binary stars however recent simulations indicate planets likely form around binary star systems singlestar exoplanets currently known actually orbit binary star systems orbit multiple star systems three stars specifically orbit known wide binary star systems two stars fairly far apart several au tatooine appears type close binary stars close planets orbit common center mass first observationally confirmed binary close binary exoplanet researchers simulations indicate planets form frequently around close binaries though gravitational effects dual star system tend make difficult find current doppler transit methods planetary studies looking dusty planet formation binary stars disks found wide narrow binaries whose stars less au apart respectively intermediate binaries au dusty reported guardian nasa spacecraft kepler discovered planet named twin suns seen star wars certified astrophysicist star wars fan jeanne cavelos explains scientists skeptical likelihood binary star systems tatooine since gravity one star may prevent planets developing around two stars different masses orbiting one another would cause gravity fields shift causing potential instabilities orbits planets according even planets stable orbits binary star system would suffer kinds problems climatic problems example planet binary star system orbiting larger star would drawn closer gravitational field causing planet endure heat great temperatures period planet passes larger star reaches orbit smaller star gravitational field star would give planet distance distance perhaps along smaller solar projection star would send planet extreme frigid according cavelos astronomers hypothesize least two possible solutions problems exist even life supporting binary star systems could exist one scenario could two stars billions miles apart planet planets would able orbit one star minimum influence star known proxima centauri alpha centauri c one trillion miles away sister stars alpha centauri b also according cavelos astronomers believe proxima centauri could planets would minimally influenced proxima centauris sister stars due vast distance sister stars assuming existence planets around proxima centauri planets sister suns would appear bright stars another scenario would two stars would closer one another distance
