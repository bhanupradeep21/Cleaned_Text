max ludwig henning delbrück german maks ˈdɛlbʁʏk september march biophysicist participated launching molecular biology research program late stimulated physical scientists interest biology especially basic research physically explain genes mysterious time formed led delbrück along salvador luria alfred hershey phage group made substantial headway unraveling important aspects genetics three shared nobel prize physiology medicine discoveries concerning replication mechanism genetic structure first physicist predict called delbrück delbrück born berlin german empire mother granddaughter justus

justus died soviet custody year son tobias delbruck professor institute neuroinformatics university zurich eth professor tobias delbruck also one pioneers domain event increasingly deployed dynamic vision systems delbrück studied astrophysics shifting towards theoretical physics university göttingen completing phd traveled england denmark switzerland met wolfgang pauli niels bohr interested biology delbrück returned berlin assistant lise meitner collaborating otto hahn irradiation uranium neutrons delbrück wrote papers including one gamma rays scattering coulomb fields polarization vacuum though theoretically tenable conclusion misplaced whereas hans bethe years later confirmed phenomenon named delbrück delbrück published collaboration nikolay timofeevressovsky karl zimmer major work über die natur der genmutation und der genstruktur considered major advance understanding nature gene mutation gene work keystone formation molecular also inspirational starting point erwin schrödingers thinking course lectures eventual writing book life physical aspect living attained fellowship rockefeller launching molecular biology research research genetics fruit fly drosophila melanogaster california institute technologys biology delbrück could blend interests biochemistry caltech delbrück researched bacteria viruses bacteriophages phages emory l coauthored growth bacteriophage paper reporting viruses reproduce one step exponentially cellular organisms although delbrücks rockefeller foundation fellowship expired foundation matched vanderbilt university nashville tennessee taught physics yet laboratory biology delbrück met salvador luria indiana university began visiting delbrück luria published bacterial resistance virus infection mediated random alfred hershey washington university st louis began visiting experiment also called fluctuation test demonstrated darwins theory natural selection acting random mutations applies bacteria well complex organisms nobel prize physiology medicine awarded scientists part work put work historical perspective lamarck first presented theory inheritance acquired characteristics stated organism changes life order adapt environment example stretches neck reach tall trees changes passed offspring also said evolution happens according predetermined plan darwin published theory evolution book origin species compelling evidence contradicting lamarck darwin said evolution predetermined inherent variations organisms variations confer increased fitness selected environment passed offspring feud lamarck darwin darwin talked preexisting changes nature changes known await science genetics gregor mendels experiments pea plants published support darwins theory provided thomas hunt morgan discovered mutated whiteeyed fruit fly among redeyed flies able reproduce true whiteeyed offspring elegant convincing support darwins ideas however provided luriadelbruck showed mutations conferring resistance bacterium e coli bacteriophage virus existed population prior exposure induced adding words mutations random events occur whether prove useful selection resistance upon challenge case provides direction evolution retaining mutations advantageous discarding harmful sensitivity case experiment dealt blow lamarckian inheritance set stage tremendous advances genetics molecular biology launching tsunami research eventually led discovery dna hereditary material cracking genetic code course avery along mccloud earlier mccarty well way showing genetic capability dna delbrück luria hershey set course bacteriophage genetics cold spring harbor laboratory long island new phage group spurred molecular biologys early delbrück received nobel prize physiology medicine shared luria hershey discoveries concerning replication mechanism genetic structure committee also noted honour first place goes delbrück transformed bacteriophage research vague empiricism exact science analyzed defined conditions precise measurement biological effects together luria elaborated quantitative methods established statistical criteria evaluation made subsequent penetrating studies possible delbrücks lurias forte perhaps mainly theoretical analysis whereas hershey eminently skillful experimenter three supplement well also respects year delbrück luria also awarded columbia university louisa gross horwitz prize late vanderbilt lacked resources keep delbrück returned caltech professor biology remained rest meanwhile set university colognes institute molecular genetics addition nobel prize delbrück elected foreign member royal society formemrs elected embo member max delbruck prize formerly known biological physics prize awarded american physical society named honour max delbrück center

cellular dnas molecular structure double retired caltech remaining professor biology emeritus became interested behavioral sciences spent unfruitful effort mold behavior max delbrück died age evening monday march huntington memorial hospital pasadena california august year delbrück would turned friends gathered cold spring harbor laboratory reminisce life although delbrück held antireductionist views conjectured ultimately perhaps waveparticle duality revealed life view however later refuted upon discovery double helix structure
