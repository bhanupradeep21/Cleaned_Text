audio signal processing auditory masking occurs perception one sound affected presence another auditory masking frequency domain known simultaneous masking frequency masking spectral masking auditory masking time domain known temporal masking nonsimultaneous masking unmasked threshold quietest level signal perceived without masking signal present masked threshold quietest level signal perceived combined specific masking noise amount masking difference masked unmasked thresholds gelfand provides basic let us say given individual sound cat scratching post otherwise quiet environment first audible level db spl however presence masking noise example vacuum cleaner running simultaneously individual detect sound cat scratching unless level scratching sound least db spl would say unmasked threshold individual target sound ie cat scratching db spl masked threshold db spl amount masking simply difference two thresholds db amount masking vary depending characteristics target signal masker also specific individual listener person example able detect cat scratching db spl another person may able hear cat scratching vacuum sound level cat scratching increased db spl thereby making amount masking second listener db simultaneous masking occurs sound made inaudible noise unwanted sound duration original example powerful spike khz tend mask lowerlevel tone khz also two sine tones hz
