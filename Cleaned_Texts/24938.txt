originally titled salancik pfeffer stated individual perceptions attitudes behaviors shaped information cues values work requirements expectations social environment beyond influence individual dispositions later renamed social influence model start advent internet world wide web interest grew studying internet impacted ways people communicate joseph walther communication media theorist said computermediated communication cmc users adapt restricted medium use effectively develop close relationships walther understood describing new nature online communication required new social information processing theory focuses social processes occur two people engaged communication similar theories social presence theory social penetration theory uncertainty reduction theory makes sip different theories distinct focus communication mediated solely information communications technologies media theories exist media richness theory uses gratifications theory sip specifically focuses relationships entirely mediated unlike theories rooted theoretical perspectives various fields study eg communication accommodation theory sip conceptualized part addressing shortcomings theories addressed communication mediums theories termed cues filteredout cues filteredout theories refer theories address lack nonverbal cues detrimental online relationship development social information processing many theorists believed lack nonverbal cues would hinder process forming impressions communicating accurately found norms interactions would unclear via social networking sites moreover theorists believed communication blips would cause hostile communication create weak environment relationship walthers research critiqued past methodological conceptual problems theoretical thinking walther states often online communication feels cold impersonal yet ftf walther challenges past theorists stating yes online communication warm walther believes loss nonverbal cues inherently fatal defining impression others unlike previous theorists subsequently worked toward establishing interpersonal communication theory accurately reflected intersection among communication online environments self relationships two theoretical perspectives influenced walthers theory social presence theory spt media richness theory mrt walther believes spt mrt suffer limited understanding relational life online argues interactants communicate enough times sufficient breadth depth nonverbal communication remain paramount relationship one important aspects online interaction presentation self tory higgins developed selfdiscrepancy theory described three main forms self actual self ideal self ought self actual self set qualities characteristics person actually possesses ideal self contains attributes person hopes someday achieve ought self contains attributes person believes higgins also explored inconsistencies found associated emotional discomforts eg fear threat restlessnessclarification needed carl rogers posited another form self one concerned future like ideal ought self called true self present form self exists psychologically always fully expressed within social settings like actual bargh mckenna fitzsimons conducted experiment test actual self true self expressed people facetoface computermediated interactions bargh et al found actual self accessible following initial facetoface interaction true self accessible following initial interaction online results study researchers concluded people tend like better meet online instead meeting selves manifested particular importance online conversations relationships allowing individual manage online persona social information processing researchers like joseph walther intrigued identities managed online relationships able move one superficiality one intimacy three assumptions related sip theory listed first assumption rests premise computermediated communication unique opportunity build interpersonal relationships others cmc systems vast almost always textbased identified organic setting synchronous asynchronous cmc clearly different facetoface communication offers unparalleled opportunity meet someone would usually never meet facetoface ftf moreover relationships established via cmc systems also prompt emotions feelings find finally since cmc systems available around globe uniqueness able cultivate online relationships someone far away ignored walther suggests hyperpersonal communication improve relationships groups history walther notes visual identifiers like turbans race need visible hyper personal interactions turn may promote identification similarities however walther notes online communication magical cure intergroup second assumption alludes impression management essential online relationships participants undertake efforts ensure particular impressions social networking sites sns like facebook people wish provide image ideal self called selective self presentation process people put together profile makes appear desirable turn making third assumption sip states different rates information exchange information accrual affect relationship development sip theory suggests although messages verbalclarification needed communicators adapt restrictions online medium look cues messages others modify language extent words compensate lack nonverbal cues third assumption reflects walthers contention given sufficient time accrual messages online relationships capacity become intimate established facetoface addition online comments usually delivered rather quickly efficiently messages build time provide online participants sufficient information begin develop interpersonal relationships social information processing theory describes computermediated communication process including three phases impersonal interpersonal finally impersonal phase due lack nonverbal cues cmc believed taskoriented traditional facetoface communication since content influenced social emotional influence avoid overly personal interpersonal interaction promote rationality providing essential discipline facilitate efficiency group work getting rid peer pressure hierarchy ultimately create democratic atmosphere within interpersonal phase nonverbal cues lean communication time increases exchange social information increases accordingly anticipation future communication may cause communicators look information mechanism leads similar immediacy similarity composure receptivity ftf communication hyperpersonal phase sender uses process selective selfpresentation people meet online better opportunity make favorable impression communicators decide information would like share controlling selfpresentations giving power disclose good traits sip core impression management communication scholars define impression management either strategic unconscious effort influence anothers perception much earlier research impression management focused ftf communication nuances meeting persons selfimage viewed important relational development later applications impression management undertaken online communication selective selfpresentation likely occur ftf communication cmc due ability observe obvious traits walther notes selective selfpresentation process probably much involved people put together due fact cmc people want found attractive present best image whereas ftf communication undesirable traits readily detected receivers may idealize senders based making attributions available paralingual cues found message process enhanced asynchronous exchanges letting sender receiver ample time consider messages sent received absence ftf contextual cues likelihood overattributing given information sender increased often creating idealized image message sender example overattribution also found online dating reading perspective dates profile reader likely see similar one another therefore become interested originally would finally feedback process addresses reciprocal influence senders receivers develop impressions intimacy result interaction hyperpersonal perspective saying online relationship intimate walther examines hyperpersonal relationships intimate partners physically walther number different scholarly venues articulated complexity scholars elucidate four components

hyperpersonal perspective attribution attributions evaluations judgements make based actions behaviors others receiver tends attribute according theory may overattribute means receiver likely think

forget relationship sender based words asynchronous nature cmc allows online participants think texts emails sending prior sending messages one rewrite clarity sense relevance online asynchronous experiences allow optimal desirable communication ensuring messages high quality walther contends relational affection desirable communicator editing message composition walther interprets feedback
