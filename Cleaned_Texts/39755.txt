concave one fish vision shows evolutionary adaptation visual environment example deep sea fish eyes suited dark environment fish aquatic animals live different light environment terrestrial species water absorbs light increasing depth amount light available decreases quickly optical properties water also lead different wavelengths light absorbed different degrees example visible light long wavelengths eg red orange absorbed water light shorter wavelengths green blue ultraviolet light even shorter wavelength violet penetrate deeper visual besides universal qualities water different bodies water may absorb light different wavelengths due varying salt andor chemical presence water water effective absorbing incoming light amount light penetrating ocean declines rapidly attenuated
