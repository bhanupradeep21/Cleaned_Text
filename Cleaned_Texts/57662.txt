chest tube related pain goes away chest tube removed however chronic pain related chest tube induced scarring intercostal space uncommoncitation needed subcutaneous emphysema indicates backpressure

distance markers along length tube radiopaque stripe outlines first drainage chest tubes also provided right angle trocar flared tapered configurations different drainage needs well chest tubes coated heparin help prevent thrombus formation though effect chest tube end hole proximal toward patient series side holes number side holes generally chest tubes length tube side holes effective drainage length edl chest tubes designed pediatric heart surgery edl shorter generally side channel style chest drains also called blake drains socalled silastic drains made silicone feature open flutes reside inside patient drainage thought achieved capillary action allowing fluids travel open grooves closed cross section contains fluid allows suctioned though chest tubes expensive conventional ones theoretically less chest drainage system typically used collect chest drainage air blood effusions commonly drainage systems use three chambers based threebottle system first chamber allows fluid drained chest collected second chamber functions water seal acts one way valve allowing gas escape reenter chest air bubbling water seal chamber usual patient coughs exhales may indicate continual pleural system leak evaluated critically also indicate leak air lung third chamber suction control chamber height water chamber regulates negative pressure applied system gentle bubbling water column minimizes evaporation fluid indicates suction regulated height water column way increased wall suction increase negative pressure system newer drainage systems eliminate water seal using mechanical checkvalve also use mechanical regulator regulate suction pressure systems employ dubbed dry systems whereas systems retain water seal use mechanical regulator called wetdry systems systems use water seal water column regulator called wet systems dry systems advantageous tipovers wet systems spill mix blood mandating replacement system even newer systems smaller ambulatory patient sent home drainage free end tube usually attached underwater seal level chest allows air fluid escape pleural space prevents anything returning chest alternatively tube attached flutter valve allows patients pneumothorax remain recently digital electronic chest drainage systems introduced onboard motor used vacuum source along integrated suction control canister water seal systems monitor patient alert

iatrogenic lung injury placement using seldinger technique blunt guidewire passed needle chest tube inserted described protocols maintain chest tube patency preventing chest tube clogging necessary placement technique postoperative drainage eg cardiac surgery differs technique used emergency situations completion open cardiac procedures chest tubes placed separate stab incisions typically near

sutured skin prevent movement chest tube connected drainage canister using additional tubing connectors connected suction source typically regulated cm suturing dressings applied hygienical reasons covering wound first yslit compress used around tube second compress x cm placed top finally adhesive plaster added way tension avoided bridle rein recommended fix tube skin tape bridge prevent tube moving backwards possibility cause clogging also prevents pain reduces tension fixation stitch alternatively large adhesive plaster functions like tape bridge may chest tubes kept free dependent loops kinks obstructions may prevent general chest tubes clamped except insertion removal diagnosing air leakscitation needed chest tube clogging blood clots fibrinous material common occurs result retained blood around heart lungs lead complications hematoma needs drained effusions empyema long term fibrothorax thus critical maintain chest tube patency manual manipulation often called milking stripping fan folding tapping chest tubes commonly performed clear chest tube obstructions however approaches controversial conclusive evidence demonstrated techniques effective others method shown improve chest tube furthermore chest tube manipulation proved increase negative pressure may detrimental painful reasons many hospitals allow types manual tube one option active chest tube clearance without
