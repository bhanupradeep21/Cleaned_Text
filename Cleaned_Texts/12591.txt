minimaze procedures cardiac surgery procedures intended cure atrial fibrillation af common disturbance heart rhythm procedures derived original maze procedure developed james cox md james cox md associates developed maze cox maze procedure openheart cardiac surgery procedure intended eliminate atrial fibrillation performed first one maze refers series incisions arranged mazelike pattern atria intention eliminate af using incisional scars block abnormal electrical circuits atrial macroreentry af requires required extensive series endocardial inside heart incisions atria median sternotomy vertical incision breastbone cardiopulmonary bypass heartlung machine extracorporeal circulation series improvements made culminating cox maze iii procedure considered gold standard effective surgical cure af quite successful eliminating af drawbacks cox maze iii sometimes referred traditional maze cut sew maze simply mazecitation needed efforts since made equal success cox maze iii reducing surgical complexity likelihood complications late operations similar cox maze fewer atrial incisions led use terms minimaze mini maze although still major operations primary goal perform curative mazelike procedure epicardially outside heart could performed normally beating heart without cardiopulmonary bypass recently thought possible recently dr cox defined minimaze requiring endocardial approachcitation needed summary would appear placing following lesions cure patients atrial fibrillation either type pulmonary vein encircling incision left atrial isthmus lesion attendant coronary sinus lesion right atrial isthmus lesion call pattern atrial lesions minimaze procedure none present energy cryotherapy unipolar radiofrequency irrigated radiofrequency bipolar radiofrequency microwave laser capable creating left atrial isthmus lesion epicardial surface necessity penetrating circumflex coronary artery reach left atrial wall near posterior mitral annulus therefore minimaze procedure performed epicardially means presently available energy although dr coxs definition specifically excludes epicardial approach eliminate af others pursued important goal meaning term changed successful epicardial procedures developed saltman performed completely endoscopic surgical ablation subsequently published results performed epicardially beating heart without cardiopulmonary bypass median sternotomy method came known minimaze microwave minimaze procedure microwave energy used make lesions previously performed surgeons scalpel shortly thereafter randall k wolf md others developed procedure using radiofrequency energy rather microwave different slightly larger incisions published results first came known wolf minimaze procedurecitation needed today terms minimaze minimaze mini maze still sometimes used describe open heart procedures requiring cardiopulmonary bypass median sternotomy commonly refer minimally invasive epicardial procedures requiring cardiopulmonary bypass developed saltman wolf others procedures characterized completely endoscopic microwave ablation atrial fibrillation beating heart using bilateral thoracoscopy microwave minimaze requires three mm cm incisions side chest surgical tools endoscope pericardium entered two sterile rubber tubes threaded behind heart transverse oblique sinuses tubes joined used guide flexible microwave antenna energy source sinuses behind heart position ablation energy delivered atrial tissue heated destroyed series steps microwave antenna withdrawn behind heart lesions form boxlike pattern around four pulmonary veins behind heart left atrial appendage usually videoassisted bilateral epicardial bipolar radiofrequency pulmonary vein isolation left atrial appendage excision wolf minimaze requires one cm two cm incisions side chest incisions allow surgeon maneuver tools view areas endoscope see heart directly right side left atrium exposed first clamplike tool positioned left atrium near right pulmonary veins atrial tissue heated jaws clamp cauterizing area clamp removed autonomic nerves ganglionated plexi may cause may eliminated well subsequently left side chest entered ligament marshall vestigial structure marked autonomic activity removed clamp subsequently positioned left atrium near left pulmonary veins ablation direct testing demonstrate complete electrical isolation pulmonary veins ganglionated plexi longer active may surgical ablation atrial fibrillation offpump epicardial highintensity focused ultrasound although hifu minimaze performed epicardially normally beating heart also usually performed conjunction cardiac surgery would minimally invasive cases ultrasonic device positioned epicardially left atrium around pulmonary veins intense acoustic energy directed atrium destroy tissue appropriate regions near pulmonary mechanism af eliminated curative procedures maze minimaze catheter ablation controversial successful methods destroy tissue areas left atrium near junction pulmonary veins hence regions thought important concept gaining support paroxysmal af mediated part autonomic nervous intrinsic cardiac nervous system located regions plays important supporting finding targeting autonomic sites improves likelihood successful elimination af catheter minimaze procedures alternatives catheter ablation af patient selection criteria similar patients considered minimaze procedures moderate severe symptoms failed medical therapy asymptomatic patients generally considered likely good outcome paroxysmal intermittent af heart relatively normal severely enlarged marked cardiomyopathy severely leaking heart valves less likely successful result procedures generally recommended patients previous cardiac surgery provides technical challenges due scarring outside heart always preclude minimaze surgerycitation needed longterm success minimaze procedures awaits consensus attaining consensus hindered several problems perhaps important incomplete inconsistent postprocedure followup determine atrial fibrillation recurred although many reasons clearly demonstrated longer intensive followup identifies much recurrent atrial hence procedure careful followup appear less successful addition procedures continue evolve rapidly long followup data accurately reflect current procedural methods recent minimaze procedures relatively small preliminary reports available caveats mind said reported shortterm freedom atrial fibrillation following radiofrequency wolf procedure ranges longerterm results similar range limited primarily patients paroxysmal
