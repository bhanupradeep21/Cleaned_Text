bioleaching extraction liberation metals ores use living organisms bioleaching one several applications within biohydrometallurgy several methods used treat ores concentrates containing copper zinc lead arsenic antimony nickel molybdenum gold silver cobalt bioleaching falls two broad categories first use microorganisms oxidize refractory minerals release valuable metals gold silver commonly minerals target oxidization pyrite arsenopyrite second category leaching sulphide minerals release associated metal example leaching pentlandite release nickel leaching chalcocite covellite chalcopyrite release copper bioleaching involve numerous ferrous iron sulfur oxidizing bacteria including acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans formerly known thiobacillus ferrooxidans acidithiobacillus
