pistia genus aquatic plants arum family araceae sole genus tribe pistieae reflects systematic isolation within single species comprises pistia stratiotes often called water cabbage water lettuce nile cabbage shellflower native distribution uncertain probably pantropical first discovered nile near lake victoria present either naturally human introduction nearly tropical subtropical fresh waterways considered invasive species well mosquito breeding habitat genus name derived greek word πιστός pistos meaning water refers aquatic nature specific epithet also derived greek word στρατιώτης meaning soldier references swordshaped leaves plants stratiotes pistia stratiotes perennial monocotyledon thick soft leaves form floats surface water roots hanging submersed beneath floating leaves leaves measure cm long light green parallel venations wavy surface leaves covered short white hairs form basketlike structures trap air bubbles increase plants buoyancy spongy parenchyma large intercellular spaces leaves also aids plant flowers dioecious lack petals hidden middle plant amongst leaves pistia stratiotes spadix inflorescence containing one pistillate flower one ovary staminate flowers two pistillate carpellate flowers separated folds spathe male flowers located female oval green berries ovoid seeds form successful fertilization plant undergoes asexual reproduction propagating stolons yet evidence sexual reproduction also observed ponds southern pistia stratiotes found slowmoving rivers lakes ponds species displays optimal growth temperature range endure extreme temperatures result pistia stratiotes grow colder temperatures beyond tropics cancer capricorn species also require slightly acidic water ph range optimal water lettuce among worlds productive freshwater aquatic plants considered invasive species introduced new areas water dispersal fragmentation hitchhiking marine transportation fishing invasion pistia stratiotes ecosystem lead environmental socioeconomic ramifications community serves waters high nutrient content particularly contaminated human loading sewage fertilizers water lettuce exhibit weedy overgrowth may also become invasive hydrologically altered systems flood control canals severe overgrowth water lettuce block gas exchange surface water creating hypoxic conditions eliminating disrupting various native marine blocking access sunlight large mats water lettuce shade native submerged plants alter communities relying native plants source growth mats also get tangled boat propellers create challenges boaters recreational pistia stratiotes feature life cycles certain insect vectors malaria mosquitoes genus mansonia lay eggs leaves aquatic plants pistia stratiotes twentyfour hours later emerging larvae attach plants roots using siphon tube respiration within week larvae develop adult mosquitos making pistia stratiotes potential breeding ground vectors infectious moth samea multiplicalis also uses pistia stratiotes primary host plant eggs laid among leaves stems host plant larvae hatch feed intensively center origin pistia stratiotes remains however plant thought native south america described egyptian hieroglyphics reported greek botanists dioscorides theophrastus nile river plant suggests african addition coevolution pistia stratiotes various insects native brazil argentina water lettuce weevil proposes south american common aquatic plant southeastern united states particularly florida recent argument nativity florida notes recorded botanist william bartram st johns river basin fossil specimens dating back late pleistocene bp early holocene bp period reported yet rationale southeastern north american nativity remains controversial disagreeing botanists claim spanish may indirectly introduced plant floridas basins ship pistialike plants appear fossil record late cretaceous epoch rock strata western interior north america first described corrugata leo lesquereux based specimens almond formation wyoming late campanian age however based complete specimens campanian dinosaur park formation southern alberta canada areas redescribed separate genus primarily due differences leaf

cast doubt claim pistia stratiotes native southeastern united considered edible pistia stratiotes palatable rich calcium oxalate crystals bitter taste nevertheless records plant utilized famine food india great famine hausa people nigeria utilized ash plant substitute salt due high concentration potassium chloride mineral salt substitute also called zakankau high importance especially imported salt caution advised consuming pistia stratiotes plant hyperaccumulator absorb accumulate toxic heavy metals present presence high concentrations calcium oxalate crystals induce various health concerns inhibited mineral absorption kidney singapore southern china pistia stratiotes commonly grown collected animal feed ducks water lettuce also considered alternative poultry feed indonesia due high content crude various medical uses pistia stratiotes throughout regions asia africa nigeria dried leaves prepared powder form applied wounds sores similar use present indian traditional medicine powdered leaf applied syphilitic eruptions skin nigeria gambia leaf infused water create eyewash treat allergic eyewash known cooling analgesic effect therefore plant commonly called eyepity addition leaves pistia stratiotes burned ash indian nigerian traditional medicine ash used treating ringworm infections high sorption property water lettuce makes great candidate biodegradable oil sorbents marine oil spills particularly leaves pistia stratiotes efficiently absorb significant amounts hydrocarbons due large surface area hyperaccumulator pistia stratiotes studied potential candidate wastewater treatment plants roots leaves plant found absorb excess nutrients heavy metals zinc chromium cadmium contaminated pistia stratiotes grown water gardens reduce harmful algal blooms eutrophic plant able control growth algae restricting light penetration water column competing nutrients significant uptake phosphorus ammonia httpsenwikipediaorgwikipistia
