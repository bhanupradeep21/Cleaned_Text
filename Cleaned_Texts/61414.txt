dna origami nanoscale folding dna create arbitrary two threedimensional shapes nanoscale specificity interactions complementary base pairs make dna useful construction material design base dna wellunderstood material suitable creating scaffolds hold molecules place create structures dna origami cover story nature march since dna origami progressed past art form found number applications drug delivery systems uses circuitry plasmonic devices however commercial applications remain concept testing idea using dna construction material first introduced early nadrian current method dna origami developed paul rothemund california institute process involves folding long single strand viral dna typically bp genomic dna bacteriophage aided multiple smaller staple strands shorter strands bind longer various places resulting formation predefined two threedimensional examples include smiley face coarse map china americas along many threedimensional structures produce desired shape images drawn raster fill single long dna molecule design fed computer program calculates placement individual staple strands staple binds specific region dna template thus due watsoncrick base pairing necessary sequences staple strands known displayed dna mixed heated cooled dna cools various staples pull long strand desired shape designs directly observable via several methods including electron microscopy atomic force microscopy fluorescence microscopy dna coupled fluorescent bottomup selfassembly methods considered promising alternatives offer cheap parallel synthesis nanostructures relatively mild conditions since creation method software developed assist process using cad software allows researchers use computer determine way create correct staples needed form certain shape one software called cadnano open source software creating structures dna use software increased ease process also drastically reduced errors made manual many potential applications suggested literature
