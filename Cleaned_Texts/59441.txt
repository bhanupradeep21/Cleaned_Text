epineurial repair common surgical procedure repair nerve laceration via epineurium connective tissue surrounding nerve fibers originating spinal cord intended allow restoration sensory function nerve lacerated cut repair done sewing cut ends together epineurium increase potential proximal part growing correctly along route degrading distal part leaves behind usual sensation mobility immediate result nerves grow rate approximately millimeter per day take months notice final research use nerve grafts nerve growth factors done speed recovery time nerve injury continuity results axonal function nonexistent structure connective tissue preserved severe nerve injury like axonotmesis neurotmesis warrant repair epineurium connective tissue damaged epineurium preserved nerve injury continuity definition severity injury varies amount connective tissue typical indications surgery patient presented laceration conduction along axon signal transmitted across nerve recover within week numbness paralysis varies depending amount functional loss due axonal interruption lack signal sent brain across gap caused laceration procedure applied nerve procedure used repair differentsized fascicles nongrouped fascicles compared group fascicular perinuerial repaircitation needed glial scars detrimental effects neuronal regrowth aide restoration sensory function astrocytes form barrier preventing growth forming gap junctions along producing molecules chemically prevent axon extensioncitation needed tension rejoined nerve may stretch epineurium rip two parts even tension along sutured joint necessary even repaircitation needed results gaining motor function guarantee results amount scarring size gap influences results repair larger gap less likelihood recovery axon would grow astrocytes could develop longer length time takes grow shorter gap order reduce length time regeneration research conducted speed regeneration nerve grafts stem cells detailed descriptions epineural repair focus removal scar apposition healthy citations needed removal scarred nerve tissue nerve freed surrounding soft tissues course may shifted allow free ends meet easily initial sutures placed opposite sides joint epineurium slightly subepineurial neural structure anchor two nerves together suturing continues degrees initial suture position lateral sutures reversed expose opposite side sutured way glue used place sutures limit scarring resulting better axonal growth speed surgery needed bend body part position bring nerve ends together patient instructed maintain position days order disrupt length efficiency recovery depended regenerative process may require months length nerve site injury influences recovery time avoid tension recovery generally days minimizing movement nerve may reduce risk regaining motor function intended result typical axon regrowth amounts approximately millimeter per day signs recovery may present quickly thought due socalled pioneer axons

used avoid tension proximal distal ends reduce likelihood postoperative distraction nerve graft percent longer gap nerves crosssection nerve end quite larger diameter nerve graft allow growth use harvested nerve grafts donor nerve provider contain schwann cells basal lamina endoneurial tubes provide growth factors surfaces molecules regenerate sensory loss scarring neuroma formation cause morbidity donor site patient nerve harvested therefore alloplastic nerve graft research conducted nerve repair silicone used previously longterm use tubes produces compression decreased conduction requiring surgery remove tube conduits made polyglycolic acid bioabsorbable substance used dissolvable sutures reduce problems associated silicone eliminate problems associated nerve grafts taken donors study nerve repair comparing nerve grafts polyglycolic acid conduits statistical differences discrimination showed conduit group better eliminating donorsite morbidity result nerve tissue loss associated severe nerve injuries sensory motor neurons calculated experiments use nerve grafts schwann cells form myelin insulation nerve allow better conduction along axon around nerve fibers secrete growth factors play major role regeneration process cells align provide directional support regrowth axons injury possibly increase level secretion growth factors modified genetically time needed grow
