sequential hermaphroditism called dichogamy botany one two types hermaphroditism type simultaneous hermaphroditism occurs organisms sex changes point particular sequential hermaphrodite produces eggs female gametes sperm male gametes different stages sequential hermaphroditism occurs many fish gastropods plants species undergo changes normal event within reproductive cycle usually cued either social structure achievement certain age species fish sequential hermaphroditism much common simultaneous animals different types change male female protandry protandrous hermaphroditism female male protogyny protogynous bidirectional serial bidirectional protogynous protandrous hermaphroditism allow organism switch functional male functional bidirectional hermaphrodites capacity sex change either direction male female female male potentially repeatedly various types sequential hermaphroditism may indicate advantage based original sex individual change gonadal sex female male germ cells gonads change one complete gonadal type last life plants individual flowers called dichogamous function two sexes separated time although plant whole may functionally male functionally female flowers

sequential hermaphroditism general protandrous hermaphrodites animals develop males later reproduce however protandry features spectrum different forms characterized overlap male female reproductive function throughout organisms lifetime furthermore also species reproduce sexes throughout lifespans ie simultaneous hermaphrodites shift reproductive resources male female protandry occurs widespread range animal fact protandrous hermaphroditism occurs many completely absent terrestrial protandrous fishes include teleost species families pomacentridae sparidae common example protandrous species clownfish structured society amphiprion percula species zero four individuals excluded breeding breeding pair living sea anemone dominance based size female largest reproductive male second largest rest group made progressively smaller males breed functioning female dies many cases reproductive male gains weight becomes female group largest nonbreeding male sexually matures becomes reproductive male protandrous fishes found classes clupeiformes siluriformes stomiiformes since groups distantly related many intermediate relatives protandrous strongly suggests protandry evolved multiple phylogenies support assumption ancestral states differ family example ancestral state family pomacentridae gonochoristic singlesexed indicating protandry evolved within therefore families also contain protandrous species protandry likely evolved multiple times examples protandrous animals include protogynous hermaphrodites animals born female point lifespan change sex protogyny common form sequential hermaphroditism fish especially compared animal ages shifts sex become male animal due internal external triggers unlike females male fecundity increases greatly age hypothesized selectively advantageous male organisms body advantage may cause certain species protogynous hermaphrodites sex change male leads increased reproductive fitness protogyny common form hermaphroditism fish known sequentially hermaphroditic fish species protogynous often polygynous mating systems large males use aggressive territorial defense dominate female mating causes small males severe reproductive disadvantage promotes strong selection sizebased therefore individual small reproductively advantageous female still able reproduce unlike small males common model organisms type

males compete larger territorial botryllus schlosseri colonial tunicate protogynous hermaphrodite colony eggs released two days peak sperm although selffertilization avoided crossfertilization favored strategy selffertilization still possible selffertilized eggs develop substantially higher frequency anomalies cleavage crossfertilized eggs vs also significantly lower percentage larvae derived selffertilized eggs metamorphose growth colonies derived metamorphosis significantly lower findings suggest selffertilization gives rise inbreeding depression associated developmental deficits likely caused expression deleterious recessive examples protogynous organisms include ultimate cause biological event determines event makes organisms better adapted environment thus evolution natural selection produced event large number ultimate causes hermaphroditism proposed two causes relevant sequential hermaphroditism sizeadvantage protection sizeadvantage model states individuals given sex reproduce effectively certain size age create selection sequential hermaphroditism small individuals must higher reproductive fitness one sex larger individuals must higher reproductive fitness opposite sex example eggs larger sperm thus larger individuals able make eggs individuals could maximize reproductive potential beginning life male turning female upon achieving certain ectotherms body size female fecundity positively supports sizeadvantage model kazancioglu alonzo performed first comparative analysis sex change labridae analysis supports sizeadvantage model suggest sequential hermaphroditism correlated sizeadvantage determined dioecy less likely occur size advantage stronger warner suggests selection protandry may occur populations female fecundity augmented age individuals mate randomly selection protogyny may occur traits population depress male fecundity early ages territoriality mate selection inexperience female fecundity decreased age latter seems rare example territoriality favoring protogyny occurs need protect habitat large male advantageous purpose mating aspect large male higher chance mating effect female mating thus suggests female fecundity impact sequential hermaphroditism age structures sizeadvantage model predicts sex change would absent relationship sizeage reproductive potential identical sexes prediction one would assume hermaphroditism common case sequential hermaphroditism rare according scientists due cost decreases fitness sex changers opposed change sex hypotheses proposed dearth hermaphrodites energetic cost sex change genetic andor physiological barriers sex change sexspecific mortality kazanciglu alonzo found dioecy favored cost changing sex large indicates cost sex change explain rarity sequential hermaphroditism sequential hermaphroditism also protect inbreeding populations organisms low enough motility andor sparsely distributed enough considerable risk siblings encountering reaching sexual maturity interbreeding siblings similar ages begin life one sex transition sex age siblings highly likely sex given time dramatically reduce likelihood inbreeding protandry protogyny known help prevent inbreeding many examples sequential hermaphroditism attributable inbreeding prevention identified wide variety proximate cause biological event concerns molecular physiological mechanisms produce event many studies focused proximate causes sequential hermaphroditism may caused various hormonal enzyme changes organisms role aromatase widely studied area aromatase enzyme controls androgenestrogen ratio animals catalyzing conversion testosterone oestradiol irreversible discovered aromatase pathway mediates sex change directions many studies also involve understanding effect aromatase inhibitors sex change one study performed kobayashi et al study tested role estrogens male threespot wrasses halichoeres trimaculatus discovered fish treated aromatase inhibitors showed decreased gonodal weight plasma estrogen level spermatogonial proliferation testis well increased androgen levels results suggest estrogens important regulation spermatogenesis protogynous previous studies also investigated sex reversal mechanisms teleost fish sex reversal whole gonads including germinal epithelium undergoes significant changes remodeling reformation one study teleost synbranchus marmoratus found metalloproteinases mmps involved gonadal remodeling process ovaries degenerated slowly replaced germinal male tissue particular action mmps induced significant changes interstitial gonadal tissue allowing reorganization germinal epithelial tissue study also found sex steroids help sex reversal process synthesized leydig cells replicate differentiate thus synthesis sex steroids coincides gonadal remodeling triggered mmps produced germinal epithelial tissue results suggests mmps changes steroid levels play large role sequential hermaphroditism sequential hermaphrodites almost always sex ratio biased towards birth sex consequently experience significantly reproductive success switching sexes according population genetics theory decrease genetic diversity effective population size ne however study two ecologically similar santer sea bream gonochoric slinger sea bream protogynous south african waters found genetic diversities similar two species ne lower instant sexchanger similar relatively short time ability organisms change biological sex allowed better reproductive success based ability certain genes pass easily generation

rare less recorded cases plant species entirely change patchy environment model size dependent sex allocation two environmental factors drive sequential hermaphroditism plants patchy environment model states plants want maximize use resources change sex example plant benefit resources given environment certain sex want change sex furthermore size dependent sex allocation outlines sequential hermaphroditic plants preferable change sexes way maximizes overall fitness compared size similar maximizing use resources combination size fitness certain sex beneficial plant want change sex evolutionarily sequential hermaphrodites emerged certain species found one best ways maximize benefits environment changing sex arisaema plant genus commonly cited exercising sequential hermaphroditism commonly known arisaema plant arisaema triphyllum jack pulpit triphyllum grows changes develops nonsexual juvenile plant young allmale plant maleandfemale plant allfemale plant means triphyllum changing sex male female course lifetime size increases showcasing size dependent sex allocation another example arisaema dracontium green dragon change sex yearly dracontiums sex also dependent size smaller flowers male larger flowers male female typically arisaema species small flowers contain stamens meaning males larger flowers contain stamen pistils pistils meaning either

possible producing offspring ultimately dies damage sickness context plant sexuality flowering plants angiosperms two forms dichogamy function precedes male function precedes female function examples include asteraceae bisexual tubular disks florets usually protandrous whereas acacia banksia flowers protogynous style female flower elongating male phase shedding pollen historically dichogamy regarded mechanism reducing however survey angiosperms found selfincompatible si plants incapable inbreeding likely dichogamous selfcompatible sc finding led reinterpretation dichogamy general mechanism reducing impact pollenpistil interference pollen import unlike inbreeding avoidance hypothesis focused female function interferenceavoidance hypothesis considers reproductive functions many hermaphroditic species close physical proximity anthers stigma makes interference unavoidable either within flower flowers inflorescence withinflower interference occurs either pistil interrupts pollen removal anthers prevent pollen deposition result autonomous facilitated betweenflower interference results similar mechanisms except interfering structures occur different flowers within inflorescence requires pollinator activity results geitonogamous pollination transfer pollen flowers contrast withinflower interference geitonogamy necessarily involves processes outcrossing pollinator attraction reward provisioning pollen removal therefore betweenflower interference carries cost selffertilization inbreeding also reduces amount pollen available export socalled pollen pollen discounting diminishes outcross siring success interference avoidance may important evolutionary force floral dichogamy may reduce betweenflower interference reducing eliminating temporal overlap stigma anthers within inflorescence large inflorescences attract pollinators potentially enhancing reproductive success increasing pollen import however large inflorescences also increase opportunities geitonogamy pollen discounting opportunity betweenflower interference increases inflorescence consequently evolution floral display size may represent compromise maximizing pollinator visitation minimizing geitonogamy pollen discounting barrett et al protandry may particularly relevant compromise often results inflorescence structure female phase flowers positioned male phase given tendency many insect pollinators forage upwards protandry may enhance pollen export reducing betweenflower furthermore enhanced pollen export increase floral display size increases betweenflower interference increase floral display size effects protandry betweenflower interference may decouple benefits large inflorescences consequences geitonogamy pollen discounting decoupling would provide significant reproductive advantage increased pollinator visitation siring success harder et al demonstrated experimentally dichogamy reduced rates selffertilization enhanced outcross siring success reductions geitonogamy pollen discounting routley husband examined influence inflorescence size siring advantage found bimodal distribution increased siring success small large display length stigmatic receptivity plays key role regulating isolation male female stages dichogamous plants stigmatic receptivity influenced temperature another study jersakova johnson studied effects protandry
