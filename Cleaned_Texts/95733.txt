information processing theory approach study cognitive development evolved american experimental tradition psychology developmental psychologists adopt information processing perspective account mental development terms maturational changes basic components childs mind theory based idea humans process information receive rather merely responding stimuli perspective uses analogy consider mind works like computer way mind functions like biological computer responsible analyzing information environment according standard informationprocessing model mental development minds machinery includes attention mechanisms bringing information working memory actively manipulating information longterm memory passively holding information used theory addresses children grow brains likewise mature leading advances ability process respond information received senses theory emphasizes continuous pattern development contrast cognitivedevelopmental theorists jean piagets theory cognitive development thought development occurs stages time information processing theory simplified comparing human brain computer basic processor theorized brain works set sequence computer sequence goes follows receives input processes information delivers output theory suggests humans process information similar way like computer receives input mind receive information senses information focused move shortterm memory shortterm memory working memory mind able use information address surroundings information encoded longterm memory information stored information retrieved necessary using central executive central executive understood conscious mind central executive pull information longterm memory back working memory use computer processes information thought minds processing information output computer would deliver likened minds output information behavior though information processing compared computer much needs explained information processing several components major components information stores cognitive processes executive information stores different places information stored mind information stored briefly sensory memory information stored long enough us move information shortterm memory george armitage miller discovered shortterm memory hold plus minus two things information also stored seconds information stored shortterm memory committed longterm memory store limit information stored longterm memory information stored stay many years longterm memory divided semantic episodic procedural semantic memory made facts information learned obtained throughout life episodic memory made personal experiences real events happened persons last procedural memory made procedures processes learned riding bike subcategories longterm memory cognitive processes way humans transfer information among different memory stores prominent processes used transferring information coding retrieval perception coding process transferring information short longterm memory relating information longterm memory item shortterm memory done memorization techniques retrieval used bring information longterm memory back shortterm memory achieved many different recall techniques perception use information processed interpret environment another useful technique advised george miller recoding recoding process regrouping organizing information mind working successful method recoding chunking used group together pieces information unit information considered chunk could one several commonly used trying memorize phone number executive cognition idea someone aware way process information know strengths weaknesses concept similar metacognition conscious mind control processes information processing theory information processing model human thinking learning part resurgence cognitive perspectives learning cognitive perspective asserts complex mental states affect human learning behavior mental states scientifically investigated computers process information include internal states affect processing computers therefore provided model possible human mental states provided researchers clues direction understanding human thinking learning information processing overall informationprocessing models helped reestablish mental processes processes directly observed legitimate area scientific research george armitage miller one founders field psychology known cognition played large role came information processing theory researched capacity working memory discovering people hold plus minus items also created term chunking explaining make shortterm two theorists associated cognitive information processing theory richard c atkinson richard shiffrin two proposed multistage theory memory explained time information received processing system goes different stages fully stored broke sensory memory shortterm memory longterm memory atkinson later alan baddeley graham hitch would contribute information processing theory discoveries deepened understanding memory central executive phonological loop visuospatial sketch pad baddeley later updated model episodic atkinson shiffrin model proposed richard c atkinson richard shiffrin model illustrates theory human memory two theorists used model show human memory broken three subsections sensory memory shortterm memory longterm sensory memory responsible holding onto information mind receives senses auditory visual information example someone hear bird chirp know bird information held brief sensory memory shortterm memory lasts seconds shortterm memory retains information needed short period time remembering phone number needs dialed longterm memory unlimited amount space longterm memory memory stored beginning life time longterm memory tapped need recall event happened individuals previous experiences baddeley hitch introduced model working memory research contributed help understand mind may process information added three elements explain cognitive processes elements central executive phonological loop visuospatial working later alan baddeley added fourth element working memory model called episodic buffer together ideas support information processing theory possibly explain mind processes information central executive flexible system responsible control regulation cognitive processes directs focus targets information making working memory longterm memory work together thought supervisory system controls cognitive processes making sure shortterm store actively working intervenes go astray prevents following functions updating coding incoming information replacing old information binding information number sources coherent episodes coordination slave systems shifting tasks retrieval strategies inhibition suppressing dominant automatic selective attention central executive two main systems visuospatial sketchpad visual information phonological loop verbal using dualtask paradigm baddeley erses found instance patients alzheimers dementia impaired performing multiple tasks simultaneously even difficulty individual tasks adapted two tasks include memory tasks tracking task individual actions completed well alzheimers becomes prominent patient performing two actions becomes difficult research shown deteriorating central executive individuals recent research executive functions suggests central executive central conceived baddeley hitch model rather seem separate executive functions vary largely independently individuals selectively impaired spared brain damage working connection central executive phonological loop phonological loop used hold auditory information two sub components phonological loop phonological store articulatory rehearsal process phonological store holds auditory information short period articulatory rehearsal process keeps information store longer period time visuospatial sketch pad portion central executive used hold visual spatial information visuospatial sketch pad used help conscious imagine objects well maneuver physical baddeley later added fourth aspect model called episodic buffer proposed episodic buffer able hold information thereby increasing amount stored due ability hold information episodic buffer said also transfer information perception shortterm memory longterm memory episodic buffer relatively new idea still cognitive processes include perception recognition imagining remembering thinking judging reasoning problem solving conceptualizing planning cognitive processes emerge human language thought imagery symbols addition specific cognitive processes many cognitive psychologists study languageacquisition altered states mind consciousness visual perception auditory perception shortterm memory longterm memory storage retrieval perceptions thought much cognitive processes emerge senses thoughts experiences first step aroused paying attention allows processing information given cognitive processing occur without learning work hand hand fully grasp informationcognitive process nature versus nurture refers theory people nature mentality around idea influenced genetics involves physical characteristics personality hand nurture revolves around idea influenced environment experiences believe way due raised type environment raised early childhood experiences theory views humans actively inputting retrieving processing storing information context social content social influences processing simply viewed information nature provides hardware cognitive processing information processing theory explains cognitive functioning based hardware individuals innately vary cognitive abilities memory span human cognitive systems function similarly based set memory stores store information control processes determine information processed nurture component provides information input stimuli processed resulting behavior learning changes contents longterm memory store knowledge learning prior knowledge affects future processing thus affects future behavior learning information processing theory combines elements quantitative qualitative development qualitative development occurs emergence new strategies information storage retrieval developing representational abilities utilization language represent concepts obtaining problemsolving rules miller increases knowledge base ability remember items working memory examples quantitative changes well increases strength connected cognitive associations miller qualitative quantitative components often interact together develop new efficient strategies within processing system information processing theory currently utilized study computer artificial intelligence theory also applied systems beyond individual including families business organizations example ariel applied information processing theory family systems sensing attending encoding stimuli occurring either within individuals within family system unlike traditional systems theory family system tends maintain stasis resists incoming stimuli would violate systems rules information processing family develops individual mutual schemes influence information attended processed dysfunctions occur individual level well within family system creating targets therapeutic change rogers p r et al utilized information processing theory describe business organizational behavior well present model describing effective ineffective business strategies developed study components organizations sense market information identified well organizations attend information gatekeepers determine information relevantimportant organization organized existing culture organizational schemas whether organization effective ineffective processes longterm strategy cognitive psychologist kahnemen grabe noted learners control process selective attention ability humans select process certain information simultaneously ignoring others influenced many things including research shown individuals high working memory better able filter irrelevant information particular one study focusing dichotic listening followed participants played two audio tracks one ear asked pay attention one shown significant positive relationship working memory capacity ability participant filter information audio examples classroom implications information processing theory include
