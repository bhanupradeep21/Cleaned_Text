human reproductive system includes male reproductive system functions produce deposit sperm female reproductive system functions produce egg cells protect nourish fetus birth humans high level sexual differentiation addition differences nearly every reproductive organ numerous differences typical secondary sex characteristics human reproduction usually involves internal fertilization sexual intercourse process male inserts penis females vagina ejaculates semen contains sperm small proportion sperm pass cervix uterus fallopian tubes fertilization ovum one sperm required fertilize ovum upon successful fertilization fertilized ovum zygote travels fallopian tube uterus implants uterine wall marks beginning gestation better known pregnancy continues around nine months fetus develops fetus developed certain point pregnancy concluded childbirth involving labor labor muscles uterus contract cervix dilates course hours baby passes vagina human infants completely dependent caregivers require high levels parental care infants rely caregivers comfort cleanliness food food may provided breastfeeding formula human female reproductive system series organs primarily located inside body around pelvic region female contribute towards reproductive process human female reproductive system contains three main parts vulva leads vagina vaginal opening uterus uterus holds developing fetus ovaries produce females ova breasts involved parenting stage reproduction classifications considered part female reproductive system vagina meets outside vulva also includes labia clitoris urethra intercourse area lubricated mucus secreted bartholins glands vagina attached uterus cervix uterus attached ovaries via fallopian tubes ovary contains hundreds egg cells ova singular ovum approximately every days pituitary gland releases hormone stimulates ova develop grow one ovum released passes fallopian tube uterus hormones produced ovaries prepare uterus receive ovum lining uterus called endometrium unfertilized ova shed cycle process menstruation ovum fertilized sperm attaches endometrium fetus develops male reproductive system series organs located outside body around pelvis region male contribute towards reproduction process primary direct function male reproductive system provide male sperm fertilization ovum major reproductive organs male grouped three categories first category produces stores sperm spermatozoa produced testicles housed temperatureregulating scrotum immature sperm travel epididymis development storage second category ejaculatory fluid producing glands include cowpers gland also called bulbourethral gland seminal vesicles prostate vas deferens final category used copulation deposition sperm within female include penis urethra vas deferens major secondary sexual characteristics include larger muscular stature deepened voice facial body hair broad shoulders development adams apple important sexual hormone males androgen particularly testosterone testes release hormone controls development sperm hormone also responsible development physical characteristics men facial hair deep voice development reproductive system development urinary system closely tied development human fetus despite differences adult female male derived intermediate mesodermclarification neededno main verb three main fetal precursors reproductive organs wolffian duct müllerian ducts gonads endocrine hormones wellknown critical controlling factor normal differentiation reproductive wolffian duct forms epididymis vas deferens ductus deferens ejaculatory duct seminal vesicle male reproductive system essentially disappears female reproductive system reverse true müllerian duct essentially disappears male reproductive system forms fallopian tubes uterus vagina female system sexes gonads go form testes ovaries derived undeveloped structure considered homologous organs number homologous structures shared male female reproductive systems however despite similarity function female fallopian tubes male epididymis vas deferens homologous rather analogous structures arise different fetal structures gametes produced within gonads process known gametogenesis occurs certain types germ cells undergo meiosis split normal diploid number chromosomes haploid cells containing males process known spermatogenesis takes place puberty seminiferous tubules testes immature spermatozoa sperm sent epididymis gain tail enabling motility original diploid germ cells primary spermatocytes forms four functional gametes forever youngclarification needed production survival sperms require temperature normal core body temperature since scrotum testes present situated outside body cavity provides temperature normal body temperature females gametogenesis known oogenesis occurs ovarian follicles ovaries process produce mature ovum puberty contrast males original diploid germ cells primary oocytes form one mature ovum three polar bodies capable fertilization long understood females unlike males primary oocytes ever found female created prior birth final stages ova production resume however recent scientific research challenged new research indicates least species mammal oocytes continue replenished females well like complex organ systems human reproductive system affected many diseases four main categories reproductive diseases humans specific reproductive diseases often symptoms diseases disorders multiple unknown causes making difficult classify examples unclassifiable disorders peyronies disease males endometriosis females many congenital conditions cause reproductive abnormalities better known symptoms include turner syndrome klinefelters syndrome cystic fibrosis bloom
