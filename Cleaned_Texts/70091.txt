wobbler disease catchall term referring several possible malformations cervical vertebrae cause unsteady wobbly gait weakness dogs horses number different conditions cervical neck spinal column cause similar clinical signs conditions may include malformation vertebrae intervertebral disc protrusion disease interspinal ligaments ligamenta flava articular facets wobbler disease also known cervical vertebral instability cvi cervical spondylomyelopathy csm cervical vertebral malformation cvm dogs disease common large breeds especially great danes doberman pinschers horses linked particular breed though often seen tall racebred horses thoroughbred standardbred ancestry likely inherited least extent dogs horsescitation needed wobbler disease probably inherited borzoi great dane doberman basset instability vertebrae neck usually caudal neck causes spinal cord compression younger dogs great danes less two years age wobbler disease caused stenosis narrowing vertebral related degeneration dorsal articular facets subsequent thickening associated joint capsules highprotein diet may contribute middleaged older dogs dobermans intervertebral disc disease leads bulging disc herniation disc contents spinal cord great danes vertebrae commonly affected dobermans vertebrae disease tends gradually progressive symptoms weakness ataxia dragging toes start rear legs dogs often crouching stance downward flexed neck disease progresses front legs symptoms less severe neck pain sometimes seen symptoms usually gradual onset may progress rapidly following xrays may show misaligned vertebrae narrow disk spaces effective myelogram reveals stenosis vertebral canal magnetic resonance imaging shown effective showing location nature severity spinal cord compression treatment either medical control symptoms usually corticosteroids cage rest surgical correct spinal cord compression prognosis guarded either case surgery may fully correct problem technically difficult relapses may occur types surgery include ventral decompression spinal cord ventral slot technique dorsal decompression vertebral one study showed significant advantage common spinal cord decompression another study showed electroacupuncture may successful treatment wobbler new surgical treatment using proprietary medical device developed dogs discassociated wobbler disease implants artificial disc cervical arthroplasty place affected disc wobbler disease wobblers syndrome broad category cervical disorders horse including conditions listed well equine wobbles anemia cervical vertebral myelopathy spinal cord compression sometimes referred colloquially among horse owners cervical arthritis due arthritis accumulates facets within horse community neurological problem causes limb proprioception issues decreased performance horse suspected rooted neck considered type wobbler disease forms wobbler disease root cause cervical vertebral myelopathy cvm causes inflammation arthritis joint painful affected horses time believed possibly congenital condition mounting evidence growing points cvm cervical vertebral disorders like kissing spine hereditary found populations specific forms cervical arthritis equine wobbles anemia concentrated certain breeds demonstrate possible hereditary factors horses wobbler disease often exhibit ataxia implying dysfunction parts nervous system show weakness hindquarters may knuckle fetlocks particularly rear also may show overall stiffness especially neck back may move fluidly common ataxic symptom horse list one side behind also may demonstrate uneven strides one leg intermittently shorter step horses wobbler disease cervical anomalies demonstrate difficult diagnose lamenesses come go often resolved veterinary blocks limbs advanced stages disease affected horses prone falling due extreme listing behind often demonstrate difficulty getting lying reluctance lie cases successfully treated nutritional medical management surgery also used one method use titanium baskets placed fuse vertebrae thereby preventing compression spinal cord horses able return work able reach competitive levels complete cure condition known famous horses known completed basket surgery include seattle slew seattle slew underwent two basket surgeries sired multiple offspring cervical arthritis one many thoroughbred stallions undergone basket surgery still used stud wobbler disease best known neurological conditions affect horses unrelated conditions kissing spine equine protozoal myeloencephalitis cerebellar abiotrophy sometimes misdiagnosed wobbler disease though causes symptoms differ including symptoms listed clinical presentations wobblers also include neck pain stiffness difficulty tracking gait abnormalities decreased performance intermittent swapping lameness particularly diagonal pairs forelimb lameness abnormal head neck posture defensiveness change behavior abnormal sweat patterns wobbler disease definitively diagnosed xray nuclear scintigraphy bone scan xrays show channel widening filling easiest often costeffective horse owners xrays also show structural anomaly arthritis facet remodeling bone spurs present preliminary diagnosis made ultrasound xrays needed measure true depth facet involvement extent damage associated structures veterinarians may opt horse undergo bone scan nuclear scintigraphy
