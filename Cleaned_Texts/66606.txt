camarasaurus lewisi species sauropod dinosaur upper jurassic united states named james jensen c lewisi originally placed genus cathetosaurus reclassified species camarasaurus researchers since considered one four valid species camarasaurus two unpublished studies since argued genus cathetosaurus reinstated whereas two studies argued c lewisi may junior synonym another species camarasaurus c lewisi smallest species assigned camarasaurus despite representing old individual holotype specimen roughly smaller c supremus humerus centimetres possible c lewisi specimen sma also represents fully mature individual exceptionally small humerus centimetres possible size difference reflects sexual dimorphism frank seebacher estimated length c lewisi metres ft mass whereas gregory paul estimated length c lewisi metres ft mass c lewisi relatively longnecked compared specimens six traits indicated distinguishing c lewisi species bifurcated vertebrae neck back narrow deep cleft incising tops neural spines resulting vshaped transverse profile instead ushaped profile typical camarasaurus species bifurcation continues sacrum instead ending middle back typical camarasaurus first sacral vertebra strongly sacralised fifth last sacral vertebra less strongly sacralised typical camarasaurus costal plate sacrum strongly developed typical camarasaurus even compared old individuals ilium
