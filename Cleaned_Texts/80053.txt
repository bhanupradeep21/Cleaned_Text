wargame generally type strategy game realistically simulates warfare professional wargame specifically wargame used military organizations train officers tactical strategic decisionmaking test new tactics strategies predict trends future conflicts contrast recreational wargames designed fun competition exact definition wargame varies one writer next one organization next prevent confusion section establish general definition employed article note term game derived economic game theory still professional wargamers feel term game trivializes see serious professional tool one georg von reisswitz creator kriegsspiel father professional wargaming stuck word game could think better us army many preferred term map maneuvers contrast field maneuvers us naval war college preferred terms chart maneuvers simulating campaigns board maneuvers simulating battles although term war game never officially professional wargames tend looser rules simpler models recreational wargames umpire arbitrating situations based personal knowledge umpire highly knowledgeable warfare perhaps veteran wargames achieve higher degree realism wargames rigid rulesets recreational wargame looseness would lead concerns fairness point professional wargame education competition simple loose rules also keeps learning curve small convenient since officers little wargaming experience professional wargames used prepare officers actual warfare naturally strong emphasis realism current events historical wargames wargames set distant past world war ii napoleonic simulating wars realistically may interest historians little use military recreational wargames may take creative liberties reality simplifying models make enjoyable adding fictional armaments units orcs wizards making little use officers must fight real world military organizations typically secretive current wargames makes designing professional wargame challenge secrecy makes harder disseminate corrections wargame already delivered clients whereas commercial wargame might thousands even millions players professional wargames tend small player bases makes harder designers acquire feedback consequence errors wargame models tend although commercial wargame designers take consumer trends player feedback account products usually designed sold takeitorleaveit approach professional wargames contrast typically commissioned military plans use wargame commissioned several clients designer juggle competing demands lead great complexity high development costs compromised product satisfies commercial wargames pressure deliver enjoyable experience players expect userfriendly interface reasonable learning curve exciting gameplay forth contrast military organizations tend see wargaming tool chore players often bluntly obliged use whatever provided term model mean two things wargaming one conceptual models describe properties capabilities behaviors things wargame attempts simulate weapons vehicles troops terrain weather etc meaning miniature wargaming form recreational wargaming physical models ie sculptures soldiers vehicles terrain generally serve aesthetic purpose little consequence simulation professional wargames rarely use physical models aesthetics arent important military scale professional wargames typically play make physical models impractical therefore article focus conceptual models wargame decisionmaking learning technical capabilities particular weapon vehicle therefore welldesigned model describe something beyond player needs know make effective decisions players burdened cumbersome calculations slows game distracts players player makes bad decision poor strategic thinking forgotten rule arithmetic error otherwise game yield less reliable insights wargame computerassisted

battle represents problem afflicted original kriegsspiel wargamers experiment assets military actually possess alliances country armaments yet acquire even hypothetical technologies yet invented example world war germany forced downsize armed forces outright give certain weapons planes tanks submarines made difficult impossible german officers develop doctrines field exercises germans greatly expanded use wargaming compensate germany began openly rearming officers already fairly welldeveloped theories armaments buy organizational reforms wargames used predict progression outcome war one might predict weather human behavior difficult predict wargames provoke anxiety anger stress fatigue etc commander experience actual combat thus foresee effects emotions said training tool replicate emotional experience war specific flaw another issue produce wrong predictions commander may things differently field precisely dissatisfied decisions made wargames costeffective way giving officers experience something resembling experience making decisions leader armed conflict oldest application wargaming actual effectiveness wargaming bad strategist good difficult measure officers use many tools hone decisionmaking skills effect wargaming difficult context wargames used help players understand decisionmaking process wartime command wargames help players master practice certain routine skills discuss ideas share intel communicate orders wargames present players intellectual challenges receive books classroom enemy reacts unpredictably intelligently players decisions wargames train players evaluate situations make decisions faster teach players discuss ideas protocols sharing intel communicating teach players cope incomplete delayed incorrect superfluous information teach player cope unpredictable foe reacts intelligently decisions wargames also help familiarize players geography areas might eventually fight oftcited justification wargaming us naval war wargames used prepare grand strategic plans develop doctrine low risk enemy becoming aware developments adapting problem military faces learning hard experience actual warfare gets better fighting enemy enemy adapt turn modifying armaments tactics maintain edge live exercises similar weakness enemy spy learn tested wargames done good secrecy enemy know ideas wargames help military determine armaments infrastructure acquire substantial historical evidence support particular instance american military planners believed america could win war japan quickly simply sailing armada across pacific knocking japanese navy decisive strategy tested wargames routinely failed japan held assault american armada exhausted counterattacked wargames foretold war japan would instead prolonged war attrition america would need advance bases western pacific warships could get resupplied infrastructure would require making alliances friendly countries australia new zealand british wargames also used develop potential new technology order wield new technology optimally enough military merely also develop good tactics know organize around enemy isnt exploring issues wargames one gain significant edge enemy war breaks deploying mature example german submarine doctrine world wars world war submarines new thing nobody knew best use germany developed submarine doctrine go german navy time use wargames tested new ideas immediately british consequently every incremental innovation submarine warfare germans deployed british quickly developed countermeasure kept pace limited impact submarines world war interwar years german navy experimented extensively new submarine tactics wargames tandem field exercises developed wolfpack doctrine defeat antisubmarine countermeasures developed world war notably convoy system british contrast experiment submarines wargames thought established countermeasures germans entered war whole bag new tricks took time british catch around turn century number european inventors created wargames based chess games used pieces represented real army units infantry artillery etc squares board colorcoded represent different terrain types rivers marshes mountains etc basing games chess made attractive accessible chess also made unrealistic taken seriously army grid forced terrain unnatural forms rivers flowing straight lines bending right angles single piece could occupy square time even square represented square prussian army officer named georg von reisswitz presented prussian general staff wargame father developed years highly realistic wargame designed strictly use professional tool training leisure instead chesslike grid game played accurate paper maps kind prussian army used allowed game model terrain naturally simulate battles real locations pieces could moved across map freeform manner subject terrain obstacles pieces represented kind army unit infantry battalion cavalry squadron etc little rectangular blocks made lead pieces painted either red blue indicate faction belonged blue pieces used represent prussian army red used represent foreign convention professional wargaming use blue represent faction players actually belong game used dice add degree randomness combat scale map pieces made proportions units represented piece occupied relative space map corresponding unit battlefield game modeled capabilities units realistically using data gathered prussian army napoleonic wars various field exercises reisswitzs manual provided tables listed far unit type could move round according terrain crossing whether marching running galloping etc accordingly umpire used ruler move pieces across map game used dice determine combat results inflicted casualties casualties inflicted firearms artillery decreased distance unlike chess pieces units reisswitzs game could suffer partial losses defeated tracked sheet paper recreational gamers might call hitpoint tracking game also rules modeled morale exhaustion reisswitzs game also used umpire players directly control pieces game map rather wrote orders virtual troops pieces paper submitted umpire umpire moved pieces across game map according judged virtual troops would interpret carry troops engaged enemy map umpire rolled dice computed effects removed defeated units map umpire also managed secret information simulate fog war umpire placed pieces map units judged sides could see kept mental track hidden units placed pieces map judged came view enemy earlier wargames fixed victory conditions occupying enemys fortress contrast reisswitzs wargame openended umpire decided victory conditions typically resembled goals actual army battle might aim emphasis experience decisionmaking strategic thinking competition reisswitz wrote winning losing sense card board game come englishspeaking world reisswitzs wargame variants called kriegsspiel german word wargame reisswitz showed wargame prussian king general staff greatly impressed general karl von mueffling wrote game training war shall recommend enthusiastically whole army king decreed every regiment play kriegsspiel end decade every regiment purchased materials become popular kriegsspiel therefore first wargame treated serious tool training research military organization aside official military venues kriegsspiel also played number private clubs around country mainly patronized officers also civilian members kriegsspiel certainly played recreational context first club berlin wargame associationa general von moltke elder joined magdeburg club became manager years officers updated reisswitzs game reflect changes technology doctrine particularly noteworthy variant free kriegsspiel developed general julius von verdy du vernois vernois frustrated cumbersome rules traditional rigid kriegsspiel took lot time learn prevented experienced officers applying expertise computations also slowed game sometimes session would take longer play actual battle represented vernois advocated dispensing rules altogether allowing umpire determine outcomes player decisions saw fit dice rulers computations etc optional rulesfree variant course depended heavily competence impartiality umpire relative merits drawbacks rulesheavy freeform wargaming still debated day prussian wargaming attracted little attention outside prussia prussia considered secondrate power wargaming unproven novelty changed prussia defeated france francoprussian war many credited prussias victory wargaming prussian army significant advantage weaponry numbers troop quality army world practiced civilians military forces around world took keen interest german wargames foreigners referred kriegsspiel german word wargame first kriegsspiel manual english based system wilhelm von tschischwitz published british army received royal worlds first recreational wargaming club university kriegspiel sic club founded oxford university england united states charles adiel lewis totten published strategos american war game william r livermore published american kriegsspiel heavily inspired prussian wargames us naval war college made wargaming regular tool us naval war college staff college american officers ranks go receive postgraduate training since wargaming regular tool instruction wargaming brought naval war college william mccarty little retired navy lieutenant likely inspired reading american kriegsspiel wr livermore livermore stationed nearby fort adams little cooperated translate ideas behind kriegsspiel naval world war navy suffered severe budget cuts prevented upgrading expanding fleet limited ability conduct naval exercises wargaming thus became vital means testing hypothetical strategies another problem time america entered world war ii none navys senior officers meaningful combat experience navy involved war years however almost participated wargames naval war college plenty virtual combat fact america defeated japan world war ii despite shortcomings evidence value wargaming war admiral nimitz said wargames predicted every tactic japanese used except kamikazes somewhat hyperbolic naval war college organized two broad classes wargames chart maneuvers strategiclevel games board maneuvers tacticallevel games chart maneuvers fleet movements scouting screening operations supply board maneuvers simulated battles detail aid model ships wargames played floors lecture halls needed space table could provide two frequently played scenarios war japan war britain japan codenamed orange britain codenamed red america codenamed blue neither students staff naval war college expected war possible us navy didnt imagine getting sort serious naval conflict atlantic anyone simulated wars britain simply saw royal navy role war japan hand real concern years passed wargames increasingly played orange case war japan us navys grand strategy send armada straight across pacific quickly defeat japanese navy one two decisive wargamers college tested strategy extensively routinely failed navys research department reviewed wargames played concluded fundamental problem armada overextended supply lines blue armada would exhaust orange would recover wargamers college abandoned old doctrine instead developed progressive strategy involved building logistics infrastructure western pacific making alliances regional countries wargames resembled much navy later experienced pacific wargames also produced tactical innovations notably circular formation formation used world war ii aircraft carrier surrounded concentric circles cruisers destroyers formation concentrated antiaircraft fire also easier maneuver line battle ships could turn signal central ship circular formation first proposed september commander roscoe c macfall initially wargamers college used battleship central ship eventually supplanted aircraft carrier chester nimitz fellow student year impressed circular formation could nimitz played pivotal role making navy hand wargamers naval war college failed develop good submarine doctrine didnt good understanding submarines could unlike german navy us navy significant experience submarine warfare time players used submarines screening force sailed ahead main formation players rarely used submarines independent operations never attack commercial shipping german wargamers years end world war ii wargaming almost ceased america naval war college wargaming dropped prewar treaty versailles greatly restricted size germanys armed forces outright banned certain weapons planes tanks submarines made difficult impossible german military

course war germany fought well tactical operational level made many bad strategic world war british learned protect ships german submarines moving convoys escorted submarinehunting ships convoy system proved effective german submarines typically operated alone interwar years german navy developed wolfpack doctrine german submarines would attack convoys groups confuse overwhelm escorts ideas tested combination wargames naval exercises karl doenitz would later command german submarine operations world war ii organized series wargames held winter results concluded would best wolfpack attack coordinated designated command submarine rather commander onshore also concluded germany needed submarines effectively destroy british shipping germanys existing submarine fleet would inflict world war ii wargaming ceased germany well axis powers germany didnt even army saw little need wargame west germany established new army officers wargaming experience german war college asked us air force provide officer wargaming january british royal navy established naval tactical analysis unit called western approaches tactical unit watu tasked developing ways counter german submarine wolfpacks devastating shipping convoys atlantic based liverpool directed captain gilbert roberts staffed mainly young women womens royal naval service primary analytical tool wargaming staff watu used wargames test various hypothetical submarine tactics virtual convoys certain tactic proved consistently effective produced outcomes similar actual convoys reporting watu assumed germans fact staff watu would design countermeasures test wargames watu operated weeklong courses wherein naval captains would instructed antisubmarine tactics wargames uncertain exactly many german submarines sunk thanks watus tactics close war several british admirals asserted watu played decisive role germanys german submarine threat merchant shipping thwarted britain would forced capitulate germans lack food necessary imports makes watu remarkable episode history wargaming first time wargames used analyze scenarios occurring ongoing war develop solutions deployed immediately field made possible communications
