thyrotoxic periodic paralysis tpp rare condition featuring attacks muscle weakness presence hyperthyroidism overactivity thyroid gland hypokalemia decreased potassium level blood usually present attacks condition may lifethreatening weakness breathing muscles leads respiratory failure low potassium levels lead abnormal heart untreated typically recurrent condition linked genetic mutations genes code certain ion channels transport electrolytes sodium potassium across cell membranes main ones ltype calcium channel potassium inward rectifier therefore classified abnormality channel thought lead shifts potassium cells conditions high thyroxine thyroid hormone levels usually additional precipitant treatment low levels potassium blood followed correction hyperthyroidism leads complete resolution attacks occurs predominantly males chinese japanese vietnamese filipino korean tpp one several conditions cause periodic attack often begins muscle pain cramping followed weakness paralysis tends develop rapidly usually late evening early hours morning weakness usually limb muscles closer trunk proximal predominantly affected weakness tends start legs spread arms muscles mouth throat eyes breathing usually affected occasionally weakness respiratory muscles cause lifethreatening respiratory failure attacks typically resolve within several hours several days even absence neurological examination attack flaccid weakness limbs noted reflexes usually diminished sensory system mental status attacks may brought physical exertion drinking alcohol eating food high carbohydrates salt may explain attacks common summer people drink sugary drinks engage exercise exerciserelated attacks tend occur period rest immediately exercise exercise may therefore recommended abort may symptoms thyroid overactivity weight loss fast irregular heart rate tremor symptoms occur half common type hyperthyroidism graves disease may additionally cause eye problems graves ophthalmopathy skin changes legs pretibial thyroid disease may also cause muscle weakness form thyrotoxic myopathy constant rather genetic mutations ltype calcium channel described southern chinese

people thyroid problems thyroiditis toxic nodular goiter toxic adenoma tshproducing pituitary adenoma excessive ingestion thyroxine amiodaroneinduced muscle weakness increased risk irregular heart beat tpp result markedly reduced levels potassium bloodstream potassium fact lost body increased nakatpase activity enzyme moves potassium cells keeps sodium blood leads shift potassium tissues depletes circulation types potassium derangement acidbase balance usually disturbed metabolic alkalosis metabolic acidosis often present tpp disturbances generally absent hypokalemia leads hyperpolarization muscle cells making neuromuscular junction less responsive normal nerve impulses leading decreased contractility clear described genetic defects increase nakatpase activity suspected enzyme becomes active due increased thyroid hormone levels hyperthyroidism increases levels catecholamines adrenaline blood increasing nakatpase enzyme activity increased precipitating causes instance increased carbohydrate intake leads increased insulin levels known activate nakatpase precipitant removed enzyme activity returns normal postulated male hormones increase nakatpase activity explains males higher risk tpp despite thyroid disease common tpp regarded model related conditions known channelopathies linked mutations ion channels majority conditions occurs hypokalemia low blood potassium levels commonly occurs attacks levels mmoll typically encountered magnesium phosphate levels often found decreased creatine kinase levels elevated two thirds cases usually due degree muscle injury severe elevations suggestive rhabdomyolysis muscle tissue destruction electrocardiography ecgekg may show tachycardia fast heart rate due thyroid disease abnormalities due cardiac arrhythmia atrial fibrillation ventricular tachycardia conduction changes associated hypokalemia u waves qrs widening qt prolongation wave electromyography shows changes similar encountered myopathies muscle

forms thyrotoxicosis levels thyroxine triiodothyronine elevated resultant suppression tsh production pituitary various investigations usually performed separate different causes acute phase attack administration potassium quickly restore muscle strength prevent complications however caution advised total amount potassium body decreased possible potassium levels overshoot rebound hyperkalemia slow infusions potassium chloride therefore recommended treatment effects excess thyroid hormone typically respond administration nonselective beta blocker propranolol symptoms driven increased levels adrenaline effect Î²adrenergic receptors subsequent attacks may prevented avoiding known precipitants high salt carbohydrate intake thyroid disease adequately treatment thyroid disease usually leads resolution paralytic attacks depending nature disease treatment may consist thyrostatics drugs reduce production thyroid hormone radioiodine occasionally thyroid tpp occurs predominantly males chinese
