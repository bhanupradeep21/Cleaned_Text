developing hardware software computer technology augment human intelligence pondering adapt underlying principles planimeter inputting x ycoordinate data envisioned something like cursor mouse initially called bug form could drop point orthogonal wrote bug would easier natural use unlike stylus would stay still let go meant would much better coordination according roger bates young hardware designer arc bill english cursor screen unknown reason also referred cat time led calling new pointing device mouse commandline interfaces text editors text cursor also known underscore solid rectangle vertical line may flashing steady indicating text placed entered insertion point text mode displays possible show vertical bar characters show new text would inserted underscore block cursor used instead situations block used block usually created inverting pixels character using boolean math exclusive text editors word processors modern design bitmapped displays vertical bar typically used instead typical text editing application cursor moved pressing various keys include four arrow keys page page keys home key end key various key combinations involving modifier key control key position cursor also may changed moving mouse pointer different location document clicking blinking text cursor usually temporarily suspended moved otherwise cursor may change position visible making location difficult follow concept blinking cursor attributed charles kiesling sr via us patent filed august interfaces use underscore thin vertical bar indicate user insert mode mode text inserted middle existing text larger block indicate user overtype mode inserted text overwrite existing text way block cursor may seen piece selected text one character wide since typing replace text cursor new text vertical line text cursor small leftpointing rightpointing appendage indicating direction text flow systems support bidirectional text thus usually known among programmers bidi cursor cases cursor may split two parts indicating lefttoright righttoleft text would computing pointer mouse pointer part personal computer wimp style symbol graphical image computer monitor display device echoes movements pointing device commonly mouse touchpad stylus pen signals point actions user take place used textbased graphical user interfaces select move elements distinct cursor responds keyboard input cursor may also repositioned using pointer pointer commonly appears angled arrow angled historically improved appearance lowresolution vary within different programs operating systems use pointer employed input method pointing device device move fluidly across screen select highlight objects screen guis input method relies hard keys fiveway key many mobile phones pointer employed instead gui relies clear focus state pointer echoes movements pointing device commonly mouse touchpad trackball kind pointer used manipulate elements graphical user interfaces menus buttons scrollbars widget pointer hotspot active pixel pointer used target click drag hotspot normally along pointer edges center though may reside location many guis moving pointer around screen may reveal screen hotspots pointer changes shape depending circumstances example ibeam pointer also called icursor cursor shaped like serifed capital letter purpose cursor indicate text beneath cursor highlighted sometimes inserted pointer trails used enhance visibility movement pointer trails feature gui operating systems enhance visibility pointer although disabled default pointer trails option every version microsoft windows since windows pointer trails active mouse stylus moved system waits moment removing pointer image old location screen copy pointer persists every point pointer visited moment resulting snakelike trail pointer icons follow actual pointer user stops moving mouse removes stylus screen trails disappear pointer returns normal pointer trails provided feature mainly users poor vision screens low visibility may become issue lcd screens bright sunlight windows pointer trails may enabled control panel usually mouse applet introduced windows nt animated pointer small looping animation played location used example provide visual cue computer busy introduction many animated pointers became available download third party suppliers unfortunately animated pointers without problems addition imposing small additional load cpu animated pointer routines introduce security vulnerability clientside exploit known windows animated cursor remote code execution vulnerability used buffer overflow vulnerability load malicious code via animated cursor load routine idea cursor used marker insertion point new data transformations rotation extended modeling environment blender instance
