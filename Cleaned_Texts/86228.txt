alcoholic cardiomyopathy acm disease longterm consumption alcohol leads heart acm type dilated cardiomyopathy heart unable pump blood efficiently leading heart failure affect parts body heart failure severe common males ages causal relationship alcohol consumption cardiomyopathy heart failure per american heart association aha alcohol one leading causes dilated however multiple longitudinal studies shown paradoxical lowering dilated cardiomyopathy modesttomoderate alcohol acm type heart disease occurs due chronic alcohol consumption etiology acm multifactorial combination genetic environmental lifestyle factors playing direct toxic effects alcohol heart muscle cells cardiomyocytes considered primary cause chronic alcohol consumption leads accumulation toxic metabolites acetaldehyde reactive oxygen species heart muscle toxic substances cause oxidative stress inflammation damage cardiomyocytes leading development additionally chronic alcohol consumption lead deficiencies essential vitamins minerals thiamine magnesium selenium important proper functioning thiamine deficiency particular common people alcohol use disorder lead condition known beriberi damage heart furthermore chronic alcohol consumption also lead cardiovascular risk factors high blood pressure high cholesterol levels obesity contribute development overall etiology acm complex involves various factors damage heart muscle signs symptoms alcoholic cardiomyopathy indistinguishable seen forms cardiomyopathy symptoms include signs symptoms alcoholic cardiomyopathy acm vary depending severity early stages people acm may experience symptoms however condition progresses may experience symptoms fatigue shortness breath palpitations swelling legs may also experience chest pain dizziness fainting cases acm cause arrhythmias irregular heartbeats lifethreatening advanced cases people acm may develop severe heart failure cause symptoms severe shortness breath wheezing left untreated acm lead lifethreatening complications heart failure arrhythmias sudden cardiac therefore important seek medical attention symptoms experienced especially history chronic alcohol consumption alcoholinduced cardiac toxicity aict characterized either acute chronic believed consumption large amounts alcohol leads cardiac inflammation detected finding large amounts troponin chronic consumption alcohol defined greater g per day least years lead multiorgan failure including myocardial exact pathophysiologic mechanism chronic consumption alcohol causes dcm well understood however believed genetic mutation mitochondrial damage due oxidative stress injury may play abnormal heart sounds murmurs ecg abnormalities enlarged heart chest xray may lead diagnosis echocardiogram abnormalities cardiac catheterization angiogram rule coronary artery blockages along history alcohol abuse confirm important note part diagnosing chronic acm noting absence coronary artery also worth noting diagnosis acm largely diagnosis exclusion diagnosis alcoholic cardiomyopathy typically made based combination patients medical history physical examination diagnostic firstly doctor ask patient alcohol consumption habits well symptoms may experienced shortness breath swelling may also perform physical examination check signs heart failure enlarged heart fluid buildup addition patients medical history physical exam diagnosis alcoholic cardiomyopathy often confirmed various diagnostic one common tests echocardiogram uses ultrasound waves create images heart detect abnormalities hearts structure tests may include electrocardiogram ecg measure hearts electrical activity blood tests check elevated levels certain enzymes may indicate heart diagnosis confirmed treatment typically involves stopping alcohol consumption managing heart failure symptoms medications lifestyle changes severe cases heart prognosis influenced several factors including amount alcohol time period consumed presence absence dysrhythmias atrial fibrillation width qrs indications poor prognosis include following patients qrs patients continue consume alcohol prolonged consumption alcohol directly related amount alcohol consumed length consumption indicators good prognosis include following successfully quitting consumption alcohol associated decreased hospital admissions patient compliance beta mortality years prognosis alcoholic cardiomyopathy acm varies depending severity condition extent heart muscle damage response treatment without treatment acm progress severe heart failure arrhythmias sudden cardiac however proper treatment including cessation alcohol consumption management heart failure symptoms prognosis improve research shown mortality rate people acm higher general population fiveyear survival rate around however studies also shown people stop drinking alcohol significantly better prognosis continue drink addition people receive early treatment acm including medication lifestyle modifications better chance improving heart function overall health prognosis acm also depend presence comorbidities diabetes hypertension conditions exacerbate effects acm heart increase risk therefore important manage comorbidities improve overall prognosis acm several complications arise result alcoholic cardiomyopathy instance individuals condition may higher risk developing blood clots lead heart attacks strokes serious cardiovascular additionally weakened heart muscle may able effectively pump blood lungs leading accumulation fluid lungs condition known pulmonary another potential complication alcoholic cardiomyopathy development arrhythmias abnormal heart irregular heart rhythms range mild severe may cause symptoms palpitations lightheadedness even loss cases arrhythmias lead sudden cardiac arrest lifethreatening condition heart treatment alcoholic cardiomyopathy involves lifestyle changes including complete abstinence alcohol use low sodium diet fluid restriction well medications medications may include ace inhibitors beta blockers diuretics commonly used forms cardiomyopathy reduce strain heart persons congestive heart failure may considered surgical insertion icd pacemaker improve heart function cases heart failure irreversible worsening heart transplant may treatment possibly prevent heart deterioration cardiomyopathy largely reversible complete abstinence alcohol unfortunately patients require heart transplants cardiomyopathy due alcoholism lowest postheart transplant survival causes per one study compared alcoholic cardiomyopathy patients nonalcoholic cardiomyopathy patients survival post heart transplant less year years years interestingly patients defined heavy drinkers defined consuming alcoholday decreased alcohol consumption moderate levels shown effective treatment fact retrospective cohort study analyzed data collected million patients categorized patients either abstinent drinkers mild drinkers moderate drinkers heavy drinkers despite large sample size association alcohol intake cardiomyopathy remains study found patients either mild moderate drinkers least likely develop hf compared patients study also found patients increased alcohol consumption light moderate andor moderate heavy increased risk heart although one might think patients completely abstinent alcohol would would least likely diagnosed heart failure actually patients categorized either light moderate drinkers lowest risk developing httpsenwikipediaorgwikialcoholiccardiomyopathy
