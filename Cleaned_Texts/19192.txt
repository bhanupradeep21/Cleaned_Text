meningococcal disease describes infections caused bacterium neisseria meningitidis also termed high mortality rate untreated best known cause meningitis also result sepsis even damaging dangerous condition meningitis meningococcemia major causes illness death disability developed underdeveloped countries approximately cases bacterial meningitis per year united states average cases developing countries case fatality rate ranges incidence endemic meningococcal disease last years ranges per developed countries per developing countries epidemics incidence meningococcal disease approaches per meningococcal vaccines sharply reduced incidence disease developed countriescitation needed diseases pathogenesis fully understood neisseria meningitidis colonises substantial proportion general population harmlessly small percentage individuals invade bloodstream affecting entire body notably limbs brain causing serious illness past yearswhen experts made intensive effort understand specific aspects meningococcal biology host interactions however development improved treatments effective vaccines expected depend novel efforts workers many different meningococcal disease contagious common cold spread casual contact transmitted saliva occasionally close prolonged general contact infected person meningococcemia like many gramnegative blood infections cause disseminated intravascular coagulation dic inappropriate clotting blood within vessels dic cause ischemic tissue damage upstream thrombi obstruct blood flow hemorrhage clotting factors exhausted small bleeds skin cause characteristic petechial rash appears starlike shape due release toxins blood break walls blood vessels rash develop skin due blood leakage may leave red brownish pinprick develop purple bruising meningococcal rash usually confirmed glass test rash fade away meningococcal meningitis form bacterial meningitis meningitis disease caused inflammation irritation meninges membranes surrounding brain

many survivors disease lose limb hearing experience permanent brain sepsis type infection much deadly results severe blood poisoning called meningococcal sepsis affects entire body case bacterial toxins rupture blood vessels rapidly shut vital organs within hours patients health change seemingly good mortally source n meningitidis bacterium surrounded slimy outer coat contains diseasecausing endotoxin many bacteria produce endotoxin levels produced meningococcal bacteria times greater accordingly lethal normal bacteria multiply move bloodstream sheds concentrated amounts toxin endotoxin directly affects heart reducing ability circulate blood also causes pressure blood vessels throughout body blood vessels start hemorrhage major organs like lungs kidneys damagedcitation needed

prevent early onset disease contacts usually recommended following sporadic cases invasive meningococcal disease unlike developed countries subsaharan africa developed countries entire families live single room meningococcal infection usually introduced household asymptomatic person carriage spreads household reaching infants usually one household members infected disease likely occur infants young children lack immunity strain organism circulating subsequently acquire carriage invasive preventing susceptible contacts acquiring infection directly inhibiting colonization close contacts defined persons could intimate contact patients oral secretions kissing sharing food drink importance carrier state meningococcal disease well known developed countries disease transmission usually occurs day care schools large gatherings usually disease transmission could occur meningococcal organism transmitted respiratory droplets susceptible drying postulated close contact necessary transmission therefore disease transmission susceptible person prevented meningitis occurs sporadically throughout year since organism known reservoir outside man asymptomatic carriers usually source additionally basic hygiene measures handwashing sharing drinking cups reduce incidence infection limiting exposure case confirmed close contacts infected person offered antibiotics reduce likelihood infection spreading people however rifampinresistant strains reported indiscriminate use antibiotics contributes problem chemoprophylaxis commonly used close contacts highest risk carrying pathogenic strains since vaccine duration unknown mass select vaccinations may costeffective means controlling transmission meningococcal disease rather mass routine vaccination persons component deficiencies final common complement pathway susceptible n meningitidis infection complementsatisfactory citations estimated risk infection times higher addition complement componentdeficient populations frequently experience frequent meningococcal since immune response natural infection may less complete complement nondeficient inherited properdin deficiency also related increased risk contracting
