varying meal frequency size seen foraging rats forage typically hoard food instead either ingest food found retreat nearby safe space consume depending level perceived threat rat vary frequency foraging size laboratory studies investigating preencounter behaviour density shocks often used represent risk number shocks administered daily random schedule shocks administered per day higher perceived predatory shocks affect rats outside safe nest area get food leave area press lever dispense models reallife situation rat needing leave relative safety nest go foraging common finding perceived threat predation increases frequency foraging decreases size consumed meal increased meal size ensures even though rat leaves safe area search food less often still consumes relatively

postencounter behaviours commonly form jumping vocalizing striking animal successful evading predator found safe location eventually return preferred activity one example extremely successful circastrike defensive behaviour evasive leaping kangaroo kangaroo rats desert dwelling mammals preyed upon venomous sidewinder rattlesnakes strike kangaroo rats exhibit quick forceful circastrike behaviour form leap using hind leaping reaction serves several functions help escape prevent first kangaroo rat able jump within around perceiving incoming snake gives rat ability avoid contact predator together thus allowing escape leap unsuccessful completely avoiding snakes strike still serves purpose preventing fangs jumping action forceful rat may able disrupt snakes striking finally else fails fangs made contact kangaroo rat still able employ evasive leaping behaviour use hind legs forcefully dislodge snakes fangs prevent leaping behaviour serves function preventing escaping contact predator immediately attack therefore consistent circastrike defensive httpsenwikipediaorgwikipredatoryimminencecontinuum
