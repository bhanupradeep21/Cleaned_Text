allostatic load wear tear body accumulates individual exposed repeated chronic stress term coined bruce mcewen eliot stellar represents physiological consequences chronic exposure fluctuating heightened neural neuroendocrine response results repeated prolonged chronic stress term allostatic load wear tear body accumulates individual exposed repeated chronic coined mcewen stellar term part regulatory model allostasis predictive regulation stabilization internal sensations response stimuli ascribed allostasis involves regulation homeostasis body decrease physiological consequences predictive regulation refers brains ability anticipate needs prepare fulfill part efficient regulation reduction uncertainty humans naturally like feeling surprise inevitable constantly strive reduce uncertainty future outcomes allostasis helps us anticipating needs planning satisfy ahead takes considerable amount brains energy fails resolve uncertainty situation may become chronic result accumulation allostatic concept allostatic load provides neuroendocrine cardiovascular neuroenergetic emotional responses become persistently activated blood flow turbulences coronary cerebral arteries high blood pressure atherogenesis cognitive dysfunction depressed mood accelerate disease longstanding effects continuously activated stress responses referred allostatic load allostatic load result permanently altered brain architecture systemic allostatic load minimizes organisms ability cope reduce uncertainty mcewen wingfield propose two types allostatic load different etiologies distinct consequences type allostatic load occurs energy demand exceeds supply resulting activation emergency life history stage serves direct animal away normal life history stages survival mode decreases allostatic load regains positive energy balance normal life cycle resumed perturbation passed typical situations ending type allostasis starvation hibernation critical illness note lifethreatening consequences critical illness may cause consequences allostatic type allostatic load results sufficient even excess energy consumption accompanied social conflict types social

inflammatory cytokines wax wane allostatic load allostatic load chronically high pathologies may develop type allostatic overload trigger escape response counteracted learning changes social whereas types allostatic load associated increased release cortisol catecholamines differentially affect thyroid homeostasis concentrations thyroid hormone triiodothyronine decreased type allostasis elevated type may result interaction type allostatic load set point thyroid special situations may involve blend type type allostatic load examples include exhausting exercise adaptation antarctic allostatic load generally measured composite index indicators cumulative strain several organs tissues primarily biomarkers associated neuroendocrine cardiovascular immune metabolic indices allostatic load diverse across studies frequently assessed differently using different biomarkers different methods assembling allostatic load index allostatic load unique humans may used evaluate physiological effects chronic frequent stress nonhuman primates rat cumulative allostatic load measure rcalm marker allostatic load endocrine system increase repeated levels stress results elevated levels hormone corticotropinreleasing factor crh associated activation hpa axis central stress response system responsible modification inflammatory responses throughout body prolonged stress levels lead decreased levels cortisol morning increased levels afternoon leading greater daily output cortisol long term increases blood sugar levels nervous system structural functional abnormalities result chronic prolonged stress increase stress levels causes shortening dendrites neuron therefore shortening dendrites causes decrease chronic stress also causes greater response fear unlearned nervous system fear immune system increase levels chronic stress results elevation inflammation increase inflammation levels caused ongoing activation sympathetic nervous impairment cellmediated acquired immunity also

allostatic load largest contribution allostatic load effect stress brain allostasis system helps achieve homeostasis regulation physiological processes whereby systems body respond state body external

cumulative lifetime effects types stress type allostatic load represents adaptive response absolute lack energy glutathione several macronutrients also includes predictive responses eg hibernation infection type allostatic load results expected mismatch energy demand supply triggered psychosocial stressors low socioeconomic status major life events environmental association explains increased risk cardiovascular disease chronic conditions like obesity diabetes hypertension psychotic conditions subjects exposed psychosocial trauma social disadvantage sociocultural mechanisms tend augment relation perpetuating disparity even quality health care tends inferior socially disadvantaged population cumulation stressful experiences leads chronic exposure fluctuations neural neuroendocrine responses surpass individuals coping ability result considered allostatic causing factors allostatic load include following continual physiological arousal due chronic stress inadequate coping mechanisms stress response continuing past completion stressor insufficient allostatic response typical allostatic response initiated stressor continues duration stressor shuts stressor ended allostatic load accumulation stressors maladaptive responses may result extreme state stress response longterm impact childhood adversity eg abuse neglect shown lasting effects including increased risk allostatic load regardless type association discrimination allostatic load adulthood health risk behaviors poor eating habits obesity physical inactivity substance use sleep deprivation also considered risk factors allostatic extended activation hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis hpa well autonomic nervous system lead negative impacts biological health similarly structural remodeling eg cellular molecular processes nucleus cell surface cell neural architecture key result stress continues past termination stressor body longer maintaining status homeostasis extended stress response negative human body regulates maintain status homeostasis utilizing allostatic mechanisms extended stress responses continue past duration stressors termination leads failure increased allostatic load constitutes significant health hazard several studies documented strong association allostatic load incidence coronary heart surrogate markers cardiovascular hard endpoints including causespecific allcause mediators connecting allostatic load morbidity mortality include function autonomic nervous cytokines stress hormones eg thyroid biological implications allostatic load include impacts cognitive physical functioning prefrontal cortex hippocampus amygdala regions may specifically impacted reduce manage high allostatic load individual pay attention structural eg social environment access health care behavioral factors eg diet physical health tobacco smoking lead chronic low socioeconomic status ses affects allostatic load therefore focusing causes low ses may reduce allostatic load levels reducing societal polarization material deprivation psychological demands health assists manage allostatic support community social environment manage high allostatic addition healthy lifestyle encompasses broad array lifestyle change including healthy eating regular physical exercise may reduce allostatic empowering financial help government allows people gain control improve psychological improving inequalities health decreases stress levels improves health reducing high allostatic load interventions include encouraging sleep quality quantity social support selfesteem wellbeing improving diet avoiding alcohol drug consumption participating physical providing cleaner safer environments incentive towards higher education reduce chance stress improve mental health significantly therefore reducing onset high allostatic allostatic load differs sex age social status individual protective factors could various times individuals life span implemented reduce stress long run eliminate onset allostatic protective factors include parental bonding education social support healthy workplaces sense meaning towards life choices positive feelings
