dutch company developed tested collaboration leiden university medical center lumc franciscus gasthuis vlietland ggd amsterdam breath test validated prescreening test people mild symptoms april device operational test driveins conferences events ie eurovision song contest subjects must abstain alcohol eight hours prior taking breath testcitation needed spironose contains four sets seven different sensors measure mixture volatile organic compounds biomarkers exhaled air vocs provide picture persons metabolism breath profile forwarded online analysis platform breath profile compared breath
