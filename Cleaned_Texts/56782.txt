robert daviescolley popularly quoted since presentation slipping rib syndrome varies individual present one sides rib cage symptoms appearing primarily abdomen pain commonly presented episodic varies minor nuisance severely impacting quality reported symptoms last minutes one commonly reported symptoms condition sensation popping clicking lower ribs result subluxation cartilaginous individuals srs report intense sharp pain radiate chest back may reproducible pressing affected dull aching sensation also reported affected certain postures movements may exacerbate symptoms stretching reaching coughing sneezing lifting bending sitting sports activities also reports vomiting nausea associated causes slipping rib syndrome although several risk factors suggested condition often accompanies history physical trauma observation could explain reports condition among athletes increased risk trauma especially certain fullcontact sports hockey wrestling american also reports slipping rib syndrome among athletes swimmers could plausibly result repetitive upper body movements coupled high physical reported incidents history traumatic impact chest wall described considered gradual slipping rib syndrome may also result presence birth defect unstable bifid generalized hypermobility also suggested possible risk diagnosing slipping rib syndrome predominantly physical examination affected rib commonly utilized technique known hooking maneuver commonly used amongst medical professionals diagnose slipping rib syndrome examiner hook fingers costal margin pull anterior outward superior upward direction positive result movement pain replicated plain radiographs ct scans mri standard ultrasound unable visualize cartilage affected srs however often used exclude dynamic ultrasound occasionally used evaluate dynamic laxity displacement however said much superior physical examination experienced physician diagnosis dependent technicians expertise knowledge positive result dynamic ultrasound slipping rib syndrome requires observed subluxation cartilage may elicited valsalva crunch nerve blocking injections also utilized diagnostic method noting absence pain following injection intercostal nerves affected slipping rib syndrome often confused costochondritis tietze syndrome also involve cartilage thoracic wall costochondritis common cause chest pain consisting chest pain complaints emergency departments pain typically diffused upper costochondral sternocostal junctions frequently involved unlike slipping rib syndrome involves lower rib cage tietze syndrome differs conditions often associated swelling swelling costochondral sternocostal sternoclavicular joints whereas individuals slipping rib syndrome costochondritis exhibit swelling tietze syndrome typically involves second third ribs usually result infectious rheumatologic neoplastic condition referred twelfth rib syndrome similar slipping rib syndrome however affects floating ribs attachments sternum researchers classify slipping rib syndrome twelfth rib syndrome group referred painful rib syndrome others classify twelfth rib syndrome subtype slipping rib syndrome considering two separate conditions altogether two disorders different presentation diagnostic criteria diagnosis twelfth rib syndrome include hooking maneuver typically presents lower back abdominal groin differential diagnosis includes pleurisy rib fracture gastric ulcer cholecystitis esophagitis hepatosplenic treatment modalities slipping rib syndrome range conservative measures surgical procedures conservative measures often first forms treatment offered patients slipping rib syndrome especially symptoms often patients reassured recommended limit activity use ice take pain medication nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs measures osteopathic manipulation treatment omt physical therapy chiropractic treatment acupuncture noninvasive methods used treat srs goal treatments typically relief symptom management topical medications occasionally used diclofenac gel lidocaine transdermal patches noted provide temporary relief minimally invasive procedures used individuals moderate slipping rib nerve blocking injections consisting steroidal local anesthetic agents commonly reported treatment avoid surgical minimally invasive intervention seen temporary repeated injections necessary prevent resurgence surgical intervention often performed cases treatment modalities failed provide types surgical procedures noted current literature costal cartilage removal rib resection laparoscopic costal cartilage removal rib stabilization costal cartilage removal excision first attempted daviescolley technique used several surgeons since method surgical repair includes removal cartilage affected sternum boned portion rib without preserving perichondrium rib resection differentiates costal cartilage removal removes small bone portion affected laparoscopic costal cartilage removal minimally invasive intraabdominal approach treating condition affected cartilage excised sternocostal junction costochondral noted within studies performed procedures individuals may experience recurrence alternative technique known rib stabilization plating used prevent subluxation affected ribs preserving thorax mobility first used treat individuals undergone previous resection surgeries experienced recurrence symptoms procedure ribs stabilized using bioabsorbable plate anchored onto stable nonaffected rib located affected ribs plates vertically placed onto ribs secured using nonabsorbable recent technique rib stabilization suturing colloquially known hansen method creator used bring affected ribs normal anatomy method uses orthopedic tape suture tie slipped rib around higher unaffected ribs stabilize method similar concept aforementioned method stabilization plating however suture slipping rib syndrome considered underdiagnosed frequently past literature noted condition rare uncommon one study estimated srs clinical diagnoses new patients general medicine clinic specialty gastroenterology clinic prevalence even higher patients referred specialty

gender distribution others report condition occur often suggested researchers hormonal connection hormones increased ligament laxity observed females pregnancy though theory yet upheld slipping rib syndrome first mentioned edgar ferdinand cyriax orthopedic physician physiotherapist described chest pain associated popping clicking condition originally named cyriax syndrome used multiple names since including clicking rib syndrome painful rib syndrome interchondral subluxation displaced name slipping rib syndrome first used surgeon robert daviescolley gained popularity becoming commonly
