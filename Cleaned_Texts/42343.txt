plasma cells also called plasma b cells effector b cells white blood cells originate lymphoid organs b secrete large quantities proteins called antibodies response presented specific substances called antigens antibodies transported plasma cells blood plasma lymphatic system site target antigen foreign substance initiate neutralization destruction b cells differentiate plasma cells produce antibody
