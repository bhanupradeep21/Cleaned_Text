volia extinct monospecific genus mekosuchine crocodylian closely related mekosuchus trilophosuchus volia known collection largely fragmentary remains including skull bones limbs recovered voli voli wainibuku caves viti levu fiji similar remains found naigani around metres ft long making largest predatory animal island subsequently likely apex predator pleistocene ecosystems fiji may fed giant iguanas flightless birds even fish like closest relatives may terrestrial todays crocodiles fossils volia athollandersoni type currently known species found volivoli wainibuku caves viti levu island remains uncovered paleontologist trevor worthy archaeologist atholl anderson searched viti levu potential fossil deposits specifically focusing areas limestone deposits include pleistocene voli voli cave near sigatoka river wainibuku cave unknown age located far capital city suva sites yielded large number fragmentary remains belonging skull body animal however material scattered disarticulated clear many animals present based little material overlapped fossils collected appear represent minimum five individuals additionally due unknown age wainibuku cave possible unlikely remains could belong one species molnar worthy willis argue however unlikely given relatively great size volia small size fiji holotype recovered wainibuku cave voli voli cave yielded first largest fossils holotype housed collection museum new zealand te papa later research also discovered additional osteoderm tooth skull fragment island due fragmentary nature could confidently referred volia however anatomy tooth favors idea naigani crocodile volia another mekosuchine rather modern name volia derived voli voli cave species named new zealand archaeologist atholl little known rostrum volia except part premaxilla preserves singular tooth socket part nares showing opened towards top side like mekosuchus snout proportionally deeper todays saltwater crocodile appears ended abruptly tip rostrum rim eye sockets strongly raised frontal bone forms prominent eyes squamosal bone features prominent sulcus contributes supratemporal fenestrae lacks specific process present closely related mekosuchus trilophosuchus modern saltwater crocodiles one notable feature squamosal presence prominent foramina within groove along side element purpose said foramina understood thought increased blood flow part skull potentially earflaps associated lower jaw shows prominent festooning term used describe wavelike appearance crocodile jaws volia expressed two prominent rises toothrow topped fourth tenth dentary teeth respectively typical crocodiles fourth dentary tooth much larger surrounding tip lower jaw mandibular symphysis relatively low flat raised slightly raised rim first dentary tooth external mandibular fenestra oval slightly inclined lower jaw volia notably shallower closely related species genus mekosuchus mandible expands greatly towards back creating large attachment area mandibular adductor form teeth varies depending position within jaw include large conical teeth flexed somewhat inward oval crosssection base grows gradually dshaped towards top crown due asymmetrical cutting edges called carinae second type large tooth crown also present appearing much subtle outwards curving towards tip conical teeth interpreted located front jaw followed series smaller teeth broader laterally compressed flattened sidetoside carinae possess marked ridges said ridges give teeth serrated appearance truly ziphodont like quinkana even back jaw teeth become smaller broader still lacking distinct carinae ridges preceding multiple fossils limbs known generally resemble modern crocodiles one notable exception ulnare differs greatly extant saltwater crocodile several aspects articular facet connects forearm much broader entire bone long shows different outline crosssection bone elliptical articular facet would connect bones hand shaped like trochlea concave saltwater crocodiles especially last stands puts joints closer together may allow hingelike joint motion something thought important implications animals cave deposits yielded bones volia also yielded large quantity isolated osteoderms thought belonged genus recovered osteoderms generally assigned one five different morphotypes compared modern spectacled caiman saltwater crocodile indicating likely formed armor neck torso overall found similar aforementioned caiman exact match found regardless among osteoderms several rectangular bones low keel thought formed dorsal armour torso possess shelf type overlaps neighbouring osteoderms osteoderms comparable australosuchus exception latter lacked shelf articulation similar smaller type dorsal osteoderm also known differing aspects ornamentation third type distinct two oval shape prominent keel running length thought covered neck possibly located behind occiput two osteoderm types also thought placed along neck life larger postoccipital osteoderms consisting subtriangular elements osteoderms pronounced keels likely protruded side cervical size volia entirely understood due fragmentary nature much material unclear age many specimens may largely represent juveniles given way fossils disarticulated molnar worthy willis attempted determine size one particular individual comparing preserved femur bone saltwater crocodile assuming two animals shared similar proportions would indicate volia may reached length ft ft years leading description volia studies increasingly shown islands south pacific part inhabited small crocodilians family mekosuchinae mekosuchine research early stages time molnar colleagues note several features shared volia tentatively suggesting close relative quinkana mekosuchus trilophosuchus outside later studies description new mekosuchine taxa gradually improved understanding family certain relationships slowly becoming clearer description kalthifrons yates pledge volia recovered sister taxon mekosuchus trilophosuchus slightly basal quinkana part large polytomy due poor resolution basal mekosuchines tip dating study combining morphological molecular dna sequencing stratigraphic fossil age data lee yates recover slightly different results tree better resolved found volia mekosuchus successive sister taxa clade formed trilophosuchus even recent publication volia mekosuchus found sister taxa derived trilophosuchus significant change compared prior analysis study found quinkana part grouping instead clading baru phylogenetic trees lee yates ristevski et al shown kambara kambara

possible volia like closely related mekosuchus terrestrial evidence may found anatomy distal ulnare hingelike joint motion possible indicating better adapted moving land relative modern saltwater crocodile compared may advantage islands fiji today lacks terrestrial predators subsequently speculated niche could filled volia pleistocene possibly holocene preying iguanas like lapitiguana large birds like megavitiornis altirostris possibly pointed slender front teeth blunt laterally compressed back teeth could used crush bones birds frogs alike another possibility back teeth particular used crush hard yet thin prey shells snails cuticles insects diet hardshelled invertebrates also suggested mekosuchus inexpectatus possible adductor muscle jaw responsible closing mouth less complex modern crocodiles however likewise possible simply result examined material belonged juvenile animal hadnt yet fully developed part thought volia inhabited fiji pleistocene however possible may given limited range animal endemic islands would especially vulnerable changes ecosystem including caused human settlement however direct evidence human settlers hunted volia leaving precise cause extinction
