financing round led hong kongbased prosnav capital stated goal bringing funding support operations commercialization years ceo rodney turner succeeded albrecht ayoxxas protein chip microarray technology enables detection large number diseases protein analysis single droplet blood bodily technology contrasts previously established methods restricted single point testing requiring considerable amounts biological sample limiting amount analytes tested instead yielding one data point time case classic elisa new technology provides data efficient labor input using samples microliters µl range x multiplex technology approaches level analytical power throughput accuracy previously seen dna sequencing protein chip made silicon used identify qualify protein markers cancer allergies cardiovascular infectious simultaneously identifies multiple analytes interactions technology developed run manually well fully automated giving results quickly highthroughput yielding large amounts data development technology especially directed support biomedical research academic industry longerterm uses pharmaceutical screening preclinical microarrays built cm x cm silicon base plate biochip dozens separate wells containers located top one offering capacity ul used incubate reagents blocking washing solutions macrowells contain thousands microwells bottom measuring diameter single strand human wells chip filled antibodies proteins linked microspheres reside antibodies nature produced immune cells bind specifically antigens surface viruses bacteria diseased cells clear prevent health damages body since antibodies highly specific proteins binding specific antigens exploited identify measure protein biomarkers immunoassays eg since different antibodies bind antigens affinity exploited protein analytics filling wells thousands antibodies observing much target antigen present sample ayoxxas biochip used identify thousands different proteins single sample including markers

electronically analyze generate data different molecules proteins present technology centers patented insitu encoded beadbased arrays originally developed national university singapore nus ayoxxa made exclusive unlike available beadbased microarrays ieba achieves greater multiplexing capability recording position randomly distributed beads without need physical labels bead identification using instead assignment unique coordinates bead inhouse batches different beads batch assay capture site specific biomolecule applied sequentially creating unique pattern every well coordinates individual bead sequential batch recorded large mapdecoding data table provided user alongside carrier like usb flashdrive assay follows sandwich elisa principle read based fluorescent reporter introduced final step assay following imaging using fluorescence microscope technology reacted chip companys analysis software identifies individual beads according unique signals later decrypted companys software deliver customized report approach significantly reduces complexity downstream analysis increasing number individual protein targets analyzed low sample ayoxxa stated focus developing open adaptable ieba platform easily incorporated laboratories compatible existing laboratory technology researchers accustomed using furthermore ieba developed run automated liquid handling systems used highthroughput screening also stated aim making ieba open platform adaptable diverse research ayoxxas ceo andreas schmidt compared companys open platform philosophy itunes iphone many different apps different biomarkers run iphone ayoxxa ibeas used low sample numbers standard well plate format basically advanced elisa keeping current standards arrays designed readily adaptable standard high
