hypermobility also known doublejointedness describes joints stretch farther normal example hypermobile people bend thumbs backwards wrists bend knee joints backwards put leg behind head perform contortionist tricks affect one joints throughout body hypermobile joints common occur minority people pain symptoms present may sign known joint hypermobility syndrome recently hypermobility spectrum disorder hsd hypermobile joints feature genetic connective tissue disorders hypermobility spectrum disorder hsd syndromes eds new diagnostic criteria introduced hypermobility syndrome sometimes considered identical hypermobile syndrome heds formerly called eds type genetic test distinguish two conditions similarity diagnostic criteria recommended treatments many experts recommend recognized

hypermobile joints doubledextra sense people hypermobility symptoms approximately healthy population one hypermobile joints however people joint hypermobility syndrome subject many difficulties example joints may easily injured prone complete dislocation due weakly stabilized joint may develop problems muscle fatigue muscles must work harder compensate weakness ligaments support joints

mutations cases occur people history disorder family dermatosparaxis kyphoscoliosis types eds cases classic hypermobility forms inherited autosomal recessive pattern autosomal recessive inheritance two copies gene cell altered often parents individual autosomal recessive disorder carriers one copy altered gene show signs symptoms disorder july hypermobility diagnosed using beighton criteria criteria changed still involve beighton beighton criteria replace beighton score instead use previous score conjunction symptoms criteria hms diagnosed presence either two major criteria one major two

individual prevent recurrent injuries regular exercise exercise supervised physician physical therapist reduce symptoms strong muscles increase dynamic joint stability lowimpact exercise closed kinetic chain exercises usually recommended less likely cause injury compared highimpact exercise contact sports heat cold treatment help temporarily relieve pain aching joints muscles address underlying problems medication primary treatment hypermobility used adjunct treatment related joint pain nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs primary medications choice narcotics recommended primary longterm treatment reserved shortterm use acute injury people hypermobility lifestyle changes decrease symptom severity general activity increases pain avoided example hypermobile joints occur
