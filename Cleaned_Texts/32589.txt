cavernous hemangioma also called cavernous angioma venous malformation type venous malformation due endothelial dysmorphogenesis lesion present birth cavernoma brain called cerebral cavernous malformation ccm despite designation hemangioma cavernous hemangioma tumor display endothelial hyperplasia abnormal tissue causes slowing blood flow cavities caverns blood vessels form necessary junctions surrounding cells structural support smooth muscle hindered causing leakage surrounding tissue leakage blood referred hemorrhage causes variety symptoms known associated condition people condition brain may may experience symptoms complications condition lifethreatening cause major disruptions normal functioning dangerous seizures due compression brain bleeding inside brain tissue vision problems difficulty speaking using words memory loss ataxia hydrocephalus occur less serious symptoms may include headaches weakness numbness arms legs though symptoms alone indicate person condition eye may cause disruption damage extraocular muscles optic nerve may manifest double vision progressive proptosis decreased visual acuity vision changes lead partial complete blindness condition occurs liver usually cause symptoms may experience pain upper right abdomen feeling fullness eating small amount food decreased appetite nausea cavernous hemangiomas arise nearly anywhere body blood vessels sometimes described resembling raspberries appearance bubblelike caverns unlike capillary hemangiomas cavernous ones lifethreatening regress cases cavernomas thought congenital however develop course definitive cause research suggests genetic mutations result condition congenital hemangiomas appear skin known either vascular red birthmarks familial cerebral cavernous

contact cortex represent potential seizure focus patient unlike cavernous hemangiomas tissue within malformation borders encapsulated therefore change size number cavernous hemangiomas erroneously called common benign tumors usually one malformation exists multiple lesions occur left right lobe liver sizes range millimeters centimetres cm often referred giant lesions better classified venous malformations eye known orbital cavernous hemangioma found women frequently men commonly ages neoplasm usually located within muscle cone lateral optic nerve usually treated unless patient symptomatic visual impairment happens optic nerve compressed extraocular muscles surrounded several known causes cavernous hemangiomas cases still unknown radiation treatment used medical conditions suggested cause cavernous malformation hemangioma tumors result rapid proliferation endothelial cells pericytic hyperplasia enlargement tissue result abnormal cell division pericytes pathogenesis hemangioma still understood suggested growth factors hormonal influences contribute abnormal cell proliferation cavernous liver hemangiomas commonly diagnosed women result believed estrogen levels may play role incidence liver cavernomas genetic studies show specific gene mutations deletions causes disease genes identified cerebral cavernous hemangiomas malformations also also malcavernin also loss function genes believed responsible cerebral cavernous furthermore also believed second hit mutation necessary onset disease means mutation one two genes present chromosome enough cause cavernous malformation mutation alleles would cause malformation additionally research hemangiomas general shown loss heterozygosity common tissue hemangioma would confirm single allele mutation needed abnormal cell proliferation shown act transcription factor development arterial blood vessels mice overlapping structure acts scaffolding protein expressed genes involved thus appear part pathway shown cause embryonic death mice lastly gene shown similar expression suggesting link functionality currently experiments determined exact lack function genes control proliferative signaling pathway would result uncontrolled proliferation development tumor theorized proliferation endothelial cells dysfunctional tight junctions increased endothelial stress elevated venous pressure provides pathophysiological basis cavernous hemangioma gradientecho magnetic resonance imaging mri sensitive method diagnosing cavernous mri powerful tool diagnosis led increase diagnosis cavernous hemangiomas since technologys advent radiographic appearance commonly described popcorn computed tomography ct scanning sensitive specific method diagnosing cavernous angiography typically necessary unless required rule diagnoses additionally biopsies obtained tumor tissue examination microscope essential diagnose cavernous hemangioma treatments lesions less aggressive cancerous tumors angiosarcoma however since mri appearance practically pathognomonic biopsy rarely needed ultrasound cavernous haemangiomas liver appeared homogenous hyperechoic lesions posterior acoustic enhancement ct mri scans shows peripheral globularnodular enhancement arterial phase portions attenuation enhancing areas portal venous phase shows progressive centripetal enhancement delayed phase shows retention contrast shows high signal weighted asymptomatic lesions may require treatment may need monitored change size change size lesions nose lips eyelids treated steroid drugs slow progress steroids taken orally injected directly tumor applying pressure tumor also used minimize swelling site hemangioma procedure uses small particles close blood supply known sclerotherapy allows tumor shrinkage less pain possible tumor regrow blood supply procedure lesion caused cavernous hemangioma destroying healthy tissue around patient experiencing major symptoms surgery used remove cavernoma common complication surgery hemorrhage loss blood also possibility hemangioma reoccurring additionally risk stroke death also treatments cerebral cavernous hemangiomas include radiosurgery treatment approach depends site size symptoms present well history hemorrhage microsurgery generally preferred cerebral cavernous hemangioma superficial central nervous system risk damage surrounding tissue irradiation high additionally large hemorrhage deterioration patient intractable symptoms seizures coma indications microsurgical intervention gammaknife radiation favored mechanism radiosurgery provides precise radiation dose cerebral cavernous hemangioma relatively sparing surrounding treatment approaches cavernous hemangiomas regions body limited research studies worked providing details related outlook disease progression two studies show year people never bleeding brain cavernoma symptoms seizures affected contrast patients bleeding brain cavernoma past higher risk affected subsequent bleeding statistics broad ranging additional studies suggest women patients age higher risk bleeding similar conducted studies reach however cavernous hemangiomas completely excised little risk growth terms life expectancy enough data collected
