snake skeleton consists primarily skull vertebrae ribs vestigial remnants limbs skull snake complex structure numerous joints allow snake swallow prey far larger head typical snake skull solidly ossified braincase separate frontal bones united parietal bones extending downward basisphenoid large extends forward rostrum extending ethmoidal region nose less ossified paired nasal bones often attached base occipital condyle either trilobate formed basioccipital exoccipitals simple knob formed basioccipital supraoccipital excluded foramen magnum basioccipital may bear curved ventral process hypapophysis vipers prefrontal bone situated side frontal bone maxilla may may contact nasal bone postfrontal bone usually present borders orbit behind rarely also pythons supraorbital bone intercalated prefrontal bone premaxillary bone single small rule connected maxillary ligament paired vomer narrow palatine bone pterygoid long parallel axis skull latter diverging behind extending quadrate articular extremity mandible pterygoid connected maxillary ectopterygoid transverse bone may long maxillary often emits process towards palatine latter bone usually produced inwards upwards towards anterior extremity basisphenoid quadrate usually large elongate attached cranium supratemporal often regarded squamosal rare cases polemon transverse bone forked articulates two branches maxilla quadrate maxillary palatopterygoid arches less movable allow distension required passage prey often much exceeding size mouth reason rami lower jaw consist dentary splenial angular articular elements addition coronoid boas small families connected symphysis extensible elastic ligament hyoid apparatus reduced pair cartilaginous filaments situated trachea united front various modifications according genera large hole may present frontal bones basisphenoid psammophis coelopeltis maxillary may much abbreviated movable vertically viperidae pterygoids may taper converge posteriorly without connection quadrate amblycephalidae supratemporal may much reduced wedged adjacent bones cranium quadrate may short extremely large prefrontals may join median suture front frontals dentary may freely movable detached articular posteriorly deviation normal type much greater still consider degraded wormlike members families typhlopidae glauconiidae skull compact maxillary much reduced former bone loosely attached lower aspect cranium latter borders mouth suturally joined premaxillary prefrontal transverse bone supratemporal absent coronoid element present mandible snakes teeth located dentary lower jaw maxilla palatine bone lateral pterygoid plate latter form inner row teeth move separately rest jaws used help walk jaws prey several snake lineages evolved venom typically delivered specialized teeth called fangs located maxilla snakes placed one four groups based teeth correlate strongly venom lineage aglyphous snakes lacking grooves specialized teeth tooth similar shape often size teeth vary size bird eaters vary shape aglyphous snakes nonvenomous like thamnophis considered mildly venomous feature synapomorphy opisthoglyphous rearward grooves snakes possess venom injected pair enlarged teeth back maxillae normally angle backward grooved channel venom puncture since fangs located front mouth arrangement vernacularly called rearfanged order envenomate prey opisthoglyphous snake must move prey rear mouth penetrate fangs presenting difficulties large prey although quickly move smaller prey position opisthoglyphous dentition appears least two times history venom opisthoglyphous snakes strong enough harm humans notably herpetologists karl schmidt robert mertens killed boomslang twig snake respectively underestimated effects bite failed seek medical helpcitation needed opisthoglyphous snakes found mostly families colubridae homalopsidae proteroglyphous snakes forward grooved shortened maxillae bearing teeth except substantially enlarged fang pointing downwards completely folded around venom channel forming hollow needle fangs fraction inch long even largest species snakes must hang least momentarily inject spitting cobras modified fang tips allowing spray venom attackers eyes form dentition unique elapids solenoglyphous snakes pipe grooved advanced venom delivery method snake maxilla reduced nub supporting single hollow fang tooth fangs long half length head folded roof mouth pointing posteriorly skull series interacting elements ensure fangs rotate biting position jaws open solenoglyphous snakes open mouths almost degrees fangs swing position allow penetrate deep prey solenoglyph venom typically less toxic proteroglyphs system allows deeply inject large quantities venom form dentition unique vipers snakes conform categories atractaspis solenoglyphous fangs swing sideways allowing strike without opening mouth perhaps allowing hunt small tunnels scolecophidia blind burrowing snakes typically teeth often upper lower jaw common names various types snake dentition originate largely older literature still encountered informal publications aglyphous snakes commonly called fangless opisthoglyphous snakes rearfanged backfanged proteroglyphous solenoglyphous snakes referred modifications skull european genera vertebral column consists atlas composed two vertebrae without ribs numerous precaudal vertebrae except first first three bear long movable curved ribs small posterior tubercle base last ribs sometimes forked two ten socalled lumbar vertebrae without ribs bifurcate transverse processes lymphapophyses enclosing lymphatic vessels number ribless caudal vertebrae simple transverse processes bifid ribs transverse processes branches regularly superposed centra usual ball socket joint nearly hemispherical transversely elliptic condyle back procoelous vertebrae neural arch provided additional articular surfaces form pre postzygapophyses broad flattened overlapping pair anterior wedgeshaped processes called zygosphene fitting pair corresponding concavities zygantrum base neural spine thus vertebrae snakes articulate eight joints addition cupandball centrum interlock parts reciprocally receiving entering one another like mortise tenon joints precaudal vertebrae less high neural spine rare exception xenopholis may expanded platelike short moderately long transverse processes ribs attached single facet centra anterior vertebrae emit less developed descending processes haemapophyses sometimes continued throughout tropidonotus vipera ancistrodon among european genera caudal region elongate transverse processes take place ribs haemapophyses paired one side haemal canal rattlesnakes seven eight last vertebrae enlarged fused one living snake shows remains
