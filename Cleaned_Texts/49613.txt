hypoxic ventilatory response hvr increase ventilation induced hypoxia allows body take transport lower concentrations oxygen higher rates initially elevated lowlanders travel high altitude reduces significantly time people biological anthropology hvr also refers human adaptation environmental stresses resulting high mammals hvr invokes several physiological mechanisms direct result decrease partial pressure oxygen arterial blood leads increased ventilation body different ways coping acute hypoxia mammals rely pulmonary ventilation increase ventilation account lack oxygen reaching mammals

populations living high altitudes range cultural genetic vary among populations example tibetans living high altitudes sensitive hypoxic ventilatory response andean peoples living similar even though populations exhibit greater aerobic capacity compared cause difference likely genetic although developmental factors may also first stage hypoxic ventilatory response consists initial reaction hypoxic
