winged scapula scapula alata skeletal medical condition shoulder blade protrudes persons back abnormal position rare conditions potential lead limited functional activity upper extremity adjacent affect persons ability lift pull push weighty objects serious cases ability perform activities daily living changing ones clothes washing ones hair may hindered name condition comes appearance winglike resemblance due medial border scapula sticking straight back scapular winging observed disrupt scapulohumeral rhythm contributing decreased flexion abduction upper extremity well loss power source considerable winged scapula considered normal posture young children older children adults severity appearance winged scapula varies individuals well muscles andor nerves pain seen every case study individuals facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy fshd none individuals complained pain fatigue however common characteristic noted limitations activities daily cases winged scapula damage serratus anterior muscle causes deformation back serratus anterior muscle attaches medial anterior aspect scapula ie attaches side closest spine runs along side scapula faces ribcage normally anchors scapula rib cage serratus anterior contracts upward rotation abduction weak elevation scapula occurs allowing arm raised long thoracic nerve innervates serratus anterior therefore damage impingement nerve result weakening paralysis occurs scapula may slip away rib cage giving winglike appearance upper back characteristic may particularly seen affected person pushes resistance person may also limited ability lift arm head fshd winged scapula detected contraction glenohumeral joint movement glenohumeral joint atypically concurrently abducts scapula internally winging scapula divided two categories medial lateral according direction medial winging common caused serratus anterior typically due damage ie lesions long thoracic nerve supplies serratus anterior located side thorax acts pull scapula forward serratus anterior palsy dysfunction characteristic traumatic nontraumatic idiopathic injury long thoracic second category lateral winging caused injury spinal accessory nerve severe atrophy trapezius seen accidental damage spinal accessory nerve lymph node biopsy neck numerous ways long thoracic nerve sustain traumainduced injury include limited blunt trauma eg blow neck shoulder sudden depression shoulder girdle unusual twisting neck shoulder repetitive movements observed athletic activities weight lifting sports involve throwing excessive compression shoulder area straps see backpack palsy various household activities eg gardening digging car washing prolonged abduction arms sleeping propping head read etc sometimes structures body inflamed enlarged subcoracoid subscapular bursa press nerve clinical treatments may also cause injury long thoracic nerve iatrogenesis forceful manipulation mastectomies axillary node dissection surgical treatment spontaneous pneumothorax postgeneral anesthesia various clinical reasons electrical shock amongst nontraumatic induced injury long thoracic nerve includes limited causes viral illness eg influenza tonsillitisbronchitis polio allergicdrug reactions drug overdose toxic exposure eg herbicides tetanus radiculopathy coarctation secondary serratus anterior palsy winged scapula also caused trapezius rhomboid muscle palsy involving accessory nerve dorsal scapular nerve though common causes winged scapula due serratus anterior palsy less commonly trapezius rhomboid palsy still circumstances present ailment incidences include direct injuries scapulothoracic muscles ie trapezius rhomboid muscles structural abnormalities eg rotator cuff pathology shoulder instability addition history exam recommended perform projectional radiography neck chest shoulder thoracic inlet rule structural abnormalities malunited greenstick computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri rarely indicated may useful rule certain diagnoses suspected neurofibromatosisrelated injury intervertebral disc disorder radiculopathy variety classifications winged scapula likewise several treatment options strength training particularly serratus anterior may recommended muscle responsible holding medial scapula close rib cage severe cases physical therapy help strengthening related muscles physical therapy constitutes treatment options weakness glenohumeral joint muscles muscles contract clinically symptoms continue severe months surgery may next physical therapy winged scapula usually incorporate exercises aimed strengthening serratus anterior pushup plus pup exercise one commonly prescribed strengthening serratus anterior pushup plus usually done either pushup position either wall progressed floor full scapular protraction plus added full elbow extension end usual pushup exercise plus phase pup exercise shown elicit highest average serratus anterior electromyographic emg activity compared saactivating closed kinetic chain surgical options include neurolysis chordotomy intercostal nerve transfer nerve lesion cause winging scapular winging amenable nerve repair tendon transfer option pectoralis major transfer done isolated serratus anterior palsy edenlange procedure done isolated trapezius palsy tendon transfer feasible case muscular dystrophy multiple muscular deficits remaining options include scapulothoracic fusion also known scapulodesis induces bony fusion scapula rib cage scapulothoracic fixation without arthrodesis even though scapulothoracic fusion shown successful outcomes complications present patients observed kord et winged scapula due serratus anterior palsy rare one report fardin et al incidence cases patients seen electromyographical laboratory another report overpeck ghormley one case patients observed mayo clinic yet another report remak three diagnoses serratus anterior paralysis throughout series neurological
