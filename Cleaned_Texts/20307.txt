waxes fatty acids unsaturation occurs mainly double bonds reactive towards halogens iodine case thus higher iodine value unsaturations present seen table coconut oil saturated means good making soap hand linseed oil highly unsaturated makes drying oil well suited making oil paints determination iodine value particular example iodometry solution iodine yellowbrown color added solution tested
