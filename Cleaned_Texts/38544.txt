intestinal ischemia medical condition injury large small intestine occurs due enough blood come suddenly known acute intestinal ischemia gradually known chronic intestinal acute form disease often presents sudden severe abdominal pain associated high risk chronic form typically presents gradually abdominal pain eating unintentional weight loss vomiting fear risk factors acute intestinal ischemia include atrial fibrillation heart failure chronic kidney failure prone forming blood clots previous myocardial four mechanisms poor blood flow occurs blood clot elsewhere getting lodged artery new blood clot forming artery blood clot forming superior mesenteric vein insufficient blood flow due low blood pressure spasms chronic disease risk factor acute best method diagnosis angiography computed tomography ct used treatment acute ischemia may include stenting medications break clot provided site obstruction interventional open surgery may also used remove bypass obstruction may required remove intestines may rapidly treated outcomes often among affected even treatment risk death chronic disease bypass surgery treatment thrombosis vein may treated anticoagulation heparin warfarin surgery used acute intestinal ischemia affects five per hundred thousand people per year developed chronic intestinal ischemia affects one per hundred thousand people affected years rates equal males females intestinal ischemia first described always present often overlapping three progressive phases intestinal ischemia symptoms intestinal ischemia vary acute especially subacute case series report prevalence clinical findings provide best available yet biased estimate sensitivity clinical series patients intestinal ischemia due mixed absence adequate quantitative studies guide diagnosis various heuristics help guide diagnosis difficult diagnose intestinal ischemia series patients intestinal ischemia due mixed early extensive acute intestinal ischemia elevated lactate white blood cell count may yet present extensive mesenteric ischemia bowel may ischemic separated blood flow byproducts ischemia yet number devices used assess sufficiency oxygen delivery colon earliest devices based tonometry required time equilibrate estimate phi roughly estimate local levels first device approved us fda used visible light spectroscopy analyze capillary oxygen levels use aortic aneurysm repair detected colon oxygen levels fell sustainable levels allowing realtime repair several studies specificity chronic intestinal ischemia higher acute colonic ischemia sensitivity device must placed using endoscopy findings gastroscopy may include edematous gastric finding colonoscopy may include fragile segmental longitudinal loss plain xrays often normal show nonspecific computed tomography ct scan often accuracy ct scan depends whether small bowel obstruction sbo sbo absent sbo present early findings ct scan include embolic acute intestinal ischemia ctangiography great value diagnosis treatment may reveal emboli lodged superior mesenteric artery well presence absence distal mesenteric late findings indicate dead bowel include cause ischemia due embolic thrombotic occlusion mesenteric vessels nonocclusive ischemia best way differentiate etiologies use mesenteric angiography though serious risks angiography provides possibility direct infusion vasodilators setting nonocclusive treatment intestinal ischemia depends cause medical surgical however bowel become necrotic treatment surgical removal dead segments nonocclusive

term mesenteric ischemia generally defined ischemia small bowel also defined poor circulation vessels supplying blood flow several mesenteric organs including stomach liver colon ischemia large intestine colon termed ischemic colitis although uncommon general population ischemic colitis occurs greater frequency elderly common form bowel causes reduced blood flow include changes systemic

supportively recover fully minority severe ischemia may develop sepsis become sometimes fatally patients mild moderate ischemic colitis usually treated iv fluids analgesia bowel rest food water mouth symptoms resolve severe ischemia develop complications sepsis intestinal gangrene bowel perforation may require aggressive interventions surgery intensive care patients make full recovery occasionally
