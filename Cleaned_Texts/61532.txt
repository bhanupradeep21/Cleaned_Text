vasodilation also known vasorelaxation widening blood results relaxation smooth muscle cells within vessel walls particular large veins large arteries smaller arterioles process opposite vasoconstriction narrowing blood vessels blood vessels dilate flow blood increased due decrease vascular resistance increase cardiac outputfurther explanation needed therefore dilation arterial blood vessels mainly arteriolescitation needed decreases blood pressure response may intrinsic due local processes surrounding tissue extrinsic due hormones nervous system addition response may localized specific organ depending metabolic needs particular tissue strenuous exercise may systemic seen throughout entire systemic circulation endogenous substances drugs cause vasodilation termed vasodilators vasoactivity necessary homeostasis keeping body running normally primary function vasodilation increase blood flow body tissues need often response localized need oxygen occur tissue question receiving enough glucose lipids nutrients localized tissues multiple ways increase blood flow including releasing vasodilators primarily adenosine local interstitial fluid diffuses capillary beds provoking local physiologists suggested lack oxygen causes capillary beds vasodilate smooth muscle hypoxia vessels region latter hypothesis posited due presence precapillary sphincters capillary
