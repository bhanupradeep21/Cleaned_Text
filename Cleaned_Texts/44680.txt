membranes gibbon bedfords paper also stated human spermatozoa would even attach zona surface nonhominoid primates baboon rhesus monkey squirrel monkey concluding although specificity human spermatozoa confined homo sapiens sapiens alone probably restricted hominoidea however opposite direction closely related species found human sperm binds gorilla oocytes almost ease human hybridization members

distance humans monkeys versus humans chimpanzees considered unlikely true humanmonkey hybrids could brought term however feasible humancompatible organs transplantation could grown evidence complex speciation process split different chromosomes appear split different times suggesting largescale hybridization may taken place period much four million years leading emergence distinct human chimpanzee lineages late six million years similarity x chromosome humans chimpanzees might suggest hybridization taking place late four million years ago however mechanisms natural selection x chromosome last common ancestor may also explain apparent short divergence time x hypothesized peculiar features homo naledi may due descendants relatively recent hybridization event homo
