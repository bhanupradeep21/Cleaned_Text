mathematician dusa mcduff early waddington many embryologists looked molecules would induce amphibian neural tube search beyond technology time embryologists moved away deep problems waddington however came view answers embryology lay genetics went thomas hunt morgans drosophila laboratory california even though time embryologists felt genes unimportant played role minor phenomena eye colour late waddington produced formal models gene regulatory products could generate developmental phenomena showed mechanisms underpinning drosophila development could studied systematic analysis mutations affected development drosophila winga period great creativity end also discovered mutations affected cell phenotypes wrote first textbook developmental epigenetics term meant external manifestation genetic activity waddington introduced concept canalisation ability organism produce phenotype despite variation genotype environment also identified mechanism called genetic assimilation would allow animals response environmental stress become fixed part developmental repertoire went show mechanism would work waddington founded centre human ecology university waddingtons epigenetic landscape metaphor gene regulation modulates among metaphors waddington asks us imagine number marbles rolling marbles sample grooves slope come rest lowest points points represent eventual cell fates tissue types waddington coined term chreode represent cellular developmental process idea based experiment waddington found one effect mutation could modulate epigenetic landscape affect cells differentiated also showed mutation could affect landscape used metaphor discussions emphasised like ernst haeckel evolution mainly occurred mutations affected developmental anatomy waddington proposed evolutionary process genetic assimilation darwinian mechanism allows certain acquired characteristic become heritable according navis waddington focused genetic assimilation work crossveinless trait drosophila trait occurs high frequency heattreated flies generations trait found population without application heat based hidden genetic variation waddington asserted waddingtons theory genetic assimilation controversial evolutionary biologists theodosius dobzhansky ernst mayr thought waddington using genetic assimilation support lamarckian inheritance denied genetic assimilation taken place asserted waddington simply observed natural selection genetic variants already existed study biologists wallace arthur disagree writing genetic assimilation looks lamarckian special case evolution phenotypic adam wilkins wrote waddington lifetime widely perceived primarily critic neodarwinian evolutionary theory criticisms focused saw unrealistic atomistic models gene selection trait evolution particular according wilkins waddington felt neodarwinians badly neglected phenomenon extensive gene interactions randomness mutational effects posited theory even though waddington became critical neodarwinian synthetic theory evolution still described darwinian called extended evolutionary synthesis based reviewing debate systems biologist denis noble writes however waddington describe lamarckian revealing mechanisms inheritance acquired characteristics think regarded reason lamarck could conceived processes waddington revealed incidentally also true say lamarck invent idea inheritance acquired characteristics whether historically correct stuck today term lamarckian inheritance characteristic acquired environmental waddington active advancing biology discipline contributed book role sciences
