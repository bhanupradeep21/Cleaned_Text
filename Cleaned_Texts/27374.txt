ureteral cancer cancer ureters muscular tubes propel urine kidneys urinary bladder also known ureter renal pelvic rarely ureteric cancer uretal cancer cancer location ureteral cancer becomes likely older adults usually ages previously diagnosed bladder ureteral cancer usually transitional cell transitional cell carcinoma common cause ureter cancer urinary renal pelvic tract inside ureters inside bladder contain cell type people diagnosed ureteral cancer likely also diagnosed bladder cancer vice ureteral cancer oftentimes doesnt present unusual symptoms cancer cancer progressed often causes hematuria frequent urination nocturia many urination problems well unusual weight loss become clear doctors specifically causes disease many well known risk factors many common variety cancers diagnosis made different ways common diagnostic tools intravenous pyelography computed tomography diagnosis made many different treatment methods dependent upon nature cancer patients wishes ureter cancer rarely causes problems early stages cancer progresses often side symptoms ureteral cancer may include blood urine hematuria diminished urine stream straining void caused urethral stricture frequent urination increased nighttime urination nocturia hardening tissue perineum labia penis itching incontinence pain sexual intercourse dyspareunia painful urination dysuria recurrent urinary tract infection urethral discharge common symptoms associated ureteral cancer may include back pain unexplained weight loss unusual exact causes ureteral cancer clear however known patients history bladder cancer likely develop ureteral cancer cancers contain cell type cancers cells lining ureter undergo dna mutation resulting abnormal growth cells without programmed cell death eventually leads blockage ureter possibly body parts left risk developing ureteral cancer increases age addition increasing age previous bladder kidney cancer diagnoses may also increase risk developing ureteral cancer hnpcc hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer also known lynch syndrome leads increased risk developing ureteral cancer well various cancers colon aside genetic factors predisposition developing cancer also environmental factors lifestyle choices may significantly escalate chances diagnosed ureteral cancer example taking overabundance pain medications phenacetin probable carcinogen lead increased risk exposure certain chemicals used produce leather goods plastics rubber etc also proven influence likeliness developing ureteral many types cancer tobacco smoking also associated increased risk ureteral diagnosis may include fluorescence situ hybridization fish test computed tomography urography ctu magnetic resonance urography mru intravenous pyelography ivp xray biopsy diagnosis made physical examination health history conducted includes questions related current signs symptoms used better understand presenting condition imaging tests ctu ivp also frequently used well mru used ct imaging available suitable procedure called ureteroscopy also used inspect ureters procedure thin lighted tube equipped camera inserted urethra bladder ureter renal pelvis also include biopsy small sample tissues collected inspected laboratory less invasive common testing methods include urine test urine cytology test look abnormal cells well urinalysis check color urine multiple stages ureteral cancer ii iii iv stage divided stages occurs abnormal cells appear tissue lining inside ureter stage noninvasive papillary carcinoma long thin growths extend tissue lining ureter stage carcinoma situ flat tumor located tissue lining classifications transitional cell cancer ureter include localized regional metastatic localized means cancer remained point origin ureter regional indicates cancer spread tissues lymph nodes blood vessels vicinity metastatic cancer means spread parts body recurrent means cancer returned treatment completed occur location parts treatment methods include radiation treatment options vary based size location tumor aggressive cancer cells patients lifestyle diagnosis ureteral cancer surgery oftentimes recommended help remove infected ureter early stage ureteral patients removing portion ureter successful whereas advanced cases full removal ureter well associated kidney nephroureterectomy part bladder sometimes less advanced cases cancer surface ureter electrosurgery laser therapy may performed remove affected cells electrosurgery uses electric current whereas laser therapy involves passing ureteroscope bladder urethra beam laser used destroy chemotherapy many different uses treating ureteral cancer prior surgery chemotherapy sometimes used help shrink tumor easily removed chemo may also used advanced cases control symptoms side effects surgery remove tumor single dose chemotherapy injected bladder helpful reducing rate cancer recurrence people cancer inner lining bladder upper tract urothelial serious side effects dont seem increased advanced ureteral cancer cases may often treated immunotherapy treatment methods successful immunotherapy uses bodys immune system fight cancer helping immune system recognize cancer cells united states cancer surveillance reports surveillance epidemiology end results seer program national cancer institute included cases ureteral cancer adults male female white black fiveyear relative survival rates cancers ureter similar among males vs total transitional cell carcinoma papillary determined transitional cell carcinoma twice common caucasian men compared africanamerican men mentioned national cancer institute cases ureter cancer occur us canada northern europe australia new zealand less common areas ureter cancer diagnosis thailand china
