robotic pets artificially intelligent machines made resemble actual pets first robotic pets produced late advanced since grown technologically many use machine learning algorithms allow machines adapt experiences independent humans making much consumers buy robotic pets aim getting similar companionship real pets offer without drawbacks come caring live pets market currently wide price range low hundreds several thousands multiple studies done show treat robotic pets similar way actual pets despite obvious however controversy regarding ethical using robotic pets whether widely adopted elderly first known robotic pet robot dog called sparko built american company westinghouse never got sold due poor public interest first robotic pets put market hasbros furby sonys aibo since robotic pets grown increasingly advanced shapes robotic pet includes popular robotic pets today primary consumer group elderly people live alone nursing homes often suffer loneliness social group robotic pets helpful often unable consistently walk feed otherwise take care actual robotic pets also marketed towards dementia patients people suffer loss memory thinking skills people often suffer extreme loneliness due remembering loved ones physical contact constant reminders robotic pet lessen example study done texas kansas found dementia residents group sessions paro brand robotic pet three months showed decreased anxiety less behavioral problems compared control group experienced activities traditional nursing home music physical robotic pets helpful comes patients unable perform consistent physical action aibo performs slower live animal addition patients unable contact loved ones due infectious diseases eased loneliness feeling interacting new aibo aibo model used household use therapy furthermore qualitative study associated national centre child health development ncchd shown bright future robotassisted therapy special medical experiment conducted children hospitalised ncchd two physicians observed participants throughout experiment rendered qualitative analysis evaluate possibility applying robotic pet medical result experiments national centre child health development ncchd given dominant positive result children interact aibo research proved robotassisted therapy effectively medical purposed especially case paediatric robotic pets first introduced market financially feasible people even remains large price gap different types robotic pets example paros robotic pet seals cost making unaffordable individual therefore bought nursing homes hospitals end price spectrum joy alls companion pets cost makes realistic individual consumers elderly adults live currently little insurance coverage available robotic pet owners medicare covers costs certain robotic pets paro use therapists however medicaid private insurers exploring idea including robotic pets happen would significantly boost sales sony relaunched discontinued aibo friendly puppy appearance new model released various significant upgrades compared model price aibo falls around price gone due new design state art sensors integrated model since effectiveness robotic pet depends heavily much consumers see real animal multiple studies done comparing robotic pets things live animals inanimate objects toys studies often focus whether robot animal toy seen following characteristics one study compared children interacted sonys aibo versus stuffed dog researchers letting children play either stuffed toy aibo three minutes asking children series questions determine viewed study found children asked questions characteristics either aibo stuffed animal responded similar held true asked questions concerning biological essence mental states sociability moral however differences children behaved aibo versus stuffed animal example questionnaire children responded aibo stuffed dog could hear verbal researchers observed children interacted aibo stuffed dog found children gave verbal commands another study compared childrens interactions aibo live dog researchers letting children play freely either aibo real dog five minutes asking children series questions determine viewed study found children preferred play live dog aibo children affirmed live dog physical essence mental state sociability moral however researchers found aibo given doglike attributes even treated entirely like example many children thought aibo could feelings happiness sadness also thought aibo could friend wasnt okay kick aibo something studies concluded robotic pets aibo often arent categorized either alive inanimate rather new category example children first study treated aibo differently treated stuffed toy even though stated two contrast children second study stated live dog different aibo ended treating two findings show consciously identify robotic pets inanimate objects behave closer real pets toys study united states conducted animalassisted therapy study carried evaluate effectiveness therapy pet method participants interact animals pet owner plays pet experiments outcomes reported many physical mental improvements however concern transmitted diseases animals posed reconsideration institutions consider animalassisted addition qualified therapy animal requires welltrained session licensed caregiver randomly escalate operating fees opposite animalassisted therapy robotassisted therapy overcomes draws back animalassisted therapy studies conducted justify possibility robotic pet medical study aibo selected subject research aibo used companion elderly hospitalised children robotassisted method already applied many cases namely aged care workplace vulnerable social robotassisted therapy comes lower cost animalassisted therapy robot need feed licensed professional trainer ultimately robotic pet hygienic standard higher live aiboassisted therapy given positive results stimulating socialemotional function vulnerable social groups mental health wellbeing elders agedcare conclusion studies animalassisted therapy aat robotassisted therapy rat shown positive results patients robotassisted therapy replace animalassisted therapy particular unavoidable situation social activity support infectious illness patients restricted movement patients elderly whose vulnerable animal transmitted contrast animalassisted therapy studys result shows positive level participants higher robotassisted method still limited cultural beliefs cleanliness animals notably budget method pricey alternative ultimately advancement robotic technology robotassisted therapy gradually replace live animal therapy safeness vulnerable target patient also robotassisted therapy proved delightful positive results conducted large scale robotic pets proven beneficial many consumers especially elderly remains controversy certain ethical one study attempted discuss two main ethical considerations elderly consumers may able recognize robots arent actual pets robot pets come replace human participated study came conclusion consumers neither issue major found robotic pet owners understood robot pet animated even formed petlike relationship additionally study participants argued robotic pets would likely used way facilitated social interactions group setting dog however issues continue cause debate minority consumers including many dementia patients may fail recognize robot animated robotic pet mimic animal gestures pet robots design look close natural pet situation aibo inherited appearance close puppy behaviour developed based owner new aibo integrated cloud memory data sent online process keep aibo updated function aibo behaviours develop new puppy mature financial statistical robot dog compare domestic pet visualised financial picture owns robotic pet save owner many unexpected issues veterinary cost domestic pet need medical care food vaccination adopt fee training httpsenwikipediaorgwikiroboticpet
