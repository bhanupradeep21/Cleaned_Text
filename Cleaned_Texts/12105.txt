renal physiology reabsorption tubular reabsorption process nephron removes water solutes tubular fluid preurine returns circulating called reabsorption absorption substances already absorbed particularly intestines body reclaiming postglomerular fluid stream way becoming urine soon lost urine unless reabsorbed tubule peritubular capillaries happens result sodium transport lumen blood nakatpase basolateral membrane epithelial cells thus glomerular filtrate becomes concentrated one steps forming urine nephrons divided five segments different segments responsible reabsorbing different reabsorption allows many useful solutes primarily glucose amino acids salts water passed bowmans capsule return circulation solutes reabsorbed isotonically osmotic potential fluid leaving proximal convoluted tubule initial glomerular filtrate however glucose amino acids inorganic phosphate solutes reabsorbed via secondary active transport cotransport channels driven sodium gradient system httpsenwikipediaorgwikireabsorption
