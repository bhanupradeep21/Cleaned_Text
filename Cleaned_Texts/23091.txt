p elements transposable elements discovered drosophila causative agents genetic traits called hybrid dysgenesis transposon responsible p trait p element found wild flies also found many name comes evolutionary biologist margaret kidwell together james kidwell john sved researched hybrid dysgenesis drosophila referred strains p paternal maternal contributed hybrid dysgenesis reproductive p

genome disrupting many genes often proving lethal progeny rendering sterile p elements commonly used mutagenic agents genetic experiments drosophila one advantage approach mutations easy locate hybrid dysgenesis one strain drosophila mates another strain drosophila producing hybrid offspring causing chromosomal damage known dysgenic hybrid dysgenesis requires contribution parents example pm system
