jacques colleagues studied timecourse face inversion effect fie using adaptation stimulus presented multiple times neuronal response decreases time different stimulus presented response recovers conditions release adaptation occurs therefore provides way measure stimulus similarity experiment jacques et al found release adaptation smaller occurs ms later inverted faces indicating neuronal population encoding face identity require additional processing time detect identity inverted faces experiment examining effects race amplitude found otherrace effect elicited conjunction face

results led authors conclude actually measure stimulus similarity face processing per se response rossion measured similarity several object categories used previous study found faces elicited larger
