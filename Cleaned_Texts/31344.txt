upward comparisons toward people better james davis first noticed effect relation college students ambition impact local rank based environment surrounded ie see big frogs little ponds little frogs big ponds davis suggested students surrounded highachieving classmates may develop lower main findings related men made career decisions closely related undergraduate gpa rather actual quality school attended showing students evaluated performance worse based comparison highperforming peers school versus comparing school advantageously mcfarland theorized effect happens individuals selfmonitor withingroup rather compare across groups evaluating oneself ingroup members versus outgroup members tendency towards contextual neglect available information people place weight position within group rather larger general closer intragroup context weight farther away intergroup called local dominance effect tendency people focus comparisons people around rather many people close regards frame
