environmental noise accumulation noise pollution occurs outside noise caused transport industrial recreational noise frequently described unwanted sound within context environmental noise generally present form areas human animal environmental activity effects humans exposure environmental noise may vary emotional physiological noise low levels necessarily harmful environmental noise also convey sense liveliness area desirable adverse effects noise exposure ie noise pollution could include interference speech desired sounds annoyance sleep disturbance anxiety hearing damage stressrelated cardiovascular health result environmental noise studied regulated monitored many governments institutions around world creates number different occupations basis decisions supported objective accurate measurement noise noise measured decibels db using patternapproved sound level meter measurements typically taken period weeks weather conditions noise transportation typically emitted machinery eg engine exhaust aerodynamic noise see aerodynamics aircraft noise caused compression friction air around vessel motion environmental noise railway specifically variable depending speed quality tracks used industrial recreational noise could generated multitude different sources processes industrial noise generated factories plants ie product fabrication assembly power generation hydroelectricity wind turbines construction activities agricultural meat processing facilities sources recreational noise vary widely include music shooting ranges sporting events car racing woodworking peoples activities etc sound propagation outdoors subject meteorological effects eg wind temperature affect distance speed direction environmental noise travels source listener children adolescents susceptible environmental noise exposure adults similar adults exposure noise damaging outcomes mental environmental noises children exposed traffic noise aircraft trains pieces evidence show small correlation environmental noise reading oral environmental noise children commonly people around whether siblings crying friends screaming children mostly exposed animal noises traffic researchers asked children felt came environmental noises around felt negative emotions compared positive emotions negative emotions tied environmental sound example traffic noise industrial noises sirens positive emotions tied winds fans everyday household noises noise quality life correlated increase environmental noise especially living near railways airports created conflict getting adequate quality sleep difficult live areas high noise exposure body rest noise stimuli continually presented environment body responds sounds negatively affect high exposure environmental noise play role cardiovascular disease noise raise blood pressure change heart rate release stress hormones consistent changes health statistics lead risks hypertension arteriosclerosis even serious events stroke myocardial sleep deprivation another aspect health affected environmental noise order bodies function properly need sleep people excessive environmental noise around cause difficulties many even
