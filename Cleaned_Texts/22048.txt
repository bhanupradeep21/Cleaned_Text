millimetres mm wide even larger species usually dark gray dark brown color resemble faeces front pole eggs circular lid operculum micropylar plate three arms shape usually resembles upsidedown arm pointing lid significantly longer arms pointing lower pole also bent eggs laid ground using ovipositor nymphs hatch three four months clearly prickly imago depending species sex takes five eight
