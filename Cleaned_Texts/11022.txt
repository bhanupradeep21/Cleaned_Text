yury verlinsky september july russianamerican medical researcher specializing embryonic cellular genetics genetic cytology best known pioneer prenatal diagnosis detecting genetic chromosomal disorders six weeks earlier standard amniocentesis founding father preimplantation genetic diagnosis pgd embryo analysis prior invitro fertilization ivf verlinsky used polar body biopsy technique detect potential birth defects offspring accepted worldwide standard efficient effective means analyzing chromosomal status embryo help research pgd used prevent different genetic disorders diseases verlinsky born ishim tyumen oblast siberia former soviet union one two sons simon verlinsky dora verlinskaya mother accountant father disabled veteran soviet army yury received phd embryology cytogenetics kharkiv university ukrainian ssr met wife luba biologist married graduating phd submitted research proposals rejected government committees chose emigrate united states soviet government continued refuse requests fund research pgd field early practitioner became difficult forced pay back cost education receiving exit visa diploma tax required borrow money friends eventually left united states wife nineyearold son two arrived one many thousands soviet jews allowed leave year including young sergey brin later cofounded google inc soon arriving offered research position michael reese hospital chicago illinois ran cytogenetics laboratory asked easily obtained position replied previous experience chromosome language chromosome microscope microscope took time outside job work identifying chromosome polymorphisms syndrome families also analyze chorionic villus sampling goal develop modified technique performing chromosomal research even difficult since like soviet emigres allowed contact colleagues back one friend colleague lost contact anver kuliev done research still moscow worked together developing prenatal test could administered earlier amniocentesis goal allowing woman avoid secondtrimester abortion years later verlinsky settled us london scientific meeting discovered kuliev working soviet union head genetics world health organization verlinsky contacted met geneva soon began working together embryonic genetic research kuriev would later become director reproductive genetics institute verlinsky established verlinsky expert preimplantation genetic diagnosis genetic testing chromosome analysis embryos transferred womans uterus invitro fertilization ivf research expanded applications earlier prenatal embryonic testing methods allow doctors understand health future diagnostic techniques become widely accepted routinely used prospective parents especially couples history genetic abnormalities woman age risk genetically related disorders higher tests could performed six weeks earlier amniocentesis uses technique called chorionic villus sampling prospective parents often comfortable considering abortion major abnormalities risk factors discovered addition allowing parents select embryo without known genetic disorders also potential saving lives siblings already similar disorders established private reproductive genetics institute chicago provide prenatal testing according colleague dr norman ginsberg hardworking scientist first lab morning last night profits work plowed back research rather make rich used money whole range testing ginsberg verlinsky developed ideas genetic screening invitro fertilization says viewing joan mir√≥ painting jerusalem art gallery observed painting showed two disks one red one yellow floating space small round black object red one disks reminded human eggs one changing ejecting black object flash insight took business card wrote polar bodies back polar body cell structure found inside ovum includes package chromosomes ejected egg fertilization sperm verlinskys insight could analyze polar body look certain genetic defects resulting egg approach useful parents carriers genetic defect found using eggs healthy version gene child would protected even father passed mutated version result approach produced many healthy pregnancies later found single cell could removed early fertilized egg without disturbing subsequent development used genetic technique became notable helped parents molly nash child suffered lifethreatening fanconi anemia conceive son without disease whose cells later used save mollys life method also helped mother whose genetic diagnosis showed likelihood getting alzheimers disease conceive daughter free case declared medical milestone first use genetic testing prevent early onset form alzheimers result verlinskys preimplantation genetic diagnosis pgd methods experts today able easily test different genetic disorders diseases including hemophilia sickle cell anemia fanconi anemia alzheimers disease cystic fibrosis thalassemia syndrome disease muscular dystrophy huntingtons experts credited firsts applying pgd tissue typing determine genetic defect risks allow use stem cells newborns treat diseased family members dr andrew la barbera scientific director american society reproductive medicine said verlinskys research farreaching impact reproductive medicine giant field enabling couples children free genetic diseases making methods available clinics around wasnt yury said dr jamie grifo program director new york university fertility center knows far field would verlinsky died chicago colon cancer july age survived wife luba son oleg brother vitaly three httpsenwikipediaorgwikiyuryverlinsky
