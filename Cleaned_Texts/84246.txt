surgical treatments ingrown toenails include number different options conservative treatment minor ingrown toenail succeed ingrown toenail severe surgical management podiatrist initial surgical approach typically partial avulsion nail plate known wedge resection complete removal ingrown toenail recurs despite treatment destruction germinal matrix phenol alternative one may use sodium hydroxide less trichloroacetic acid may give faster healing antibiotics needed surgery performed physician perform onychectomy nail along edge growing skin cut away ablated offending piece nail pulled infection surgically drained process referred wedge resection simple surgical ablation permanent ie nail regrow matrix entire procedure may performed physicians office approximately thirty fortyfive minutes depending extent problem patient allowed go home day recovery time anywhere two weeks two months barring complications infection followup physician may prescribe oral topical antibiotic special soak used week surgery use lateral onychoplasty wedge resection method choice ingrown toenails wide wedge resection total cleaning removal nail matrix nearly success ratecitation needed physicians perform complete nail avulsion removal except extreme circumstances cases physicians remove sides toenail even one side currently ingrown coat nail matrix sides chemical acid usually phenol prevent regrowth leaves nail intact ensures problem ingrowth recur possible disadvantages nail matrix coated applicable chemical acid phenol allowed regrow method prone failure also underlying condition still become symptomatic nail grows back within year nail matrix could growing nail curved thick wide otherwise irregular allow normal growth furthermore flesh become injured concussion tight socks quick twisting motions walking simply nail growing incorrectly likely wide hypersensitivity continued injury mean chronic ingrowth solution nearly always edge avulsion effective procedure phenolisation case recurrence complete removal patient never felt pain inflammation occurred condition likely onychia often confused ingrown ingrowing nail onychocryptosis complete removal whole nail simple procedure anaesthetic injected nail removed quickly pulling outward toe patient function normally right procedure discomfort goes away days entire procedure performed approximately minutes less complex wedge resection nail often grows back however cases cause problems becoming ingrown get injured concussion cases grows back thick wide deformed procedure result chronic ingrown nails causing pain accordingly cases determined doctor nail matrix coated chemical usually phenol none nail ever grow back known permanent full nail avulsion full matrixectomy phenolisation full phenol avulsion

purpose procedure prevent regrowth matrix cauterized procedure nail slightly narrower usually one millimeter barely noticeable year later surgery advantageous performed doctors office local anesthesia recovery time minimal visible scar surgery site nominal chance recurrence however phenol improperly inadequately applied nail matrix regenerate partial cauterization grow new nail result recurrence
