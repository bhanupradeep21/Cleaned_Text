italics original flowery language see example conclusion vastly less expensive look send signals attempt contact spaceship probes conclusion based present state technological prowess present knowledge physical law orderofmagnitude uncertainty average distance communicative civilizations galaxy strongly argues expandable search system search begun minimum system would effective nearby stars system expanded search carried farther space success achieved new search strategy initiated communication means disposal microwaves best also best races reasons energy required wavelengths least necessary stabilities collecting areas fundamentally easier realize cheaper shorter wavelengths best part microwave region low frequency end microwave window frequencies ghz greater absolute frequency stability possible doppler rates lower beamwidths broader given gain collecting area cheaper high end window nature provided us rather narrow quiet band best part spectrum seems especially marked interstellar

prevent expansion size antenna arrays equivalent single antenna kilometers diameter transmitting receiving end microwave communication possible intergalactic distances highspeed communication possible large interstellar distances thus rapid information transmission occur contact confirmed two civilizations search phase count receiving signals beamed us directive antennas neither afford overlook possibility beamed signals may radiated relatively low powers communicative races many thousand nearby likely stars long times long range beacons intended detectable million likely stars within lightyears probably omnidirectional high powered displaystyle w beacons likely circularly polarized surely highly monochromatic spectral widths hz less probable convey information slow rate manner seriously degrade detectability best respond contained information efficient detection beacons involves searching frequency domain high resolution hz less one major contributions cyclops study data processing method permits mhz frequency band searched simultaneously resolution hz cyclops system provides receiver billion simultaneous narrow channel outputs although cyclops system bandwidth mhz great technological barriers prevent widening mhz would permit searching entire water hole simultaneously conclusion appropriateness band correct problem posed frequency dimension search considered solved cost system capable making effective search using techniques considered order billion dollars sum would spent period years contact achieved early period might either stop expanding system encouraged go make contacts principal cost cyclops design antenna structures adopting upper frequency limit ghz rather ghz could reduce antenna cost factor two search almost certainly take years perhaps decades possibly centuries undertake enduring program requires search highly automated requires long term funding commitment turn requires faith faith quest worth effort faith man survive reap benefits success faith races equally curious determined expand horizons almost certainly first intelligent species undertake search first races undoubtedly followed listening phase long transmission epochs later races enter search perseverance greatest asset beginning listening phase search extraterrestrial intelligent life legitimate scientific undertaking included part comprehensive balanced space program believe exploration solar system proper initial step space program considered ultimate goal quest intelligent life fires popular imagination might receive support critics question value landings dead planets moons great deal study problem optimum system design precede commitment fund search program however early fund studies studies would undoubtedly emerge system greater capabilitytocost ratio first cyclops design proposed existence one cyclopslike system great value providing complete sky coverage continuous reception detected signals long baseline studies
