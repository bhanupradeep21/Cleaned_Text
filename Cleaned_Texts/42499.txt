sunlight borlaug later recalled worked north planting days getting shorter low elevation high temperature wed take seed best plants south plant high elevation days getting longer lots rain soon varieties fit whole range conditions wasnt supposed happen meant project would need start separate breeding programs geographic region planet purebred genotypically identical plant varieties often one major genes disease resistance plant diseases rust continuously producing new races overcome pure lines resistance multiple linear lines varieties developed multiline varieties mixtures several phenotypically similar pure lines different genes disease resistance similar heights flowering maturity dates seed colors agronomic characteristics remain compatible reduce yields grown together fieldcitation needed borlaug extended technique suggesting several pure lines different resistance genes developed backcross methods using one recurrent backcrossing involves crossing hybrid subsequent generations recurrent parent result genotype backcrossed progeny becomes increasingly similar recurrent parent borlaugs method would allow various different diseaseresistant genes several donor parents transferred single recurrent parent make sure line different resistant genes donor parent used separate backcross program five ten lines may mixed depending upon races pathogen present region process repeated lines become susceptible pathogen lines easily replaced new resistant lines new sources resistance become available new lines developed way loss crops kept minimum one lines become susceptible pathogen within given season crops unaffected disease disease would spread slowly entire population susceptible also reduces damage susceptible lines still possibility new race pathogen develop lines susceptible dwarfing important agronomic quality wheat dwarf plants produce thick stems cultivars borlaug worked tall thin stalks taller wheat grasses better compete sunlight tend collapse weight extra trait called rapid growth spurts induced nitrogen fertilizer borlaug used poor soil prevent bred wheat favor shorter stronger stalks could better support larger seed heads

production world hungry bread speech repeatedly presented improvements food production within sober understanding context population green revolution temporary success mans war hunger deprivation given man breathing space fully implemented revolution provide sufficient food sustenance next three decades frightening power human reproduction must also curbed otherwise success green revolution ephemeral people still fail comprehend magnitude menace population monstersince man potentially rational however confident within next two decades recognize selfdestructive course steers along road irresponsible population borlaug continually advocated increasing crop yields means curb deforestation large role played increasing crop yields promoting view led methodology called agricultural economists borlaug hypothesis namely increasing productivity agriculture best farmland help control deforestation reducing demand new farmland according view assuming global food demand rise restricting crop usage traditional lowyield methods would also require least one following world population decrease either voluntarily result mass starvations conversion forest land crop land thus argued highyield techniques ultimately saving ecosystems destruction global scale view holds strictly true ceteris paribus deforestation occurs increase land agriculture land uses exist urban areas pasture fallow research necessary ascertain land converted purposes determine true view remainsaccording increased profits highyield production may also induce cropland expansion case although world food needs decrease expansion may decrease borlaug expressed idea known borlaug hypothesis speech given oslo norway upon occasion anniversary acceptance nobel peace prize global cereal yields still prevailed would needed nearly billion ha additional land quality instead million used equal current global borlaugs name nearly synonymous green revolution many criticisms mounted decades throughout years research borlaugs programs often faced opposition nonscientists consider genetic crossbreeding unnatural negative farming techniques addition increasing yields often reaped large profits us agribusiness agrochemical corporations criticized one author widening social inequality countries owing uneven food distribution forcing capitalist agenda us corporations onto countries undergone land

whether go enough feed population monster another matter unless progress agricultural yields remains strong next century experience sheer human misery numerical scale exceed worst everything come besides increasing worldwide food supply early career borlaug stated taking steps decrease rate population growth also necessary prevent food shortages nobel lecture borlaug stated people still fail
