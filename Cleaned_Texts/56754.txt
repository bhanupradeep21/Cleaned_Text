sleep weight association amount sleep individual obtains weight individual numerous studies demonstrated association sleep disturbances weight gain specifically sleep deprivation related furthermore body weight also influences quality sleep occurrence sleep disorders like obstructive sleep oversleeping may also contribute weight additionally decrease sleep duration quality among populations due modern lifestyles include increased time spent looking artificial lights availability nighttime use electronic devices communication devices associated shorter sleep duration increased body weight biological reaction stressor activation hpaaxis stressful environment body release multiple hormones including cortisol long duration high cortisol concentrations negative effects immune attention increase risk psychological disorders also much stress impact sleep risk factor stress effect sleep patterns food intake consequently weight stress found associated increased emotional reward palatable foods turn also lead seems onesided relationship cortisol levels sleep deprivation high cortisol levels due high stress lead decreased sleep however sleep deprivation seem lead changes cortisol levels healthy however believed chronic sleep deprivation negative effect neuroendocrine system seems change ways people deal first changes appear emotional perception might also change fundamental properties neuroendocrine stress axis long lack sleep strongly associated weight gain variety across ages though research suggests children adolescents particularly however exact mechanisms sleep deprivation leads weight gain diverse sleep deprivation believed influence body weight several different aspects sleep deprivation influences brains response highcalorie food making attractive leads highenergy food affects production hormones ghreline sleep reduction also disruption circadian clock negative impact sleep architecture metabolism shown mouse adolescence late bedtimes related higher risk getting great bedtime shifts weekdays weekend associated greater severity overweight longer screen time general sleeping less hours per night increases risk another plausible explanation fatigue limited sleep reduces physical activity thus energy expenditure predisposes weight others show nonreciprocal relationship fatness predicts less physical activity also sleep duration predict fatness association found model includes three sleep deprivation believed influence brains response highcalorie food making attractive also affecting production hormones control appetite matthew p walker psychology neuroscience professor uc berkeley published study participants deprived sleep one night new york times summarized study days subjects proper sleep fattening foods like potato chips sweets stimulated stronger responses part brain helps govern motivation eat time subjects experienced sharp reduction activity frontal cortex higher level part brain consequences weighed rational decisions brain deprived sleep one night likely respond intensely junk food also decreased ability curb desire results consistent even subjects given extra calories compensate amount energy expended extra hours subjects stayed awake indicates ones craving junk food response offset energy walker speculates one biological basis reaction could buildup adenosine metabolic byproduct may degrade communication networks brain adenosine cleared brain previous research university chicago also associated short sleep increase calorie consumption snacks albeit change overall calorie intake hormone levels energy expenditure across different sleep schedules review studies link sleep debt obesity also reported association short sleep duration total energy study gonnissen et al showed desiretoeat ratings higher night fragmented sleep comparison normal night could one explanation people eat sleep deprived another study adolescents found greater neural activation brain regions associated inhibition response food cues sleep restriction also found neural activation consistent greater reward processing associated food cues sleep restriction findings differ groups normal weight sleep restriction also showed increase neuronal response like blood oxygen highcaloric food normalweight subjects reward processing food cues sleep let relative increase activity brain areas related study shows link restricted sleep susceptibility food stimuli might increase risk another explanation relationship stems balance two hormones leptin ghrelin act nuclei hypothalamus monitor energy food intake leptin primarily inhibits appetite ghrelin released stomach works stimulate appetite sleep deprivation associated increased levels ghrelin decreased levels leptin multiple addition hormonal variation research also associated shortened sleep durations proportional increase subjects sleep important modulator neuroendocrine function glucose metabolism sleep loss shown result metabolic endocrine alterations including decreased glucose tolerance decreased insulin sensitivity increased evening concentrations cortisol increased levels ghrelin decreased levels leptin increased hunger
