abdominal ultrasonography also called abdominal ultrasound imaging abdominal sonography form medical ultrasonography medical application ultrasound technology visualise abdominal anatomical structures uses transmission reflection ultrasound waves visualise internal organs abdominal wall help gel helps transmission sound waves reason procedure also called transabdominal ultrasound contrast endoscopic ultrasound latter combining ultrasound endoscopy visualize internal structures within hollow organs abdominal ultrasound examinations performed gastroenterologists specialists internal medicine radiologists sonographers trained procedure abdominal ultrasound used diagnose abnormalities various internal organs liver gallbladder pancreas spleen abdominal aorta doppler ultrasonography added blood flow inside blood vessels evaluated well example look renal artery stenosis commonly used examine uterus fetus pregnancy called obstetric abdominal ultrasound commonly used setting abdominal pain acute abdomen sudden andor severe abdominal pain syndrome surgical intervention might necessary diagnose appendicitis cholecystitis ultrasound also used suspicion enlargement one organs used screening abdominal aortic aneurysm investigation splenomegaly urinary retention ultrasound used additional anatomical information patients abnormal kidney function pancreatic enzymes pancreatic amylase pancreatic lipase used abdominal aorta detect exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm purpose standard aortic measurement abdominal aortic aneurysm outer margins aortic cases infectious mononucleosis splenomegaly common symptom health care providers may consider using abdominal ultrasonography get insight persons however spleen size varies greatly ultrasonography valid technique assessing spleen enlargement used typical circumstances make routine decisions fitness playing ultrasound imaging useful detecting stones example kidney stones gallstones create clearly visible ultrasound shadow behind stonecitation needed ultrasonography used guide procedures treatment kidney stones extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy needle biopsies paracentesis needle drainage free fluid inside abdominal cavitycitation needed patients deranged liver function tests ultrasound may show increased liver size hepatomegaly increased reflectiveness might example indicate cholestasis gallbladder bile duct diseases tumor liver ultrasonography liver tumors involves two stages detection characterizationcitation needed tumor detection based performance method include morphometric information three axes dimensions volume topographic information number location specifying liver segment lobelobes specification data important staging liver tumors prognosiscitation needed tumor characterization complex process based sum criteria leading towards tumor nature definition often diagnostic procedures especially interventional ones longer necessary tumor characterization using ultrasound method based following elements consistency solid liquid mixed echogenicity structure appearance homogeneous heterogeneous delineation adjacent liver parenchyma capsular imprecise elasticity posterior acoustic enhancement effect relation neighboring organs structures displacement invasion vasculature presence characteristics doppler ultrasonography contrastenhanced ultrasound ceuscitation needed ultrasonography kidneys essential diagnosis management kidneyrelated diseases kidneys easily examined pathological changes kidneys distinguishable advantages ultrasound imaging abdominal structures procedure performed quickly bedside involves exposure xrays makes useful pregnant patients example inexpensive compared oftenused techniques computed tomography ct scan abdomen disadvantages troublesome imaging lot gas present inside bowels lot abdominal fat quality imaging depends experience person performing itcitation needed imaging occurs realtime without sedation influence movements assessed quickly example pressing ultrasound probe gallbladder radiological murphys sign elicited abdominal wall organs inside pelvis seen urinary bladder ovaries uterus women water excellent conductor ultrasound waves visualizing structures often requires wellfilled urinary bladder means patients drink plenty water examination liver imaged swiping probe sagittally medial
