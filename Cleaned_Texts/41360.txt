structure left side paper naming two groups seeley reviewed previous classification schemes put forth paleontologists divide traditional order dinosauria preferred one put forward othniel charles marsh divided dinosaurs four orders sauropoda theropoda ornithopoda stegosauria names still used today much way refer suborders clades within saurischia seeley however wanted formulate classification would take account single primary difference major dinosaurian groups based characteristic also differentiated reptiles found configuration hip bones found four marshs orders could divided neatly two major groups based feature placed stegosauria ornithopoda ornithischia theropoda sauropoda saurischia furthermore seeley used major difference hip bones along many noted differences two groups argue dinosaurs natural grouping rather two distinct orders arisen independently primitive concept dinosaur outdated term two distinct orders lasted many decades scientific popular literature scientists began consider possibility saurischians ornithischians closely related archosaurs although concept polyphyletic dinosauria longer accepted paleontologists seeleys basic division two dinosaurian groups stood test time supported modern cladistic analysis relationships among nodebase clade eusaurischia named least inclusive group containing sauropodomorphs represented cetiosaurus theropods represented neornithes saurischian diverged theropodsauropodomorph split therefore outside clade one alternative hypothesis challenging seeleys classification proposed robert bakker book dinosaur heresies bakkers
