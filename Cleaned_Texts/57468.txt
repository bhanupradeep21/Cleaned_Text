eusociality greek εὖ eu good social highest level organization sociality defined following characteristics cooperative brood care including care offspring individuals overlapping generations within colony adults division labor reproductive nonreproductive groups division labor creates specialized behavioral groups within animal society sometimes referred castes eusociality distinguished social
