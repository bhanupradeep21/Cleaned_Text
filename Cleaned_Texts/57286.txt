reactive hypoglycemia postprandial hypoglycemia sugar crash term describing recurrent episodes symptomatic hypoglycemia occurring within four high carbohydrate meal people without term necessarily diagnosis since requires evaluation determine cause condition related homeostatic systems used body control blood sugar level described sense tiredness lethargy irritation hangover although effects lessened lot physical activity undertaken first hours food consumption alleged mechanism feeling crash correlated abnormally rapid rise blood glucose eating normally leads insulin secretion known insulin spike turn initiates rapid glucose uptake tissues either storing glycogen fat using energy production consequent fall blood glucose indicated reason sugar another cause might hysteresis effect insulin action ie effect insulin still prominent even plasma glucose insulin levels already low causing plasma glucose level eventually much lower baseline sugar crashes confused aftereffects consuming large amounts protein produces fatigue akin sugar crash instead result body prioritising digestion ingested prevalence condition difficult ascertain number stricter looser definitions used recommended term reactive hypoglycemia reserved pattern postprandial hypoglycemia meets whipple criteria symptoms correspond measurably low glucose relieved raising glucose term idiopathic postprandial syndrome used similar patterns symptoms abnormally low glucose levels time symptoms documented assist diagnosis doctor may order test measures blood sugar average two three months test specific glucose tolerance test used chart changes patients blood sugar levels ingestion special glucose drink regular intervals six hours following see unusual rise drop blood glucose levels occurs according us national institutes health nih blood glucose level mgdl mmoll time symptoms followed relief eating confirms diagnosis reactive symptoms vary according individuals hydration level sensitivity rate andor magnitude decline blood glucose concentrationcitation needed crash usually felt within four hours heavy carbohydrate consumption along symptoms hypoglycemia symptoms reactive hypoglycemia majority symptoms often correlated feelings hunger mimic effect inadequate sugar intake biology crash similar bodys response low blood sugar levels following periods glucose nih states causes cases reactive hypoglycemia still open debate researchers suggest certain people may sensitive body normal release hormone epinephrine causes many symptoms hypoglycemia others believe deficiencies glucagon secretion might lead reactive several hormones responsible modulating bodys response insulin including cortisol growth hormone sex hormones untreated undertreated hormonal disorders adrenal insufficiency see also addisons growth hormone therefore sometimes cause insulin hypersensitivity reactive hypoglycemia stomach bypass surgery hereditary fructose intolerance believed causes albeit uncommon reactive hypoglycemia myoinositol withdrawal cause temporary reactive hypoglycemiacitation needed several kinds reactive idiopathic reactive hypoglycemia term longer used researchers know underlying causes reactive hypoglycemia tools perform diagnosis pathophysiological data explaining check real hypoglycemia symptoms occur neither oral glucose tolerance test breakfast test effective instead hyperglucidic breakfast test ambulatory glucose testing current body requires relatively constant input glucose sugar produced upon digestion carbohydrates normal functioning glucagon insulin among hormones ensure normal range glucose human upon consumption meal blood sugar normally rises triggers pancreatic cells produce insulin hormone initiates absorption justdigested blood glucose glycogen liver metabolism storage thereby lowering glucose levels blood contrast hormone glucagon released pancreas response lower normal blood sugar levels glucagon initiates uptake stored glycogen liver bloodstream increase glucose levels sporadic highcarbohydrate snacks meals deemed specific causes sugar crashes crash one feels due rapid increase subsequent decline blood sugar body system one begins ceases consumption highsugar foods insulin actually needed produced response large rapid ingestion sugary foodscitation needed reactive hypoglycemia usually relieved dietary tips prevent sugar crashes include lowcarbohydrate diet andor frequent small meals first treatment condition first important point add small meals middle morning afternoon glycemia would start decrease adequate composition meal found fall blood glucose thus prevented patients avoid rapidly absorbed sugars thus avoid popular soft drinks rich glucose sucrose also cautious drinks associating sugar alcohol mainly fasting shortterm ailment sugar crash caused injecting much insulin usually require medical intervention people important factors consider addressing issue composition timing acute shortterm low blood sugar symptoms best treated consuming small amounts sweet foods regain balance bodys carbohydrate metabolism suggestions include sugary foods quickly digested antihypertensive class medication known calcium channel blockers could useful reactive hypoglycemia inhibition calcium channels beta islet cells help prevent overproduction insulin meal hypoglycemia time symptoms condition called idiopathic postprandial syndrome might adrenergic postprandial syndrome blood glucose levels normal symptoms caused autonomic adrenergic often syndrome associated emotional distress anxious behaviour often seen dysautonomic disorders well dietary recommendations reactive hypoglycemia help relieve symptoms postprandial syndromecitation needed
