experimentally based scct give communicators scientific evidence guide decisions essentially stating actions organization takes postcrisis depend crisis situation scct identifies key facets crisis situation influence attributions crisis reputations held stakeholders turn understanding stakeholders respond crisis informs postcrisis coombs would later expand work scct reflections empirical evidence support theory provided summary crisis response strategy guidelines crisis managers given table scct provides crisis managers evidencebased guide assessing responding crises allowing make informed strategic beneficial decisions roots scct found attribution theory provided one first links crisis situations crisis responses attributions responsibility shape strategic crisis responses formed foundation scct coombs built upon attribution theory using base predict severity potential reputational reputational crisis may bring organization using prediction guide communication response decisions minimize damage coombs draws william benoits image restoration theory conceptualization responsibility reputational threat stating perception fundamental assessments components audience perceives organization fault reputational threat put existence organization held responsible scct suggests key determining effective strategic crisis response understanding crisis situation amount reputational threat posed crisis reputational threat much damage crisis could inflict organization action taken respond reputational threat influenced three elements initial crisis responsibility crisis history prior relational initial crisis responsibility much organizations stakeholders attribute crisis organization responsible key publics hold organization crisis assessing level reputational threat facing organization crisis managers must first determine type crisis facing organization coombs identified three crisis clusters types crises scct research victim cluster accidental cluster intentional table outlines crisis clusters victim cluster organization attributed cause crisis rather organization viewed victim accidental cluster organization nominally attributed cause crisis situation generally viewed stakeholders unintentional simply accidental intentional cluster organization given attributions crisis shoulders responsibility case crisis considered deliberate one example scct used lockout began within national hockey league september determined type crisis cluster organizations situation falls managers predict much attribution placed organization much reputational threat facing fact coombs prior research showed crisis responsibility organizational reputation negatively another element threatens organizations reputation history crisis whether faced similar crises past within context well organization treated stakeholders prior relational plays part assessing reputational threat two elements involved second step crisis managers must take evaluating reputational threat facing organization either elements exist within organization intensify attributions organization increase level reputational threat organization history facing crises poor history dealing stakeholders attributions crisis responsibility level reputational threat greatercitation needed crisis responsibility reputational threat crises effect changes emotions result behaviors person perceives organization high level crisis responsibility likely feelings anger toward organization conversely lower levels crisis responsibility evoke feelings sympathy feelings affect behaviors person toward organization whether person act positively negatively toward organizationcitation needed levels crisis responsibility reputational threat determined scct provides crisis managers theoretical base strategic crisis response sccts list responding crises assumes organization accepted level responsibility crisis coombs found primary responses crises scct form three groups deny diminish rebuild scct list crisis response strategies shown table needed strategies helps organization get side story media crisis framed media determine organizations publics view medias frames become stakeholders frames secondary type responses bolstering attempts increase positive reputational perceptions presenting new positive information organization andor reminding stakeholders past good works strategy bolster goodwill arouse feelings sympathy toward organization coombs warns used supplement primary responses scct suggests organization communicates affect publics perceptions organization perceptions shape organizations publics emotionally react behave toward organization therefore communication decisions crisis managers make wake crisis could great consequences either positive negative imperative crisis managers act strategically save organizations reputation according crisis response strategies three objectives relative protecting reputations shape attributions crisis change perceptions organization crisis reduce negative effect generated crisis coombs research situational crisis communication theory focused crisis response effect corporate reputation never nonprofit organization standpoint two industries operate differently still need crisis situations properly addressed timely manner building maintaining trust
