belief perseverance also known conceptual maintaining belief despite new information firmly contradicts beliefs may even strengthened others attempt present evidence debunking phenomenon known backfire effect compare boomerang example article atlantic journalist cari romm describes study involving vaccination hesitancy study subjects expressed concerns side effects flu shots told vaccination completely safe became even less eager accept new knowledge pushed distrust vaccine even reinforcing idea already three kinds backfire effects familiarity backfire effect making myths familiar overkill backfire effect providing many arguments worldview backfire effect providing evidence threatens someone according cook lewandowsky number techniques debunk misinformation emphasizing core facts myth providing explicit warnings upcoming information false providing alternative explanations fill gaps left debunking however recent studies provided evidence backfire effects likely since rationality involves conceptual belief perseverance consistent view human beings act times irrational manner philosopher fcs schiller holds belief perseverance deserves rank among fundamental laws according lee ross craig anderson beliefs remarkably resilient face empirical challenges seem logically first study belief perseverance carried festinger riecken psychiatrists spent time members doomsday cult believed world would end december despite failure forecast believers continued adhere prophecy fails social psychological study modern group predicted destruction world theory cognitive

motivated reduce cognitive tend make changes justify stressful behavior either adding new parts cognition causing psychological dissonance rationalization avoiding circumstances contradictory information likely increase magnitude cognitive dissonance confirmation asked reappraise probability estimates light new information subjects displayed marked tendency give insufficient weight new evidence refused acknowledge inaccurate prediction reflection overall validity faith cases subjects reported stronger faith religion separate study mathematically capable teenagers adults given seven
