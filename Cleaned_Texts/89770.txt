deposits anisianladinian age long known mostly osteoderms vertebrae fragments skull specimens described provided much anatomical details showed fairly large predator tarjadia predates known species aetosaurs phytosaurs two late triassic groups crurotarsans heavy plating making one first heavily armored archosaurs prior studies placed outside archosauria member doswelliidae family heavily armored
