toxin exerts effect cleaving key proteins required nerve activation first toxin binds specifically presynaptic surface neurons use neurotransmitter bound nerve terminal neuron takes toxin vesicle receptormediated vesicle moves farther cell acidifies activating portion toxin triggers push across vesicle membrane cell botulinum neurotoxins recognize distinct classes receptors simultaneously gangliosides synaptotagmin inside cytoplasm toxin cleaves snare proteins proteins mediate vesicle fusion target membrane bound compartments meaning acetylcholine vesicles bind intracellular cell preventing cell releasing vesicles neurotransmitter stops nerve signaling leading flaccid toxin released bacterium single chain becomes activated cleaved active form consists twochain protein composed heavy chain polypeptide joined via disulfide bond light chain heavy chain contains domains several functions domain responsible binding specifically presynaptic nerve terminals well domain responsible mediating translocation light chain cell cytoplasm vacuole light chain zinc metalloprotease active part toxin translocated host cell cytoplasm cleaves host protein member snare protein family
