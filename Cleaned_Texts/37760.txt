injuries may accompanied bruising bruises often induce pain immediately trauma results formation small bruises normally dangerous alone sometimes bruises serious leading lifethreatening forms hematoma associated serious injuries including fractures severe internal bleeding likelihood severity bruising depends many factors including type healthiness affected tissues minor bruises may easily recognized people light skin color characteristic blue purple appearance idiomatically described black blue days following injury hematomas subdivided size definition ecchymoses centimetres size larger therefore larger petechiae less millimetres purpura millimetres ecchymoses also diffuse border broader definition ecchymosis escape blood tissues ruptured blood term also applies subcutaneous discoloration resulting seepage blood within injured tissue bruise colors vary red blue almost black depending severity broken capillaries blood vessels within bruise site broken venules arterioles often result deep blue dark red bruise respectively darker colored bruises may result severe bleeding blood vessels older bruises may appear yellow green many causes subcutaneous hematomas including ecchymoses coagulopathies hemophilia may cause ecchymosis formation medication betamethasone adverse effect causing presence bruises may seen patients platelet coagulation disorders treated anticoagulant unexplained bruising may warning sign child abuse domestic abuse serious medical problems leukemia meningoccocal infection unexplained bruising also indicate internal bleeding certain types cancer longterm glucocorticoid therapy cause easy bruising bruising present around navel belly button severe abdominal pain suggests acute pancreatitis connective tissue disorders syndrome may cause relatively easy spontaneous bruising depending severity spontaneous bruising bruising minimal trauma absence explanations together minor major criteria suggestive vascular syndrome veds suggests genetic testing autopsy bruises accompanying abrasions indicate abrasions occurred individual alive opposed damage incurred post mortem bruise shapes may correspond directly instrument injury modified additional factors bruises often become prominent time lapses resulting additional size swelling may grow large size course hours injury caused bruise inflicted bruises scored scale categorize severity danger injury harm score determined extent severity injuries organs tissues causing bruising turn depending multiple factors example contracted muscle bruise severely tissues crushed underlying bone capillaries vary strength stiffness toughness also vary age medical conditions low levels damaging forces produce small bruises generally cause individual feel minor pain straight away repeated impacts worsen bruises increasing harm level normally light bruises heal nearly completely within two weeks although duration affected variation severity individual healing generally severe deeper bruises take somewhat longer severe bruising harm score may dangerous cause serious complications bleeding excess fluid may accumulate causing hard fluctuating lump swelling hematoma potential cause compartment syndrome swelling cuts blood flow tissues trauma induced bruise may also caused severe potentially fatal harm internal organs example impacts head cause traumatic brain injury bleeding bruising massive swelling brain potential cause concussion coma death treatment brain bruising may involve emergency surgery relieve pressure brain damage causes bruising also cause bones broken tendons muscles strained ligaments sprained tissue damaged symptoms signs injuries may initially appear simple bruising abdominal bruising severe injuries cause difficulty moving limb feeling liquid skin may indicate lifethreatening injury require attention physician increased distress tissue causes capillaries break skin allowing blood escape build time progresses blood seeps surrounding tissues causing bruise darken spread nerve endings within affected tissue detect increased pressure depending severity location may perceived pain pressure asymptomatic damaged capillary endothelium releases endothelin hormone causes narrowing blood vessel minimize bleeding endothelium destroyed underlying von willebrand factor exposed initiates coagulation creates temporary clot plug wound eventually leads restoration normal tissue time larger bruises may change color due breakdown hemoglobin within escaped red blood cells extracellular space striking colors bruise caused phagocytosis sequential degradation hemoglobin biliverdin bilirubin hemosiderin hemoglobin producing redblue color biliverdin producing green color bilirubin producing yellow color hemosiderin producing goldenbrown products cleared area bruise disappears often underlying tissue damage repaired long process complete treatment light bruises minimal may include rice rest ice compression elevation painkillers particularly nsaids later recovery light stretching exercises particularly immediate application ice elevating area may reduce completely prevent swelling restricting blood flow area preventing internal bleeding rest preventing reinjury essential rapid recovery gently massaging area applying heat may encourage blood flow relieve pain according gate control theory pain although causing additional pain may indicate massage exacerbating injuries techniques applied least three days following initial damage ensure internal bleeding stopped although increasing blood flow allow healing factors area encourage drainage injury still bleeding allow blood seep wound cause bruise become worse cases hematomas spontaneously revert cases large hematomas localized certain organs eg
