venous ulcer defined american venous forum fullthickness defect skin frequently ankle region fails heal spontaneously sustained chronic venous disease based venous duplex ultrasound venous ulcers wounds thought occur due improper functioning venous valves usually legs hence leg important cause chronic wounds affecting venous ulcers develop mostly along medial distal leg painful negative

endovenous signs symptoms venous ulcers includecitation needed venous ulcer surgery healing process chronic venous stasis ulcer lower leg healing venous ulcer one month exact cause venous ulcers certain common denominator generally venous stasis may caused chronic venous andor congestive heart venous stasis causes pressure veins body needs pressure gradient arteries veins order heart pump blood forward arteries veins venous hypertension exists arteries longer significantly higher pressure veins blood pumped effectively venous hypertension may also stretch veins allow blood proteins leak extravascular space isolating extracellular matrix ecm molecules growth factors preventing helping heal leakage fibrinogen veins well deficiencies fibrinolysis may also cause fibrin build around vessels preventing oxygen nutrients reaching venous insufficiency may also cause white blood cells leukocytes accumulate small blood vessels releasing inflammatory factors reactive oxygen species ros free radicals contributing chronic wound buildup white blood cells small blood vessels may also plug vessels contributing blockage blood vessels leukocytes may responsible reflow phenomenon ischemic tissue never fully allowing blood flow back limb example elevating necessary also contributes reperfusion comorbidities may also root cause venous crus classic venous stasis ulcer occurs venous stasis results damage vein valvular system lower extremity extreme cases allows pressure veins higher pressure arteries pressure results transudation inflammatory mediators subcutaneous tissues lower

pathophysiology classification system developed expert panel high score gives poor venous ulcer tends occur medial side leg typically around medial malleolus gaiter area whereas arterial ulcer tends occur lateral side leg bony prominences venous ulcer typically shallow irregular sloping edges whereas arterial ulcer deep punched appearance venous ulcers typically wet moderate heavy exudate whereas arterial ulcers typically dry scabbed skin surrounding venous ulcer may edematous swollen may evidence varicose veins skin surrounding arterial ulcer may pale cold shiny hairless venous arterial

include inadequate blood flow oxygen delivery tissues seen peripheral arterial disease venous stasis ulcerations additional causes include neutrophilic skin conditions pyoderma gangrenosum sweets

ultrasound improve healing venous nonelastic ambulatory knee bk compression counters impact reflux venous pump failure compression therapy used venous leg ulcers decrease blood vessel diameter pressure increases effectiveness preventing blood flowing compression also decrease release inflammatory cytokines lower amount fluid leaking capillaries therefore prevent swelling prevent clotting decreasing activation thrombin increasing compression applied using elastic bandages boots specifically designed systematic review found compression dressings probably reduce pain help ulcers heal quickly usually within months may also improve quality however clear whether compression bandages unwanted effects potential health benefits using compression outweigh clear whether nonelastic systems better multilayer elastic patients wear much compression treating existing ulcer type dressing applied beneath compression seem matter hydrocolloid better simple low adherent good outcomes ulcer treatment shown application double compression stockings eg ulcer stockings systems contain two different stockings one often white colour one put first also worn overnight exerts basic pressure mmhg
