immature teratoma teratoma contains anaplastic immature elements often synonymous malignant teratoma tumor germ cell origin containing tissues one germ cell ovarian testicular almost always immature teratoma thus rare tumor representing teratomas ovarian cancers malignant ovarian germ cell displays specific age incidence occurring frequently first two decades life almost never unlike mature cystic teratoma immature teratoma contains immature embryonic structures coexist mature cystic teratomas constitute combination adult embryonic common symptoms noted abdominal distension prognosis treatment options vary largely depend grade stage karyotype tumor ct mri immature teratoma possesses characteristic appearance typically large cm prominent solid components cystic usually filled lipid constituents therefore demonstrates fat density ct ultrasound appearance immature teratoma nonspecific highly heterogeneous partially solid lesions scattered traditionally comprehensive surgical staging performed via exploratory laparotomy cytologic washings peritoneal biopsies omental assessment either biopsy rarely full omentectomy pelvic aortic lymph node dissection laproscopy often suggested alternative surgically stage patients immature ovarian cancer staged using figo staging system uses information obtained surgery include total abdominal hysterectomy via midline laparotomy unilateral bilateral salpingooophorectomy pelvic peritoneal washings assessment retroperitoneal lymph nodes andor ajcc staging system identical figo staging system describes extent tumor presence absences metastases lymph nodes n presence absence distant metastases immature teratoma contains varying compositions adult embryonic tissue common embryonic component identified immature teratomas occasionally tumors may present neuroepithelium resemble tumors may also present embryonic components immature cartilage skeletal muscle mesodermal immature teratomas composed embryonic endodermal derivatives often mature cystic teratoma misdiagnosed immature counterpart due misinterpretation mature neural tissue mature neural cells nuclei uniformly dense chromatin neither exhibit apoptotic

devised grading system pure immature teratomas basis differentiation cellular elements proportion immature tissue elements defines grade later modified norris et al added quantitative aspect degree ovarian immature teratoma karyotypically normal nearnormal grade tumors exhibit normal karyotype whereas grade tumors show variety abnormal though immature teratoma cells show normal karyotype may
