carpenter syndrome also called acrocephalopolysyndactyly type extremely rare autosomal congenital disorder characterized craniofacial malformations obesity syndactyly acrocephalopolysyndactyly variation acrocephalosyndactyly presents polydactyly first characterized named george alfred carpenter syndrome presents several intellectual disability also common disorder although patients may average intellectual carpenter syndrome belongs rare genetic disorder known acrocephalosyndactyly acps rn originally five types acps number decreased found closely related one another disorders paul johnson common physical manifestation carpenter syndrome early fusing fibrous cranial sutures results abnormally pointed head fusion skull bones evident birth national organization rare disorders inc babies mobile cranial bones form cone shape pass birth canal soon thereafter return normal shape however baby affected carpenter syndrome maintains cone shaped headcitation needed baby affected carpenter syndrome also display malformations face individual affected syndrome may broad cheeks flat nasal bridge wide upturned nose abnormally large nasal openings ears commonly low unevenly set malformed structure addition facial abnormalities individuals also underdeveloped maxilla andor mandible highly arched narrow palate makes speech difficult skill master teeth usually late come undersized spaced far apartcitation needed physical abnormalities associated carpenter syndrome include extra digits extra toes commonly seen fingers often toes fingers webbed process occurs sixth week gestational period often digits abnormally short fingers commonly missing interphalangeal joint roughly half babies born carpenter syndrome type heart defect seventy five percent individuals disease experience degree development delay due mild intellectual disability carpenter syndromedescriptioncitation needed carpenter syndrome associated mutations located chromosome humans additionally three key snps located chromosome identified primary causes carpenter syndrome diagnosis carpenter syndrome made based presence bicoronal sagittal skull malformations results pointed coneshaped short broad head diagnosis also made based presence extra fused digits x rays ct scans skull may performed order accurately diagnose individual however genetic disorders available genetic tests also characterized skull malformations positive result tests rule carpenter syndrome diagnosiscitation needed primary diagnostic factor malformation skull two common types craniosynostosis sagittal bicoronal sagittal craniosynostosis manifests causing long narrow skull resembling football quantitatively determined measuring anterior posterior front back diameter skull increased ap diameter indicates malformed fusion sagittal suture individuals affected sagittal craniosynostosis narrow prominent foreheads back head much larger normal soft spot small missing altogether particular type craniosynostosiscitation needed second common type skull malformation bicoronal craniosynostosis characterized wide short skull particular type craniosynostosis ap diameter smaller normal individuals individuals malformed eye sockets foreheads eye sockets much smaller normal often cause visual impairment complications may include damage optic nerve resulting decrease visual clarity bulging eyeballs result shallow eye orbits usually causes sort damage cornea outer layer eye bicoronal craniosynostosis may also result widely spaced eyes narrowing sinuses tear ducts may result inflammation mucous membranes exposed portion eyecitation needed addition previously named complications bicoronal craniosynostosis many babies also affected hydrocephalus commonly known water brain hydrocephalus results increased pressure brain cause permanent brain damage treated promptly abnormally highly arched palate also seen affected individuals causing dental problems thrusting forward lower jaw individuals affected carpenter syndrome often experience cutaneous syndactyly fusion digits polydactyly presence extra digits toes often fingers individuals also short fingers approximately one third individuals born carpenter syndrome type heart defect commonly seen heart defects may include narrowing pulmonary artery transposition major blood vessels presence abnormally large vena cava delivers blood back heart head neck upper limbs testes males affected carpenter syndrome may also fail descend paul johnson operations correct malformations skull performed within first year infancy patients affected carpenter syndrome performing surgery young age increases likelihood obtaining greatly improved appearance head modifying bone much easier skull still constantly growing surgery doctor breaks fused sutures allow brain growth doctors remove cranial plates skull reshape replace back onto skull attempt reshape head appear normal although sutures broken surgery quickly refuse cases holes form plates allowing cerebral spinal fluid escape cyst like structures external surface individual carpenter syndrome serious heart defect require surgery correct malformation heart elective surgeries may also performed parents opt childs webbed fingers toes separated improves appearance necessarily functionality digits order address occupational challenges disease many children carpenter syndrome go speech occupational therapy order achieve independence everyday tasks activities rn order address vision problems associated bicoronal craniosynostosis individual must seek consultation ophthalmologist palate severely affected dental consultation may necessary correct malformation obesity often associated carpenter syndrome lifelong diet plan often utilized maintain healthy weight addition surgery must performed testes fail descend paul johnson procedure performed individual become infertile approximately three hundred known cases carpenter syndrome united states million live births result infant affected carpenter syndrome rn carpenter syndrome autosomal recessive disease means parents must faulty genes order pass disease onto children even parents possess faulty gene still twenty five percent chance produce child affected syndrome children disease still carriers possess ability pass disease onto offspring spouse also carrier particular
