hypoestrogenism estrogen deficiency refers lower normal level estrogen umbrella term used describe estrogen deficiency various conditions estrogen deficiency also associated increased risk cardiovascular linked diseases like urinary tract osteoporosis women low levels estrogen may cause symptoms hot flashes sleeping disturbances decreased bone changes genitourinary system hypoestrogenism commonly found women postmenopausal primary ovarian insufficiency poi presenting amenorrhea absence menstrual periods hypoestrogenism includes primarily genitourinary effects including thinning vaginal tissue layers increase vaginal ph normal levels estrogen environment vagina protected inflammation infections sexually transmitted hypoestrogenism also occur men instance due hypogonadism hormonal nonhormonal treatments prevent negative effects low estrogen levels improve quality life presentations low estrogen levels include hot flashes sudden intense feelings heat predominantly upper body causing skin redden blushing believed occur due narrowing thermonuclear zone hypothalamus making body sensitive body temperature night disturbances also common symptoms associated hypoestrogenism people may experience difficulty falling asleep waking several times night early awakening different variability races ethnic classic symptoms include physical chemical changes vulva vagina lower urinary genitals go atrophic changes losing elasticity losing vaginal rugae increasing vaginal lead changes vaginal flora increase risk tissue fragility fissure genital signs include dryness lack lubrication burning irritation discomfort pain well impaired low levels estrogen lead limited genital arousal cause dyspareunia painful sexual intercourse changes four layers vaginal people low estrogen also experience higher urgency urinate dysuria painful urinationfailed verification hypoestrogenism also considered one major risk factors developing uncomplicated urinary tract infection postmenopausal women take hormone replacement estrogen contributes bone health several low estrogen levels increase bone resorption via osteoclasts osteocytes cells help bone making bones likely deteriorate increase risk fracture decline estrogen levels ultimately lead serious illnesses type osteoporosis disease thins weakens bones resulting low bone density estrogen deficiency plays important role osteoporosis development genders pronounced women younger menopausal ages five ten years compared men females also higher risk osteopenia variety conditions lead hypoestrogenism menopause primary ovarian insufficiency premature menopause due varying causes radiation therapy chemotherapy spontaneous manifestation also lead low estrogen hypogonadism condition gonads testes men ovaries women diminished activity decrease primary hypogonadism elevated serum gonadotropins detected least two occasions several weeks apart indicating gonadal secondary hypogonadism cause hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction serum levels gonadotropins may causes include certain medications gonadotropin insensitivity inborn errors steroid metabolism example aromatase deficiency deficiency deficiency dehydrogenase deficiency cholesterol sidechain cleavage enzyme steroidogenic acute regulatory protein deficiency functional amenorrheamedical citation needed low endogenous estrogen levels elevate risk cardiovascular disease women reach early estrogen needed relax arteries using endothelialderived nitric oxide resulting better heart health decreasing adverse atherogenic women poi may increased risk cardiovascular disease due low estrogen estrogen deficiency vaginal urologic effects female genitalia lower urinary tract share common estrogen receptor function due embryological development estrogen vasoactive hormone one affects blood pressure stimulates blood flow increases vaginal secretions lubrication activated estrogen receptors also stimulate tissue proliferation vaginal walls contribute formation rugae rugae aids sexual stimulation becoming lubricated distended genitourinary effects low estrogen include thinning vaginal epithelium loss vaginal barrier functionclarification needed decrease vaginal folding decrease elasticity tissues decrease secretory activity bartholin glands leads traumatization vaginal mucosa painful sensations thinning vaginal epithelium layers increase risk developing inflammation infection urinary tract vagina largely dominated bacteria genus lactobacillus typically comprise vaginal bacteria women lactobacilli process glycogen breakdown products result maintained low vaginal ph estrogen levels closely linked lactobacilli abundance vaginal ph higher levels estrogen promote thickening vaginal epithelium intracellular production glycogen large presence lactobacilli subsequent low ph levels hypothesized benefit women protecting sexually transmitted pathogens opportunistic infections therefore reducing disease hypoestrogenism typically found menopause aids diagnosis conditions poi functional estrogen levels tested several laboratory tests vaginal maturation indexclarification needed progestogen challenge test vaginal swabs small parabasal menopause usually diagnosed symptoms vaginal atrophy pelvic exams taking comprehensive medical history consisting last menstruation cycle definitive testing available determining menopause symptom complex primary lower levels estradiol harder accurately detect however laboratory tests done differentiate menopause diagnosescitation needed functional hypothalamic amenorrhea fha diagnosed based findings amenorrhea lasting three months low serum hormone gonadotropins since common causes fha include exercising much eating little much stress diagnosis fha includes assessing changes exercise weight stress addition evaluation amenorrhea includes history physical examination biochemical testing imaging measuring estrogen level examination menstrual problems clinical tests measure hormones serum prolactin thyroidstimulating hormone folliclestimulating hormone fsh help rule potential causes amenorrhea potential conditions include hyperprolactinemia poi polycystic ovary primary ovarian insufficiency also known premature ovarian failure develop women age forty consequence hypergonadotropic poi present amenorrhea similar symptoms menopause measuring fsh levels used hormone replacement therapy hrt used treat hypoestrogenism menopause related symptoms low estrogen levels premenopausal postmenopausal women lowdose estrogen medications approved us food drug administration treatment menopauserelated symptoms hrt used without progestogen improve symptoms hot flashes sweating trouble sleeping vaginal dryness fda recommends hrt avoided women history risk breast cancer undiagnosed genital bleeding untreated high blood pressure unexplained blood clots liver hrt vasomotor symptoms hypoestrogenism include different forms estrogen conjugated equine estrogens transdermal estradiol ethinyl estradiol estradiol addition hrt common progestogens used protect inner layer uterus endometrium medications include medroxyprogesterone acetate progesterone norethisterone acetate nonpharmacological treatment hot flashes includes using portable fans lower room temperature wearing layered clothing avoiding tobacco spicy food alcohol caffeine lack evidence support treatments acupuncture yoga exercise reduce estrogens also important male hypoestrogenism occur men due rare causes include aromatase deficiency estrogen insensitivity medications also cause hypoestrogenism hypoestrogenism men lead osteoporosis among estrogens may also positively involved sexual desire httpsenwikipediaorgwikihypoestrogenism
