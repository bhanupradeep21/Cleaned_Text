human anatomy muscles hip joint muscles cause movement hip modern anatomists define muscles although additional muscles may sometimes considered often divided four groups according orientation around hip joint gluteal group lateral rotator group adductor group iliopsoas group muscles hip consist four main groups gluteal muscles include gluteus maximus gluteus medius gluteus minimus tensor fasciae latae cover lateral surface ilium gluteus maximus forms muscle buttocks originates primarily ilium sacrum inserts gluteal tuberosity femur well iliotibial tract tract strong fibrous tissue runs along lateral thigh tibia fibula gluteus medius gluteus minimus originate anterior gluteus maximus ilium insert greater trochanter femur tensor fasciae latae shares origin gluteus maximus ilium also shares insertion iliotibial tract adductor brevis adductor longus adductor magnus pectineus gracilis make adductor group adductors originate pubis insert medial posterior surface femur exception gracilis inserts medial condyle tibia iliacus psoas major comprise iliopsoas group psoas major large muscle runs bodies disc vertebrae joins iliacus via tendon connects lesser trochanter femur iliacus originates iliac fossa ilium together muscles commonly referred iliopsoas group consists externus internus obturators piriformis superior inferior gemelli quadratus femoris six originate acetabulum ilium insert near greater trochanter femur additional muscles rectus femoris sartorius cause movement hip joint however muscles primarily move knee generally classified muscles hip hamstring muscles originate mostly ischial tuberosity inserting tibiafibula large moment assisting hip extension movements hip occur multiple muscles activate muscles also responsible one type movement movements hip described anatomical terminology using anatomical terms motion movement brings thighs close abdomen called flexion legs open lotus posture yoga called lateral rotation opposite movement called medial rotation hip abduction occurs femur moves outward side taking thighs apart hip adduction occurs femur moves back midline many muscles contribute movements hip muscles also play role maintaining standing posture muscles work integrated system muscles shoulder neck core lower leg supporting muscles spine provide ability stand good muscles include gluteus medius gluteus minimus abduct thigh prevent swaying hips stabilize pelvic region keeping hips level shift individuals weight order adjust body placement increase ones overall body httpsenwikipediaorgwikimusclesofthehip
