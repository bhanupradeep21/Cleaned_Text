prominent far beyond ethology literature humans express several forms animals use several modalities communication express dominance aggressive encounters competing individuals result significant costs animals minimize fighting costs increase fitness many species evolved specialized signalling systems assert dominance electing specific cues signals allow individuals gauge status conspecifics engage combat individuals higher rank signals found several species present many different visual communication common dominance signal among animals effective modality come low cost animal minimize risk gila monster heloderma suspectum example express bright orange splotches territorial conflict warn competitors poisonous thus assert dominance acoustic communication often used animals express dominance acoustic sounds vary substantially amplitude duration frequency structure influence signal vocalizations effective species may decrease physical interaction may decrease injury northern elephant seals mirounga angustirostris example polygynous breeding system adult males establish dominance hierarchies facilitates copulation acoustic signalling detrimental resolving competition males mates elephant seals express unique acoustic signals allow males remember violations past rivals recall seals dominant tactile signals occur physical contact made two competing animals transmitted short tactile communication often important building maintaining relationship among social animals establish snakes serpentes engage tactile communication compete dominance communication often
