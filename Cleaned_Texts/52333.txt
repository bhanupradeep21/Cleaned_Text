pfam database protein families includes annotations multiple sequence alignments generated using hidden markov recent version pfam released september contains general purpose pfam database provide complete accurate classification protein families originally rationale behind creating database semiautomated method curating information known protein families improve efficiency annotating pfam classification protein families widely adopted biologists wide coverage proteins sensible naming used experimental biologists researching specific proteins structural biologists identify new targets structure determination computational biologists organise sequences evolutionary biologists tracing origins early genome projects human fly used pfam extensively functional annotation genomic pfam website allows users submit protein dna sequences search matches families database dna submitted sixframe translation performed frame rather performing typical blast search pfam uses profile hidden markov models give greater weight matches conserved sites allowing better remote homology detection making suitable annotating genomes organisms wellannotated close pfam also used creation resources ipfam catalogs domaindomain interactions within proteins based information structure databases mapping pfam domains onto family pfam one entries several types family domain repeat motif family default class simply indicates members related domains defined autonomous structural unit reusable sequence unit found multiple protein contexts repeats usually stable isolation rather usually required form tandem repeats order form domain extended structure motifs usually shorter sequence units found outside globular descriptions pfam families managed general public using wikipedia see history release protein sequences uniprotkb matched least one pfam new families come range sources primarily pdb analysis complete proteomes find genes pfam family representative subset sequences aligned highquality seed alignment sequences seed alignment taken primarily pfamseq nonredundant database reference proteomes supplementation seed alignment used build profile hidden markov model using hmmer hmm searched sequence databases hits reach curated gathering threshold classified members protein family resulting collection members aligned profile hmm generate full alignment family manually curated gathering threshold assigned maximises number true matches family excluding false positive matches false positives estimated observing overlaps pfam family hits clan threshold used assess whether match family hmm included protein family upon update pfam gathering thresholds reassessed prevent overlaps new existing domains unknown function dufs represent growing fraction pfam database families named found conserved across species perform unknown role newly added duf named order addition names entries updated functions identified normally function least one protein belonging duf determined function entire duf updated family renamed named families still domains unknown function named representative protein eg ybbr numbers dufs expected continue increasing conserved sequences unknown function continue identified sequence data expected dufs eventually outnumber families known time sequence residue coverage increased families grown evolutionary relationships discovered allowing grouping families clans first introduced pfam database groupings related families share single evolutionary origin confirmed structural functional sequence hmm release approximately one third protein families belonged portion grown around threefourths version identify possible clan relationships pfam curators use simple comparison outputs program scoop well information ecod ecod semiautomated hierarchical database protein families known structures families map readily pfam entries homology levels usually map pfam pfam founded erik sonnhammer sean eddy richard durbin collection commonly occurring protein domains could used annotate protein coding genes multicellular one major aims inception aid annotation c elegans project partly driven assertion one thousand families molecular biologist cyrus chothia around different families proteins majority proteins fell counter assertion pfam database currently contains entries corresponding unique protein domains families however many families contain structural functional similarities indicating shared evolutionary origin see major point difference pfam databases time inception use two alignment types entries smaller manually checked seed alignment well full alignment built aligning sequences profile hidden markov model built seed alignment smaller seed alignment easier update new releases sequence databases came thus represented promising solution dilemma keep database date genome sequencing became efficient data needed processed time improvement speed database could updated came version introduction times faster entries pfama cover known proteins automatically generated supplement provided called pfamb pfamb contained large number small families derived clusters produced algorithm called although lower quality pfamb families could useful pfama families found pfamb discontinued release reintroduced release using new clustering algorithm pfam originally hosted three mirror sites around world preserve redundancy however pfam resource moved emblebi allowed hosting website one domain xfamorg using duplicate independent data centres allowed better centralisation updates grouping xfam projects rfam treefam ipfam others whilst retaining critical resilience provided hosting multiple pfam undergone substantial reorganisation last two years reduce manual effort involved curation allow frequent curation large database presented issues terms keeping volume new families updated information needed added speed releases database developers started number initiatives allow greater community involvement managing
