hours comparing minutes case landiolol fda points poor metabolizers decreased cardioselectivity metoprolol due increased metoprolol blood levels since gene variation reduces conversion metoprolol inactive metabolites leading almost higher plasma concentrations activation adrenergic receptors contributes bronchial dilation acceleration alveolar fluid clearance pulmonary airway system consequently cardioselective limited effect decreases heart rate without pulmonary adverse effects patients copd asthma pharmacological stimulation receptors increases coronary blood flow healthy humans patients mildly atherosclerotic coronary arteries thus cardioselective reduce myocardial oxygen demand exercise also unveils coronary exercise hyperemia reducing heart rate selectively
