apamin amino acid globular peptide neurotoxin found apitoxin bee dry bee venom consists apamin selectively blocks sk channels type k channel expressed central nervous system toxicity caused amino acids particular amino acids involved binding apamin k channel due specificity sk channels apamin used drug biomedical research study electrical properties sk channels role afterhyperpolarizations occurring immediately following action first symptoms apitoxin bee venom thought caused apamin described back hahn leditschke apamin first isolated habermann apis mellifera western honey bee apamin named bee bee venom contains many compounds like histamine phospholipase hyaluronidase mcd peptide main active component melittin apamin separated compounds gel filtration ion exchange apamin polypeptide possessing amino acid sequence oneletter sequence disulfide bonds apamin rigid two disulfide bridges seven hydrogen bonds threedimensional structure apamin studied several spectroscopical techniques hnmr circular dichroism raman spectroscopy ftir structure presumed consist alphahelix betaturns exact structure still local alterations possible find amino acids involved toxicity apamin found vincent et al guanidination εamino group decrease toxicity εamino group αamino group acetylated treated fluorescamine toxicity decreases factor respectively small decrease indicates neither εamino group αamino group essential toxicity apamin altered formation amide bond glycine ethyl ester resulted decrease toxicity factor also doesnt appear essential toxicity altered carbethoxylation toxicity decreases factor εamino group αamino group carbethoxylated acetylated toxicity decreases drastically means three amino acids essential toxicity three combined chemical alteration treatment cleavage trypsin decreases toxicity factor greater amino acids cause toxicity apamin apamin smallest neurotoxin polypeptide known one passes bloodbrain apamin thus reaches target organ central nervous system inhibits smallconductance k channels sk channels neurons channels responsible afterhyperpolarizations follow action potentials therefore regulate repetitive firing three different types sk channels show different characteristics blocked apamin whereas apamin insensitive sk channels function tetramer subunits heteromers intermediate sk channels activated binding intracellular protein calmodulin constitutively associated transport potassium ions cell along concentration gradient causes membrane potential become negative sk channels present wide range excitable nonexcitable cells including cells central nervous system intestinal myocytes endothelial cells hepatocytes binding apamin sk channels mediated amino acids pore region well extracellular amino acids sk likely inhibition sk channels caused blocking pore region hinders transport potassium ions increase neuronal excitability lower threshold generating action potential toxins block sk channels tamapin scyllatoxin kinetics labeled derivatives apamin studied vitro vivo mice chengraude et al shed light kinetics apamin key organ excretion likely kidney since enrichment labeled derivatives found peptide apamin small enough pass glomerular barrier facilitating renal excretion central nervous system contrarily found contain small amounts apamin unexpected target organ neurotoxicity caused apamin low concentration thus appeared sufficient cause toxic however results disagree study vincent et al injection supralethal dose radioactive acetylated apamin mice enrichment found spinal cord part target organ organs including kidney brain contained small amounts apamin symptoms following bee sting may include patients poisoned bee venom treated antiinflammatory medication antihistamines oral apamin element bee venom come contact apamin bee venom symptoms known caused apamin directly venom whole apamin neurotoxin acting purely central nervous system symptoms apamin toxicity well known people easily exposed toxin research neurotoxicity apamin symptoms discovered mice injection apamin produces convulsions longlasting spinal spasticity also known polysynaptic spinal reflexes disinhibited polysynaptic reflex reflex action transfers impulse sensory neuron motor neuron via interneuron spinal rats apamin found cause tremor ataxia well dramatic haemorrhagic effects furthermore apamin found times efficient applied ventricular system instead peripheral nervous system ventricular system set structures brain containing cerebrospinal fluid peripheral nervous system contains nerves ganglia outside brain spinal difference efficiency easily explained apamin binds sk channels differ slightly different tissues apamin binding probably stronger sk channels ventricular system tissues earlier years thought apamin rather nontoxic compound mgkg mice compared compounds bee current lethal dose values apamin measured mice given data known specific humans intraperitoneal mouse mgkg subcutaneous mouse mgkg intravenous mouse mgkg intracerebral mouse ngkg parenteral mouse mgkg recent studies shown sk channels regulate afterhyperpolarization also effect synaptic plasticity activitydependent adaptation strength synaptic transmission synaptic plasticity important mechanism underlying learning memory processes apamin expected influence processes inhibiting sk channels shown apamin enhances learning memory rats may provide basis use apamin treatment memory disorders cognitive dysfunction however due risk toxic effects therapeutic window sk channel blockers may therapeutic effect
