postosuchus mainly bipedal quadrupedal one postosuchuss two forelimbs slightly half size characteristic short forelimbs usually seen bipedal reptiles chatterjee suggested postosuchus could walk erect stance since short forelimbs probably used slow robert long phillip murry argued postosuchus heavily built peyer et al argued thick pectoral girdle served locomotion noted however detract theory postosuchus could also walk major study skeletal structure concluded postosuchus may obligate biped based evidence anatomy digits vertebrae pelvis proportions limbs weightbearing sections spine
