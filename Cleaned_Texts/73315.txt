antiabortion libertarian approach reproductive rights controversy developed american philosopher sean parr argues contrary lethal removal unwanted fetus ought legally impermissible except cases pregnancy jeopardizes life departurism evictionism acknowledge fetus distinct living human admit makes theories uniquely libertarian twofold moreover approaches argue fetus without mens rea occupation mother premises womb treatment hands mother must accord gentleness ex ante element ex post element states victim invasion means halt occurring must use least severe measures necessary order failure bring noncriminal aggression end via gentlest means possible places victim risk falling wrong side nonaggression principle violating far greater extent trespasser fetuses equally innocent attempt curtail property owners dealing trespassers severely libertarian punishment theory allows applicable unwanted fetuses result rape less consensually departurism evictionism differ understanding
