pollutantinduced abnormal behaviour refers abnormal behaviour induced pollutants chemicals released natural environment humans impact behaviour wide variety animals main culprits endocrinedisrupting chemicals edcs mimic block interfere animal hormones new research field integrative behavioural ecotoxicology however chemical pollutants anthropogenic offenders noise light pollution also induce abnormal behaviour topic special concern conservation human health implications studied greatly animal behaviourists environmental toxicologists conservation scientists behaviours serve potential indicators ecological health behaviour sensitive edcs developmental physiological traits behaviour eagles first drew attention wellknown dangers however behaviour generally difficult measure highly variable behaviours critical survival reproductive social behaviours cognitive abilities like learning affected directly indirectly chemical many examples documented chemical culprits identified behaviours also altered anthropogenic noise light although mechanisms relatively unknown determining link pollutants altered behaviours often requires field studies laboratory studies field studies useful determining whether behavioural changes appear pollution levels occurring environment laboratory studies used clarify mechanisms connecting environmental pollutant specific behavioural changes edcs affect synthesis storage release transport clearance receptor recognition binding postreceptor responses hormones results either stimulative inhibitive effects resulting overproduction underproduction hormones effects hormones behaviour well studied often produce direct behavioural effects acting central nervous system indirectly behaviours may altered hormones influencing animals metabolism important processes since behaviours also influence hormones chemical pollutants induce behavioural changes may also affect hormone levels could result behavioural changes studies mechanisms underlying behavioural adjustments fall category animal behaviour research described tinbergen studies animal behaviour typically pertain one tinbergen four questions applied studies

avoiding toxins environment reproductive behaviour effects may involve changes courtship mating behaviours mate choice changes nest studies topic conducted fish birds example treating adult male zebra fish biphenol weeks resulted decreased courtship behaviour exposure adult guppies mosquitofish also altered female mate selection preferred unexposed guppies treated atrazine breeding gestation less likely engage showed fewer numbers courtship displays reproductive behaviours additionally females preferred untreated studies birds show significant effects edcs mating songs displays example treating female zebra finches pcbs egg laying resulted size reduction song centres chick methylmercury exposure environmental levels years male white ibises resulted increased homosexual behaviour decreased rates key courtship behaviours less attractiveness mammals also susceptible effects individuals shown transgenerational even populationlevel consequences illustrating female rats three generations removed vinclozolin exposure show changes mate preference preferring unexposed mates male rats could complex effects chemicalinduced changes animal behaviour often consequences wild populations effects concern limited reproductive effects obvious implications population vitality example frogs exposed pesticidelevels found environment demonstrate hyperactivity whiplike convulsions depressed avoidance behaviour may increase vulnerability well guppies crude oilpolluted environments less exploratory shortterm longterm exposure may weaken foraging efficiency resourceuse diversity thus posing threat population topic therefore quite important understanding humanimpacts environment may threaten populations additionally abnormal behaviours used indicators toxic pollution provides much accessible mode toxicology science therefore potential engaging citizen scientists environmental research pollutants always chemicals unnatural stimuli introduced environment humans noise light pollution anthropogenic noise light result altered antipredator behaviour reproductive behaviour communication foraging behaviour population distribution malemale competition however mechanisms behind altered behaviours relatively unknown within literature noise pollution widespread mostly result transportation although many effects noise pollution two specific consequences adjustments population distribution modified animal communication birds provide clear example consequences altered population distributions affect interspecies interactions example diversity birds woodlands new mexico significantly reduced areas unnatural noise change diversity resulted less nest predation explained decreased presence dominant predator scrubjay effect also observed owls negative correlation found noise intensity area probability longeared owl reside suggested explanations outcome hunting efficiency diminished communication less effective noise pollution also affects conspecific communication high noise levels may require animals adjust vocalizations order communication remain effective bird songs wellstudied component animal communication use adjusted songs observed savannah sparrows residing noisy adjusted songs distinct use control environment result responses ie aggressive territorial behaviour typically observed nonadjusted songs vocalized failure recognize conspecific vocalizations also detrimental malemale competition male urban whitecrowned sparrows approached stimulus songs intruders closely regardless song type presence noise higher frequency harmful fights suggested consequence behaviour relatively small distance intruding defending males noise pollution also affect marine animals many sources noise worlds oceans sounds produced commercial shipping sonars acoustic unnatural noise levels negatively affect reproductive behaviour courtship behaviours example painted goby males take part visual courtship behaviour noisy female painted gobies experiment also less likely spawn noisy environment noise pollution also affect foraging behaviour marine animals results less effective strategies porpoises found make fewer prey capture attempts dive deeper cut foraging behaviour short vessel passes results higher energy shore crabs also observed interrupting foraging behaviour presence ship antipredator behaviour marine animals also known change noise levels high shore crabs took longer return shelters presence ship neolamprologus pulcher cichlid fish females defended nest less predators boat noise specific mitigation strategies recommendations presented marine mammal commission offer multiple ways alleviate noise pollution ocean strategies include removing source noise employing sound attenuation devices limiting use sound source monitoring operational requirements recommend improving research programs creating consistent regulation standards better enforced improving mitigation strategies light pollution affects multiple aspects animal behaviour reproductive behaviour foraging behaviour antipredator behaviour altered reproductive behaviour observed multiple taxa female crickets less captious males raised bright artificial male crickets raised continuous artificial light discriminated male crickets raised darkness moonlight female fireflies also altered reproductive behaviour failing flash placed artificial light males never flashed response however insects affected light pollution male green frogs made less calls moved often presence artificial according baker richardson behavioural changes negatively affect breeding success another consequence light pollution disruption foraging behaviour wildlife forage hunt beach mice used foraging patches near sodium vapor lights yellow bug lights less often nonlit patches also harvested fewer seeds lit study also hypothesizes artificial light may alter movement mice predation risks bats another animal greatly affected light pollution presence artificial lights associated delayed emergence bats dwellings less time spent alteration foraging behaviour causes bats miss optimal hunting time according study little one hour artificial light exposure dusk disrupts bats foraging behaviour well growth rates light pollution also alter antipredator behaviour wildlife moths come within close proximity hunting bat make powerdive towards roeder treat moths presence artificial light less likely make powerdive manoeuver results reduced ability evade bat suggested explanation behaviour according study moths turn ultrasound detection daylight simulated daylight predatorprey interactions also altered noise pollution example loggerhead turtles ghost ghost crabs attracted artificial lights begin exhibit aggressive predatory behaviour presence light study hypothesizes loggerhead hatchling predation would also increase result modified predatory behaviour predatorprey relationship would therefore altered
