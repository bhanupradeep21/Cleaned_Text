asynclitic birth asynclitism terms used obstetrics refer childbirth malposition head fetus uterus relative birth asynclitic presentation different shoulder presentation shoulder presenting first many babies enter pelvis asynclitic presentation asynclitism corrects spontaneously part normal birthing process fetal head asynclitism may affect progression labor increase need obstetrical intervention may associated difficult instrumental prevalence asynclitism transperineal ultrasound common nulliparous women second stage labor seemed commonly associated nonocciput anterior position suggesting autocorrection occurs many selfcorrection occur obstetrical intervention necessary deliver child persistence asynclitism cause problems dystocia often associated cesarean births however skilled midwife obstetrician complicationfree vaginal birth sometimes though necessarily achieved movement positioning birthing person patience extra time allow movement baby pelvis moulding skull birthing process safe circumstances options include use vacuumassisted delivery forcepsmedical citation source evidence suggest people previous asynclitic presentation likely experience subsequent source needed asynclitism digitally diagnosed using intrapartum ultrasound transabdominal cavity transperitoneal cavity intrapartum ultrasonography regularly used pregnancy constantly monitor fetal position within mothers international society ultrasound obstetrics gynecology practice guidelines recommend use intrapartum ultrasound diagnose asynclitic births prolonged obstructed asynclitism easily diagnosed labor cervix opened allowing orientation occiput back fetal head visually assessed relation mothers posterior asynclitism fetal occiput facing mothers spine anterior asynclitism fetal occiput facing mothers belly common preferred type asynclitism left occiput anterior asynclitism babys head enters pelvis way minimizes circumference baby exits body much possible type asynclitism allows fetus efficient position back fetuss head towards carriers left side meanwhile face towards mothers right side angle hip spine posterior asynclitism lengthen duration labor cause asynclitism commonly discovered vaginal exams conducted labor exam healthcare professional may feel parietal bone distinctly others professionals also use ultrasound help identify potential asynclitism occur time pregnancy commonly occurs near end third trimester labor time fetus becomes developed begins moving birth exact cause asynclitism unknown shape size uterus weight fetus pelvic anatomy multiparity contribute factors vary depending person carrying fetus example pregnant person rotated hips increase likelihood asynclitism situational factors include short umbilical cord unevenness pregnant persons pelvic floor contractions leading babys head tip one asynclitism also begin time birth happens fetus quickly comes pelvis floor straightening head water due water rushing pelvis quickly occurs difficult correct signs asynclitism may observed without medical diagnostic equipment include visual asymmetric baby bumps caused babys head tilted asymmetrically relation mothers pelvis abnormal buildup amniotic mother may report symptoms abdominal discomfort particularly one side pain one side asynclitism common fetus enters tilts maternal pelvis three types anterior posterior lateral minor asynclitism generally resolves results uncomplicated minor cases present mild molding slight deviation head midline otherwise absent major fetal head malpositioning cases present persistent occiput posterior head downward position facing towards front abdomen shoulder positions result prolonged difficult delivery may warrant surgical complications occur birth affect parent baby asynclitism lead slower difficult labor increasing stress fatigue fetus head optimally positioned result dystocia necessitating operative delivery complications associated procedures operational vaginal deliveries ovd particularly use vacuum extraction caesarean sections caesarean sections increase risk maternal complications affect future pregnancies include uterine ruptures chronic pain hemorrhages bladder injury one severe complications placenta accreta lead lifethreatening hemorrhage peripartum complications baby may face include cephalohematomas hyperbilirubinemia intracranial asynclitic birth also increase risk birth injuries brachial plexus injury nerves responsible sending signals babys arm damaged resulting temporary permanent numbness weakness even paralysis affected rare cases uncorrected asynclitism lead neonatal asphyxia child receive enough oxygen birth result temporary permanent organ mother may experience complications vaginal cervical tears excessive blood loss infection placental membrane postpartum asynclitism also affect development facial structures nerves pregnancy lifelong consequences child complications include facial malformation bells palsy deviated septum facial various techniques tried resolve asynclitic position fetus vacuum extraction delivery assistance method used prolonged obstructed labor shown reverse position less optimal one known occiput posterior occiput transverse favorable position known occiput however primary treatment asynclitic births effectiveness rate high vacuum extraction lead additional possible complications include fetal morbidity fatality damage derma layer leading bleeding within brain layer skin skull known facial nerve damage immobility permanent consequences intracranial hemorrhage leading diminished quality life however successful vacuum extraction change position nonoccital anterior position occital anterior position favorable terms asynclitic following medical procedure alter occiput position assisted vaginal delivery monitoring neonate extremely important intracranial hemorrhages may imperceptible noninvasive techniques typically first steps dealing asynclitic birth short quick breaths synchronized contractions commonly suggested obstetrician help prolonged labor positioning techniques also employed help baby rotate examples techniques include handsonknees position lunging kneeling lunge sidelying release use birth ball positioning techniques work healthcare professionals may attempt manual rotation attempting adjust babys position manually via none methods successful physician may consider caesarean section deliver baby along procedural interventions supportive measures taken alleviate physical psychological trauma associated childbirth supportive measures come
