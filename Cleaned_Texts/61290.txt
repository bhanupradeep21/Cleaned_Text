histological changes small bowel biopsy serologic testing clinical signs symptoms laboratory findings intestinal epithelial autoantibodies aid confirming original diagnostic criteria autoimmune

prolonged diarrhea lasting longer six weeks accompanied malabsorption diminished intraepithelial lymphocytosis deep crypt lymphocytosis increased crypt apoptotic bodies exclusion causes villous atrophy symptoms listed required common site autoimmune enteropathy duodenum however autoimmune enteropathy may also affect parts gastrointestinal tract visually endoscopy may normal abnormal findings include ulcerations mucosal histopathological features include small bowel villous changes atrophy blunting typically prominent proximal occasionally crypt abscesses also crypt epithelium may contain apoptotic bodies lymphocytic infiltration comparatively little surface lymphocytosis less lymphocytes per epithelial furthermore intestinal mucosa contains lymphocytes macrophages goblet paneth cells may crypt enterocytes increase hla class ii molecular possible exception prominent mesenteric lymph nodes may detected cases abdominal imaging typically important diagnostic technique determining autoimmune enteropathy diagnosis wireless capsule patients autoimmune enteropathy capsule endoscopy typically detects small intestinal abnormalities mostly form scalloping mosaic pattern mucosal

many patients autoimmune enteropathy develop malnutrition oral nutritional supplements may help manage malnutrition however parenteral nutrition often corticosteroids prednisone budesonide often first line treatment respond corticosteroids immunosuppressive drugs azathioprine mycophenolate mofetil rituximab cyclosporine medications also used alongside corticosteroids maintenance therapy medications often adverse side effects dont always help maintain mesenchymal stem cell therapy also used treat autoimmune enteropathy shown without treatment mortality rates autoimmune enteropathy high many
