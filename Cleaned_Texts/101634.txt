mouth body orifice many animals ingest food vocalize body cavity immediately behind mouth opening known oral cavity cavum oris also first part alimentary canal leads pharynx gullet tetrapod vertebrates mouth bounded outside lips cheeks thus oral cavity also known buccal cavity latin bucca meaning contains tongue inside except groups like birds lissamphibians vertebrates usually teeth although fish species pharyngeal teeth instead oral teeth bilaterian phyla including arthropods molluscs chordates twoopening gut tube mouth one end anus end forms first ontogeny criterion used classify bilaterian animals protostomes deuterostomes first multicellular animals probably mouth gut food particles engulfed cells exterior surface process known endocytosis particles became enclosed vacuoles enzymes secreted digestion took place intracellularly digestive products absorbed cytoplasm diffused cells form digestion used nowadays simple organisms amoeba paramecium also sponges despite large size mouth gut capture food however animals mouth gut lining continuous epithelial cells surface body animals live parasitically originally guts secondarily lost structures original gut diploblastic animals probably consisted mouth oneway gut modern invertebrates still system food ingested mouth partially broken enzymes secreted gut resulting particles engulfed cells gut lining indigestible waste ejected animals least complex earthworm embryo forms dent one side blastopore deepens become archenteron first phase formation gut deuterostomes blastopore becomes anus gut eventually tunnels make another opening forms mouth protostomes used thought blastopore formed mouth meaning first anus formed later opening made end gut recent research however shows protostomes edges slitlike blastopore close middle leaving openings ends become mouth apart sponges placozoans almost animals internal gut cavity lined gastrodermal cells less advanced invertebrates sea anemone mouth also acts anus circular muscles around mouth able relax contract order open close fringe tentacles thrusts food cavity gape widely enough accommodate large prey items food passes first pharynx digestion occurs extracellularly gastrovascular annelids simple tubelike guts possession anus allows separate digestion foodstuffs absorption many molluscs radula used scrape microscopic particles invertebrates hard exoskeletons various mouthparts may involved feeding behaviour insects range mouthparts suited mode feeding include mandibles maxillae labium modified suitable appendages chewing cutting piercing sponging decapods six pairs mouth appendages one pair mandibles two pairs maxillae three sea urchins set five sharp calcareous plates used jaws known aristotles vertebrates first part digestive system buccal cavity commonly known mouth buccal cavity fish separated opercular cavity gills water flows mouth passes gills exits via operculum gill slits nearly fish jaws may seize food feed opening jaws expanding pharynx sucking food items food may held chewed teeth located jaws roof mouth pharynx gill nearly amphibians carnivorous adults many catch prey flicking elongated tongue sticky tip drawing back mouth hold prey jaws swallow food whole without much typically many small hinged pedicellate teeth bases attached jaws crowns break intervals replaced amphibians one two rows teeth jaws frogs lack teeth lower jaw many amphibians also vomerine teeth attached bone roof mouths reptiles largely similar mammals crocodilians reptiles teeth anchored sockets able replace approximately teeth times reptiles either carnivorous insectivorous turtles often herbivorous lacking teeth suitable efficiently chewing food turtles often gastroliths stomach grind plant snakes flexible lower jaw two halves rigidly attached numerous joints skull modifications allow open mouths wide enough swallow prey whole even wider birds teeth relying instead means gripping macerating food beaks range sizes shapes according diet composed elongated mandibles upper mandible may nasofrontal hinge allowing beak open wider would otherwise possible exterior surface beaks composed thin

gape mouths provide cooling evaporation mouth mammals rely panting thermoregulation increases evaporation water across moist surfaces lungs tongue mouth birds also avoid overheating gular fluttering flapping wings near gular throat skin similar panting various animals use mouths threat displays may gape widely exhibit teeth prominently flash startling colours mouth lining display allows potential

mouths also used part mechanism producing sounds communication produce sounds air forced lungs vocal cords larynx humans pharynx soft palate hard palate alveolar ridge tongue teeth lips termed articulators play part production speech varying position tongue relation articulators moving lips restricts airflow lungs different ways changes mouths resonating properties producing range different
