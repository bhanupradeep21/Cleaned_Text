culturomics highthroughput cell culture bacteria aims comprehensively identify strains species samples obtained tissues human gut approach conceived alternative complementary method metagenomics relies presence homologous sequences identify new due limited phylogenetic information available bacteria metagenomic data generally contains large amounts microbial dark matter sequences unknown culturomics provides missing gaps added advantage enabling functional study generated cultures main drawback many bacterial species remain effectively uncultivable growth conditions better understood therefore optimization culturomics approach done improving culture unlike metagenomics relies direct shotgun sequencing rrna gene sequencing culturomics based matrixassisted laser malditof mass however culturomics also uses rna sequencing identify new
