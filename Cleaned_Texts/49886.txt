biology biological life cycle life cycle biological context clear series stages life organism begins zygote often egg concludes adult reproduces producing offspring form new zygote goes series stages process repeating cyclic fashion concept closely related life history development ontogeny differs stressing transitions form may involve growth asexual reproduction sexual reproduction organisms different generations species succeed life cycle plants many algae two multicellular stages life cycle referred alternation generations term life history often used particularly organisms red algae three multicellular stages rather life cycles include sexual reproduction involve alternating haploid n diploid stages ie change ploidy involved return diploid stage haploid stage meiosis must occur regard changes ploidy three types cycles cycles differ mitosis growth occurs zygotic meiosis gametic meiosis one mitotic stage mitosis occurs n phase zygotic meiosis phase gametic meiosis therefore zygotic gametic meiosis collectively termed haplobiontic single mitotic phase confused haplontic sporic meiosis hand mitosis two stages diploid haploid stages termed diplobiontic confused diplonticcitation needed study reproduction development organisms carried many botanists zoologists wilhelm hofmeister demonstrated alternation generations feature unites plants published result see plant sexuality terms haplobiont diplobiont used description life cycles proposed initially algae nils svedelius became used terms autogamy gamontogamy used protist life cycles introduced karl gottlieb description complex life cycles various organisms contributed disproof ideas spontaneous generation zygotic meiosis meiosis zygote immediately karyogamy fusion two cell nuclei way organism ends diploid phase produces several haploid cells cells divide mitotically form either larger multicellular individuals haploid cells two opposite types gametes eg male female individuals cells fuse become zygote whole cycle zygotes diploid cell mitosis occurs haploid phase individuals cells result mitosis haplonts hence life cycle also called haplontic life cycle haplonts gametic meiosis instead immediately dividing meiotically produce haploid cells zygote divides mitotically produce multicellular diploid individual group unicellular diploid cells cells diploid individuals undergo meiosis produce haploid cells gametes haploid cells may divide mitosis form haploid cells many yeasts haploid phase predominant life cycle phase diplonts mitosis occurs diploid phase ie gametes usually form quickly fuse produce diploid zygotescitation needed whole cycle gametes usually haploid cells mitosis usually occurs diploid phase diploid multicellular individual diplont hence gametic meiosis also called diplontic life cycle diplonts sporic meiosis also commonly known intermediary meiosis zygote divides mitotically produce multicellular diploid sporophyte sporophyte creates spores via meiosis also divide mitotically producing haploid individuals called gametophytes gametophytes produce gametes via mitosis plants gametophyte smallsized also shortlived plants many algae gametophyte dominant stage life cyclecitation needed haplodiplonts animals sexdetermination system called haplodiploid related haplodiplontic life cycle red algae lemanea green algae prasiola vegetative meiosis also called somatic meiosis rare vegetative meiosis occur haplodiplontic also diplontic life cycles gametophytes remain attached part sporophyte vegetative nonreproductive diploid cells undergo meiosis generating vegetative haploid cells undergo many mitosis produces gametes different phenomenon called vegetative diploidization type apomixis occurs brown algae eg elachista cells haploid part plant spontaneously duplicate chromosomes produce diploid tissue parasites depend exploitation one hosts must infect one host species complete life cycles said complex indirect life cycles dirofilaria immitis heartworm indirect life cycle example microfilariae must first ingested female mosquito develops infective larval stage mosquito bites animal transmits infective larvae animal migrate pulmonary artery mature parasites infect single species direct life cycles example parasite direct life cycle ancylostoma caninum canine hookworm develop infective larval stage environment penetrate skin dog directly mature adults small parasite infect given host order complete life cycle said obligate parasite host sometimes infection parasite survive complete life cycle without infecting particular host species parasites sometimes infect hosts complete life cycles accidental hosts host parasites reproduce sexually known definitive final primary host intermediate hosts parasites either reproduce asexually parasite always develops new stage type host cases parasite infect host undergo development hosts known transport hosts paratenic host useful raising chance parasite transmitted definitive host example cat lungworm aelurostrongylus abstrusus uses slug snail intermediate host first stage larva enters mollusk develops third stage larva infectious definitive cat mouse eats slug third stage larva enter mouses tissues undergo developmentcitation needed primitive type life cycle probably haploid individuals asexual bacteria archaea exhibit life cycle like eukaryotes apparently eg cryptophyta choanoflagellata many euglenozoa many amoebozoa red algae green algae imperfect fungi rotifers many groups necessarily however eukaryotes probably primitively asexual lost sexual reproduction observed many eukaryotes including animals plants exhibit asexual reproduction may facultative obligate life cycle sexual reproduction occurring less individual organisms participating biological life cycle ordinarily age die cells organisms connect successive life cycle generations germ line cells descendants potentially immortal basis difference fundamental problem biology russian biologist historian zhores considered accuracy genome replicative synthetic systems alone explain immortality germ lines rather medvedev thought known features biochemistry genetics sexual reproduction indicate presence unique information maintenance restoration processes gametogenesis stage biological life cycle particular medvedev considered important opportunities information maintenance germ cells created recombination meiosis dna repair saw processes within germ line cells capable restoring integrity dna chromosomes types damage cause irreversible ageing nongerm line cells eg somatic ancestry present day cell presumably traces back unbroken lineage billion years origin life actually cells immortal multigenerational cell immortality cell lineage depends maintenance cell division potential potential may lost particular lineage cell damage terminal differentiation occurs nerve cells programmed cell death apoptosis development maintenance cell division potential biological life cycle successive generations depends avoidance accurate repair cellular damage particularly dna damage sexual organisms continuity germline successive cell cycle generations depends effectiveness processes avoiding dna damage repairing dna damages occur sexual processes eukaryotes provide opportunity effective repair dna damages germ line homologous
