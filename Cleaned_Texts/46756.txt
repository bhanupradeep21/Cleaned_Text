major histocompatibility complex sexual selection concerns major histocompatibility complex mhc molecules allow immune system surveillance population protein molecules hosts cells yamazaki et al demonstrated sexual selection mate choice male mice females different mhcclarify major histocompatibility complex genes control immune response effective resistance pathogens able maintain extremely high level allelic diversity throughout time throughout different populations studies suggest mhc involved mate choice many vertebrates olfactory cues several proposed hypotheses address mhcassociated mating preferences could adaptive unusually large amount allelic diversity maintained vast source genetic variation affecting organisms fitness stems coevolutionary arms race hosts parasites two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses explaining one selection maintenance highly diverse set mhc genes mhc heterozygotes resistant parasites called heterozygote advantage second selection undergoes frequencydependent called red queen hypothesis first hypothesis individuals heterozygous mhc resistant parasites homozygous beneficial females choose mates mhc genes different would result mhcheterozygous known disassortative mating hypothesis states individuals heterozygous mhc would capable recognizing wider range pathogens therefore inciting specific immune response greater number immunity advantage unfortunately mhcheterozygote advantage hypothesis adequately nonmhc immune genes across species exhibit heterozygote disadvantage mice increased mhc heterozygosity reduces fitness challenging hypothesis mhcheterozygous females significantly reduced fitness compared finding replicated another study mice cases excess heterozygosity lead decreased optimality hypothesis states much

mhc loci humans greater mhc diversity greater risk autoimmune disorders mhc diversity may low foreign peptides stand selfbackground individual level mhc diversity tends low across many species intermediate heterozygosity mhc overall evidence supports intermediate mhc heterozygosity red queen hypothesis asserts mhc diversity maintained parasites individuals mhc alleles render different resistances particular parasite allele highest resistance favored selected consequently spread throughout population recombination mutation cause generation new variants among offspring may facilitate quick response rapidly evolving parasites pathogens much shorter generation times however particular allele becomes common selection pressure parasites avoid recognition common allele increases advantageous characteristic allows parasite escape recognition spreads causes selection formerly resistant allele enables parasite escape cycle frequencydependent selection cycle eventually leads coevolutionary arms race may support maintenance mhc diversity hypothesis empirical inbreeding avoidance hypothesis less hostparasite relationships heterozygote advantage hypothesis red queen hypothesis extreme diversity mhc would cause individuals sharing mhc alleles likely related result one function mhcdisassortative mating would avoid mating family members harmful genetic consequences

advantage animals rarely avoid inbreeding avoidance hypothesis ruled explanation observed pattern mhcdependent mate preference relatedness associated mate course searching potential mates would benefit females able discriminate bad genes order increase health viability offspring female mate choice occurs good genes implied genetic variation exists among males furthermore one would presume said difference genes would impart difference fitness well could potentially chosen selected generally extreme polymorphism mhc genes selected hostparasite arms races red queen hypothesis however disassortative mate choice may maintain genetic diversity species depending parasites alter selection mhc alleles mhcdependent matechoice may increase fitness offspring enhancing immunity mentioned earlier case either heterozygote advantage hypothesis red queen hypothesis selection also favors mating practices mhcdependent therefore mate respect probably evolved females choose males either based
