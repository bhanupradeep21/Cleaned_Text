milgram experiments obedience authority figures series social psychology experiments conducted yale university psychologist stanley milgram measured willingness study participants men age range diverse range occupations varying levels education obey authority figure instructed perform acts conflicting personal conscience participants led believe assisting unrelated experiment administer electric shocks learner fake electric shocks gradually increased levels would fatal experiment found unexpectedly high proportion subjects would fully obey instructions every participant going volts going full volts milgram first described research article journal abnormal social later discussed findings greater depth book obedience authority experimental experiments began august grant proposal approved july basement linslychittenden hall yale university three months start trial german nazi war criminal adolf eichmann milgram devised psychological study explain psychology genocide answer popular contemporary question could eichmann million accomplices holocaust following orders could call experiment repeated many times around globe fairly consistent results interpretations well applicability holocaust three individuals took part session experiment subject actor arrived session together experimenter told taking part scientific study memory learning see effect punishment subjects ability memorize content also always clarified payment participation experiment secured regardless development subject actor drew slips paper determine roles unknown subject slips said teacher actor would always claim drawn slip read learner thus guaranteeing subject would always teacher next teacher learner taken adjacent room learner strapped appeared electric chair experimenter dressed lab coat order appear authority told participants ensure learner would later variation experiment confederate would eventually plead mercy yell heart point prior actual test teacher given sample electric shock electroshock generator order experience firsthand shock learner would supposedly receive experiment would feel like teacher learner separated could communicate see teacher given list word pairs teach learner teacher began reading list word pairs learner teacher would read first word pair read four possible answers learner would press button indicate response answer incorrect teacher would administer shock learner voltage increasing increments wrong answer correct teacher would read next word volts ranged shock generator included verbal markings vary slight shock danger severe shock subjects believed wrong answer learner receiving actual shocks reality shocks learner separated teacher learner set tape recorder integrated electroshock generator played previously recorded sounds shock level voltage fake shocks increased learner began making audible protests banging repeatedly wall separated teacher every condition learner makessays predetermined sound word highest voltages reached learner fell time teacher indicated desire halt experiment experimenter instructed give specific verbal prods prods prod could used prod unsuccessful subject still wished stop four successive verbal prods experiment halted otherwise experiment halted subject elicited maximum shock three times experimenter also prods use teacher made specific comments teacher asked whether learner might suffer permanent physical harm experimenter replied although shocks may painful permanent tissue damage please go teacher said learner clearly wants stop experimenter replied whether learner likes must go learned word pairs correctly please go conducting experiment milgram polled fourteen yale university senioryear psychology majors predict behavior hypothetical teachers poll respondents believed small fraction teachers range zero average would prepared inflict maximum voltage milgram also informally polled colleagues found believed subjects would progress beyond strong also reached honorary harvard university graduate chaim homnick noted experiment would concrete evidence nazis innocence due fact poor people likely cooperate milgram also polled forty psychiatrists medical school believed tenth shock victim demands free subjects would stop experiment predicted shock victim would refuse answer percent subjects would still continue believed little onetenth one percent subjects would administer highest shock milgram suspected experiment obedience exhibited nazis reflected distinct german character planned use american participants control group using german participants expected behave closer nazis however unexpected results stopped conducting experiment german subjects uncomfortable administering shocks displayed varying degrees tension stress signs included sweating trembling stuttering biting lips groaning digging fingernails skin even nervous laughing fits subjects showed definite signs nervous laughing smiling every participant paused experiment least question continued assured experimenter said would refund money paid participating milgram summarized experiment article perils obedience writing legal philosophic aspects obedience enormous importance say little people behave concrete situations set simple experiment yale university test much pain ordinary citizen would inflict another person simply ordered experimental scientist stark authority pitted subjects participants strongest moral imperatives hurting others subjects participants ears ringing screams victims authority often extreme willingness adults go almost lengths command authority constitutes chief finding study fact urgently demanding explanation ordinary people simply jobs without particular hostility part become agents terrible destructive process moreover even destructive effects work become patently clear asked carry actions incompatible fundamental standards morality relatively people resources needed resist original simulated shock

victims although certainly experiments tended lend weight milgrams original milgram elaborated two theories book irrational exuberance yale finance professor robert j shiller argues factors might partially able explain milgram experiments people learned experts tell something right probably even seem fact experimenter indeed correct right continue giving though subjects suspect experiment computerized avatar used place learner receiving electrical shocks although participants administering shocks aware learner unreal experimenters reported participants responded situation

willing continue experiment desire support scientific goals leader lack identification also neuroscientific study supports perspective namely watching learner receive electric shocks activate brain regions involving empathic obedience authority experimental view milgram describes variations experiment previously reported several experiments varied distance participant teacher learner generally participant physically closer learner participants compliance decreased variation learners physical immediacy participant hold learners arm onto shock percent participants completed experiment participants compliance also decreased experimenter physically farther away experiments example experiment participants received telephonic instructions experimenter compliance decreased percent

universitys prestige possible factor influencing participants behavior conditions obedience dropped percent though difference statistically significant milgram also combined effect authority conformity experiments participant joined one two additional teachers also actors like learner behavior participants peers strongly affected results experiment two additional teachers refused comply four participants continued experiment experiment participant performed subsidiary task reading questions via microphone recording learners answers another teacher complied fully variation continued
