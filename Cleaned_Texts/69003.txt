expectancy violations theory evt theory communication analyzes individuals respond unanticipated violations social norms theory proposed judee k burgoon late continued nonverbal expectancy violations theory based burgoons research studying burgoons work initially analyzed individuals allowances expectations personal distance responses personal distance violations influenced level liking relationship theory later changed current name researchers began focus violations social behavior expectations beyond nonverbal theory sees communication exchange behaviors one individuals behavior used violate expectations another participants communication perceive exchange either positively negatively depending upon existing personal relationship favorably violation violations expectancies cause arousal compel recipient initiate series cognitive appraisals theory predicts expectancies influence outcome communication interaction either positive negative predicts positive violations increase attraction violator negative violations decrease attraction beyond proxemics examining people interpret violations many given communicative contexts evt also makes specific predictions individuals reaction given expectation violations individuals reciprocate match someones unexpected behavior also compensate counteract opposite communicators evt examines three main components interpersonal communication situations expectancies communicator reward valence violation expectancy refers individual anticipates happen given situation expectancies primarily based upon social norms specific characteristics idiosyncrasies burgoon notes people view others behaviors random rather various expectations others think behave evt proposes observation interaction others leads expectancies two types expectancies noted predictive predictive expectations behaviors expect see typical houser vary across let people know expect based upon typically occurs within context particular environment example husband wife may evening routine husband always washes dishes ignore dirty dishes one night might seen predictive discrepancy prescriptive expectations hand based upon beliefs behaviors performed needed desired houser person walks police department report crime person expectation police file report follow investigation judee burgoon jerold hale categorize existing expectations two types based process interaction preinteractional interactional preinteractional expectations package knowledge skills person already entering example aggressive attitudes may expected previous experience included dealing similar attitudes interactional expectations form abilities equipped conduct ongoing proper reactions nodding show listening behaviors expected conversation theory first proposed evt identified three factors influence persons expectations interactant variables environmental variables variables related nature interactant variables traits persons involved communication sex attractiveness race culture status environmental variables include amount space available nature territory surrounding interaction interaction variables include social norms purpose interaction formality factors later evolved communicator characteristics relational characteristics communicator characteristics include personal features individuals appearance personality communication also includes factors age sex ethnic relational characteristics refer factors similarity familiarity status type relationship one individual shares within another eg romantic business platonic previous experiences shared individuals close one another also relational characteristics influence context encompasses environment interaction communicator characteristics lead distinctions males females assessing extent nonverbal expressions power dominance effect immediacy immediacy cues conversational distance lean body orientation gaze touch may differ genders create psychological closeness distance behavioural expectations may also shift depending environment one experiencing example visit church produce different expectations social function expected violations therefore altered similarly expectations differ based culture europe one may expect greeted three kisses alternating cheeks case united communicator reward valence evaluation one makes person committed violation expectancy em griffin summarizes concept behind communicator reward valence sum positive negative attributes brought encounter plus potential reward punish social exchange theory explains individuals seek reward seek avoid punishing one individual interacts another burgoon believes assess positive negative attributes person brings person ability reward punish receiver future person positive reward valence rewards simply refer persons ability provide want need represented several features communicators high social class reputation knowledge positive emotional support physical attractiveness term communicator reward valence used describe results example people feel encouraged conversation listener nodding making eye contact responding actively conversely listener avoiding eye contact yawning texting implied interest interaction speaker may feel violated deviation expectations always yield negative results depends degree reward held reward communicator action might viewed positive

conditions positive negative interpretation behavior nature rewardingness violator nature violator evaluated many categories attractiveness prestige ability provide resources associated relationship

upon relationship particular behavior valence persons preinteractional expectancies especially personal attributes may cause perceiver evaluate communication behavior target differently terms assigning positive negative valenced another perspective violation valence perceived positive negative value assigned breach expectations inconsequential violator perspective places much greater weight act breach violator expectancy violations refer actions noticeably discrepant expectancy classified outside range expectancy term arousal value used describe consequences deviations expectations individuals expectations violated interests attentions arousal occurs ones interest attention deviation increases resulting less attention paid message attention source two kinds arousals cognitive arousal idea people mentally aware violation physical occurs people body actions behaviors response deviations example one experiences physical arousal chooses move physical space keep distance conversationalists stretch body beth le poire judee burgoon research examine physical arousal conversation result shows participants report cognitive arousal physically speaking heart rate decreases pulse volume occurrence arousal aligned threats burgoon introduced term threat threshold explain people different levels tolerance distant violations threat threshold high people feel good even keep close distance violator whereas people low threat threshold sensitive uncomfortable closeness distance assessing expectancy violation valence communicator reward valence given situation becomes possible make rather specific predictions whether individual perceived violation reciprocate compensate behavior question guerrero burgoon noticed predictable patterns develop considering reward valence violation valence specifically violation valence perceived positive communicator reward valence also perceived positive theory predicts individuals reciprocate positive behavior similarly one perceives violation valence negative communicator reward valence negative theory predicts one reciprocate negative behavior thus disliked coworker grouchy unpleasant people likely reciprocate unpleasant return conversely one perceives negative violation valence views communicator reward valence positive likely person compensate partners negative behavior example imagine supervisor appears sullen throws stack papers front employee rather grunt back evt predicts employee compensate bosss negativity perhaps asking everything okay difficult predict however situation person viewed unfavorably violates another positive behavior situation receiver may reciprocate giving person benefit assumptions discussed thus far summarized six major propositions posited evt
