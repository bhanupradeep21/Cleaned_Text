tooth discoloration abnormal tooth color hue external discoloration accumulation stains tooth surface internal discoloration due absorption pigment particles tooth sometimes several different coexistent factors responsible appearance perception tooth result complex interaction factors lighting conditions translucency opacity light scattering gloss human eye intrinsic pigmentation tooth turn determined genetic natural light hitting tooth undergoes reflection absorption transmission varying degrees tissue layer tooth reflected light detected human eye determines perceived appearance teeth thin enamel layer outer surface enamel layer whiter semitransparent contributes blue pink green tints tooth underlying dentin layer darker enamel yellowbrown color less dentin forms bulk tooth contributes overall tooth core tooth soft connective tissue termed dental pulp pinkred due vascularity rarely visible overlying enamel dentin unless thickness layers reduced tooth wear rarely internal resorption public opinion normal tooth shade tends distorted portrayals cosmetically enhanced teeth common media one report common tooth shade general population ranged vita classical shade tooth color varies according race gender geographic females generally slightly whiter teeth males partly females teeth smaller therefore less bulk dentin partially visible enamel layer reason larger teeth molars canine cuspid teeth tend darker baby teeth deciduous teeth generally whiter adult teeth follow due differences ratio enamel dentin extrinsic discolorations common many different range factors capable staining surface restorations eg composite fillings porcelain extrinsic discolorations allowed remain long time may become causes intrinsic discoloration generally fall occur tooth development acquired later life known causes intrinsic staining listed however causes dental caries tooth decay begins opaque white spot surface enamel demineralization progresses various lesion eventually cavitates underlying brown color becomes fluorosis may occur chronic excessive exposure fluoride years tooth fluoride naturally occurring mineral water although regions higher levels others areas fluoride added water supplies low levels help prevent tooth decay exposure also occur via bottled water fluoride toothpaste mildest form fluorosis appears small opaque white flecks enamel severe cases show severely hypoplastic patches enamel also prone accumulation surface chronological fine white bands fluorosis may seen correspond times high exposure dental trauma may result following luxation injuries red discoloration may develop almost instantly due severance venous microcirculation tooth arteries continue supply blood pulp blood decomposed gradually bluebrown discoloration teeth may turn grey following traumainduced pulp necrosis death discoloration typically develops weeks months injury caused incorporation pigments released breakdown pulpal tissue blood yellow discoloration may occur following pulp canal obliteration ie sealing trauma developing adult tooth eg intrusion baby tooth bone may affect enamel layer adult becomes apparent adult tooth erupts teeth die mainly result extensive tooth decay however may also occur following dental trauma heavy drilling tooth tooth preparation prior restoration internal resorption may sometimes follow dental trauma although cases appears unrelated dentin resorbed replaced instead hyperplastic vascular pulp tissue process starts approach external surface tooth pink hue replacement pulp tissue may become visible remaining overlying tooth appearance sometimes termed pink tooth internal staining common following root canal treatment however exact causes completely failure completely clean necrotic soft tissue pulp system may cause staining certain root canal materials eg gutta percha root canal sealer cements another possible factor lack pulp pressure dentinal tubules pulp removed leading incorporation dietary stains amalgam fillings often stain tooth placed noticeable old fillings pigment slowly leaches amalgam filling material associated corroded surfaces addition metallic fillings cast shadow visible tooth make appear tetracycline broad spectrum derivative minocycline common treatment drug able chelate calcium ions incorporated teeth cartilage ingestion years tooth development causes yellowgreen discoloration dentin visible enamel fluorescent ultraviolet light later tetracycline oxidizes staining becomes brown longer fluoresces uv drugs derived tetracycline glycylcycline share side

appearance structure enamel hypoplasia enamel hypocalcification examples defective enamel potentially gives discolored appearance tooth teeth affected way also usually susceptible staining acquired throughout life amelogenesis imperfecta rare condition affects formation enamel amelogenesis enamel fragile teeth appear yellow brown surface stains build dentinogenesis imperfecta defect dentin

may associated red brown discolored hyperbilirubinemia years tooth formation may make bilirubin incorporate dental hard tissues causing yellowgreen bluegreen one condition hemolytic disease newborn erythroblastosis thalassemia sickle cell anemia may associated blue green brown tooth high proportion children cystic fibrosis discolored possibly result exposure tetracycline however cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator also demonstrated involved enamel formation suggesting disease influence tooth discoloration regardless exposure tetracyclines intrinsic discoloration tends accompany aging throughout life deposition secondary dentin occurs along internal walls pulp chamber secondary dentin darker opaque primary dentin gives dentin overall darker time enamel layer gradually thinned tooth wear processes attrition acid erosion degree considered enamel also becomes less porous phosphate deficientmedical citation needed discoloration front teeth one common reasons people seek dental however many people teeth normal shade ask management tooth discoloration depends cause discoloration harmless may may cosmetic concern individual cases may indicate underlying pathology pulp necrosis rarely systemic disorder extrinsic discoloration readily removed cleaning teeth whether whitening ie abrasive toothpaste home treatment carried professional eg scaling andor polishing prevent future buildup extrinsic stains identification cause eg smoking required intrinsic discoloration generally requires one many types tooth bleaching alternatively appearance tooth hidden dental restorations eg
