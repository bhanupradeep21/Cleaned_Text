integrative neuroscience study neuroscience works unify functional organization data better understand complex structures relationship structure function regions functions connect different parts brain carrying different tasks interconnecting come together allowing complex integrative neuroscience works fill gaps knowledge largely accomplished data sharing create understanding systems currently applied simulation neuroscience computer modeling brain integrates functional groups roots integrative neuroscience originated rashevskyrosen school relational characterizes functional organization mathematically abstracting away structure ie physics chemistry expanded introduced hierarchical functional integration hierarchical integration structural involving spatiotemporal dynamic continuity euclidean space bring functional organization viz however functional integration relational requires topology restricted euclidean space rather occupying vector means given functional organization methods functional analysis enable relational organization mapped functional integration viz thus hierarchical functional integration entails neurobiology cognitive semantics hierarchical organization associated neurobiology relational organization associated cognitive semantics relational organization throws away matter function dictates structure hence material aspects entailed reductionism causal nexus structure dynamics entails function obviates functional integration causal entailment brain hierarchical integration absent structure integrative neuroscience studied viewpoint functional organization hierarchical levels defined causal entailment brain hierarchical integration studied viewpoint relational organization defined semantic entailment brain functional integration aims present studies functional organization particular brain systems across scale hierarchical integration leading speciestypical behaviors normal pathological states integrative

specializations within contemporary neuroscience including diversity inevitable yet arguably created void neglect primary role nervous system enabling animal survive prosper integrative neuroscience
