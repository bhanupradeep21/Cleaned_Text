interaction defined microbes viruses sustain within host organisms molecular cellular organismal population level term commonly used refer diseasecausing microorganisms although may cause illness definition expanded known pathogens survive within host whether cause disease molecular cellular level microbes infect host divide rapidly causing disease causing homeostatic imbalance body secreting toxins cause symptoms appear viruses also infect host virulent dna affect normal cell processes transcription translation etc protein folding evading immune one first pathogens observed scientists vibrio cholerae described detail filippo pacini initial findings drawings bacteria published many papers concerning bacteria described causes diarrhea well developed effective treatments findings went unnoticed robert koch rediscovered organism linked disease giardia lamblia discovered leeuwenhoeck found pathogenic epasponsored symposium held following large outbreak oregon involving parasite since many organisms identified pathogens h pylori e coli allowed scientists develop antibiotics combat harmful microorganisms pathogens include bacteria fungi protozoa parasitic worms helminths viruses different types organisms classified pathogen based mode transmission includes following food borne airborne waterborne bloodborne vectorborne many pathogenic bacteria foodborne staphylococcus aureus clostridium botulinum secrete toxins host cause symptoms hiv hepatitis b viral infections caused bloodborne pathogens aspergillus common pathogenic fungi secretes aflatoxin acts carcinogen contaminates many foods especially grown underground nuts potatoes within host pathogens variety things cause disease trigger immune response microbes fungi cause symptoms due high rate reproduction tissue invasion causes immune response resulting common symptoms phagocytes break bacteria within host bacteria h pylori secrete toxins surrounding tissues resulting cell death inhibition normal tissue function viruses however use completely different mechanism cause disease upon entry host one two things many times viral pathogens enter lytic cycle virus inserts dna rna host cell replicates eventually causes cell lyse releasing viruses environment lysogenic cycle however viral dna incorporated host genome allowing go unnoticed immune system eventually gets reactivated enters lytic cycle giving indefinite shelf life depending pathogen interacts host involved one three interactions commensalism pathogen benefits host gains nothing interaction example bacteroides thetaiotaomicron resides human intestinal tract provides known mutualism occurs pathogen host benefit interaction seen human stomach many bacteria aid breaking nutrients host return bodies act parasitism occurs pathogen benefits relationship host harmed seen unicellular plasmodium falciparum parasite causes malaria although pathogens capability cause disease always described contextdependent pathogenicity scientists believe variability comes genetic environmental factors within host one example humans e coli normally bacteria flourishes part normal healthy microbiota intestines however relocates different region digestive tract body cause intense diarrhea e coli classified pathogen always act example also applied aureus common microbial flora humans currently antimicrobials primary treatment method pathogens drugs specifically designed kill microbes inhibit growth within host environment multiple terms used describe antimicrobial drugs antibiotics chemicals made microbes used pathogens penicillin erythromycin semisynthetics antimicrobials derived bacteria enhanced greater effect contrast synthetic strictly made lab combat pathogenicity three types antimicrobials classified two subsequent groups bactericidal bacteriostatic bactericidal substances kill microorganisms bacteriostatic substances inhibit microbial main problem pathogenic drug treatments modern world drug resistance many patients dont take full treatment drugs leading natural selection resistant bacteria one example methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa antibiotic overuse bacteria developed genetic mutations combat drug survive reduces drug effectiveness renders many treatments thanks network analysis interactions largescale analyses rna sequencing data infected host know pathogen proteins causing extensive rewiring host interactome higher impact pathogen fitness infection observations suggest hubs interactome explored promising targets antimicrobial drug currently many scientists aiming understand genetic variability contributes pathogen interaction variability within host also aiming limit transmission methods many pathogens prevent rapid spread hosts learn interaction amount variability within definition interaction needs redefined casadevall proposes pathogenicity determined based amount damage caused host classifying pathogens different categories based function however order cope changing pathogenic environment treatment methods need revised deal drugresistant microbes
