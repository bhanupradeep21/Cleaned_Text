libuttis research program develop novel cancer therapies better understanding tumor microenvironment interaction tumor vasculature critical tumor growth spread tumor cells distant organs process new vessel development within tumor termed angiogenesis required tumors grow larger millimeters order better understand relationship tumor blood supply research focused interaction tumorderived factors endothelial cells developing context tumor microenvironment understanding interaction hope able design novel treatment strategies inhibit growth spread tumors currently studying variety tumorderived factors effects tumorassociated vasculature include vascular endothelial growth factor vegf endothelial cell monocyteactivating polypeptide ii emapii emapii cytokine potent effects blood vessels discovered research team including libutti columbia university cytokines vegf emapii appear produced varying amounts tumors direct effects tumor neovasculature libuttis approach study interactions utilization variety vitro vivo model team using gene expression profiling understand changes occur endothelial cells exposed tumorderived laboratory developing techniques allow isolate endothelial cells tumor tissue resulted ability study tumorderived endothelial cells directly led observation tumor associated endothelial cells epigenetic changes compared normal endothelial cells tissue type approach also allowed identify specific genes formerly appear play role control endothelial cell responses angiogenesis inhibitors also using noninvasive imaging techniques including dynamic mri pet map changes tumor blood flow within tumors animal models patients clinical trials variety inhibitors tumor angiogenesis actively studied include recombinant proteins derived naturally occurring substances well small molecules designed act specific pathways various methods delivering agents including gene therapy approaches use tumor targeted nanoparticles pursued libutti first administer tnf
