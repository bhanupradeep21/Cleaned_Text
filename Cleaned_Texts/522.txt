ethylene signaling pathway signal transduction plant cells regulate important growth developmental acting plant hormone gas ethylene responsible promoting germination seeds ripening fruits opening flowers abscission shedding leaves stress simplest alkene gas first gaseous molecule discovered function understanding ethylene signal transduction come studies arabidopsis ethylene bind least five different membrane receptors although structurally diverse ethylene receptors exhibit similarity homology twocomponent regulatory system bacteria indicating common ancestry bacterial ethylene binds
