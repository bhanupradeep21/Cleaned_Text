duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd severe type muscular dystrophy primarily affects muscle weakness usually begins around age four worsens muscle loss typically occurs first thighs pelvis followed result trouble standing unable walk age affected muscles may look larger due increased fat scoliosis also may intellectual females single copy defective gene may show mild disorder xlinked two thirds cases
