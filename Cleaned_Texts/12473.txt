body produced gambling review report book consciousness creeping hard problem written towards end life gray summarised ideas brain function consciousness took view contents consciousness usually something described intentionality meaning suggested intentionality another aspect binding problem different modalities sight hearing bound together single conscious experience gray argued without binding eating banana could involve seeing yellow feeling surface tasting something without unifying awareness particular object known banana without unifying binding argued objects would meaningless shapes edges colours tastes gray thought intentionality based unconscious processing example argued processing visual cortex underlies conscious perception conscious instead perception springs consciousness fully formed including intentionality conscious perception arguing gray used example pictures either two things duck rabbit never hybrid always completely duck completely rabbit perception duck rabbit constructed unconsciously last moment grays conclusion part discussion intentionality arises physical chemical structure brain also intentionality constructed unconscious processing unlikely produce solution hard problem consciousness arises gray opposed idea brain contains representation external world considered external world described physics nothing like appears conscious perception also dismissed called fall back position think perception something cow example representation sense resembling cow really exists gray argued direct knowledge cow brain state direct knowledge cow really meaningless say cow brainstate representation real cow instead gray thought conscious perceptions treated signals signals need resemble thing communicate whistle might warn thieves approach policeman whistle nothing like policeman rather perceptual experiences signals observers might expect environments however gray stressed perceptual signals arise brain kind external existence say deduce useful information visual world perception thus example view visual perception good guide reflectance surfaces turn often survival value organism gray took view investigating consciousness discussions intentionality representation discarded research concentrated purely qualia subjective experience aspect brain involves consciousness gray viewed function consciousness late error detector argued brain comparator system predicts happen detects departures prediction suggested consciousness particularly concerned novelty error gray also viewed something causes us review past actions learn errors actions lateerror detection permits successful adaption similar situation emerges future respect gray gave example pain remove hands hot surface consciously feeling pain touching gray argued pain reversal action led survival advantage making repetition damaging action less likely gray accepted many unconscious systems detect errors establish survival value consciousness however distinguished consciousness multimodal directing us towards whatever novel within several modalities gray argued brain takes account plans next plus memories past regularities assessing likely next stage particular process predictions submitted comparator still unconscious stage unexpected outcomes feedback continuation motor action enters consciousness gray regarded consciousness medium display created unconscious processing argued conscious display used unconscious systems unconscious aversion food associated gastric illness conscious perception theory created unconscious systems used unconscious systems respond late errors unexpectedness novelty gray likened conscious perception sketch made particular scene retained use record reminder scene way sketch causal sense performs function recalling assisting memories directly active brain grays consciousness model conscious perception plays much role sketch analogy consciousness causal sense downstream unconscious systems respond mainly area error correction however conscious aspect brain agency free initiate inhibit actions sketch piece paper initiate actions independently gray disagreed functionalist theory consciousness described position functionalism saying consciousness nature certain complex systems regardless whether systems made neurons silicon chips material underlying tissues machinery irrelevant consciousness relates functions performed brain system arise result anything functional discriminated difference qualia must difference function functionalist theory every discriminated difference function difference qualia discussing question gray looked synaesthesia described modalities becoming mixed example sounds experienced colour experimentation recent years demonstrated synaesthesia likely abnormal projections auditory cortex colour region visual cortex brain scanning studies shown words spoken addition normal activity auditory cortex colour vision area visual cortex became active way occur people without synaesthesia related activation earlier stages visual pathway gray argued findings relationship occurrence synaesthetes colour experience linguistic function triggers evidence experience colour function refuting functionalist theory consciousness gray also discussed penrosehameroff orchor theory consciousness main objection question particular wave function collapses select one particular quale also questioned temporal aspect hameroffs model proposed milliseconds wave function collapse tenth time considered necessary conscious
