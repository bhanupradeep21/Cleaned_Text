wake therapy sometimes sleep deprivation therapy specific application intentional sleep deprivation encompasses many sleeprestricting paradigms aim address mood disorders form nonpharmacological wake therapy first popularized following articles schulte pflug t√∂lle describing striking symptom relief depressed individuals night total sleep deprivation wake therapy involve partial sleep deprivation usually consists restricting sleep hours total sleep deprivation individual stays consecutive hours total sleep deprivation individual typically stays hours spanning normal awakening time evening deprivation also involve shifting sleep schedule later earlier typical schedule eg going bed called sleep phase advancement older studies involved repetition sleep deprivation treatment depression either person showed response treatment person reached threshold possible number sleep deprivation treatments chronic sleep deprivation dangerous modern research studies longer common repeat sleep deprivation treatments close together recent closedloop paradigms developed selectively deprive individuals sleep slowwave sleep deprivation researchers monitor electrical activity individuals scalp electroencephalography eeg realtime use sensory stimulation eg playing noise burst pink noise disrupt stage sleep eg interfere slow waves nonrapid eye movement sleep goal paradigms investigate deprivation one type sleep stage sleep microarchitecture affects outcome measures rather deprivation sleep stages one drawback closed loop sleep deprivation paradigms must carefully calibrated individual researchers use auditory stimuli inhibit slow waves must calibrate volume stimulus loud enough evoke sensory response quiet enough wake patient sleep evidence depriving individuals slow wave sleep induce rapid antidepressant effect dosedependent manner meaning greater reduction slow wave activity relative baseline expected induce greater symptom response rate sleep deprivation generally agreed approximately metaanalysis sleep studies partial total sleep deprivation treatment depression found overall response rate immediate relief symptoms total sleep deprivation individuals response rate partial sleep deprivation separate review sleep deprivation found patients depression across separate studies showed response rate ranged reference nonresponse rate conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapy estimated symptom relief may delayed several weeks onset treatment compared immediate transient relief induced sleep metrics mood change vary highly across studies including surveys daily mood clinician administered interviews assess severity depression symptoms one benefit sleep deprivation provide relief symptoms within hours sleep deprivation rapid effect compared weeks may take conventional treatments one downside sleep deprivation therapy beneficial effects transient disappear even short periods even ultrashort periods sleep lasting seconds termed microsleeps shown cause relapse one metaanalysis unmedicated depressed patients undergone sleep deprivation found relapsed symptoms one night recovery patients initially respond sleep deprivation show sustained however sleep deprivation combined pharmacological treatments number patients show sustained remission much higher rates high half patients experiencing sustained compared relapse rate unmedicated patients patients simultaneously took antidepressants experienced relapse rate night recovery effect sleep deprivation mood dependent individuals psychiatric status healthy individuals history mood disorders undergo sleep deprivation often show change worsening mood sleep addition constant worsening mood also show increase tiredness agitation similarly individuals psychiatric disorders obsessive compulsive disorder suffer panic attacks show reliable improvements mood known contraindication sleep deprivation therapy individuals unipolar depression risk seizures studies shown stress associated night sleep deprivation precipitate unexpected medical conditions heart known side effects sleep deprivation include general fatigue individuals bipolar depression sleep deprivation sometimes cause switch manic studies show increase bdnf adaptative neuronal injury hours sleep loss per night becomes maladaptative apoptosis studies mices shows neuronal deaths occurring days rem sleep deprivation however mice models well effects humans sleeps third amount rem sleep humans used proxy neuron apoptosis kills times amount humans something also accounted nearly studies acute rem sleep deprivation induces lasting days neuronal apoptosis histological studies performed humans ethical reasons long term studies study shows sleep quality associated grey matter volume alternatives must preferably considered unlike many psychiatric conditions neuronal losses effects lifelong lasting treated currently although individual studies shown positive effect combined antidepressantsleep deprivation therapy currently widelyaccepted consensus whether combined treatment superior pharmacological intervention alone individuals unipolar meta analysis patients found sleep deprivation combined standard treatment reduce depressive symptoms compared standard treatment contrast unipolar depression wide body evidence sleep deprivation may useful treatment bipolar depression meta analysis articles found combining total sleep deprivation pharmacological intervention significantly increased antidepressant effects patient bipolar depression compared pharmacological intervention metric studies used assess success interventions depression symptom scale called montgomeryasberg depression hamilton depression rating used measure someones mood multiple studies shown adding mood stabilizing medication lithium amineptine pindolol total sleep deprivation induce significant decrease depression symptoms sustained least days considering longterm effects combined total sleep deprivationpharmacological intervention appears combination therapy also improve maintenance antidepressant effect individuals bipolar mood disorders results suggest adding total sleep deprivation bipolar depression pharmacological treatment may result augmented treatment total sleep deprivation may necessary achieve beneficial effect combined sleep deprivationantidepressant therapy partial sleep deprivation may sufficient compliance studies typically measured actigraphy order track movements time bed mechanism sleep deprivation enhances effect antidepressant pharmacological intervention still investigation one hypothesis sleep deprivation could enhance effects antidepressant drugs could shorten delay drugs effects take several months depending one hypothesis mechanism sleep deprivation induces rapid increase level neutrophic protein called brainderived neurotrophic factor bdnf mimics long term effects antidepressant drugnaive patients depression typically show lower levels bdnf age sexmatched increase bdnf patients depression take class drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors reported several studies increase similarly increase serum bdnf level also observed patients undergo single night total rem sleep deprivation however effect observed immediately rather long period increase hypothesized result compensatory mechanism brain produces bdnf preserve cognitive functions like working memory another hypothesis mechanism sleep deprivation may affect serotoninergic system including receptor called animals models sleep deprivation suggest sleep deprivation increases serotonin neurotransmission several ways including increasing extracellular serotonin increasing serotonin turnover reducing sensitivity serotonin inhibitory autoreceptors increasing behavioral responsiveness serotonin studies humans measure presleep deprivation levels serotonin single photon emission computer tomography provided evidence responders sleep deprivation may specific deficit serotoninergic one barrier understanding effects sleep deprivation lack consistent metric response although standard mood surveys clinicianrated scales different investigators use different criterion evidence response treatment example investigators required decrease hamilton rating scale others required barriers include fact researchers blind patient condition rate patients mood many previous studies included control groups rather published findings patient groups without control reference skeptics sleep deprivation therapy argue sleep deprivation rather prolonged contact humans unusual circumstances sleep deprivation lead improvements mood another major barrier depression highly heterogenous disorder spanning unipolar bipolar mood fluctuations currently thought dependent circadian processes typical healthy individual without mood disorder shows circadianlocked fluctuations mood positive mood beginning right morning awakening decaying day goes prolonged wakefulness typical individual depression show opposite mood fluctuation cycle low mood right morning awakening gradually becomes positive prolonged wakefulness circadianlocked changes across day referred diurnal variations mood evidence across many sleep deprivation studies suggests individuals diurnal mood fluctuations used predict whether respond sleep deprivation individuals depression show typical low morning mood increases throughout day likely respond positively sleep deprivation individuals show mood fluctuations deviate typical one caveat findings single individual may show diurnal fluctuations vary daytoday showing typical diurnal changes one day showing changes constant mood next complexity addressed studies followed single individuals administered repeated sleep deprivation days individual showed different mood fluctuations studies showed individuals ability show typical mood fluctuations better predictor whether would respond sleep deprivation treatment individuals mood state particular day underwent sleep responsiveness sleep deprivation also currently believed dependent observable pattern persons regular sleep cycle quickly person enters sleep cycle called rapid eye movement rem individuals depression typically show abnormally short rem sleep onsets meaning enter rem sleep stage earlier course night matched healthy controls individuals depression shortlatency rem sleep typically respond sleep deprivation therapy often individuals depression show typical short latency rem sleep
