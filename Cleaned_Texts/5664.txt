chronic pulmonary aspergillosis longterm fungal infection caused members genus commonly aspergillus term describes several disease presentations considerable overlap ranging clump aspergillus mold subacute invasive form known chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis affects people whose immune system weakened many people affected chronic pulmonary aspergillosis underlying lung disease commonly tuberculosis allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis asthma lung chronic pulmonary aspergillosis term encompasses number different presentations varying severity considerable overlap disease forms adds confusion diagnosis primary differentiation comes radiological findings aspergilloma fungus ball composed aspergillus hypha long filamentous strands extend fungus enable growth arise within bodily cavity though chronic pulmonary aspergillosis form within pulmonary cavities colonized aspergillus spp single stable cavity provides minimal symptoms term simple aspergilloma commonly used distinguish severe forms chronic pulmonary aspergillus form single multiple nodules may may form whilst usually benign nature sometimes cause symptoms cough exacerbation existing disease
