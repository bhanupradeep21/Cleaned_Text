frostbite skin injury occurs exposed extremely low temperatures causing freezing skin commonly affecting fingers toes nose ears cheeks chin often frostbite occurs hands initial symptoms typically feeling cold tingling may followed clumsiness white bluish color swelling blistering may occur following complications may include hypothermia compartment people exposed low temperatures prolonged periods winter sports enthusiasts military personnel homeless individuals greatest risk factors include drinking alcohol smoking mental health problems certain medications prior injuries due underlying mechanism involves injury ice crystals blood clots small blood vessels following diagnosis based severity may divided superficial degree deep bone scan mri may help determining extent prevention consists wearing proper fullycovering clothing avoiding low temperatures wind maintaining hydration nutrition sufficient physical activity maintain core temperature without treatment rewarming immersion warm water near body temperature body contact done consistent temperature maintained refreezing rapid heating cooling avoided since could potentially cause burning heart rubbing applying force affected areas avoided may cause damage use ibuprofen tetanus toxoid recommended pain relief reduce swelling severe injuries iloprost thrombolytics may surgery sometimes amputation

avoiding constrictive footwear clothing remaining active without causing exhaustion supplemental oxygen might also use high elevations repeated exposure cold water makes people susceptible additional
