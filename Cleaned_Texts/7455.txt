embryo initial stage development multicellular organism organisms reproduce sexually embryonic development part life cycle begins fertilization female egg cell male sperm cell resulting fusion two cells produces singlecelled zygote undergoes many cell divisions produce cells known blastomeres blastomeres arranged solid ball reaching certain size called morula takes fluid create cavity called blastocoel structure termed blastula blastocyst mammals mammalian blastocyst hatches implantating endometrial lining womb implanted embryo continue development next stages gastrulation neurulation organogenesis gastrulation formation three germ layers form different parts body neurulation forms nervous system organogenesis development various tissues organs body newly developing human typically referred embryo ninth week conception referred fetus multicellular organisms word embryo used broadly early developmental life cycle stage prior birth hatching first attested english word embryon derives medieval latin embryo greek ἔμβρυον embruon lit young neuter ἔμβρυος embruos lit growing ἐν en βρύω bruō swell proper latinized form greek term would embryum animals fertilization begins process embryonic development creation zygote single cell resulting fusion gametes eg egg development zygote multicellular embryo proceeds series recognizable stages often divided cleavage blastula gastrulation cleavage period rapid mitotic cell divisions occur fertilization cleavage overall size embryo change size individual cells decrease rapidly divide increase total number cleavage results depending species blastula blastocyst stage embryo appear ball cells top yolk hollow sphere cells surrounding middle embryos cells continue divide increase number molecules within cells rnas proteins actively promote key developmental processes gene expression cell fate specification implanting uterine wall embryo sometimes known preimplantation embryo preimplantation sometimes called preembryo term employed differentiate embryo proper relation embryonic stem cell gastrulation next phase embryonic development involves development two layers cells germinal layers animals form two layers cnidaria called diploblastic form three animals flatworms humans called triploblastic gastrulation triploblastic animals three germinal layers form called ectoderm mesoderm tissues organs mature animal trace origin back one example ectoderm give rise skin epidermis nervous mesoderm give rise vascular system muscles bone connective endoderm give rise organs digestive system epithelium digestive system respiratory many visible changes embryonic structure happen throughout gastrulation cells make different germ layers migrate cause previously round embryo fold invaginate cuplike past gastrulation embryo continues develop mature multicellular organism forming structures necessary life outside womb egg name suggests organogenesis stage embryonic development organs form organogenesis molecular cellular interactions prompt certain populations cells different germ layers differentiate organspecific cell example neurogenesis subpopulation cells ectoderm segregate cells specialize become brain spinal cord peripheral embryonic period varies species species human development term fetus used instead embryo ninth week whereas zebrafish embryonic development considered finished bone called cleithrum becomes animals hatch egg birds young animal typically longer referred embryo hatched viviparous animals animals whose offspring spend least time developing within parents body offspring typically referred embryo inside parent longer considered embryo birth exit parent however extent development growth accomplished inside egg parent varies significantly species species much processes take place hatching birth one species may take place well events another therefore according one textbook common scientists interpret scope embryology broadly study development flowering plants angiosperms create embryos fertilization haploid ovule pollen dna ovule pollen combine form diploid singlecell zygote develop zygote divide multiple times progresses throughout embryonic development one part seed seed components include endosperm tissue rich nutrients help support growing plant embryo seed coat protective outer covering first cell division zygote asymmetric resulting embryo one small cell apical cell one large cell basal small apical cell eventually give rise structures mature plant stem leaves larger basal cell give rise suspensor connects embryo endosperm nutrients pass plant embryo cells continue divide progress developmental stages named general appearance globular heart torpedo globular stage three basic tissue types dermal ground vascular dermal tissue give rise epidermis outer covering ground tissue give rise inner plant material functions photosynthesis resource storage physical vascular tissue give rise connective tissue like xylem phloem transport fluid nutrients minerals throughout heart stage one two cotyledons embryonic leaves form meristems centers stem cell activity develop torpedo stage eventually produce many mature tissues adult plant throughout end embryonic growth seed usually go dormant embryo begins germinate grow seed forms first true leaf called seedling plants produce spores instead seeds like bryophytes ferns also produce embryos plants embryo begins existence attached inside archegonium parental gametophyte egg cell inner wall archegonium lies close contact foot developing embryo foot consists bulbous mass cells base embryo may receive nutrition parent structure development rest embryo varies group since land plants create embryos collectively referred embryophytes scientific name embryophyta along
