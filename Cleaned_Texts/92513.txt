blood alcohol content bac also called blood alcohol concentration blood alcohol level measurement alcohol intoxication used legal medical expressed mass alcohol per volume blood example bac one tenth one percent means g alcohol every ml bac sober different countries maximum permitted bac driving ranges limit detection bac levels considered impaired potentially bac increases shortterm effects
