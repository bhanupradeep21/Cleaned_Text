allee effect phenomenon biology characterized correlation population size density mean individual fitness often measured per capita population growth rate population although concept allee effect title time first described namesake warder clyde allee experimental studies allee able demonstrate goldfish greater survival rate individuals within led conclude aggregation improve survival rate individuals cooperation may crucial overall evolution social structure term allee principle introduced time field ecology heavily focused role competition among within classical view population dynamics stated due competition resources population experience reduced overall growth rate higher density increased growth rate lower density words individuals population would better fewer individuals around due limited amount resources see logistic growth however concept allee effect introduced idea reverse holds true population density low individuals within species often require assistance another individual simple reproductive reasons order persist obvious example observed animals hunt prey defend predators group generally accepted definition allee effect positive density

necessarily result demographic allee effect example cooperative hunting ability easily find mates influenced population density component allee effects influence individual fitness population low population density component allee effects would add produce overall demographic allee effect increased fitness higher population density population density reaches high number negative density dependence often offsets component allee effects resource competition thus erasing demographic allee allee effects might occur even high population density strong allee effect demographic allee effect critical population size density weak allee effect demographic allee effect without critical population size density distinction two terms based whether population question exhibits critical population size density population exhibiting weak allee effect possess reduced per capita growth rate directly related individual fitness population lower population density size however even low population size density population always exhibit positive per capita growth rate meanwhile population exhibiting strong allee effect critical population size density population growth rate becomes negative therefore population density size hits number threshold population destined extinction without aid strong allee effect often easier demonstrate empirically using time series data one pinpoint population size density per capita growth rate becomes due definition positive correlation population density average fitness mechanisms allee effect arises therefore inherently tied survival reproduction general allee effect mechanisms arise cooperation facilitation among individuals species examples cooperative behaviors include better mate finding environmental conditioning group defense predators mechanisms moreeasily observable field tend commonly associated allee effect concept nevertheless mechanisms allee effect less conspicuous inbreeding depression sex ratio bias considered well although numerous ecological mechanisms allee effects exist list commonly cited facilitative behaviors contribute allee effects literature include mate limitation cooperative defense cooperative feeding environmental behaviors classified separate categories overlap tend context dependent operate certain conditions example cooperative defense useful predators competitors present classic economic theory predicts human exploitation population unlikely result species extinction escalating costs find last individuals exceed fixed price one achieves selling individuals market however rare species desirable common species prices rare species exceed high harvest costs phenomenon create anthropogenic allee effect rare species go extinct common species sustainably anthropogenic allee effect become standard approach conceptualizing threat economic markets endangered however original theory posited using one dimensional analysis two dimensional turns two dimensional analysis yields allee curve human exploiter biological population space curve separating species destined extinction vs persistence complicated even high population sizes potentially pass originally proposed allee thresholds predestined paths declines population size result loss genetic diversity owing genetic variations role evolutionary potential species could turn result observable allee effect species population becomes smaller gene pool reduced size well one possible outcome genetic bottleneck reduction fitness species process genetic drift well inbreeding overall fitness

stochastic event deleterious alleles become fixed genetic drift evolutionary theory states expressed deleterious alleles purged natural selection purging would efficient eliminating alleles highly detrimental harmful mildly deleterious alleles act later life would less likely removed natural selection conversely newly acquired beneficial mutations likely lost random chance smaller genetic pools larger although longterm population persistence several species low genetic variation recently prompted debate generality inbreeding depression various empirical evidences genetic allee one case

prevalence defects previously associated inbreeding depression although timescale inbreeding depression larger immediate allee effects significant implications longterm persistence species demographic stochasticity refers variability population growth arising sampling random births deaths population finite small populations demographic stochasticity decrease population growth rate causing effect similar allee increase risk population extinction whether demographic stochasticity considered part allee effect somewhat contentious however current definition allee effect considers correlation population density mean individual fitness therefore random variation resulting birth death events would considered part allee effect increased risk extinction consequence changing fates individuals within meanwhile demographic stochasticity results fluctuations sex ratios arguably reduces mean individual fitness population declines example fluctuation small population causes scarcity one sex would turn limit access mates opposite sex decreasing fitness individuals within population type allee effect likely prevalent monogamous species polygynous demographic mathematical studies demonstrate existence allee effect reduce speed range expansion even prevent biological recent results based spatiotemporal models show allee effect also promote genetic diversity expanding results counteract commonly held notions allee effect possesses net adverse consequences reducing growth rate individuals ahead colonization front simultaneously reduces speed colonization enables diversity genes coming core population remain front allee effect also affects spatial distribution diversity whereas spatiotemporal models include allee effect lead vertical pattern genetic diversity ie strongly structured spatial distribution genetic fractions including allee effect lead horizontal pattern genetic diversity ie absence genetic differentiation simple mathematical example allee effect given cubic growth model population negative growth rate n displaystyle positive growth rate n k displaystyle ank assuming k displaystyle departure logistic growth equation dividing sides equation population size n logistic growth left hand side equation represents per capita population growth rate dependent population size n decreases increasing n throughout entire range population sizes contrast allee effect percapita growth rate increases increasing n range population sizes spatiotemporal models take allee effect account well simple example given reactiondiffusion model population made small subpopulations additional factors allee effect arise subpopulations subject different environmental variations ie separated enough disaster could occur one subpopulation site without affecting subpopulations still allow individuals travel subpopulations individual subpopulations likely go extinct total population case catastrophic event decreasing numbers subpopulation individuals another subpopulation site may able repopulate area subpopulations subject environmental variations ie disaster affected one would affect fragmentation population detrimental population increases extinction risk total population case species receives none benefits small subpopulation loss subpopulation catastrophic species whole disadvantages inbreeding depression loss genetic diversity increased vulnerability environmental instability population would survive better clumping results due individuals aggregating response local habitat landscape differences daily seasonal weather
