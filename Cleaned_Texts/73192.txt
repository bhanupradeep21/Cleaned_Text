incisivosaurus incisor lizard genus small probably herbivorous theropod dinosaurs early cretaceous period peoples republic china first specimen described xu et al ivpp skull collected lowermost levels fluvial lujiatun beds yixian formation dating barremian stage million years sihetun area near beipiao city western liaoning province significant highly unusual characteristic dinosaur apparent adaptation herbivorous omnivorous lifestyle named prominent rodentlike front teeth show wear patterns commonly found planteating dinosaurs specific name gauthieri honors dr jacques gauthier pioneer phylogenetic method initial description incisivosaurus xu et al showed skull measures approximately cm length preserves complete dentition known oviraptorosaurian cladistic analysis indicated incisivosaurus lies base oviraptorosaurian group making primitive caudipteryx oviraptorids subsequent study osmolska et al described distinguishing skeletal features incisivosaurus including long snout made half total length skull slender lower jaw long fenestra opening distinctive large flattened front teeth addition unique features incisivosaurus shared many traits typical oviraptorosaurs allowing classification group several features including numerous teeth advanced oviraptorids toothless show primitive member group several features skull even support relationship therizinosaurs another theropod group probably holotype skull scanned analyzed three dimensions results indicated incisivosaurus less bird like air spaces skull bones later oviraptorosaurs also found incisivosaurus reduced olfactory lobes expanded optic lobes similar ornithomimosaurs suggested birdlike features oviraptorosaurs may convergent incisivosaurus assumed feathered like maniraptoran theropods total body
