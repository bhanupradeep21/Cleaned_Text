upper motor neuron syndrome umns motor control changes occur skeletal muscle upper motor neuron lesion following upper motor neuron lesions affected muscles potentially many features altered performance including signs collectively termed upper motor neuron syndrome affected muscles typically show multiple signs severity depending degree damage factors influence motor control neuroanatomical circles often joked example hemisection cervical spinal cord leads upper lower motor neuron syndrome lower upper motor neuron syndrome saying refers lower motor neuron symptoms upper extremity arm upper motor neurons symptoms lower extremity leg health professionals understanding impairments muscles upper motor neuron lesion progressed considerably recent decades however diagnosis spasticity still often used interchangeably upper motor neuron syndrome unusual see patients labeled spastic demonstrate array umn spasticity exaggerated stretch reflex means muscle reflex contraction stretched contraction stronger stretch applied quickly commonly quoted definition lance describes motor disorder characterised velocitydependent increase tonic stretch reflexes exaggerated tendon jerks resulting hyperexcitability stretch reflex one component upper motor neurone umn syndrome spasticity common feature muscle performance upper motor neuron lesions generally much less clinical significance features decreased strength decreased control decreased endurance confusion use terminology complicates assessment treatment planning health professionals many confuse findings upper motor neuron syndrome describe confusion potentially leaves health professionals attempting inhibit exaggerated stretch reflex improve muscle performance potentially leaving significant umns changes weakness unaddressed improved understanding multiple features upper motor neuron syndrome supports rigorous assessment improved treatment planning upper motor neuron syndrome signs seen conditions motor areas brain andor spinal cord damaged fail develop normally include spinal cord injury cerebral palsy multiple sclerosis acquired brain injury including stroke impact impairment muscles individual problems movement posture often affects function assessment motor control may involve several health professionals depending affected individuals situation severity condition may include physical therapists physicians including neurologists physiatrists rehabilitation physicians orthotists occupational therapists speechlanguage pathologists assessment needed affected individuals goals function symptoms may related movement disorder pain thorough assessment uses clinical reasoning approach determine difficulties occurring elements assessment include analysis posture active movement muscle strength movement control coordination endurance well muscle tone spasticity impaired muscles typically demonstrate loss selective movement including loss eccentric control decreased ability actively lengthen decreased active lengthening muscle key factor limits motor control multiple muscles limb usually affected upper motor neuron syndrome usually imbalance muscle activity muscle tone stronger pull one side joint elbow flexion decreasing degree imbalance common focus muscle strengthening programs impaired motor control also typically features loss stabilisation affected limb head trunk thorough assessment requires analysed well exercise improve proximal stability may indicated secondary effects likely impact assessment impaired muscles muscle tone assessed passive muscle lengthening increased muscle stiffness may affect feeling resistance passive stretch addition neurological resistance stretch secondary changes loss muscle fibres following acquired muscle weakness likely compound weakness arising upper motor neuron lesion severely affected muscles may marked secondary changes muscle contracture particularly management delayed absent treatment based assessment relevant health professionals muscles mildtomoderate impairment exercise mainstay management likely need prescribed physical therapist health professional skilled neurological rehabilitation muscles severe impairment likely limited ability exercise may require help may require additional interventions manage greater neurological impairment also greater secondary complications interventions may include serial casting flexibility exercise sustained positioning programs medical interventions research clearly shown exercise beneficial impaired even though previously believed strength exercise would increase muscle tone impair muscle performance also previous decades strong focus interventions impaired muscles particularly stretching splinting evidence support one challenges health professionals working umns movement disorders degree muscle weakness makes developing exercise programme difficult muscles lack volitional control complete spinal cord injury exercise may assisted may require equipment using standing frame sustain standing position often muscles require specific stimulation achieve small amounts activity often achieved weightbearing eg positioning supporting limb supports body weight stimulation muscle belly electrical stimulation vibration medical interventions may include medications baclofen diazepam dantrolene clonazepam phenol injections botulinum injections muscle belly upper lower extremities used attempt dampen signals nerve muscle effectiveness medications varies individuals varies based location upper motor neuron lesion brain spinal cord
