levels increases number receptors cell surface increase increase number receptors surface neuron increase effectiveness serotonin communication across synapse hand levels decrease fewer receptors migrate inside neuron cell membrane synaptic cleft thus lowering efficiency serotonin signaling occur across synapse findings suggest although serotonin levels immediately introduced via medication
