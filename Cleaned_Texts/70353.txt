despite unusual anatomy azhdarchids assumed occupied ecological niche witton naish noted evidence mode feeding lacked support azhdarchid anatomy functional morphology lacked cranial features sideways compressed lower jaws shockabsorbing adaptations required jaws instead appear almost triangular crosssection unlike skimfeeders witton naish instead stated azhdarchids probably inhabited inland environments based taphonomic contexts fossils found half fossils surveyed example fluvial alluvial deposits marine occurrences also fossils terrestrial lifeforms morphology made illsuited lifestyles wading foraging terrestrially though feet relatively small slender pads suited wading either researchers instead argued azhdarchids similar storks ground hornbills generalists termed terrestrial stalkers foraged different kinds environments small animals carrion supported apparent proficiency ground relatively inflexible necks example wellpreserved neck phosphatodraco providing information

phosphatodraco labita martill noted azhdarchids might less terrestrial suggested witton naish since moroccan fossils marine strata arambourgiania phosphates jordan noted azhdarchids found truly terrestrial strata proposed could instead associated aquatic environments rivers lakes marine offshore pterosaurs generally thought gone gradually extinct decreasing diversity towards end cretaceous longrich colleagues suggested impression could result poor fossil records pterosaurs signorlipps effect since found multiple lineages pteranodontidae nyctosauridae azhdarchidae latter including phosphatodraco others coexisted late maastrichtian morocco diverse pterosaur assemblage known late cretaceous pterosaurs time thereby increased nichepartitioning compared earlier faunas santonian campanian ages able outcompete birds large size based niches birds therefore remained small exceeding ft wingspans late cretaceous pterosaurs time larger wingspans thereby avoided smallsize niche researchers indicated extinction pterosaurs abrupt instead gradual caused catastrophic chicxulub impact extinction freed niches filled birds led evolutionary radiation early witton summarized ideas azhdarchid flight abilities noted generally considered adapted soaring although found possible musculature allowed flapping flight like swans geese short potentially broad wings may suited flying terrestrial environments similar large terrestrially soaring birds albatrosslike soaring also suggested witton thought unlikely due supposed terrestrial bias fossils adaptations foraging ground
