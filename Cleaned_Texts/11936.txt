paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia psvt type supraventricular tachycardia named intermittent episodes abrupt onset often people otherwise symptoms may include palpitations feeling lightheaded sweating shortness breath chest cause risk factors include alcohol psychostimulants caffeine nicotine amphetamines psychological stress wolffparkinsonwhite syndrome often underlying mechanism typically involves accessory pathway results diagnosis typically electrocardiogram ecg shows narrow qrs complexes fast heart rhythm typically beats per vagal maneuvers valsalva maneuver often used initial effective person normal blood pressure medication adenosine may adenosine effective calcium channel blocker beta blocker may otherwise synchronized cardioversion future episodes prevented catheter per people paroxysmal supraventricular problems typically begin years women often affected outcomes generally good otherwise normal ultrasound heart may done rule underlying heart symptoms may include palpitations feeling faint sweating shortness breath chest episodes start end paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia type arrhythmia originates atrioventricular av junction common underlying anatomical cause psvt atrioventricular nodal reentry accounts half underlying anatomical causes psvt specifically atrioventricular nodal reentry involve presence two functionally distinct conduction pathways within av node formation reentrant circuit sustains pathways within av node known fast pathway slow av node structure controls electrical signals travel upper chambers atria lower chambers ventricles normal sinus rhythm signals pass one pathway known fast pathway fast pathway conducts signals quickly longer rest period send another signal however people psvt caused atrioventricular nodal reentry fast slow pathways activated slow pathway conducts signals slowly shorter rest period psvt episodes irregular heartbeat triggered early electrical signal one atria premature signal enters pathways simultaneously encounters problem traveling along slow pathway conduction speed matches well specific arrhythmia type however faces difficulty passing effectively faster path since takes slightly longer path ready following conduction recent signal point retrograde backward flow overcomes forward movements pace fast pathway unwanted feedback intensifies rapid heartbeat something intervenes stop episode currently solid understanding stops episode treatment depends type heart rhythm shown electrocardiogram test stability patients blood circulation patient low blood pressure difficulty breathing chest pain shock confusion considered unstable must electrocardiogram result checked determine heart beating normally case cardioversion uses electricity reset heartbeat performed urgently electrocardiogram shows high heart rate caused something psvt reduction blood flow heart injections drugs called betablockers may help medication also used someone found unstable due inappropriate sinus tachycardia fast unexplained normal av nodal blocking achieved least three ways number physical maneuvers increase resistance av node transmit impulses av nodal block principally activation parasympathetic nervous system conducted heart vagus nerve manipulations collectively referred vagal maneuverscitation needed valsalva maneuver first vagal maneuver works increasing intrathoracic pressure affecting baroreceptors pressure sensors within arch aorta carried asking patient hold hisher breath trying exhale forcibly straining bowel movement holding nose exhaling obstruction similar pressing gently top closed eyes may also bring heartbeat back normal rhythm people atrial supraventricular tachycardia known oculocardiac review confirms success valsalva maneuver nonpharmaceutical intervention adenosine ultrashortacting av nodal blocking agent indicated vagal maneuvers unsuccessful psvt recurs calcium channel blockers diltiazem verapamil adenosine may safely used adenosine administered together nondihydropyridine calcium channel calcium channel blockers verapamil diltiazem longer halflife compared adenosine although blockers safe administered slowly adenosine considered safer particularly useful cases electrocardiogram provide clear information calcium channel blockers verapamil similar effectiveness however despite safer overall adenosine associated higher costs increased likelihood arrhythmia recurrence compared calcium channel svt involve av node may respond antiarrhythmic drugs sotalol amiodaronecitation needed person hemodynamically unstable treatments effective synchronized electrical cardioversion may used children often done dose radiofrequency catheter ablation rfca safe effective treatment adults rfca considered minimally invasive procedure rather surgery involve making large incisions opening chest cavity instead performed using thin catheters inserted blood vessels guided heart catheter delivers radiofrequency energy specific areas heart disrupt abnormal electrical pathways causing arrhythmias may require mild sedation local anesthesia doesnt typically involve extensive cutting suturing tissue associated traditional surgical decade significant advancements catheter ablation techniques ventricular arrhythmias including improved mapping methods like ultrahigh density mapping innovative energy sources like electroporation new types catheters lattice salineenhanced radiofrequency catheters provide precise longerlasting tissue damage additionally cardiac imaging technologies like mri
