deceived thinking experiencing actually normal perception similar close mimicking normal perception reported subjects lucid outofbody therefore pose similar problems theory direct realism apparitional experiences appear prima facie compatible philosophical theory representationalism according theory immediate objects experience perceiving world normally representations world rather world representations variously called sensedata images case apparitional experience one might say subject aware sensedata images happen correspond represent external world normal way philosophical implications hallucinatory experiences sane discussed argues provide empirical support theory representationalism rather direct realism httpsenwikipediaorgwikiapparitionalexperience
