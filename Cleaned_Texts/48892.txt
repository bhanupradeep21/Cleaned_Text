reassortment mixing genetic material species new combinations different individuals several different processes contribute reassortment including assortment chromosomes chromosomal particularly used two similar viruses infecting cell exchange genetic material particular reassortment occurs among influenza viruses whose genomes consist eight distinct segments rna segments act like minichromosomes time flu virus assembled requires one copy segment single host human chicken animal infected two different strains influenza virus possible new assembled viral particles created segments whose origin mixed coming one strain coming another new reassortant strain share properties parental lineages reassortment responsible major genetic shifts history influenza virus asian flu hong kong flu pandemics flu strains caused reassortment avian virus human addition virus responsible swine flu pandemic unusual mix swine avian human influenza genetic reptarenavirus family responsible inclusion body disease snakes shows high degree genetic diversity due reassortment genetic material multiple strains infected animal influenza viruses inactivated uv irradiation ionizing radiation remain capable multiplicity reactivation infected host viruss genome segments damaged way prevent replication expression essential gene virus inviable alone infects host cell single infection however two damaged viruses infect cell multiple infection infection often succeed multiplicity reactivation due reassortment segments provided eight genome segments present least one undamaged httpsenwikipediaorgwikireassortment
