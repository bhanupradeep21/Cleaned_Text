descriptionexperience gap phenomenon experimental behavioral studies decision making gap refers observed differences peoples behavior depending whether decisions made towards clearly outlined described outcomes probabilities whether simply experience alternatives without prior knowledge consequences described experienced choice tasks experimental task usually involves selecting one two possible choices lead certain outcome could gain loss probabilities outcomes vary two choices one probabilistically safer choice offers comparably improbable outcome specific payoffs outcomes choices terms magnitude potential gains losses varies study descriptionbased alternatives prospects much information regarding choice clearly participant shown potential outcomes choices well probabilities outcomes within choice typically feedback given choice selected participant shown consequences selections led prospect theory guides much currently known regarding described choices according prospect theory decision weight described prospects considered differently depending whether prospects high low probability nature specifically peoples decisions differ depending whether described prospects framed gains losses whether outcomes sure probable prospects termed gains two possible choices offer chance receive certain reward losses two possible choices result reduction certain resource outcome said sure probability absolutely certain close probable outcome one comparably unlikely sure outcome described prospects people tend assign higher value sure probable outcomes choices involve gains known certainty effect choices involve losses people tend assign higher value improbable outcome called reflection effect leads opposite result certainty previous studies focusing descriptionbased prospects suffered one drawback lack external validity natural environment peoples decisions must made without clear description probabilities instead decisions must made drawing upon past experiences experiencebased studies outcomes probabilities two possible choices initially presented instead participants must sample choices learn outcomes feedback making choices participants estimate probabilities outcomes based experiencing outcomes contrary results obtained prospect theory people tended underweight probabilities rare outcomes made decisions general tended choose probable outcome much often rare outcomes behaved rare outcomes unlikely really effect observed studies involving repeated small samples however people tended choose riskier choice deciding experience tasks framed terms gains contrast decisions made demonstrated decisions appear made differently depending whether choices made experience description descriptionexperience gap demonstrated decision making studies example reverse reflection effect aptly demonstrates nature gap recall descriptionbased prospects lead reflection effect people risk averse gains risk seeking however experiencebased prospects results reversal reflection effect people become risk seeking gains risk averse losses specifically level risktaking behavior towards gains participants experience task virtually identical level risktaking towards losses participants description task effect observed gains versus losses experience description tasks explanations factors contribute gap discussed one factor may contribute gap nature sampling task sampling paradigm people allowed respond number presumably form estimations probabilities outcomes sampling however studies rely people making decisions small sample prospects due small samples people may even experience low probability event might influence peoples underweighting rare events however descriptionbased studies involve making exact probabilities known participant since participants immediately made aware rareness event unlikely undersample rare events results experiencebased studies may result recency recency effect shows greater weight value assigned recent given rare events uncommon common events likely take recency therefore weighted rare events recency effect may responsible underweighting rare events decisions made given descriptionbased studies usually involving responding limited number trials one recency effects likely much influence decision making studies may even entirely irrelevant another variable may driving results experiencebased decisions paradigm basic tendency avoid delayed outcomes alternatives positive rare events average advantageous long term alternatives negative rare events average disadvantageous long term hence focusing short term outcomes produces underweighting rare events consistent notion found increasing short term temptation eg showing outcomes options foregone payoffs increases underweighting rare events decisions experience since experiencebased studies include multiple trials participants must learn outcomes available choices participants must base decisions previous outcomes must therefore rely memory learning outcomes probabilities biases salient memories may reason greater risk seeking gains choices experiencebased assumption improbable greater reward may produce salient memory reiterate prospect theory offers sound explanations people behave towards descriptionbased prospects however results experiencebased prospects tend show opposite forms responding described prospects people tend overweight extreme outcomes expect probabilities likely really whereas experienced prospects people tend underweight probability extreme outcomes therefore judge even less likely occur highly relevant example descriptionexperience gap illustrated difference opinions vaccination doctors patients learn vaccination usually exposed information regarding probabilities side effects vaccines likely overweight likelihood side effects although doctors learn probabilities descriptions side effects perspective also shaped experience doctors direct experience vaccinating patients likely recognize unlikelihood side effects due different ways doctors patients learn side effects potential disagreement necessity safety typically natural settings however peoples awareness probabilities certain outcomes prior experience separated make decisions involve risk gambling settings instance players participate game level understanding probabilities possible outcomes specifically outcomes lead example players know six sides die side one six chance rolled however players decisions game must also influenced past experiences playing game httpsenwikipediaorgwikidescriptionexperiencegap
