aenigmastropheus extinct genus early archosauromorph reptiles known middle late permian usili formation songea district southern tanzania contains single species aenigmastropheus parringtoni known solely umzc partial postcranial skeleton mature individual collected first described problematic reptile due unique morphology therefore binomial name erected specimen aenigmastropheus probably fully fossils aenigmastropheus first described british paleontologist dr francis rex parrington article titled problematic reptile upper permian parrington reported collecting remains ruhuhu valley songea district southern tanzania considered come single individual specimen umzc currently housed university museum zoology cambridge uk umzc consists partial postcranial skeleton including five posterior cervical anterior dorsal vertebrae distal half right humerus fragment probable left humeral shaft proximal end right ulna three indeterminate fragments bone one may represent partial article parrington highlighted apparent contrast primitive appearance forelimb bones derived appearance vertebrae resembling archosaurs thus concluded specimen bear close resemblances known synapsid including ones collected locality suggested possible close affinities archosaurs due vertebral morphology presence hollow limb bones ectepicondylar groove humerus hughes subsequently noted similar vertebral morphology pelycosaurian synapsids concluded combination derived vertebral column primitive limb structure occurs proterosuchian archosauromorphs umzc might possibly proterosuchian ancestor subsequent studies came similar conclusion listing specimen possible member proterosuchidae however gower sennikov noted still could possibly archosaurian ezcurra butler gower indicated umzc archosauromorph

rocks cistecephalus assemblage zone south african karoo basin implies usili formation considered lateral equivalent assemblage zone therefore usili formation spans wuchiapingian stage middle late permian approximately million years aenigmastropheus known solely holotype partial postcranial skeleton bones mostly well preserved possess damaged surfaces possibly result preparation acetic acid cortical bone collapsed broken away degree postmortem distortion evident areas bones notably vertebrae ezcurra et al agreed parrington bones catalogued umzc belong individual supported congruent morphology similar size five preserved vertebrae well right humerus ulna ratio certain measurements axial appendicular elements also supports aenigmastropheus mediumsized archosauromorph saurian unique combination traits complicates assessment relationships resulting parrington referring problematic reptile enable differentiating known amniotes posterior cervical anterior dorsal vertebrae notochordal unlike basal archosauromorphs welldeveloped anterior posterior centrodiapophyseal prezygodiapophyseal laminae zygapophyses positioned close medially unlike nonarchosauromorph reptiles side view vertebrae low neural arches nearly triangular neural spines unlike enigmatic neodiapsid helveticosaurus zollingeri humerus aenigmastropheus thick posteroventral diagonal ridge anterior surface shaft autapomorphy unique taxon among basal diapsids humerus also lacks entepicondylar unlike nonarchosauromorph reptiles ectepicondylar foramina shows strongly developed capitellum trochlea unlike helveticosaurus finally olecranon process strongly developed forming single ossification rest ulna unlike stem archosaurs ezcurra et al performed bone histology remains aenigmastropheus order better understand paleobiology early archosauromorphs evident short period fibrolamellar bone formation aenigmastropheus exhibited high growth rates early development however growing slowly life indicated steady decrease vascularization well increase spatial organization bone matrix formation lamellarzonal bone ezcurra et al noted rapid growth early development observed aenigmastropheus resembles prolacerta broomi basal archosauriforms proterosuchus fergusi erythrosuchus africanus chanaresuchus bonapartei extant lepidosauromorphs basal archosauromorphs trilophosaurus buettneri rhynchosaurs exhibit slow overall growth pattern suggests even among basal members archosauromorpha diverse growth strategies already umzc likely juvenile individual closed neurocentral sutures possibly also fullygrown least elements like fifth vertebra notochordal canal still connected neural canal hourglassshaped opening histology suggests umzc may reached skeletal maturity closely spaced growth marks present lamellarzonal bone outer part cortex known outermost thin layer bone directly external bone surface show marks interpreted outer circumferential layer truly absent simply obscured would argue interpretation indicating individual prolonged period life several years adult experienced unfavorable growth conditions like nutritional shortage drought disease leading limited ezcurra et al suggested fully terrestrial mode life aenigmastropheus already supported gut content relative protorosaurus speneri ratio inner diameter outer diameter humerus aenigmastropheus found consistent bones terrestrial basal archosauriforms humerus tibia euparkeria capensis fibula proterosuchus fergusi considerably smaller ratio observed aquatic semiaquatic animals furthermore strongly developed distal humeral condyles olecranon process ulna also suggest fully terrestrial mode phylogenetic position aenigmastropheus explored ezcurra et al using newly constructed data matrix mostly based data matrix published reisz et al redescription apsisaurus witteri thirteen early saurian species well aenigmastropheus characters dilkes müller senter well new characters added matrix taxa scored differently resultant data matrix includes amniote taxa scored based morphological traits cladogram recovered ezcurra et al almost entirely consistent reisz et al aenigmastropheus recovered nonarchosauriform archosauromorph sister taxon protorosaurus speneri wuchiapingian germany position within archosauromorpha supported three unambiguous synapomorphies two possible synapomorphies supporting position within protorosauria however due fragmentary nature holotype aenigmastropheus scored less characters constrained topologies one additional step required position aenigmastropheus outside archosauromorpha robust version analysis published found one step away protorosaurus archosauromorph family tree rather forming clade cladogram shows phylogenetic position aenigmastropheus among sauria following lepidosauromorpha archosauriformes httpsenwikipediaorgwikiaenigmastropheus
