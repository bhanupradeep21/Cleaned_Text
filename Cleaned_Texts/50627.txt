virus classification process naming viruses placing taxonomic system similar classification systems used cellular organisms viruses classified phenotypic characteristics morphology nucleic acid type mode replication host organisms type disease cause formal taxonomic classification viruses responsibility international committee taxonomy viruses ictv system although baltimore classification system used place viruses one seven groups based manner mrna synthesis specific naming conventions classification guidelines set ictv catalogue worlds known viruses proposed preliminary efforts species form basis biological classification system thought viruses could made fit ernst mayrs reproductive concept species amenable treatment ictv started define species cluster strains unique identifying qualities specific principle virus species polythetic class viruses constitutes replicating lineage occupies particular ecological niche july ictv definition species changed state species monophyletic group viruses whose properties distinguished species multiple criteria include structure capsid existence envelope gene expression program proteins host range pathogenicity importantly genetic sequence similarity phylogenetic actual criteria used vary taxon inconsistent arbitrary similarity thresholds unrelated lineage geography matter many yet currently accepted formal definition virus accepted ictv executive committee november ratified march viruses sensu stricto defined operationally ictv type mge mobile genetic element encodes least one protein major component virion encasing nucleic acid respective mge therefore gene encoding major virion protein mges clearly demonstrable members line evolutionary descent major virion proteinencoding entities monophyletic group mges originates virion proteinencoding ancestor classified group viruses international committee taxonomy viruses began devise implement rules naming classification viruses early effort continues present ictv body charged international union microbiological societies task developing refining maintaining universal virus system shares many features classification system cellular organisms taxon structure however differences exist universal use italics taxonomic names unlike international code nomenclature algae fungi plants international code zoological viral classification starts level realm continues follows taxonomic suffixes unlike system binomial nomenclature adopted cellular species currently standardized form virus species names present ictv mandates species name must contain words possible remaining distinct must contain word virus host species names often take form disease virus particularly higher plants animals ictv published proposal adopt formalized system binomial nomenclature virus species names voted however virologists later objected potential naming system change arguing debate came many field preoccupied due levels taxa except subrealm subkingdom subclass used six realms one incertae sedis class incertae sedis families two incertae sedis genera realms incertae sedis classes incertae sedis families incertae sedis genera suggested similarity virion assembly structure observed certain viral groups infecting hosts different domains life eg bacterial tectiviruses eukaryotic adenoviruses prokaryotic caudovirales eukaryotic herpesviruses reflects evolutionary relationship therefore structural relationship viruses suggested used basis defining higherlevel taxa structurebased viral lineages could complement ictv classification scheme ictv gradually added many higherlevel taxa using relationships protein folds four realms defined release defined presence protein certain structural baltimore classification first defined classification

groups designated roman numerals classifications determined disease caused virus morphology neither satisfactory due different viruses either causing disease looking similar addition viral structures often difficult determine microscope classifying viruses according genome means given category behave similar fashion offering indication proceed research viruses placed one seven following viruses

accepted others due neglect morphological infectious agents smaller viruses since ictv allowed classified similar way viruses satellites depend coinfection host cell helper virus productive multiplication nucleic acids substantially distinct nucleotide sequences either helper virus host satellite subviral agent encodes coat protein encapsulated called satellite virus satellitelike nucleic acids resemble satellite nucleic acids replicate aid helper viruses however differ encode functions contribute success helper viruses sometimes considered genomic elements helper viruses always found within helper defective interfering particles defective viruses lost ability replicate except presence helper virus normally parental virus also interfere helper virus
