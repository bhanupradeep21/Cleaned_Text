impression formation social psychology refers processes different pieces knowledge another combined global summary impression social psychologist solomon asch credited seminal research impression formation conducted research individuals integrate information personality two major theories proposed explain process integration takes place gestalt approach views formation general impression sum several interrelated impressions individual seeks form coherent meaningful impression another individual previous impressions significantly influence interpretation subsequent contrast gestalt approach cognitive algebra approach asserts individuals experiences combined previous evaluations form constantly changing impression related area impression formation study person perception making dispositional attributions adjusting inferences based information impression formation traditionally studied using three methods pioneered asch free response free association checklist form addition fourth method based likert scale anchors favorable unfavorable also used recent combination techniques often employed produce accurate assessment impression formation free response experimental method frequently used impression formation research participant perceiver presented stimulus usually short vignette list personality descriptors assured talkative cold etc instructed briefly sketch impressions type person described useful technique gathering detailed concrete evidence nature impression formed however difficulty accurately coding responses often necessitates use additional quantitative free association another commonly used experimental method perceiver creates list personality adjectives immediately come mind asked think type person described particular set descriptor adjectives checklist consisting assorted personality descriptors often used supplement free response free association data compare group presenting characterqualities imagined individual perceivers instructed select character adjectives preset list best describe resulting impression produces easily quantifiable assessment impression forces participants answers limited often extreme response however used conjunction abovementioned techniques checklist data provides useful information character impressions likert scales perceivers responding presentation discrete personality characteristics common presentation methods include lists adjectives photos videos depicting scene written example participant might asked answer question would honest trait person ever search owner lost package behavior answering scale ranging unlikely asch stressed important influence individuals initial impressions persons personality traits interpretation subsequent impressions asch argued early impressions often shaped colored individuals perception traitrelated considerable body research exists supporting example individuals asked rate impression another person presented list words

process anchoring cause people actively change perception others process emotionality certain personality traits warm versus cold characteristics influence subsequent traits interpreted ultimately type impression information inconsistent persons global impression another individual especially prominent memory process assimilation lead causal attributions personality inconsistent information integrated effect especially influential behavior perceived negative consistent negativity bias negative behaviors seen indicative individuals behavior situations involving moral extreme negative behavior also considered predictive personality traits less extreme classic experiment solomon aschs principal theoretical concern revolved around understanding mechanisms influencing persons overall impression others principally trait centrality trait valence various personality research illustrated influential roles primacy effect valence causal attribution part based findings ten experiments
