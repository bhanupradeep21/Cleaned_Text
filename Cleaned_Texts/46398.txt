dual consciousness theoretical concept neuroscience proposed possible person may develop two separate conscious entities within one brain undergoing corpus callosotomy idea first began circulating neuroscience community splitbrain patients exhibited alien hand syndrome led scientists believe must two separate consciousnesses within brains left right hemispheres competition one another corpus callosum idea dual consciousness caused controversy neuroscience community conclusive evidence proposed phenomenon discovered first half century neurosurgeons concluded best option treating severe epilepsy severing patients corpus callosum corpus callosum primary communication mechanism brains two cerebral hemispheres example communication across corpus callosum allows information left right visual fields interpreted brain way makes sense comprehend persons actual experience visual inputs eyes interpreted brain make sense experience looking computer directly front procedure surgically removing corpus callosum called corpus callosotomy patients undergone corpus callosotomy colloquially referred splitbrain patients called brains left right hemispheres longer connected corpus callosumcitation needed splitbrain patients subjects numerous psychological experiments sought discover occurs brain primary interhemispheric pathways disrupted notable researchers field include roger sperry one first publish ideas involving dual consciousness famous graduate student michael gazzaniga results found pattern among patients severing entire corpus callosum stops interhemispheric transfer perceptual sensory motor forms information cases corpus callosotomies way affect patients realworld functioning however psychology experiments demonstrated interesting differences splitbrain patients normal subjectscitation needed first successful corpus callosotomies humans performed purpose procedure alleviate effects epilepsy forms treatment medications failed stop violent convulsions associated epileptic seizures occur abnormal electrical discharges spread across areas william van wagenen proposed idea severing corpus callosum eliminate transcortical electrical signals across brains could achieved seizures reduced even eliminatedcitation needed general procedure corpus callosotomy follows patient put anesthesia patient deep sleep craniotomy performed procedure removes section skull leaving brain exposed accessible surgeon dura mater pulled back deeper areas brain including corpus callosum seen specialized instruments placed brain allows safe severing corpus initially partial callosotomy performed severs front twothirds important note back section callosum preserved visual information still sent across hemispheres though corpus callosum loses majority functioning partial callosotomy completely lose capabilities operation succeed reducing seizures complete callosotomy needed reduce severity seizurescitation needed similar type procedure known commissurotomy involves severing number interhemispheric tracts anterior commissure hippocampal commissure massa intermedia thalamus addition corpus surgery splitbrain patients often given extensive neuropsychological assessments interesting finding among splitbrain patients many claim feel normal surgery feel brains corpus callosotomy commissurotomy successful reducing cases eliminating epileptic seizures van wagenens theory correctcitation needed alien hand syndrome sometimes used synonymously anarchic neurological disorder afflicted persons hand appears take mind alien hand syndrome documented split brain patients first instance alien hand syndrome reported kurt incident occurred woman whose left hand grabbed throat without making effort able remove hand took great deal effort upon passing autopsy performed concluded event may caused several strokes right hemisphere corpus callosum reports surfaced patients undergone corpus callosotomies experiencing uncontrollable hand movements following surgery instances actions one left hand conflicted actions one right hand initial diagnosis experiences diagnostic dyspraxia three main types alien hand first frontal variant characterized nondominant hand grabbing items manipulating objects second callosal variant common characterized uncontrollable conflicting movement righthanded patient left hand callosal alien hand syndrome often occurs alongside symptoms callosal damage alexia diminished absent ability comprehend written language visual anomia inability name objects seen right vision third type posterior variant type alien hand syndrome characterized affected hand rising air making non purposeful classic sign alien hand syndrome affected person control one hands example splitbrain patient alien hand syndrome asked pick glass right hand right hand moves glass left hand interfere action thwarting right hands task interference left hand completely control patient done purpose affected patients times control movements hands another example included patients unbuttoning shirt one hand hand simultaneously rebuttoning shirt although reported feeling normal switching ones attention one task another also lessen amount control allocate affected scientists first started observing alien hand syndrome splitbrain patients began question nature consciousness began theorize perhaps corpus callosum cut consciousness also split two separate entities development added general appeal splitbrain researchcitation needed michael gazzaniga joseph discovered unique phenomenon among splitbrain patients asked perform simultaneous concept task patient shown pictures house winter time chickens claw pictures positioned would exclusively seen one visual field brain winter house positioned would seen patients left visual field lvf corresponds brains right hemisphere chickens claw placed would seen patients right visual field rvf corresponds brains left hemisphere series pictures placed front patients gazzaniga ledoux asked patient choose picture right hand picture left hand paradigm set choices would obvious patients snow shovel used shoveling snowy driveway winter house chickens head correlates chickens claw pictures way correlate original pictures study patient chose snow shovel left hand corresponding brains right hemisphere right hand chose chickens head corresponding brains left hemisphere patient asked chosen pictures chosen answer gave chicken claw goes chicken head need snow shovel clean chicken shed would say wouldnt obvious shovel goes winter house people intact corpus callosum yes obvious splitbrain patient winter house shovel projected patient lvf right hemisphere receiving processing information input completely independent going rvf involves chickens claw head information processed left hemisphere human brains left hemisphere primarily responsible interpreting meaning sensory input receives fields however left hemisphere knowledge winter house knowledge winter house must invent logical reason shovel chosen since objects work chickens claw head left hemisphere interprets meaning choosing shovel object necessary help chicken lives shed therefore shovel used clean chicken shed gazzaniga famously coined term left brain explain phenomenon results gazzaniga ledouxs work suggest existence dual consciousness varying possibilities studies based previous studies done sperry sperry examined splitbrain patients sperrys experiment included subject seated table shield blocking visions subjects hands including objects table examiner seated across shield also used viewing screen shield examiner select present visual material hemispheres selective hemispheres means patient look certain points viewing screen patient briefly exposed stimuli viewing screen stimuli shown left eye goes right hemisphere visual material shown right eye projected left hemisphere experiment stimulus shown left side screen patient indicated see anything patients shown inability describe writing speech stimuli shown briefly left side speaking hemisphere people left hemisphere would awareness stimulus shown right hemisphere left visual field except left hand able point correct object based observations data sperry concluded hemisphere possessed consciousnesscitation needed revonsuo explains procedure similar nature design splitbrain patients shown picture two objects flower rabbit flower exclusively shown right visual field interpreted left hemisphere rabbit exclusively shown left visual field interpreted right hemisphere left brain seeing flower right brain simultaneously viewing rabbit patients asked saw patients said saw flower see rabbit flower right visual field left hemisphere see flower left hemisphere dominates interpretation stimulus since see rabbit represented right hemisphere patients believe saw rabbit however still point rabbit left hand revonsuo stated seemed one consciousness saw flower another consciousness saw rabbit independently one rhawn joseph observed two patients undergone complete corpus callosotomy joseph observed right hemisphere one patients able gather comprehend express information right hemisphere able direct activity patients left arm leg execution left arm legs action inhibited left hemisphere joseph found patients left leg would attempt move forward walk straight right leg would either refuse move begin walk opposite direction observing struggles execution activities involving left right arms legs led joseph believe two hemispheres possessed joseph also noted patient specific instances conflict right left hemispheres including left hand right hemisphere carrying actions contrary left hemispheres motives left hand turning television immediately right hand turned joseph found patients left leg would allow patient return home patient going walk would reject continuing go walk laboratory patient given two different fabrics wire screen left hand piece sandpaper right hand patient received two different fabrics view neither eye hemisphere visually seen hands given patient indicating fabric left hand able correctly indicate point left hand wire screen set table pointed left hand however right hand tried stop left hand make left hand point fabric right hand holding left hand continued point correct fabric even though right hand tried forcefully move left hand struggle patient also verbalized feelings animosity saying wrong hate hand joseph concluded left hemisphere understand left hand right hemisphere would point different proponents dual consciousness theory caused great amount controversy debate within neuroscience community magnitude claim consciousness split two entities within one brain considered scientists audacious concrete evidence validate theory current evidence provided best anecdotalcitation needed powerful claims dual consciousness theory gonzalo munevar proposed alternative explanation demonstrate strange behaviors spawned areas brain dual two cortical areas particular supplementary motor area sma premotor cortex pmc crucial planning executing motor tasks external stimuli presented persons perceptual example person may pick glass water right hand put lips drink person may picked glass right hand well action takes place pmc sma consider variety different possibilities action could performed could picked left hand mouth even foot could done quickly slowly many possibilities entertained actually executed actions sent pmc motor cortex execution rest inhibited sma also important understand processes sma pmc done unconsciously sma pmc consider many alternative actions many milliseconds chosen action takes person never consciously aware alternative possibilities brain juggled picks right hand action picking glass right hand also performed unconsciously may preferable use right hand right handed therefore comfortable perhaps glass placed right side possibility expends least amount energy using right hand pick another important fact pmc activation bilateral activated activated hemispheres brain gazzaniga observed wrote corpus callosum severed many interhemispheric interactions disrupted many areas brain become compromised including sma sma trouble regulating inhibiting actions pmc possible conflicting sets actions may sent mc performed accounting hands reaching glass even one hand intended grab would make appearance dual consciousness competing dominance control brain case disappearance alien hand syndrome splitbrain patients evidence one consciousness defeating taking complete control likely plasticity brain may cause alleviating disorder eventually split patients brain may find adaptive routes compensate lost interhemispheric communication alternative pathways involving subcortical structures perform subcortical interhemispheric inhibition regain sense normalcy two hemispheres michael gazzaniga working model dual consciousness came conclusion simple dual consciousness ie rightbrainleftbrain model mind gross oversimplification brain organized hundreds maybe even thousands modularprocessing theory division consciousness touched upon carl jung stated socalled unity consciousness illusion like think one similar models also claim mind formed many little agents ie brain made constellation independent semiindependent agents also described
