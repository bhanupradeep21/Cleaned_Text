jr spent early childhood cleveland near fossil quarry collected first trilobite age hazen family moved new jersey roberts eightgrade teacher bill welsh observed roberts interest collection minerals hazen later recalled gave starter collection specimens mineral field guides mimeographed directions paterson franklin new hazen also early interest music starting piano age violin trumpet age hazen worked bs sm master science earth science massachusetts institute technology started intention going chemical engineering captivated enthusiasm david wones converted mineralogy wones advisor completed masters thesis cation substitution trioctahedral micas publication american mineralogist first highly completed phd mineralogy crystallography harvard university thesis charles burnham advisor involved learning use diffractometer highpressure xray crystallography applying olivine became focus early nato postdoctoral fellow cambridge university england hazen worked charles prewitt determine empirical relations effect temperature pressure interatomic distances oxides hazen joined carnegie institutions geophysical laboratory research brief stint measuring optical properties lunar minerals peter bell david mao started xray crystallography larry later recalled match made mineralogical heaven larry loved write code build machines analyze data loved mount crystals run diffractometers write collaborated two decades determined thousand crystal structures variable pressures temperatures work summarized book comparative crystal much work hazen could classified mineral physics cross geophysics mineralogy although field pioneering contributions nobel prize winner percy bridgman student francis birch early century name scientists concerned interdisciplinary approach needed understand relationship interatomic forces mineral properties hazen prewitt coconvened first mineral physics conference held october airlie house warrenton cooled low temperatures materials experience sudden transition electrical resistance drops zero magnetic fields expelled phenomenon called superconductivity superconductors host applications including powerful electromagnets fast digital circuits sensitive magnetometers low temperatures needed make applications difficult expensive superconductors existed k two ibm researchers georg bednorz k alex müller found ceramic material critical temperature k set frenzied search higher critical group led paul chu university houston explored materials made yttrium barium copper oxygen ycbo first obtain critical temperature boiling point liquid nitrogen ycbo samples mixture black green minerals although researchers knew average composition know compositions two phases february chu turned mao hazen could determine composition small mineral grains rocks took mao hazen week determine compositions black phase turned superconductor mao hazen determined crystal structure superconducting phase like perovskite important mineral earths subsequently hazens group identified twelve hightemperature oxide superconductors perovskite structures worked organic hazen felt research reached respectable plateau main principles crystals compress known questions asking increasingly narrow answers rarely surprising changed research directions study lifes chemical opportunity came colleague george mason university harold morowitz realized temperature pressure hydrothermal vent might change properties water allowing chemical reactions ordinarily require help enzyme enlisting help hatten yoder specialist high pressure mineralogy tried subjecting pyruvate water high pressure hoping simple reaction would return oxaloacetate instead analysis organic geochemist george cody found obtained tens thousands publication results seemed support deep sea vent met heavy criticism especially stanley miller colleagues believe life emerged surface along general criticism organic compounds would survive long hot high pressure conditions pointed several flaws experiment book genesis hazen acknowledges stanley miller basically right experiments argues art science isnt necessarily avoid mistakes rather progress often made making mistakes fast possible avoiding making mistake subsequent work group formed biomolecules carbon dioxide water catalyzed formation amino acids using oxides sulfides transition metals different transition elements catalyze different organic organic molecules often come two mirrorimage forms often referred righthanded lefthanded handedness called chirality example amino acid alanine comes righthanded dalanine lefthanded lalanine form living cells selective choosing amino acids lefthanded form sugars righthanded however abiotic processes produce equal amount somehow life must developed preference homochirality scientists proposed several theories consensus hazen investigated possibility organic molecules might acquire chiral asymmetry grown faces mineral crystals like quartz come mirrorimage forms others like calcite symmetric centers faces come pairs opposite tim filley expert organic chemical analysis glenn goodfriend geochemist hazen cleaned large calcite crystals dipped aspartic acid found face crystal small preference either left righthanded forms aspartate proposed similar mechanism might work amino acids work attracted lot interest pharmaceutical industry needs produce drugs pure christmas party biophysicist harold morowitz asked hazen whether clay minerals archean eon hazen could recall mineralogist ever asked whether given mineral existed given occurred one ever explored earths mineralogy changed time worked question year closest colleague geochemist dimitri sverjensky johns hopkins university collaborators including mineralogist robert downs petrologist john ferry geobiologist dominic papineau result paper american mineralogist provided new historical context mineralogy called mineral based review literature hazen coauthors estimated number minerals solar system grown dozen time formation present latter number grown predicted systematic increase number mineral species time identified three main eras change formation solar system planets reworking crust mantle onset plate tectonics appearance life first era minerals second remainder made possible action living organisms particularly addition oxygen paper followed next years several studies concentrating one chemical element time mapping first appearances minerals involving hazen colleagues started carbon mineral challenge citizen science project dedicated accelerating discovery missing carbonbearing clarence b robinson professor george mason university hazen developed innovative courses promote scientific literacy scientists physicist james trefil developed course
