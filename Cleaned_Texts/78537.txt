bone marrow semisolid tissue found within spongy also known cancellous portions birds mammals bone marrow primary site new blood cell production composed hematopoietic cells marrow adipose tissue supportive stromal cells adult humans bone marrow primarily located ribs vertebrae sternum bones bone marrow comprises approximately total body mass healthy adult humans man weighing kg lbs around kg lbs bone human marrow produces approximately billion blood cells per day join systemic circulation via permeable vasculature sinusoids within medullary types hematopoietic cells including myeloid lymphoid lineages created bone marrow however lymphoid cells must migrate lymphoid organs eg thymus order complete maturation bone marrow transplants conducted treat severe diseases bone marrow including certain forms cancer leukemia several types stem cells related bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells bone marrow give rise hematopoietic lineage cells mesenchymal stem cells isolated primary culture bone marrow stroma give rise bone adipose cartilage composition marrow dynamic mixture cellular noncellular components connective tissue shifts age response systemic factors humans marrow colloquially characterized red yellow marrow latin medulla ossium rubra latin medulla ossium flava respectively depending prevalence hematopoietic cells vs fat cells precise mechanisms underlying marrow regulation compositional changes occur according stereotypical example newborn babys bones exclusively contain hematopoietically active red marrow progressive conversion towards yellow marrow age adults red marrow found mainly central skeleton pelvis sternum cranium ribs vertebrae scapulae variably found proximal epiphyseal ends long bones femur humerus circumstances chronic hypoxia body convert yellow marrow back red marrow increase blood cell cellular level main functional component bone marrow includes progenitor cells destined mature blood lymphoid cells human marrow produces approximately billion blood cells per marrow contains hematopoietic stem cells give rise three classes blood cells found circulation white blood cells leukocytes red blood cells erythrocytes platelets stroma bone marrow includes tissue directly involved marrows primary function stromal cells may indirectly involved hematopoiesis providing microenvironment influences function differentiation hematopoietic cells instance generate colony stimulating factors significant effect hematopoiesis cell types constitute bone marrow stroma include bone marrow stroma contains mesenchymal stem cells also known marrow stromal cells multipotent stem cells differentiate variety cell types mscs shown differentiate vitro vivo osteoblasts chondrocytes myocytes marrow adipocytes betapancreatic islets cellscitation needed blood vessels bone marrow constitute barrier inhibiting immature blood cells leaving marrow mature blood cells contain membrane proteins aquaporin glycophorin required attach pass blood vessel hematopoietic stem cells may also cross bone marrow barrier may thus harvested bloodcitation needed red bone marrow key element lymphatic system one primary lymphoid organs generate lymphocytes immature hematopoietic progenitor bone marrow thymus constitute primary lymphoid tissues involved production early selection lymphocytes furthermore bone marrow performs valvelike function prevent backflow lymphatic fluid lymphatic systemcitation needed biological compartmentalization evident within bone marrow certain cell types tend aggregate specific areas instance erythrocytes macrophages precursors tend gather around blood vessels granulocytes gather borders bone people used animal bonemarrow cuisine worldwide millennia famed milanese normal bone marrow architecture damaged displaced aplastic anemia malignancies multiple myeloma infections tuberculosis leading decrease production blood cells blood platelets bone marrow also affected various forms leukemia attacks hematologic progenitor furthermore exposure radiation chemotherapy kill many rapidly dividing cells bone marrow therefore result depressed immune system many symptoms radiation poisoning due damage sustained bone marrow cellscitation needed diagnose diseases involving bone marrow bone marrow aspiration sometimes performed typically involves using hollow needle acquire sample red bone marrow crest ilium general local bone marrow derived stem cells wide array application regenerative medical imaging may provide limited amount information regarding bone marrow plain film xrays pass soft tissues marrow provide visualization although changes structure associated bone may ct imaging somewhat better capacity assessing marrow cavity bones although low sensitivity specificity example normal fatty yellow marrow adult long bones low density hounsfield units subcutaneous fat soft tissue tissue increased cellular composition normal red marrow cancer cells within medullary cavity measure variably higher mri sensitive specific assessing bone composition mri enables assessment average molecular composition soft tissues thus provides information regarding relative fat content marrow adult humans yellow fatty marrow dominant tissue bones particularly peripheral appendicular skeleton fat molecules high imaging sequences show yellow fatty marrow bright hyperintense furthermore normal fatty marrow loses signal fatsaturation sequences similar pattern subcutaneous fatcitation needed yellow fatty marrow becomes replaced tissue cellular composition change apparent decreased brightness sequences normal red marrow pathologic marrow lesions cancer darker yellow marrow sequences although often distinguished comparison mr signal intensity adjacent soft tissues normal red marrow typically equivalent brighter skeletal muscle intervertebral disc fatty marrow change inverse red marrow hyperplasia occur normal though also seen certain treatments radiation therapy diffuse marrow hypointensity without contrast enhancement cortical discontinuity suggests red marrow conversion myelofibrosis falsely normal marrow seen diffuse multiple myeloma leukemic infiltration water fat ratio sufficiently altered may seen lower grade tumors earlier disease bone marrow examination pathologic analysis samples bone marrow obtained via biopsy bone marrow aspiration bone marrow examination used diagnosis number conditions including leukemia multiple myeloma anemia pancytopenia bone marrow produces cellular elements blood including platelets red blood cells white blood cells much information gleaned testing blood drawn vein phlebotomy sometimes necessary examine source blood cells bone marrow obtain information hematopoiesis role bone marrow aspiration biopsycitation needed ratio myeloid series erythroid cells relevant bone marrow function also diseases bone marrow peripheral blood leukemia anemia normal myeloidtoerythroid ratio around ratio may increase myelogenous leukemias decrease polycythemias reverse cases bone marrow transplant hematopoietic stem cells removed person infused another person allogenic person later time autologous donor recipient compatible infused cells travel bone marrow initiate blood cell production transplantation one person another conducted treatment severe bone marrow diseases congenital defects autoimmune diseases malignancies patients marrow first killed drugs radiation new stem cells introduced radiation therapy chemotherapy cases cancer patients hematopoietic stem cells sometimes harvested later infused back therapy finished restore immune bone marrow stem cells induced become neural cells treat neurological also potentially used treatment illnesses inflammatory bowel following clinical trial scientists proposed bone marrow transplantation could used treat hiv conjunction antiretroviral however later found hiv remained bodies test stem cells typically harvested directly red marrow iliac crest often general anesthesia procedure minimally invasive require stitches afterwards depending donors health reaction procedure actual harvesting outpatient procedure require days recovery another option administer certain drugs stimulate release stem cells bone marrow circulating intravenous catheter inserted donors arm stem cells filtered blood procedure similar used blood platelet donation adults bone marrow may also taken sternum tibia often used taking samples newborns stem cells may retrieved umbilical using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr nextgeneration sequencing ngs
