environmental toxicants fetal development impact different toxic substances environment development fetus article deals potential adverse effects environmental toxicants prenatal development embryo fetus well pregnancy complications human embryo fetus relatively susceptible impact adverse conditions within mothers environment substandard fetal conditions often cause various degrees developmental delays physical mental growing baby although variables occur result genetic conditions pertaining father great many directly brought environmental toxins mother exposed various toxins pose significant hazard fetuses development study found virtually us pregnant women carry multiple chemicals including banned since bodies researchers detected polychlorinated biphenyls organochlorine pesticides

nervous system effects especially brain development eating fish main source mercury exposure humans fish may contain enough mercury harm developing nervous system embryo fetus sometimes leading learning mercury present many types fish mostly found certain large fish one welldocumented case widespread mercury ingestion subsequent fetal development complication took place minamata bay japan used nearby industrial plant manufacture plastics methyl mercury discharged waters minamata bay went ingested regularly many villagers used fish living bay dietary staple soon many inhabitants consuming mercuryladen meat began experiencing negative effects ingesting toxin however mercury especially impacted pregnant women fetuses resulting high rate miscarriage surviving infants exposed
