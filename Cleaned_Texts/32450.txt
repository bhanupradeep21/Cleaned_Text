perforated baton bâton de commandement bâton percé names given archaeologists particular type prehistoric artefact made antler prehistoric europe whose function remains debated name bâtons de commandement batons command name first applied class artefacts makes assumption function ceremonial object insignia held leaders name bâton percé meaning pierced rod perforated baton term used british museum recent term descriptive form rather presumed many decorated carved engraved animals recently usual explanation use used straightening spears arrows spearthrowers originally thought many symbolic attribute authority bâtons percés made length antler round hole made one end often abstract animal designs etched horses found aurignacian magdalenian sites upper paleolithic examples dating years ago joint one end often forming shape always swelling antler end circular hole drilled antler swelling joint often smaller second hole nearby shaft typical examples range inches cm one unusual bone baton le souci lalinde row eight holes different purpose bâton percé originally thought symbol power status hence early name bâton de commandement rod command given louis laurent gabriel de mortillet interpretation thought unlikely one french archaeologist wrote derisively name summoning image aged general directing assault interpretations include british museum scope note perforated baton says understood implements used manufacture throwing focusing objects used however account decorated use bâton percé spearthrower subject experimental archaeology yielded evidence support hypothesis bâton percé used spear spear thrower hypothesis first put forward article artist leon underwood underwood previously engaged experimental archeology working bronze artefacts rejected classification bâton percé magic wand drew comparisons contemporary inuit spear throwers underwoods hypothesis existing samples bâton percé poor shape may missing hook found inuit spear thrower atlatl underwood built two wooden models based different bâton percé museum collections addition nipple hook end shaft opposite hole reproductions compared inuit designs found offer superior performance throwing fletched spears underwood pointed inuit throwers built using driftwood necessarily weaker design reflected available another experiment bâton percé used orientation held end hole outwards hook added series tests feet grains g fletched spear used use bâton percé spear thrower length cord attached spear near middle spear leather would suitable lighter spears sinew would required heavier spears addition cord turns spear large swiss arrow using spear thus equipped swiss arrow resulted increase range compared hand thrown bâton percé used feeding cord hole laying cord along length shaft bâton percé held hand solid end held hand near pinkie pierced end emerging end fist loose end cord grasped thumb forefinger spear laid along bâton percé spear may twisted one half turns serves stabilize spear throw bâton percé held shoulder thrown overhand length bâton percé serves increase throwers leverage providing speed cord acts swiss arrow extending leverage use bâton percé way results increase range handthrown bâton percé examples curved degree either natural curve antler made result deliberate alteration straight curved handles produce similar gains range experimenters found curved handles provided better ergonomics straight handle lefthanded throwers preferring one direction curve righthanded throwers preferring straight handles advantage usable left righthanded shape required use spear thrower example shape less sensitive direction amount twist cord thus easier use used method described even bâton percés hole dispensed though resulting spear thrower would far difficult load cord used works well long enough inches mm cord extends hole bâton percé knot spear longer cords inches mm may provide higher velocities cord attachment points vary middle spear centre mass depending length significantly frontheavy spear works spear long enough project foot front bâton percé ready throw using long spear longer bâton percé also used though short version works well longer bâton percé may provide additional velocity shorter hypothesis batons used help fashion spears darts arrows necessarily conflict use spearthrowers straighteners may operated two main ways firstly holes may used shaft wrench lever wooden shaft straight perhaps heating shaft shaft would noticeably smaller hole placed applying pressure baton bends shaft could straightened second method put shaft hole spin baton round round rough inside hole either wearing away wood achieve tapering point marking areas whittled could firehardened smoothing leather thongs placed hole similar way
