freezing behavior also called freeze response petrified reaction specific stimuli commonly observed prey animals prey animal caught completely overcome predator may respond freezing uppetrification words uncontrollably becoming rigid limp studies typically assess conditioned freezing behavior response stimuli typically innately cause fear tone shock freezing behavior easily characterized changes blood pressure lengths time crouching position also known cause changes shortness breath increased heart rate sweating choking however since difficult measure sympathetic responses fear stimuli studies typically confined simple crouching times response stimuli typically said fight flight completely described fight flight freeze addition freezing observed occur fight flight response studies suggest specific areas brain known either elicit inhibit case lesions freezing behavior subjects regions include basolateral amygdala hippocampus one study conducted ann e power et al investigated effects lesions basolateral rats placed chamber containing cat hair two groups rats tested rats lesioned basolateral amygdala rats control group shamoperated rats first froze briefly retreated away stimulus upon initial contact results showed lesioned rats froze much less cat hair rats control group data infer connection basolateral amygdala freezing behavior another study conducted gisquetverrier et al tested effects hippocampus three experiments freezing behavior rats lesioned ibotenic acid tested control group first investigated changes conditioned fear results showed lesions hippocampus alter freezing behavior marginally affected avoidance next tested single conditioning sessions found freezing behavior remained unchanged avoidance disrupted finally tested conditioning larger stimulus footshock intensity found avoidance unaltered freezing behavior decreased investigations show hippocampus involved freezing behavior avoidance freezing behavior seem similar ways quantified comes fear conditioning experimentally tested particular areas brain involved freezing behavior mentioned ann e power investigated effect basolateral amygdala freezing behavior also found muscarinic cholinergic activation plays role suggests neurotransmitters general play role freezing behavior several investigations show freezing behavior influenced following hashimoto et al investigated effects conditioned fear serotonin freezing behavior vivo microdialysis certain concentrations extracellular serotonin rat brain able measured found conditioned fear stress increased levels serotonin medial prefrontal cortex increase correlated increased freezing behavior observed rats given inhibitor extracellular serotonin resulted reduced freezing behavior suggested results inhibition serotonin decrease freezing behavior also anxiety serotonin influence freezing behavior shown antipsychotic drugs apds clozapine olanzapine affect freezing behavior drugs administered subcutaneously rats minutes footshock stress observed hours following footshock freezing behavior present without shocks interesting note since sympathetic response stimuli suggests antipsychotic drugs alter freezing behavior making rats sensitive fear stimulus example methamphetamine also shown potentially affect freezing tsuchiya et al conducted study investigating effect methamphetamine pretreatment freezing behavior rats given drug week ramping doses fiveday period without drugs administered rats subjected conditioned fear stress repeated single methamphetamine pretreatment resulted significantly increased freezing behavior evidence suggests previous exposure chronic methamphetamine results increased sensitivity subsequent stress control group neurotransmitters influence freezing behavior inhibitors expected interrupt neurotransmitters influence freezing study examined effects monoamine oxidase inhibitors freezing behavior rats treated specific inhibitors target either monoamine oxidase b results showed acute inhibition monoamine oxidase b reduce anxiety freezing behavior however inhibition monoamine oxidase b alone failed shown parts brain involved freezing behavior neurotransmitters similar chemicals influence freezing behavior well related manner hormones progestogens estrogen also play role freezing first authors tested rats marble burying conditioned fear behavioral estrous diestrous female rats behavioral estrous elevated levels steroid hormones also elicit approach less freezing behavior diestrous rats results demonstrate rats behavioral estrous show less impulsive burying also less freezing behavior diestrous rats authors administered progesterone estrogen ovariectomized rats tested marble burying conditioned fear results experiment demonstrate administration progesterone estrogen progesterone decreases impulsive burying demonstrate decrease freezing behavior study concludes progesterone andor estrogen may mediate impulsive andor avoidant behavior freezing behavior females cycle seen greatly impacted levels hormones however may future studies whether testosterone influences freezing behavior well
