nothing nothing thing complete absence anything opposite everything complement concept nothing matter philosophical debate since least century bc early greek philosophers argued impossible nothing exist atomists allowed nothing spaces invisibly small atoms space filled atoms aristotle took view exists matter exists space receptacle matter objects placed became paradigm classical scientists modern age like newton nevertheless philosophers like descartes continued argue existence empty space scientific discovery physical vacuum existentialists like sartre heidegger interpreted sartre associated nothing consciousness writers made connections heideggers concept nothing nirvana eastern religions modern science equate vacuum nothing indeed vacuum quantum field theory filled virtual quantum vacuum often viewed modern version aether theory would consider study nothing absurd typical response type voiced giacomo casanova conversation landlord one dr gozzi also happens priest

air stood firmly center universe god created nothingness said proved existence nothingness absurd cut short calling nothingness treated serious subject long time philosophy avoid linguistic traps meaning nothing phrase notbeing often employed make clear discussed one earliest western philosophers consider nothing concept parmenides century bc greek philosopher monist school argued nothing exist following line reasoning speak thing one speak thing exists since speak thing past thing must still exist sense concludes thing change corollary things comingintobeing passingoutofbeing philosophers instance socrates largely agreed parmenidess reasoning nothing aristotle differs parmenidess conception nothing says although opinions seem follow logically dialectical discussion yet believe seems next door madness one considers modern times albert einsteins concept spacetime led many scientists including einstein adopt position remarkably similar death friend michele besso einstein consoled widow words departed strange world little ahead signifies nothing us believe physics distinction past present future stubbornly persistent leucippus early century bc one atomists along philosophers time made attempts reconcile monism everyday observation motion change accepted monist position could motion without void void opposite notbeing hand exists something known absolute plenum space filled matter motion plenum completely full one monolithic plenum existence consists multiplicity plenums invisibly small atoms greek atomist theory later expanded democritus c bc allows void exist scenario macroscopic objects comeintobeing move space pass notbeing means coming together moving apart constituent atoms void must exist allow happen else frozen world parmenides must accepted bertrand russell points exactly defeat argument parmenides rather ignores taking rather modern scientific position starting observed data motion etc constructing theory based data opposed parmenides attempts work pure logic russell also observes sides mistaken believing motion plenum arguably motion start cyril bailey notes leucippus first say thing void might real without body points irony comes materialistic atomist leucippus therefore first say nothing reality attached aristotle bc provided classic escape logical problem posed parmenides distinguishing things matter things space scenario space nothing rather receptacle objects matter placed true void nothing different space removed characterization space reached pinnacle isaac newton asserted existence absolute space rené descartes hand returned parmenideslike argument denying existence space descartes matter extension matter leaving room existence idea space actually empty generally still accepted philosophers invoked arguments similar plenum reasoning although descartes views challenged blaise pascal declined overturn traditional belief horror vacui commonly stated nature abhors vacuum remained evangelista

translating pseudodionysius beliefs essentially pantheist classifies evil amongst many things notbeing done grounds evil opposite good quality god god opposite since god everything pantheist view world similarly idea god created world nothing interpreted meaning nothing synonymous georg wilhelm friedrich hegel philosopher brought dialectical method new pinnacle development according hegel science logic dialectical methods consists three steps first thesis given proposition logic second antithesis thesis formed finally synthesis incorporating thesis antithesis hegel believed proposition taken completely true whole true dialectical synthesis means whole could examined relation specific proposition truth consists whole process separating thesis antithesis synthesis standalone statement results something way untrue concept nothing arises hegel right beginning logic whole called hegel absolute viewed something spiritual hegel prominent figure among existentialists jeanpaul sartre whose ideas book nothingness lêtre et le néant heavily influenced time sein und zeit martin heidegger although heidegger later stated misunderstood sartre defines two kinds être one kind êtreensoi brute existence things tree kind êtrepoursoi consciousness sartre claims second kind nothing since consciousness object consciousness possess sartre even jaques lacan use conception nothing foundation atheist philosophy equating nothingness leads creation nothing hence god longer needed understanding nothing varies widely cultures especially western eastern cultures philosophical traditions instance śūnyatā emptiness unlike nothingness considered state mind forms buddhism see nirvana mu bodhi achieving nothing state mind tradition allows one totally focused thought activity level intensity would able achieve consciously thinking classic example archer attempting erase mind clear thoughts better focus shot authors pointed similarities buddhist conception nothingness ideas martin heidegger existentialists like although connection explicitly made philosophers eastern philosophies concept nothingness characterized egoless state one fully realizes ones small part cosmosdubious discuss kyoto school handles concept nothingness well laozi zhuangzi conscious language powerless face ultimate taoist philosophy however real world main characteristic impermanence whereas tao permanence described predetermined named way tao different thing named nonexistence words nothing taoists also related concept wu wei despite proven existence vacuum scientists centuries thought must medium pervading space allowed transmission light gravity thus period accepted complete nothing possible theories describing medium collectively known aether theories named evocation aether classical element greek philosophy particular medium supposed allow transmission light called luminiferous aether became centre attention james clerk maxwell proposed light electromagnetic wave early aether theories include robert hooke christiaan huygens newton also aether theory newton medium transmission since theorised light composed corpuscles moved simple mechanical motion needed aether instead explain refraction early theories generally proposed mechanical medium sort allowing possibility medium supporting light proof light wave nature rather newtons corpuscles provided thomas young interference experiment seemingly confirming need well known attempt detect existence aether conducted albert michelson experiment later repeated edward w morley precision failed show desired effect reluctant abandon aether theory various attempts made modify account michelsonmorley finally albert einstein building work hendrik lorentz published theory special relativity dispenses entirely need luminiferous aether explain transmission although physical medium longer required concept aether still entirely vanish remained necessary assign properties vacuum various purposes
