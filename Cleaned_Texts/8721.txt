vice versa effect always present latent form material cause transforming clay pot potter wheel stick operating agents required merely nimitta instrumental causes catalysts transformation material cause always remains clay hence cause effect always entirely identical natureg potter material cause pot case potter might well prepare pot without clay thus clay pot made clay gold ornaments made gold similarly different modes existence soul result activities soul contradiction exceptions scenario jains argue material cause living soul cetana conscious entity always soul cause dead inert

workings karma morality ethics important personal whim fictional god life led agreement moral ethical principles beneficial leads decrease finally total loss karma means ever increasing karmas often wrongly interpreted method reward punishment soul good bad deeds jainism question reward punishment soul master destiny karmas said represent sum total unfulfilled desires soul enable soul experience various themes lives desires ultimately mature necessary supportive conditions required maturity hence soul may transmigrate one life form another countless years taking karmas earned finds conditions bring fruits hence whatever suffering pleasure soul may experiencing account choices made past jainism stresses pure thinking moral behavior apart buddhism perhaps jainism religion invoke fear god reason moral behavior karmic theory jainism operates endogenously tirthankaras attributed absolute godhood jainism thus even tirthankaras go stages emancipation attaining state buddhism give similar
