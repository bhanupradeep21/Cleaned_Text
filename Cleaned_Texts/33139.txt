caused acquired bacterial infection historically often caused haemophilus influenzae type b availability immunization longer h influenzae type b contains capsule helps avoid destroyed macrophages also

staphylococcus bacteria spread respiratory droplets aerosols produced coughing overall incidence epiglottitis decreased incidence cases caused streptococcus pneumoniae increased exact strains streptococcus pneumoniae often covered evidence vaccine prevents epiglottitis many cases epiglottitis reported immunocompromised patients including undergoing cancer treatment hiv variety different bacteria cause disease patients cases often involve candida species fungus though unknown fungus causes significant disease alternate risk factors causes associated infection include burns trauma medical research also identified link epiglottitis crack cocaine underlying disorders immune system graftversushost disease lymphoproliferative disorders also identified contributors increased risk developing infection diagnosis may confirmed direct inspection using laryngoscope although may provoke airway epiglottitis suspected attempts visualize epiglottis using tongue depressor discouraged

evidence infection caused tissue destruction disease called necrotizing epiglottitis feared complication ne bacteria spreading surrounding neck muscles causing cervical necrotizing fasciitis surgical differential diagnosis includes infectious causes acute airway obstruction well acute subacute mechanical causes includes limited conditions effective vaccine hib vaccine available since modern hib

actually improve patient epiglottitis may require urgent tracheal intubation protect tracheal intubation difficult due distorted anatomy profuse secretions spontaneous respiration ideally maintained tracheal intubation surgical airway opening cricothyrotomy may required intubation intravenous antibiotics ceftriaxone possibly vancomycin clindamycin given airway thirdgeneration cephalosporin ceftriaxone usually sufficient since usually effective h influenzae aureus suspected causing disease treatment include ceftaroline clindamycin would provide coverage antibiotic resistant strains
