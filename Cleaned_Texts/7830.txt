toes total middle two forming small pointed cloven hooves remaining two vestigial likely externally visible larger species bisonlike spinal hump supported weight heavy head limbs long radius ulna though fused metatarsals raised foot bones long closely packed limb hoof proportions consistent hoofed animals run well open ground built high wide tall temporal fossa allowed large temporalis muscle extends side cranium coronoid process mandible temporalis large strong also long moment arm thus higher torque due coronoid process shifting forwards reinforced pterygoid zygomatic postorbital areas

problem masseter muscle masseter extends zygomatic arch lower rear corner mandible major component chewing apparatus herbivorous artiodactyls artiodactyls added torque muscle raising jaw joint entelodonts instead expanded rear jaw downwards deep curved flange moreover characteristic jugal flanges entelodonts covered muscle scars inside likely attachment points strengthen masseter modern mammals overdeveloped projections zygomatic arch including xenarthrans kangaroos certain rodents like entelodonts mammals use equivalent projections means providing extra space attachment masseter muscle develop robust cranial bars resist resulting forces pterygoideus muscle follows similar path function masseter also benefited deep flange back function mandibular tubercles certain may also
