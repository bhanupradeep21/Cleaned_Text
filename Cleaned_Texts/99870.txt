kyphoscoliosis describes abnormal curvature spine coronal sagittal planes combination kyphosis scoliosis musculoskeletal disorder often leads issues patients underventilation lungs pulmonary hypertension difficulty performing daytoday activities psychological issues emanating anxiety acceptance among peers especially young patients also seen syringomyelia friedreichs ataxia spina bifida kyphoscoliotic syndrome keds duchenne muscular dystrophy due asymmetric weakening paraspinal muscles person kyphoscoliosis may exhibit abnormal hunch along presence clike shape presence associated disorders like hypertension neurological disorders abnormal gaitcitation needed kyphosis refers excessive convex curvature spine occurring thoracic sacral regions normal thoracic curvature vertebra naturally occurring convex shape angles ranging degrees degrees curvature exceeds degrees condition termed kyphosiscitation needed kyphosis depending extent curvature result several symptoms including breathing digestion difficulties cardiovascular issues neurological issuescitation needed several forms kyphosis including postural related slouching scheuermanns kyphosis found mostly teenagers congenital nutritional osteoporosisinduced posttraumaticcitation neededclarification needed depending type kyphosis extent curvature age patient different treatments may recommended including provision posture correction braces physiotherapy surgery surgery useful patients extensive deformity rate postsurgery complications may higher elderly patientscitation needed scoliosis refers form abnormal spinal curvature persons spine takes c shape scoliosis forms treatments available similar kyphosis including bracing physical therapy various types surgeries typically human spine straight laterally scoliosis patients may curve ten degrees either direction left rightcitation needed kyphoscoliosis may manifest individual different stages life various causes present young age ranging childhood teenage kyphoscoliosis may present birth due congenital abnormalities including spina bifidacitation needed certain infections also lead development kyphoscoliosis vertebral general tuberculosis osteochondrodysplasia disorder related development bone cartilage also cause diseasecitation needed later ages kyphoscoliosis occur patients chronic degenerative diseases like osteoporosis osteoarthritis type incidence usually seen patients years age mainly attributed structural changes spine adjoining tissues sometimes traumatic injury also lead developmentcitation needed many idiopathic occurrences kyphoscoliosis exact cause well known suspected caused genetic factorscitation needed kyphoscoliosis one main criteria kyphoscoliotic syndrome caused mutation gene gene diagnosis confirmed molecular suggested patient meets criteria criteria congenital muscle hypotonia congenital early onset kyphoscoliosis progressive nonprogressive decision choose particular treatment approach depends multiple factors age patient understanding root cause condition ie postural congenital etc risks involved surgery patient addition treatments oxygen may necessary long term patients significant extent curvature mild underlying cause bad posture physical therapy becomes first line treatment physical therapy may also advised causes well delay development abnormal curvatures case elderly patients degenerative disease bones cartilage primary objective physical therapy strengthen spinal tissues either correcting curvature maximum extent possible limiting damage cases underlying reason deformity postural detected bones stop growing back braces used braces provide support muscles bones well apply corrective pressure reduce curvature braces kyphoscoliosis designed become effective abnormal curvatures coronal sagittal planes latest brace design involves use cadcam available developed countries germany efficacy braces correcting curvature issues analyzed studies one study found bracing led successful outcomes patients correlated strongly hours braces however compliance wearing braces period hours physiologically psychologically limiting especially one considers teenage period surgery usually indicated extent deformity large causes issues physiological functions breathing interferes daily activities cosmetically unacceptable adult also advised patient passed age therapies braces longer effective kyphoscoliosis implies patient types curvature decision undergo surgery usually complex may become inevitable deformity begins interfere crucial physiological functions like breathing makes everyday activities extremely painfulcitation needed sometimes patients early adulthood may choose surgery presence deformity causes social issues rejection peers disability prevents working case elderly patients deformity triggered later age factors considered presence underlying disease caused whether progressive decline expected conservative treatments using physiotherapy drugs failed give relief debilitating surgery attempted correct spine arrest progression surgery may include use spinal implants like harrington rod veptr study focused elderly patients found rate complications much higher sample population cases mean age years rate complications high sample study points case elderly patients surgery considered option left disease progression stage quality life degraded extent conservative treatments longer help many surgical approaches spinal deformity correction including anterior posterior anteriorposterior technique popular nowadayswhen posterior vertebral column resection one studies analyzed pvcr also noted benefit using technique called neurogenic motor evoked potential nmep monitoring assisting surgeon avoid
