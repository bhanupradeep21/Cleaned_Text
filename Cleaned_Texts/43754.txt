species description formal scientific description newly encountered species usually form scientific paper purpose give clear description new species organism explain differs species described previously related considered valid species description must follow guidelines established time naming requires adherence respective codes example zoology international code zoological nomenclature iczn plants international code nomenclature algae fungi plants icn viruses international committee taxonomy viruses ictv species description often contains photographs illustrations type material along note deposited publication species described gives new species formal scientific name million species identified described million may actually millions become extinct throughout existence life earth name new species becomes valid available zoological terminology date publication formal scientific description scientist performed necessary research determine discovered organism represents new species scientific results summarized scientific manuscript either part book paper submitted scientific journal scientific species description must fulfill several formal criteria specified nomenclature codes eg selection least one type specimen criteria intended ensure species name clear unambiguous example international code zoological nomenclature states authors exercise reasonable care consideration forming new names ensure chosen subsequent users mind far possible appropriate compact euphonious memorable cause species names written letters latin alphabet many species names based words languages latinized manuscript accepted new species name officially created species name assigned approved generally changed except case error example species beetle anophthalmus hitleri named german collector adolf hitler recently become chancellor clear whether dedication would considered acceptable appropriate today name remains species names chosen many different bases common naming species external appearance origin species name dedication certain person examples would include bat species named two stripes back saccopteryx bilineata frog named bolivian origin phyllomedusa boliviana ant species dedicated actor harrison ford pheidole harrisonfordi scientific name honor person persons known taxonomic eponym eponymic patronym matronym gendered terms number humorous species names also exist literary examples include genus name borogovia extinct dinosaur named borogove mythical character lewis carrolls poem jabberwocky second example macrocarpaea apparata tall plant named magical spell apparate harry potter novels j k rowling seemed appear british naturalist peter scott proposed binomial name nessiteras rhombopteryx ness monster diamondshaped fin loch ness monster soon spotted anagram monster hoax sir peter species frequently named scientists recognition supporters benefactors example genus victoria flowering waterplant named honour queen victoria great britain recently species lemur avahi cleesei named actor john cleese recognition work publicize plight lemurs madagascar nonprofit ecological organizations may also allow benefactors name new species exchange financial support taxonomic research nature conservation german nonprofit organisation biopat patrons biodiversity raised research conservation sponsorship species using individual example system callicebus aureipalatii monkey golden palace named golden palace casino recognition contribution madidi national park bolivia international code nomenclature algae fungi plants discourages practice somewhat recommendation authors forming generic names comply following h dedicate genera persons quite unconcerned botany mycology phycology natural science early biologists often published entire volumes multiplevolume works descriptions attempt catalog known species catalogs typically featured extensive descriptions species often illustrated upon reprinting first large catalogs aristotles history animals published around bc aristotle included descriptions creatures mostly fish invertebrates homeland several mythological creatures rumored live faraway lands manticore ad pliny elder dedicated several volumes natural history description life forms knew exist appears read aristotles work since writes many faraway mythological creatures toward end century konungs skuggsj√° old norse philosophical didactic work featured several descriptions whales seals monsters icelandic seas descriptions brief often erroneous included description mermaid rare islandlike sea monster called hafgufu author hesitant mention beast known today fictitious fear size felt important enough included however earliest recognized species authority carl linnaeus standardized modern taxonomy system beginning systema naturae catalog known species increasing rapidly became impractical maintain single work documenting every species publishing paper documenting single species much faster could done scientists less broadened scopes study example scientist discovered new species insect would need understand plants frogs even insects resemble species would need understand closely related insects formal species descriptions today follow strict guidelines set forth codes nomenclature detailed formal descriptions made scientists usually study organism closely considerable time diagnosis may used instead well description diagnosis specifies distinction new species species necessarily based recent times new species descriptions made without voucher specimens according retrosos following numbers
