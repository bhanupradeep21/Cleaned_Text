myeloid sarcoma chloroma granulocytic extramedullary myeloid tumor solid tumor composed immature white blood called myeloblasts chloroma extramedullary manifestation acute myeloid leukemia words solid collection leukemic cells occurring outside bone marrow chloromas rare exact estimates prevalence lacking uncommonly seen even physicians specializing treatment leukemia chloromas may somewhat common patients following disease however even patients risk factors chloroma remains uncommon complication acute myeloid leukemia rarely chloroma develop sole manifestation relapse apparently successful treatment acute myeloid leukemia keeping general behavior chloromas event must regarded early herald systemic relapse rather localized process one review patients developed isolated chloromas treatment acute myeloid leukemia mean interval bone marrow relapse months range chloromas may occur patients diagnosis myelodysplastic syndrome mds myeloproliferative syndromes mps eg chronic myelogenous leukemia cml polycythemia vera essential thrombocytosis myelofibrosis detection chloroma considered de facto evidence premalignant conditions transformed acute leukemia requiring appropriate treatment example presence chloroma sufficient indicate chronic myelogenous leukemia entered blast crisis phase least one case fusion geneinduced eosinophilic leukemia presenting myeloid sarcoma eosinophilia reported form myeloid sarcoma distinguished highly successful treatment imatinib recommended treatment fusion geneinduced eosinophilic leukemia rather aggressive toxic rarely chloroma occur without known preexisting concomitant diagnosis acute leukemia acute promyelocytic leukemia mdsmps known primary chloroma diagnosis particularly challenging situation see almost reported cases primary chloroma acute leukemia developed shortly afterward median time development acute leukemia months range therefore primary chloroma could considered initial manifestation acute leukemia rather localized process could treated disease development markers indicate progresses acute promyleocytic leukemia treatment tailored form disease chloromas may occur virtually organ tissue common areas involvement skin also known leukemia cutis gums skin involvement typically appears violaceous raised nontender plaques nodules biopsy found infiltrated note leukemia cutis differs sweets syndrome skin infiltrated mature neutrophils paraneoplastic process gum involvement gingival hypertrophy leads swollen sometimes painful gums bleed easily tooth brushing minor trauma tissues involved include lymph nodes small intestine mediastinum lung epidural sites uterus ovaries orbit eye symptoms chloroma sites related anatomic location chloromas may also asymptomatic discovered incidentally course evaluation person acute myeloid leukemia central nervous system involvement described often takes form meningeal leukemia invasion subarachnoid space leukemic cells condition usually considered separately chloroma requires different treatment modalities true chloromas ie solid leukemic tumors central nervous system exceedingly rare described definitive diagnosis chloroma usually requires biopsy lesion question historically even tissue biopsy pathologic misdiagnosis important problem particularly patients without clear preexisting diagnosis acute myeloid leukemia guide pathologist one published series chloroma authors stated patients initially misdiagnosed often malignant however advances diagnostic techniques diagnosis chloromas made reliable traweek et al described use commercially available panel monoclonal antibodies myeloperoxidase accurately diagnose chloroma via immunohistochemistry differentiate nowadays immunohistochemical staining using monoclonal antibodies would mainstay diagnosis increasingly refined use flow cytometry also facilitated accurate diagnosis lesions evidence conflicting prognostic significance chloromas patients acute myeloid leukemia general felt augur poorer prognosis poorer response treatment worse however others reported chloromas associate biologic marker poor prognostic factors therefore independent prognostic case primary isolated choloroma prognosis better described chloromas always considered manifestations systemic disease rather isolated local phenomena treated patient newly diagnosed leukemia associated chloroma systemic chemotherapy leukemia typically used firstline treatment unless indication local treatment chloroma eg compromise spinal cord emerges chloromas typically quite sensitive standard antileukemic chemotherapy allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation considered fit patients suitable available donor long term remissions chloroma persistent completion induction chemotherapy local treatment surgery radiation therapy may considered although neither effect patients presenting primary chloroma typically receive systemic chemotherapy development acute leukemia nearly universal short term detection chloroma patients treated acute leukemia relapse isolated chloroma typically treated systemic therapy relapsed leukemia however relapsed leukemia outcomes unfortunately poor patients preleukemic conditions myelodysplastic syndromes myeloproliferative syndromes develop chloroma often treated transformed acute leukemia condition known chloroma first described british physician burns although term chloroma appear name derived greek word chloros green tumors often green tint due presence myeloperoxidase link chloroma acute leukemia first recognized dock however tumors white gray brown rather green correct term granulocytic sarcoma proposed rappaport since become virtually synonymous term chloroma currently extramedullary manifestation acute myeloid leukemia termed granulocytic sarcoma chloroma specific terms overlap granulocytic sarcoma include recent years term myeloid sarcoma httpsenwikipediaorgwikigranulocyticsarcoma
