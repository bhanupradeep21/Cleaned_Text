gametocyte eukaryotic germ cell divides mitosis gametocytes meiosis gametids gametogenesis male gametocytes called spermatocytes female gametocytes called oocytes development gametogonia primary gametocytes called gametocytogenesis development primary gametocytes secondary gametocytes part gametidogenesis gametogenesis formation production gametes taking place meiosis development maturation sex cells also takes place meiosis gametogenesis also process formation male female gametes occur gonads ovary testis male female produce gametes male gametocytes called spermatocytes female gametocytes called oocytes term gametocyte also used example talking gametocytes species like plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax transmit malariacitation needed gametocytes precursors male female gametes malaria parasites formed human host developmental switch asexual replication erythrocytes although gametocytes responsible clinical symptoms ensure transmission malaria another host upon taking blood meal gametocytes transferred mosquitos midgut lumen differentiate male female gametes complete sexual reproduction successive processes sporogonic development mature sporozoites accumulate vectors salivary gland ready inoculated new host therefore presence gametocytes circulation infected individuals imperative malaria remain endemic given communitycitation needed male female

years left untreated appropriate medications given condition often occurs poorer parts world medications always available people continue experience effects plasmodium vivax years infections take toll poor countries ways many hospitalizations due initial symptoms malaria costly people first affected plasmodium vivax frequently show symptoms high fever chills fatigue profuse sweating symptoms often
