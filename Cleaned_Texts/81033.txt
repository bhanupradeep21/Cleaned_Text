australovenator meaning southern hunter genus megaraptoran theropod dinosaur cenomanian late cretaceousage winton formation dated million years australia known partial cranial postcranial remains described scott hocknull colleagues although additional descriptions analyses continue published complete predatory dinosaur discovered australia suggested australovenator sister taxon fukuiraptor although phylogenetic analyses find derived member megaraptora possibly part main megaraptoridae family australovenator based theropod specimen aodf affectionately nicknamed banjo banjo paterson found

right dentary described time australovenator considered within genus another australian megaraptorid called rapator rapator based metacarpal first described friedrich von huene early prior recognition megaraptora considered either alvarezsaurid intermediate discovery australovenator scientists noted similarity rapator australovenator hocknull et al identified distinguishing characters two taxa based poorly preserved metacarpal holotype agnolin et al reclassified rapator instead finding megaraptoran potentially sister taxon australovenator mentioned megaraptor taxon also preserving metacarpal less similar rapator australovenator however clear differences two latter metacarpals taxa redescribed white et al determined synonymous adding multiple features two potential characters

carcharodontosaurids initial analysis shown sister taxon detailed studies found formed clade several carcharodontosauridlike allosaurs recent phylogenetic analysis suggests australovenator tyrannosauroid like phylogenetic analysis focusing new neovenatorid gualicho found australovenator megaraptorids either allosauroids basal coelurosaurs opposed ankles australovenator fukuiraptor similar australian talus bone known nmvp previously identified belonging allosaurus sp bone likely represents australovenator close relative alternatively bone could belong cladogram follows analysis benson carrano another study published later also found australian theropod rapator megaraptoran extremely similar neovenator chilantaisaurus australovenator fukuiraptor orkoraptor aerosteon

australovenator made topic various research papers studying dynamics theropod appendages study tested range motion australovenators arms using computer models found flexible arms forearms capable
