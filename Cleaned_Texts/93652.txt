single cell gel electrophoresis assay scge also known comet assay uncomplicated sensitive technique detection dna damage level individual eukaryotic cell first developed Ã¶stling johansson later modified singh et al since increased popularity standard technique evaluation dna damagerepair biomonitoring genotoxicity testing involves encapsulation cells lowmeltingpoint agarose suspension lysis

encapsulate cells anchoring place agarose considered osmoticneutral therefore solutions penetrate gel affect cells without cells shifting position vitro study cells would exposed test agent typically uv light ionising radiation genotoxic chemical induce dna damage encapsulated cells calibration hydrogen peroxide usually used provide standardized level dna damage slides immersed solution cause

dna lose compact structure relax expanding cavity agarose electric field applied dna overall negative charge drawn towards positively charged anode undamaged dna strands large leave cavity whereas smaller fragments farther free move given period time therefore amount dna leaves cavity measure amount dna damage cell image analysis measures overall intensity fluorescence whole nucleoid fluorescence migrated dna compares two signals stronger signal migrated dna damage present overall structure resembles comet hence comet assay circular head corresponding undamaged dna remains cavity tail damaged dna brighter longer tail higher level damage comet assay versatile technique detecting damage adjustments protocol used quantify presence wide variety dna altering lesions damage damage
