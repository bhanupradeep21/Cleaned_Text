anosognosia condition person disability cognitively unaware due underlying physical condition anosognosia results physiological damage brain structures typically parietal lobe diffuse lesion frontotemporalparietal area right thus neuropsychiatric disorder deficit selfawareness first named neurologist joseph babinski phenomenologically anosognosia similarities denial psychological defense mechanism attempts made unified anosognosia sometimes accompanied asomatognosia form neglect patients deny ownership body parts limbs term ancient greek ἀ without νόσος nosos disease γνῶσις gnōsis knowledge also considered disorder makes treatment patient difficult since may affect negatively therapeutic relatively little discovered cause condition since initial identification recent empirical studies tend consider anosognosia multicomponential syndrome multifaceted phenomenon manifested failure aware number specific deficits including motor hemiplegia sensory hemianaesthesia hemianopia spatial unilateral neglect memory dementia language receptive aphasia due impairment anatomofunctionally discrete monitoring anosognosia relatively common following different causes brain injury stroke traumatic brain injury example anosognosia hemiparesis weakness one side body onset acute stroke estimated however appear occur conjunction virtually neurological impairment frequent acute chronic phase prominent assessment cases right hemispheric lesions anosognosia related global mental confusion cognitive flexibility major intellectual disturbances mere sensoryperceptual deficitscitation needed condition seem directly related sensory loss thought caused damage higher level neurocognitive processes involved integrating sensory information processes support spatial bodily representations including somatosensory system anosognosia thought related unilateral neglect condition often found damage nondominant usually hemisphere cerebral cortex people seem unable attend sometimes comprehend anything certain side usually left anosognosia selective affected person multiple impairments may seem unaware one handicap appearing fully aware consistent idea source problem relates spatial representation body example anosognosia hemiplegia may occur without intact awareness visuospatial unilateral neglect phenomenon double dissociation indicator domainspecific disorders awareness modules meaning anosognosia brain damage selectively impact selfmonitoring process one specific physical cognitive function rather spatial location also studies showing maneuver vestibular stimulation could temporarily improve syndrome spatial unilateral neglect anosognosia left hemiplegia combining findings hemispheric asymmetry right association spatial unilateral neglect temporal improvement syndromes suggested spatial component underlying mechanism anosognosia motor weakness neural processes could modulated cases anosognosia right hemiplegia left hemisphere damage frequency type anosognosia anosognosia may occur part receptive aphasia language disorder causes poor comprehension speech production fluent incomprehensible sentences patient receptive aphasia correct phonetics errors shows anger disappointment person speaking person fails understand herhim may result brain damage posterior portion superior temporal gyrus believed contain representations

therefore explain occurrence neologistic although largely used describe unawareness impairment brain injury stroke term anosognosia occasionally used describe lack insight shown people anorexia seem recognize mental illness evidence anosognosia related schizophrenia may result frontal lobe clinically anosognosia often assessed giving patients anosognosia questionnaire order assess metacognitive knowledge deficits however neither existing questionnaires applied clinics designed thoroughly evaluating multidimensional nature clinical phenomenon responses obtained via offline questionnaire capable revealing discrepancy awareness observed online task discrepancy noticed patients showed awareness deficits offline responses questionnaire demonstrated reluctance verbal circumlocution asked perform online task example patients anosognosia hemiplegia may find excuses perform bimanual task even though admit paralyzed similar situation happen patients anosognosia cognitive deficits traumatic brain injury monitoring errors tasks regarding memory attention online emergent awareness predicting performance right tasks online anticipatory also occur among patients dementia anosognosia memory deficit prompted dementiarelated words showing possible preattentive processing implicit knowledge memory patients anosognosia may also overestimate performance asked firstperson formed questions thirdperson perspective questions referring assessing causes anosognosia within stroke patients ct scans used assess greatest amount damage found within various areas brain stroke patients mild severe levels anosognosia determined response anosognosia questionnaire linked lesions within temporoparietal thalamic regions compared experience moderate anosognosia none contrast stroke people moderate anosognosia higher frequency lesions involving basal ganglia compared mild severe regard anosognosia neurological patients longterm treatments exist unilateral neglect caloric reflex testing squirting ice cold water left ear known temporarily ameliorate unawareness impairment entirely clear works although thought unconscious shift attention focus caused intense stimulation vestibular system temporarily influences awareness cases anosognosia appear simply disappear time cases last indefinitely normally longterm cases treated cognitive therapy train patients adjust inoperable limbs though believed patients still aware disability another commonly used method use feedback comparing clients selfpredicted performance actual performance task attempt improve neurorehabilitation difficult anosognosia impairs patients desire seek medical aid may also impair ability seek lack awareness deficit makes cooperative mindful work therapist difficult acute phase little done improve awareness time important therapist build therapeutic alliance patients entering phenomenological field reducing frustration confusion since severity changes time single method treatment rehabilitation emerged likely httpsenwikipediaorgwikianosognosia
