procedures carry significant risks benefits inguinal hernia repair become overshadowed risks elective repair longer persons best interest cases additionally certain medical conditions prevent people candidates laparoscopic approaches repair examples techniques repair inguinal hernias fall two broad categories termed open laparoscopic surgeons tailor approach taking account factors experience either techniques features hernia persons anesthetic cost associated either approach varies widely across regions updated guidelines published international endohernia society ies cast doubt comprehensiveness cost comparison studies due part complexity inherent calculating costs across institutionscitation needed ies asserts hospital societal costs lower laparoscopic repairs compared open approaches recommend routine use reusable instruments well improving proficiency surgeons help decrease costs well time spent however example uks national health service spends million year repairing inguinal hernias repaired via open mesh approach done techniques involve approximate incision groin exposed hernia sac returned abdominal cavity excised abdominal wall often reinforced many techniques utilize mesh situations open repairs classified via whether prosthetic mesh utilized whether patients tissue used repair weakness prosthetic repairs enable surgeons repair hernia without causing undue tension surrounding tissues reinforcing abdominal wall repairs undue tension shown increase likelihood hernia recur repairs using prosthetic mesh preferable options patients aboveaverage risk infection cases bowel become strangulated blood supply lost due one large benefit approach lies ability tailor anesthesia persons needs people administered local anesthesia spinal block well general local anesthesia shown cause less pain surgery shorten operating times shorten recovery times well decrease need return hospital however people undergo general anesthesia tend able go home faster experience fewer european hernia society recommends use local anesthesia particularly people ongoing medical repairs utilize mesh usually first recommendation vast majority patients including undergo laparoscopic procedures employ mesh commonly performed able demonstrate better results compared nonmesh approaches utilizing mesh able demonstrate faster return usual activity lower rates persistent pain shorter hospital stays lower likelihood hernia citations options mesh include either synthetic biologic synthetic mesh provides option using heavyweight well lightweight variations according diameter number mesh lightweight mesh shown fewer complications related mesh heavyweight additionally correlated lower rates chronic pain sharing rates hernia recurrence compared heavyweight led
