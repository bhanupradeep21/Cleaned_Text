communication small groups consists three people share common goal communicate collectively achieve small group communication interdependent participants analyze data evaluate nature problems decide provide possible solution procedure additionally small group communication provides strong feedback unique contributions group well critical thinking analysis selfdisclosure small groups communicate interpersonal exchange process information feelings active listening two types small groups primary groups secondary first important research study small group communication performed front live studio audience hollywood california social psychologist robert bales published series books articles early mid research entailed content analysis discussions within groups making decisions human relations problems ie vignettes relationship difficulties within families organizations bales made series important discoveries first group discussion tends shift back forth relatively quickly discussion group task discussion relevant relationship among members believed shifting product implicit attempt balance demands task completion group cohesion presumption conflict generated task discussion causes stress among members must released positive relational talk second task group discussion shifts emphasis opinion exchange attentiveness values underlying decision making decision implication group discussion goes series stages order decisionmaking group known linear phase model third talkative member group tends make percent comments second talkative member matter size groupcitation needed consequence large groups tend dominated one two members detriment others influential discoveries latter linear phase model idea groups performing given type task go series stages order replicated finding four phases discussion example communication researcher b aubrey fisher showed groups going sequentially orientation stage conflict stage stage decision emerges stage decision much research although necessarily fishers two fundamental flaws first group data combined analysis making impossible determine whether differences among groups sequence discussion second group discussion content compared across number stages researcher hypothesized researcher believed four stages discussion way find actually five communication researcher marshall scott poole examined sample groups without making errors noted substantial differences among number order hypothesized groups finding difficulty due task complexity unclear leadership structure poor cohesion act feel need conduct complete discussion thus likely pass stages linear phase model implies whereas groups feeling confident due task simplicity clear leadership structure cohesion likely skip stages apparently deemed unnecessary another milestone study group discussion content early work communication researchers thomas scheidel laura crowell regarding process groups examine individual proposed solutions concluded proposal made groups discuss implied attempt determine comfort level drop lieu different proposal procedure akin survival fittest proposals viewed favorably would emerge later discussion whereas viewed unfavorably would authors referred process spiraling although serious methodological problems work studies led similar conclusions example social psychologist l richard hoffman noted odds proposals acceptance strongly associated arithmetical difference number utterances supporting versus rejecting proposal recent work shown groups differ substantially extent additional developments taken place within group communication theory researchers move away conducting research zerohistory groups toward bona fide groups perspective bona fide group described linda l putnam cynthia stohl fosters sense interdependence among members group along specific boundaries agreed upon members provides researchers model group behavior stays true characteristics displayed naturally occurring groups work relevant social influence groups long history two early examples social psychological research particularly influential first muzafer sherif using autokinetic effect sherif asked participants voice judgments light movement presence others noted judgments tended second series studies solomon asch naive participants asked voice judgments similarity length lines hearing judgments several confederates research assistants posing participants purposely voiced obviously wrong judgment cases participants voiced obviously wrong judgment asked many participants reported originally made correct judgment hearing confederates decided judgments several others confederates trusted consequence studies social psychologists come distinguish two types social influence informational normative see conformity informational influence occurs group members persuaded content read hear accept opinion sherifs study appears example normative influence occurs group members persuaded knowledge majority group members view normative influence confused compliance occurs group members persuaded voice opinions group majority although participants asch studies conformed admitted complied ones mentioned believed majority correct best considered persuaded normative influence culture affects entire communication person within small groups three specific factors affect communication first factor covers whether person prioritizes needs less important groups necessities second important factor power distance degree people accept expect power distributed unequally highpower distance cultures individual low power would disagree individual power contrary lowpower distance cultures everyones input opinions taking account certain decisions third factor affects communication small groups uncertainty avoidance degree tolerance people risk high uncertainty cultures individuals expect prefer rules structurized systems low uncertainty avoidance cultures individuals prefer comfortable constant change scarce rules group conflicts topics people agree different points view move forward task result able overcome conflict might arise six step conflict resolution help overcome small group decision process open vulnerable rely several decision common process small groups incorporate decision making situations starts orientation member starts familiarize socialize members secondly small group members face conflict person shares ideas possible solutions problem session also known brainstorming conflict stage subgroups stronger personalities emerge small group members advance consensus evaluating several ideas group agrees advance lastly closure small group team members agree completely idea start taking end studies sherifs led reasonable conclusion social influence groups leads group members converge average judgment individual members consequence surprise many social psychologists early evidence appeared group decisions often became extreme average individual predisposed originally thought tendency groups riskier members would alone risky shift later found tendency extremity direction based way members individually tended lean discussion group polarization research clearly demonstrated group polarization primarily product persuasion compliance two theoretical explanations group polarization come predominate one based social comparison theory claiming members look one another socially correct side issue find deviant regard shift opinion toward extreme socially correct would example normative influence persuasive arguments theory pat begins notion group member enters discussion aware set items information favoring sides issue lean toward side boasts greater amount information items shared among members aware others unshared one member aware assuming group members lean direction discussion items unshared information supporting direction voiced giving members previously unaware reason lean pat example informational influence although pat strong empirical support would imply unshared items information opposite side favored position would also come discussion canceling tendency polarize research shown group members lean one direction discussion content biased toward side favored group inconsistent pat finding consistent social comparison notions upon discovering group stands members voice items information socially correct side follows explanation group polarization must include information influence normative influence possibility exists majority information known group members combined supports one side issue majority information known member individually supports side issue example imagine member group aware items information supporting job candidate known member items information supporting job candidate b known members would items information supporting candidate supporting candidate b member would aware information supporting b persuasive arguments theory implies items information favoring also come leading member changing mind research indicated occur rather predicted merging pat social comparison theory member would come discussion favoring b discussion would heavily biased toward b group would choose b job circumstance first studied stasser titus known hidden profile likely occur group size increases proportion shared versus unshared items information many methods may used reaching group decisions popular method western culture majority ways make team decisions available firstly voting majority brings quick decision making one reasons widely used second method consensus reaching decisions consensus time consuming allows everyone bring forward opinion third method averaging method requires teammates reach decision compromising reaching decisions minority decision calls subcommittee getting together reaching decisions without whole groupe involved final method authority rule method group leader listens individual group members ideas final say body language form nonverbal communication consisting body pose gestures eye movements paralinguistic cues ie tone voice rate speech humans send interpret signals unconsciously often said human communication consists body language paralinguistic cues communication consists words however albert mehrabian researcher whose work source statistics stated misunderstanding see misinterpretation mehrabians rule physical expressions like waving pointing touching slouching forms nonverbal communication study body movement expression known kinesics humans move bodies communicating research shown helps ease mental effort communication difficult physical expressions reveal many things person using example gestures emphasize point relay message posture reveal boredom great interest touch convey encouragement body language form nonverbal communication involving use stylized gestures postures physiologic signs act cues people humans sometimes unconsciously send receive nonverbal signals time interpersonal space refers psychological bubble imagine exists someone standing far close us research revealed north america four different zones interpersonal space first zone called intimate distance ranges touching eighteen inches apart intimate distance space around us reserve lovers children well close family members friends second zone called personal distance begins arms length away starting around eighteen inches person ending four feet away use personal distance conversations friends chat associates group discussions third zone interpersonal space called social distance area ranges four eight feet away social distance reserved strangers newly formed groups new acquaintances fourth identified zone space public distance includes anything eight feet away zone used speeches lectures theater essentially public distance range reserved larger misunderstandings communication common many different factor way conveying message done language though right wrong way communicate avoiding language barriers jargon bypassing offensive language may prevent misunderstandings group interpersonal discussions one common barriers communication inappropriate use jargon jargon fictive language invented group verbal shorthand also syllabifies group membership used properly problem jargon make words confusing used conceal truth another barrier language bypassing bypassing occurs group members different meanings different words phrases thus miss others meanings overcome risk bypassing important look speaker wants always speaker says third common language barrier offensive language offensive language terminology demeans excludes stereotypes people reason avoiding sexist discriminating labeling talk greatly reduce chances miscommunication remember right wrong way communicate though language difficulties common avoiding barriers like jargon bypassing offensive language greatly reduce chances misunderstood habitual awareness one begin truly understand small groups means social constraints enforced also act arena constraints challenged small groups often contain develop idioculture set shared meanings well negotiate groups able provide rewards punishment line societies httpsenwikipediaorgwikicommunicationinsmallgroups
