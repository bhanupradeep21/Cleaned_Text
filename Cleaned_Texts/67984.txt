multipartite genomes vast majority chromidencoding bacteria single chromid although one compared megaplasmidencoding bacteria containing multiple megaplasmids genus azospirillum contains three species five chromids chromids known single species date chromids also appear common bacteria symbiotic pathogenic relationship organisms high tolerance abiotic chromids discovered species alphaproteobacteria known rhodobacter however formalization concept chromid independent type replicon came several classifications distinguish chromids depending conditions essentiality replication system two hypotheses origins chromids plasmid schism hypotheses according plasmid hypothesis chromids originate plasmids acquired core genes evolutionary time stabilized respective lineages according schism hypothesis chromids well main chromosome originate schism larger earlier chromosome plasmid hypothesis presently widely accepted although may rare cases large replicons originate chromosomal schism one finding holds chromids originated times across bacterial phylogenies lost early era bacterial genomics genomes bacteria thought relatively simple architecture known bacteria circular chromosomes containing crucial genes bacteria additional replicons known plasmids plasmids characteristically small circular dispensable meaning encoded nonessential bacteria genomes studied many alternative forms bacterial genomic architecture began discovered linear chromosomes linear plasmids discovered number species soon bacteria several large replicons discovered leading view bacteria like eukaryotes genome made one first example rhodobacter sphaeroides additional discoveries quickly followed brucella melitensis burkholderia cepacia complex rhizobium meliloti bacillus thuringiensis bacterial species known large replicons separate main chromosome onset discoveries several approaches classifying different components multipartite genomes proposed various terms used describe large replicons main chromosome including simply designating additional chromosomes minichromosomes megaplasmids secondary chromosomes criteria used distinguish replicons typically revolve around features size presence core classification genomic elements chromids proposed previous terms secondary chromosome considered inadequate upon observation replicons contain replication systems plasmids fundamentally different class replicons original definition chromid involves meeting three definition robust authors proposed expectation exceptions would found would blur lines chromids replicons expectation existed general tendency evolutionary lineages produce ambiguous systems resulted wellknown issues formulating widelyencompassing species since classification chromids replicons discovered share features chromids categorized separately one example designated rrnplasmid found clade within bacterial genus aureimonas rrnplasmid contains rrn rrna operon hence name rrn operon found main chromosome main chromosome therefore termed rrnlacking chromosome rlc clade bacteria within aureimonas possess rrnplasmid also termed rlc clade members rlc clade nine replicons main chromosome largest rrnplasmid smallest rrnplasmid also high copy number rlc bacteria small size copy number resembles plasmids moreso chromids rrnplasmid still ahs copies genes rrn operon trnaile distinctive collection features led scientists discovering replicon simply classify rrnplasmid thought separate classification plasmid beyond classifying certain replicons chromids number scientists proposed distinguishing different types chromids one classification distinguishes primary secondary chromids primary chromids defined chromids containing core genes always essential survival bacterium conditions secondary chromids

one largest chromids one burkholderia pseudomallei exceeds million nucleotides size ie megabases chromids frequently lower g c content compared main chromosome although strength association strong chromid also typically g c content within main chromosome reflecting nearing base composition equilibrium main chromosome stably existed within bacterial lineage necessary period time chromids also resemble main chromosome codon usage one analysis found chromids median difference gc content main chromosome compared values megaplasmids chromids least one core gene absent main chromosome main chromosomes contain bulk core genes bacterium whereas plasmids contain core genes example chromid vibrio cholerae contains genes ribosomal subunits chromids disproportionately smaller number essential

chromosomes may universally nearuniversally share hundreds conserved core genes plasmids contain core genes unlike chromids plasmids different species within bacterial genus even different isolates within species share genes partly due common transfer gain loss plasmids transfer bacteria conjugation form horizontal gene transfer chromids passed cell divisions vertically evidence chromids moving horizontal gene observed chromid least one bacterial species could eliminated without making bacterium inviable however bacterium become auxotrophic indicating severe fitness compromise associated loss due stable presence within bacterial genus chromids also feature phylogenetically restricted specific genera examples genera bacteria chromids include deinococcus leptospira cyanothece type cyanobacteria enrichment genera pseudomonadota overall bacterial genome sequencing indicates roughly bacterial species also found bias towards cooccurrence chromid megaplasmid organism chromids also appear frequently phylogenies megaplasmids approximately twice many species despite megaplasmids putative evolutionary source chromids may result tendency organisms lose megaplasmids time compared

replication controlled proteins specifically repa segregation chromid follows different patterns different genera bacteria although typically takes place segregation main far chromids known replicate
