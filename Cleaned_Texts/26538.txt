point plant apical tip shoot sucker seeds presoaked colchicine solution planting since chromosome segregation driven microtubules colchicine alters cellular division inhibiting chromosome segregation meiosis half resulting gametes therefore contains chromosomes half contains double usual number chromosomes ie diploid instead haploid gametes usually lead embryos double usual number chromosomes ie tetraploid instead would fatal higher animal cells plant cells usually welltolerated also frequently results larger hardier fastergrowing general desirable plants normally diploid parents reason type genetic manipulation frequently used breeding plants tetraploid plant crossed diploid plant triploid offspring usually sterile unable produce fertile seeds spores although many triploids propagated vegetatively growers annual triploid plants readily propagated vegetatively produce secondgeneration crop seeds triploid crop need buy triploid seed supplier year many sterile triploid plants
