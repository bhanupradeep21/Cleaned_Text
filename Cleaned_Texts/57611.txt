penetration dentinal tubules effects endodontic treatment broadly organic layer found hard tooth surfaces early studies dentinal walls cavity preparation performed brännström johnson showed presence thin layer debris micrometres mccomb smith first described smear layer observed amorphous layer debris irregular granular surface instrumented dentinal walls using scanning electron microscope sem thin granular microcrystalline layer debris micrometres thick found packed onto canal authors stated standard instrumentation techniques produced canal wall smeared packed debris year mader et al
