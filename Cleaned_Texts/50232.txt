mutations recombinations genetic changes germline may passed offspring change somatic cell need apply somatically reproducing organisms many plants example many varieties plants rosaceae asteraceae taraxacum produce seeds apomictically somatic diploid cells displace ovule early earlier stage genetic thinking clear distinction germline somatic cells example august weismann proposed pointed germline cell immortal sense part lineage reproduced indefinitely since beginning life barring accident could continue however known detail distinction somatic germ cells partly artificial depends particular circumstances internal cellular mechanisms telomeres controls selective application telomerase germ cells stem cells multicellular organisms differentiate somatic germ absence specialised technical human intervention practically simplest multicellular structures organisms somatic cells tend practically totipotent century sponge cells known reassemble new sponges separated forcing germline refer lineage cells spanning many generations example germline links living individual hypothetical last universal common ancestor plants animals descend plants basal metazoans sponges porifera corals anthozoa sequester distinct germline generating gametes multipotent stem cell lineages also give rise ordinary somatic tissues therefore likely germline sequestration first evolved complex animals sophisticated body plans ie bilaterians several theories origin strict germlinesoma distinction setting aside isolated germ cell population early embryogenesis might promote
