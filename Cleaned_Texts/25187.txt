influenza prevention involves taking steps one use decrease chances contracting flu viruses pandemic virus responsible flu pandemic people contract influenza infective second third days infection infectivity lasts around ten children much infectious adults shed virus develop symptoms two weeks transmission influenza modeled mathematically helps predict virus spread influenza spread three main relative importance three modes transmission unclear may contribute spread airborne route droplets small enough people inhale Âµm diameter inhaling one droplet might enough cause although single sneeze releases droplets quite large quickly settle long influenza survives airborne droplets seems influenced levels humidity uv radiation low humidity lack sunlight winter probably aiding influenza virus persist outside body also transmitted contaminated surfaces doorknobs light switches household length time virus persist surface varies virus surviving one two days hard nonporous surfaces plastic metal fifteen minutes dry paper tissues five minutes however virus present mucus protect longer avian influenza viruses survive indefinitely inactivated heating minimum minutes well acids ph according world health organization main route transmission pandemic influenza virus seems similar seasonal influenza via droplets expelled speaking sneezing one whos recommendations keep distance people show symptoms influenzalike illness coughing sneezing trying maintain distance metre recommendations listed american centers disease control prevention cdc agrees spread novel virus thought occur way seasonal flu spreads flu viruses spread mainly person person coughing sneezing people cdc also says person may become infected touches something flu viruses touches eyes nose researchers demonstrated antibodies variant influenza percent workers residents swine farms jiangsu province china residents nearby city detectable antibodies variant reasonably effective ways reduce transmission influenza include good personal health hygiene habits touching eyes nose frequent hand washing soap water alcoholbased hand covering coughs sneezes avoiding close contact sick people staying home sick avoiding spitting also although face masks might help prevent transmission caring mixed evidence beneficial effects smoking raises risk contracting influenza well producing severe disease thus according laws mathematical modelling infectious diseases smokers raise exponential growth rates influenza epidemics may indirectly responsible large percentage influenza casescitation needed since influenza spreads aerosols contact contaminated surfaces surface sanitizing may help prevent alcohol effective sanitizer influenza viruses quaternary ammonium compounds used alcohol sanitizing effect lasts hospitals quaternary ammonium compounds bleach used sanitize rooms equipment occupied patients influenza home done effectively diluted chlorine social distancing strategies used past pandemics closing schools churches theaters slowed spread virus large effect overall death uncertain reducing public gatherings example closing schools workplaces reduce transmission since people influenza may moved one area another measures would also difficult enforce might small numbers people infected isolating sick might reduce risk according studies conducted australia japan screening individuals influenza symptoms airports outbreak effective method infection centers disease control prevention cdcp recommends businesses promote administer annual flu vaccination within workplace additional measures include reducing potential exposure increasing awareness flu symptoms using good cough sneeze etiquette staying home ill frequent hand occupational health safety administration osha recommends controls employers decrease transmission influenza specific occupations increased risk influenza infection include health care education child care air line industry agricultural workers according decrease chance contracting flu virus taking following cdcp lists important ways lower risk watch emergency warning signs need urgent medical attention warning signs includecitation needed pandemic initial demand vaccine greatly outstripped pandemic got underway first vaccine become available united states midoctober million doses weakened livevirus nasal spray formulation form recommended people highest risk complications flu including pregnant women people asthmacitation needed attenuated live virus instead suggested used allow priority groups like health care workers healthy children older allow vaccinated immediately weakened virus might pose heightened risk recommended wait release killedvirus vaccines followed weeks months latercitation needed vaccine uptake

exposure animals especially birds swine increased risk variant influenza infection includes agricultural workers well residents farms individuals keep swine andor birds pets animal exhibitors variant influenza viruses normally infect humans cause human infection virus passed animals humans directly due human human transmission family close contacts agricultural workers increased risk influenza well unfortunately also decreased access health care agricultural communities makes prevention response influenza outbreaks pandemic multiple factors identified increasing vulnerability agricultural
