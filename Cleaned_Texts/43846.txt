largocephalosaurus extinct genus basal saurosphargid marine reptile known middle triassic anisian age guanling formation yunnan guizhou provinces southwestern china contains type species largocephalosaurus polycarpon second species l l polycarpon initially interpreted eosauropterygian sauropterygian closely related european pachypleurosaurs however following additional preparation postcranial skeleton discovery second better known species l qianensis li et al reinterpreted largocephalosaurus basal member family saurosphargidae close relative saurosphargis sinosaurosphargis according li et al saurosphargids belong sauropterygia although closely related forming sister type species largocephalosaurus l polycarpon known holotype wigm spc v nearly complete articulated skull skeleton missing tail measuring centimetres ft length housed wuhan institute geology mineral recourses spc v collected member ii guanling formation dating pelsonian substage midlate anisian stage early middle triassic million years ago luoping county yunnan l polycarpon studied wigm three specimens later named l qianensis prepared geological museum peking university institute vertebrate paleontology paleoanthropology three specimens collected km northeast type locality l polycarpon xinmin district panxian county southwestern guizhou province like spc v came member ii guanling formation dating late anisian specimens ivpp v nearly complete skeleton exposed view back tail missing chosen represent holotype l qianensis two specimen referable l qianensis include skull neck vertebra view incomplete postcranial skeleton view back portion mandible preserved missing specimens largocephalosaurus came lagerstätte discovered geological mapping project diverse record marine life called luoping biota yielded apart largocephalosaurus various invertebrates fish basal ichthyosaurs atopodentatus advanced saurosphargid sinosaurosphargis several species eosauropterygian including pachypleurosaurs largocephalosaurus first described named long cheng xiaohong chen xiongwei zeng yongjian cai type species largocephalosaurus polycarpon generic name said derived latin largus meaning large cephalus meaning head greek sauros meaning lizard common suffix genus names extinct reptiles classical latin proper word head ancient greek kephalē κεφαλή used kephalos κέφαλος first name various greek mythological historical figures rendered latin specific name polycarpon said derived latin poly meaning many plus carpon meaning ossified carpals reference eleven carpal ossifications forelimb l polycarpon shows resulting unique hand bone formula classical latin proper word many ancient greek used word polys second species l qianensis named chun li dayong jiang long cheng xiaochun wu olivier rieppel specific name derived qian shortened alternative spelling guizhou plus latin suffix ensis meaning reference different occurrence species specimens l qianensis discovered guizhou province known specimen l polycarpon came neighboring yunnan largocephalosaurus relatively large saurosphargid type specimen second species l qianensis measuring ft total body lengtha basal saurosphargid less modified morphologically archetypal diapsid reptile compared advanced saurosphargids like however even original description interpreted eosauropterygian sauropterygian several traits later identified saurosphargid noted include back vertebrae show elongated distally expanded transverse projections broadened flattened chest yet largocephalosaurus unlike saurosphargids retains elongate body shape welldeveloped supratemporal fenestra oval suborbital fenestra although much reduced compared nonsaurosphargids incomplete dorsal osteoderm carapace additionally advanced saurosphargids saurosphargis sinosaurosphargis broader flatter rib baskets also transverse projections back vertebrae proximal portions chest ribs much robust largocephalosaurus much wider spacing differences include presence three four teeth premaxilla exclusion external nostril outline elongated frontal bone backside facing projection presence row large osteoderms top neural spines midline partial osteoderm shield similarly rounded coracoid pubis bone coracoid foramen obturator fenestra present open due fact holotype skeleton l polycarpon still partially prepared li et al refrained providing revised description nevertheless least morphological differences second species l qianensis observed include paired parietal bone large pineal foramen oval eyesockets presence presacral vertebrae neck back vertebrae two sacral vertebrae l qianensis additionally distinct palatal fossa exists upper surface palatine bone l qianensis retroarticular process short back osteoderms l qianensis elongated granular shape covering sides body finally shoulder portion chest ribs broadened hooklike projection lacking crest upper surface like one seen l largocephalosaurus first included phylogenetic analysis original description due lack preparation holotype especially postcranial portion fact saurosphargids stem sauropterygians like eusaurosphargis helveticosaurus included l polycarpon recovered position closely related wumengosaurus within eosauropterygia basal european pachypleurosaurs nothosaurids however following additional preparation postcranial skeleton discovery second better known species l qianensis li et al presented analysis includes eusaurosphargis helveticosaurus known saurosphargid species following cladogram simplified results removal inclusion ichthyopterygia found affect topology switching positions eusaurosphargishelveticosaurus thalattosauriformes clades altering positions several taxa within eosauropterygia archosauromorpha
