measures changing driver behavior changing wildlife three potential ways change driver behavior primary methods focus changing driver attitude increasing public awareness helping people understand reducing roadkill benefit community second potential way make people aware specific hazardous areas use signage rumble strips lighting third potential way slow traffic physically psychologically using chicanes speed bumps three categories altering wildlife behavior primary methods discourage wildlife loitering roadsides reducing food water resources making road surfaces lighter color may make wildlife feel exposed roadway second methods discouraging wildlife crossing roads least cars present using equipment ultrasonic whistles reflectors fencing third mechanisms provide safe crossing like
