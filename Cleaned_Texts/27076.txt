veterinary surgery surgery performed animals veterinarians whereby procedures fall three broad categories orthopaedics bones joints muscles soft tissue surgery skin body cavities cardiovascular system giurogenitalrespiratory tracts neurosurgery advanced surgical procedures joint replacement total hip knee elbow replacement fracture repair stabilization cranial cruciate ligament deficiency oncologic cancer surgery herniated disc treatment complicated gastrointestinal urogenital procedures kidney transplant skin grafts complicated wound management minimally invasive procedures arthroscopy laparoscopy thoracoscopy performed veterinary surgeons registered jurisdiction general practice veterinarians perform routine surgeries neuters minor mass excisions also perform additional procedures goal veterinary surgery may quite different pets farm animals former situation close human beings benefit patient important factor latter economic benefit important united states canada europe veterinary surgery one veterinary specialties recognized american veterinary medical respectively european board veterinary wishing become board certified must undergo oneyear clinical internship program followed three years intensive training residency program direct supervision board certified veterinary surgeons including performance large number surgical procedures categories abdominal surgery surgical treatment angular limb deformities arthroscopic surgery surgery foot fracture fixation ophthalmic surgery urogenital surgery upper respiratory surgery etc minimum requirements training met residents required pass rigorous certification examination admitted members diplomates american college veterinary european college veterinary anesthesia animals many similarities human anesthesia differences well local anesthesia primarily used wound closure removal small tumors lidocaine mepivacaine bupivacaine commonly used local anesthetics used veterinary sedation without general anesthesia used involved procedures sedatives commonly used include acepromazine hydromorphone midazolam diazepam xylazine medetomidine agonists like xylazine medetomidine especially useful reversed xylazine yohimbine medetomidine atipamezole xylazine approved use dogs cats horses deer elk united states medetomidine approved surgeries ruminants performed regional anesthesia general anesthesia commonly used animals major surgery animals often premedicated intravenously intramuscularly sedative analgesic anticholinergic agent dogs frequently receive buprenorphine acepromazine next step induction usually intravenous drug dogs cats commonly receive thiopental longer allowed uk ketamine diazepam tiletamine zolazepam usually cats andor propofol alfaxalone steroid anaesthetic used many practices uk induce anaesthesia cats sometimes dogs similar physiological effect different composition withdrawn horses commonly receive thiopental following induction animal intubated endotracheal tube maintained gas anesthetic common gas anesthetics use veterinary medicine isoflurane enflurane halothane although desflurane sevoflurane becoming popular due rapid induction elective procedures performed nonemergency basis involve immediately lifethreatening conditions contrast emergency procedures one common elective surgical procedures animals render animals incapable reproducing neutering animals describes spaying castration also please see castration spay medical term ovariectomy ovariohysterectomy completely remove ovaries often uterus female animal dog accomplished ventral midline incision abdomen cat accomplished either ventral midline abdominal incision flank incision common uk ovariectomy ligatures placed blood vessels ovary organ removed ovariohysterectomy ligaments uterus ovaries broken blood vessels ligated organs removed body wall subcutis skin sutured castrate medical term orchiectomy remove testicles male animal different techniques used depending type animal including ligation spermatic cord suture material placing rubber band around cord restrict blood flow testes crushing cord specialized instrument like burdizzo neutering usually performed prevent breeding prevent unwanted behavior decrease risk future medical problems neutering also performed emergency procedure treat certain reproductive diseases like pyometra testicular torsion used treat ovarian uterine testicular cancer also recommended cases cryptorchidism prevent torsion malignant transformation testicles please see spaying neutering information advantages disadvantages procedure laser surgery offers number including reduced risk infection less postoperative pain swelling reduced bleeding improved visibility surgical field better hemostasis visibility cases minimize need anesthesia andor reduce overall surgical time common elective surgical procedures united states declawing cats onychectomy earcropping dogs tail docking dogs horses dairy cattle livestock dehorning cattle sheep goats procedures controversial recently debated among breeders veterinary organizations animal welfare scientists controversy different procedure issues arise based reasons perform procedure differing opinions techniques methods perceived longterm benefits individual animals development alternatives declawing example consists removal distal phalanges using either scalpel scissors laser typically performed prevent property damage house cats may also performed purebred dogs meet certain show requirements procedures illegal countries uk declawing illegal tail docking allowed working dogs face ethical challenges others common dental surgical procedures older dogs cats tumors common occurrence may involve multiple body systems skin musculoskeletal gastrointestinal tract urogenital tract reproductive tract cardiovascular system spinal cord peripheral nerves spleen lining body cavities common skin tumors include lipomas mast cell tumors melanomas squamous cell carcinomas basal cell carcinomas fibrosarcomas histiocytomas skin tumors removed either simple excisions excisions needing reconstructive plastic surgery common oral tumors include melanomas fibrosarcomas squamous cell carcinomas removed much surrounding tissue possible including parts mandible maxilla types cancer requiring surgery include osteosarcomas stomach intestinal tumors splenic masses urinary bladder tumors common ophthalmic surgeries animals include common orthopedic surgeries animals include common cardiology surgeries animals include caesarean sections commonly performed dogs cats horses sheep cattle usually done emergency surgery due difficulties birthing process certain dog breeds bulldogs often need surgery size puppys head relative width bitchs birth canal gastric dilatation volvulus bloat common condition dogs stomach fills gas become torsed requires immediate surgical intervention prevent necrosis stomach wall death dog surgery stomach deflated put back normal position gastropexy may performed whereby stomach attached body wall prevent condition recurring splenectomy partial gastrectomy may also required cystotomy surgical opening urinary bladder commonly performed dogs cats remove bladder stones tumors bite wounds animals rarely humans common occurrence wounds objects animal may step run also common usually wounds simple lacerations easily cleaned sutured sometimes using local anesthetic bite wounds however involve compressive tensile forces addition shearing forces cause separation skin underlying tissue avulsion underlying muscles deep puncture wounds especially prone infection deeper wounds assessed anesthesia explored lavaged debrided primary wound closure used remaining tissue healthy free contamination small puncture wounds may left open bandaged allowed heal without surgery third alternative delayed primary closure involves bandaging reevaluation surgery three five wounds occurring udder teats cows difficult repair due difficult access sensitivity organ deep anaesthesia may applied variety nonedible objects commonly swallowed dogs cats cattle foreign bodies cause obstruction gastrointestinal tract causing severe vomiting resulting electrolyte imbalances stomach gastrotomy intestine enterotomy surgically opened remove foreign body necrotic intestine removed enterectomy repaired intestinal anastomosis foreign bodies also removed endoscopy although requires general anesthesia require surgery significantly decreases recovery however endoscopic foreign body retrieval anatomically limited objects lodged esophagus stomach colon condition cattle known hardware disease httpsenwikipediaorgwikiveterinarysurgery
