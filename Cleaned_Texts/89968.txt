evolutionary psychologists using knowledge environment evolutionary adaptedness eea generate hypotheses regarding possible psychological adaptations part critique scientific basis evolutionary psychology often assumes human evolution occurred uniform environment whereas critics suggest know little environment probably multiple environments homo sapiens evolve explaining specific traits

stewartwilliams argues response claims evolutionary psychology hypotheses unfalsifiable claims logically incoherent stewartwilliams argues evolutionary psychology hypotheses cant falsified neither could competing explanations alternative explanations eg sociocultural hypotheses proven true would automatically falsify competing evolutionary psychology hypothesis competing explanations true evolutionary psychology hypothesis must false thus edward hagen observes critics evolutionary psychology often argue trait could evolved adaptation byproduct impossible determine since evolved past environment thus evolutionary psychology hypotheses traits origin untestable according hagen critics using argument flawed understanding science hagen argues science fundamentally abductivist methodology eg inference best explanation hagen argues hypotheses compete provide best explanation phenomenon best measured via criteria like predicting new surprising observations parsimony coherence abduction require scientist provide direct evidence every single prediction evolutionary psychology hypotheses make predictions thus compete hypotheses explain traits hagen argues critics conclude evolutionary psychology explanations mental traits true cant tested reasons false conclusion draw even evolutionary psychology hypotheses could tested mean false means evidence could acquired traits dont exist evolutionary dominic murphy explains one common objections evolutionary psychology time machine argument argument evolutionary psychology make predictions things see modern world evolutionary psychology hypothesis true many alternate explanations origin trait would also predict phenomenon eg trait evolving byproduct could predict evidence trait evolving adaptation therefore potentially infinite number alternative historical explanations possible thus without time machine impossible determine possible explanation evidence seen modern day correct murphy argues argument flawed multiple grounds firstly explanation trait forwarded prediction would see modern day made based explanation one propose alternative explanations instead alternative explanations require testable predictions forwarded preferably multiple different predictions addition explanations may predict evidence thus murphy argues one explanation predicts great deal evidence modern day observations alternative explanations struggle explain reasonable confidence former explanation addition murphy argues time machine argument applied sciences would lead absurd results murphy observes cosmologists confirmed predictions big bang studying available astronomical evidence current understanding particle physics need time machine travel back beginning universe similarly geologists physicists investigating hypothesis asteroid impact caused extinction dinosaurs looking modern day evidence murphy thus concludes onus sceptics prove evolutionary psychology allegedly untestable time machine grounds historical sciences methods judged across board singled ridicule one similar argument made andrew goldfinch argued entire criticism due issue underdetermination many rival explanations potentially accommodate phenomenon making difficult discern explanation correct one furthermore one also challenge interpretation experiments results revise explanation accommodate novel fact even question reliability experiments conducted however goldfinch argues ubiquitous problem science unique evolutionary psychology clear seen criticism field would dismissed elsewhere lastly goldfinch argues one way distinguish competing explanations make distinction programmes makes new predictions discovers novel facts programmes simply accommodate fresh discoveries programmes programmes actually

plausible alternative hypothesis adaptationist hypotheses logically plausible empirical evidence exists support thus reasonable support evolutionary psychologists adaptationist steven gangstead argues demonstrating trait beneficial sufficient prove adaptation rather show something adaptation must shown exhibits special design special design trait performs function function meaning increases reproductive fitness organism effectively difficult conceive alternative scenario trait would evolved gangstead observes eye extreme example highly effective function seeing yet difficult conceive scenario would evolved one selected optical properties thereby function sight evolutionary psychologists also argued lack special design evidence trait byproduct rather adaptation example found men find womens scent attractive fertile phase infertile luteal phase men finding scent attractive may adaptation evidence women possess adaptation smell better fertile instead likely byproduct changing hormone levels men selected detect differently evolutionary psychologists consider evidence trait adaptation many features improbably well suited solving ancestral adaptive problem phenotypic

exaptationist spandrel hypotheses additional evidentiary burden compared adaptationist hypotheses must identify later coopted functionality original adaptational functionality well caused trait coopted new function sufficient simply propose alternative exaptationist spandrel hypotheses adaptationist one rather evidentiary burdens must leda cosmides argues raising objection trait could spandrel meaningless organism contains potentially infinite number spandrels instead one must demonstrate trait spandrel rather simply suggesting could berry et al argue critics adaptationist hypotheses often guilty uncritically accepting alternative explanation provided adaptationist one furthermore authors argue critics insist adapative function refer original adaptive function trait

coopted new purpose maintains within species increases reproductive success members species versus may lost reason nature blind original intended function durrant et al agree alternative explanations adaptation considered authors argue issue adaptationist explanations underdetermination theory underdetermined evidence used support could equally used support one competing theories underdetermination issue science due problem induction great majority cases truth data deductively entail truth issue general science sciences deal unobserved entities processes evolutionary psychology particularly vulnerable even theory make predictions predictions necessarily confirm hypothesis competing theory could also predict authors argue prediction novel facts necessarily mean acceptance theory historically speaking observing einsteins theory general relativity famously held accepted predicted light would bend around black holes unknown time neither einstein many

explanatory coherence criteria suggested include explanatory breadth theory explains great range facts simplicity theory requires fewest special assumptions analogy theory supported analogy theories scientists already find credible thus criticism adaptationist theories must demonstrate alternative theory offers greater explanatory coherence adaptationist one aspect evolutionary psychology finding traits shown universal humans many critics pointed many traits considered universal stage evolutionary psychologists often turn dependent cultural particular historical critics allege evolutionary psychologists tend assume current cultural context represents universal human nature example anthropologist susan mckinnon argues evolutionary theories kinship rest ethnocentric presuppositions
