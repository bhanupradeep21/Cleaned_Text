copper deficiency hypocupremia defined either insufficient copper meet needs body serum copper level normal symptoms may include fatigue decreased red blood cells early greying hair neurological problems presenting numbness tingling muscle weakness neurodegenerative syndrome copper deficiency recognized time ruminant animals commonly known copper deficiency manifest parallel vitamin nutritional common cause copper deficiency remote gastrointestinal surgery gastric bypass surgery due malabsorption copper zinc toxicity hand menkes disease genetic disorder copper deficiency involving wide variety symptoms often copper required functioning many enzymes cytochrome c oxidase complex iv mitochondrial electron transport chain ceruloplasmin cuzn superoxide dismutase amine enzyme catalyze reactions oxidative phosphorylation iron transportation antioxidant free radical scavenging neutralization neurotransmitter synthesis diets vary amount copper contain may provide mgday diet elderly may lower copper content recommended daily dietary copper found whole grain cereals legumes oysters organ meats particularly liver cherries dark chocolate fruits leafy green vegetables nuts poultry prunes soybean products like copper deficiency many hematological consequences myelodysplasia anemia low white blood cell count low count neutrophils type white blood cell often called first line defense immune copper deficiency long known cause myelodysplasia blood profile indicators possible future leukemia development copper deficiency associated neurological manifestations like sensory ataxia irregular coordination due proprioceptive loss spasticity muscle weakness rarely visual loss due damage peripheral nerves myelopathy disease spinal cord rarely optic neuropathymedical citation needed characteristic hematological blood effects copper deficiency anemia may microcytic normocytic macrocytic thrombocytopenia low blood platelets peripheral blood bone marrow aspirate findings copper deficiency mimic myelodysplastic bone marrow aspirate conditions may show dysplasia blood cell precursors presence ring sideroblasts erythroblasts containing multiple iron granules around nucleus unlike cases myelodysplastic syndrome bone marrow aspirate copper deficiency characteristically shows cytoplasmic vacuoles within red white cell precursors karyotyping cases copper deficiency reveal cytogenetic features characteristic myelodysplastic anemia neutropenia typically resolve within six weeks copper copper deficiency cause wide variety neurological problems including myelopathy peripheral neuropathy optic copper deficiency myelopathy humans discovered first described schleper stuerenburg described patient history gastrectomy partial colonic resection presented severe tetraparesis painful paraesthesias found imaging dorsomedial cervical cord hyperintensity upon analysis found patient decreased levels serum coeruloplasmin serum copper csf copper patient treated parenteral copper patients paraesthesias resolve since discovery heightened increasing awareness copperdeficiency myelopathy treatment disorder reviewed kumar patients typically present difficulty walking gait difficulty caused sensory ataxia irregular muscle coordination due dorsal column degeneration spinal cord patients ataxic gait problems balancing display unstable wide walk often feel tremors torso causing sideways jerks brain mri often increased signalling posterior columns spinal cord patients myelopathy caused copper signalling often indicator kind neurodegeneration changes spinal cord mri involving thoracic cord cervical cord sometimes copper deficiency myelopathy often compared subacute combined degeneration subacute combined degeneration also degeneration spinal cord instead vitamin deficiency cause spinal scd also high signalling intensities posterior column copper deficient patient mri another common symptom copper deficiency peripheral neuropathy numbness tingling start extremities sometimes progress radially inward towards advances clinical neuroscience rehabilitation acnr published case report patient progressively worsened neurological symptoms included diminished upper limb reflexes abnormal lower limb reflexes sensation light touch pin prick diminished waist vibration sensation lost sternum markedly reduced proprioception sensation selfs many people neurological effects copper deficiency complain similar identical symptoms numbness tingling poses danger elderly increases risk falling injuring peripheral neuropathy become disabling leaving patients reliant wheelchairs walking canes mobility lack correct diagnosis rarely copper deficiency cause major disabling symptoms deficiency present extensive amount time disabling conditions manifest patients copper deficiency shown signs vision color vision usually lost peripheral views bilateral vision loss usually optical coherence tomography oct shows nerve fiber layer loss patients suggesting vision loss color vision loss secondary optic neuropathy bariatric surgery common cause copper bariatric surgery gastric bypass surgery often used weight control morbidly obese disruption intestines stomach surgery cause absorption difficulties regards copper also iron vitamin many symptoms copper deficiency myelopathy may take decades develop increased consumption zinc another cause copper zinc often used prevention treatment common colds sinusitis inflammation sinuses due infection ulcers sickle cell disease celiac disease memory impairment zinc found many common vitamin supplements also found denture recently several cases copper deficiency myeloneuropathy found caused prolonged use denture creams containing high quantities literature review found two cases copper deficiency myelopathy secondary parenteral zinc supplementation chronic metallic zinc core united states currency coins including coppercoated pennies people ingest large number coins elevated zinc levels leading zinctoxicityinduced copper deficiency associated neurological symptoms case woman diagnosed schizophrenia woman consumed coins started show neurological symptoms unsteady gait mild menkes disease congenital disease cause copper menkes disease hereditary condition caused defective gene involved metabolism copper menkes disease involves wide variety symptoms including floppy muscle tone seizures abnormally low temperatures peculiar steel color hair feels menkes disease usually fatal disease children dying within first ten years rarely suggested excess iron supplementation causes copper deficiency another rarer cause copper deficiency celiac disease probably due malabsorption still large percentage around cases unknown copper functions prosthetic group permits electron transfers key enzymatic pathways like electron transport copper integrated enzymes cytochrome c oxidase involved cellular respiration oxidative phosphorylation cuzn dismutase involved antioxidant defense many listed table several hypotheses role copper neurological manifestations suggest disruptions cytochrome c oxidase also known complex iv electron transport chain responsible spinal cord another hypothesis copper deficiency myelopathy caused disruptions methylation methylation cycle causes transfer methyl group methyltetrahydrofolate range macromolecules suspected copper dependent enzyme methionine cycle able produce purines component dna nucleotide bases also myelin spinal cord surrounded layer protective protein coating called myelin see figure methionine synthase enzyme disrupted methylation decreases myelination spinal cord impaired cycle ultimately causes anemia caused copper deficiency thought caused impaired iron transport hephaestin copper containing ferroxidase enzyme located duodenal muscosa oxidizes iron facilitates transfer across basolateral membrane another iron transporting enzyme enzyme required mobilize iron reticuloendothelial cell ceruloplasmin also oxidizes iron ferrous state ferric form required iron impairment copper dependent enzymes transport iron may cause secondary iron deficiency another speculation cause anemia involving mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase complex iv electron transport chain studies shown animal models impaired cytochrome c oxidase failed synthesize heme ferric iron normal lower rate enzyme might also cause excess iron clump giving heme unusual unusual pattern also known ringed sideroblastic anemia cells cause neutropenia still unclear however arrest maturing myelocytes neutrophil precursors may cause neutrophil zinc intoxication may cause anemia blocking absorption copper stomach zinc also upregulates expression chelator metallothionein enterocytes majority cells intestinal since copper higher affinity metallothionein zinc copper remain bound inside enterocyte later eliminated mechanism exploited therapeutically achieve negative balance wilsons disease involves excess diagnosis copper deficiency may supported persons report compatible signs symptoms findings thorough physical examination supportive laboratory evidence low levels copper ceruloplasmin serum consistent diagnosis low hour urine copper additional supportive bloodwork findings also include neutropenia mri imaging may demonstrate increased signal dorsal lemniscus copper deficiency rare disease often misdiagnosed several times physicians concluding deficiency copper differential diagnosis copper serum test bone marrow biopsy usually conclusive diagnosing copper deficiency average patients diagnosed copper deficiency around years first symptoms reported copper deficiency treated either oral copper supplementation intravenous zinc intoxication present discontinuation zinc may sufficient restore copper levels back normal usually slow people zinc intoxication usually take copper supplements addition ceasing zinc consumption hematological manifestations often quickly restored back progression neurological symptoms stopped sometimes improved appropriate treatment residual neurological disability
