fungiculture cultivation fungi mushrooms cultivating fungi yield foods include mostly mushrooms medicine construction materials products mushroom farm involved business growing fungi word also commonly used refer practice cultivation fungi animals leafcutter ants termites ambrosia beetles marsh periwinkles mushrooms fungi require different conditions plants optimal growth plants develop photosynthesis process converts atmospheric carbon dioxide carbohydrates especially cellulose sunlight provides energy source plants mushrooms derive energy growth materials growth medium biochemical decomposition processes mean light irrelevant requirement since fungi use light signal however materials growth must already present growth medium mushrooms grow well relative humidity levels around substrate moisture levels instead seeds mushrooms reproduce spores spores contaminated airborne microorganisms interfere mushroom growth prevent healthy crop mycelium actively growing mushroom culture placed sterilized grains rye induced grow grains called inoculation inoculated grains plugs referred spawn spores another inoculation option less developed established mycelium since also contaminated easily manipulated laboratory conditions laminar flow cabinet mushroom growing techniques require correct combination humidity temperature substrate growth medium inoculum spawn starter culture wild harvests outdoor log inoculation indoor trays provide elements mushrooms grown logs placed outdoors stacks piles done hundreds sterilization performed method since production may unpredictable seasonal less commercially sold mushrooms produced tree logs inoculated spawn allowed grow would wild conditions fruiting pinning triggered seasonal changes briefly soaking logs cool shiitake oyster mushrooms traditionally produced using outdoor log technique although controlled techniques indoor tray growing artificial logs made compressed substrate shiitake mushrooms grown forested canopy considered nontimber forest northeastern united states shiitake mushrooms cultivated variety hardwood logs including oak american beech sugar maple hophornbeam softwood used cultivate shiitake mushrooms resin softwoods oftentimes inhibit growth shiitake mushroom making impractical growing order produce shiitake mushrooms metre hardwood logs diameter ranging cm inoculated mycelium shiitake fungus inoculation completed drilling holes hardwood logs filling holes cultured shiitake mycelium inoculum sealing filled holes hot wax inoculation logs placed closed canopy coniferous stand left incubate months incubation complete logs soaked water hours days soaking shiitake mushrooms begin fruit harvested fully indoor mushroom cultivation commercial crop first developed caves france caves provided stable environment temperature humidity year round technology controlled growth medium fungal spawn brought uk late caves created quarrying near areas bath growing indoors provides ability control light temperature humidity excluding contaminants pests allows consistent production regulated spawning midtwentieth century typically accomplished windowless purposebuilt buildings largescale commercial production indoor tray growing common commercial technique followed containerized growing tray technique provides advantages scalability easier harvesting series stages mushroom farming widely used commercial species agaricus bisporus composting fertilizing spawning casing pinning add fertilizer additives remove unwanted must avoid damaging allow mycelium grow substrate form colony depends substrate dimensions composition finished mycelium propagated entire substrate layer add top covering dressing colonized substrate fertilizing nitrogen increases yields induces pinning adjusting temperature humidity also affect number pins mushroom size complete sterilization required performed composting cases pasteurization step included allow beneficial microorganisms remain growth specific time spans temperatures required stages vary respective species variety substrate composition geometry growth substrate also affect ideal times temperatures pinning trickiest part mushroom grower since combination carbon dioxide concentration temperature light humidity triggers mushrooms towards point rhizomorphs mushroom pins appear mycelium amorphous mass spread throughout growth substrate unrecognizable mushroom carbon dioxide concentration becomes elevated vegetative growth phase mycelium sealed gasresistant plastic barrier bag traps gases produced growing mycelium induce pinning barrier opened ruptured concentration decreases ambient atmospheric oyster mushroom farming rapidly expanding around many parts world increased consciousness nutritional value increased market demand making mushroom cultivation one sought businesses among farming communitiescitation needed oyster mushroom grown substrate comprises sterilized wheat paddy straw even used coffee require much space compared crops per unit production profit extracted comparatively higher oyster mushrooms also grown indoors kits commonly form box containing growing medium mushroom production converts raw natural ingredients mushroom tissue notably carbohydrate ideal substrate contain enough nitrogen carbohydrate rapid mushroom growth common bulk substrates include several following mushrooms metabolize complex carbohydrates substrate glucose transported mycelium needed growth energy used main energy source concentration growth medium exceed ideal fruiting closer parasitic insects bacteria fungi pose risks indoor production sciarid phorid flies may lay eggs growth medium hatch maggots damage developing mushrooms growth stages bacterial blotch caused pseudomonas bacteria patches trichoderma green mold also pose risk fruiting stage pesticides sanitizing agents available use biological controls sciarid phorid flies also trichoderma green mold affect mushroom production example

people becoming interested field rapidly increasing possibility creating viable business urban environments using coffee grounds appealing many entrepreneurscitation needed since mushroom cultivation subject available school urban farmers learned time master mushroom cultivation time consuming costly missed revenue reason numerous companies europe specialized mushroom cultivation offering training entrepreneurs organizing events build community share knowledge also show potential positive impact business courses mushroom cultivation attended many countries around europe education available
