curare kʊˈrɑːri kjʊˈrɑːri kuurahree kyuurahree common name various alkaloid arrow poisons originating plant extracts used paralyzing agent indigenous peoples central south america hunting therapeutic purposes curare becomes active contaminates wound poisons cause weakness skeletal muscles administered sufficient dose eventual death asphyxiation due paralysis diaphragm curare prepared boiling bark one dozens plant sources leaving dark heavy paste applied arrow dart heads medicine curare used treatment tetanus strychnine poisoning paralyzing agent surgical procedures word curare derived wurari carib language macusi origins carib phrase mawa cure meaning mawa vine scientifically known strychnos toxiferacitation needed curare also known among indigenous peoples ampi woorari woorara woorali wourali wouralia ourare ourari urare urari uirary noun curare confused latin verb curare heal cure take care pharmacologist rudolf boehm sought classify various alkaloid poisons based containers used preparation believed curare could categorized three main types seen however useful appeared became rapidly outmoded richard gill plant collector found indigenous peoples began use variety containers curare preparations henceforth invalidating boehms basis manske also observed alkaloids results early work inaccurate complexity variation composition mixtures alkaloids involved impure noncrystalline alkaloids almost curare preparations complex mixtures many physiological actions attributed early curarizing preparations undoubtedly due impurities particularly alkaloids present curare preparations considered two main types chondrodendron members menispermaceae family strychnos genus loganiaceae strychnaceae family preparations may contain alkaloids majority secondary curare used paralyzing poison many south american indigenous people since expensive used warfare curare mainly used prey shot arrows blowgun darts dipped curare leading asphyxiation owing inability victims respiratory muscles contract particular poison used kalinago indigenous people lesser antilles caribbean tips addition yagua people indigenous colombia northeastern peru commonly used toxins via blowpipes target prey paces due popularity among indigenous people means paralyzing prey certain tribes would create monopolies curare thus curare became symbol wealth among indigenous populations sir walter raleigh mentioned arrow poison book discovery large rich beautiful empire guiana relates travels trinidad guayana though poison described possibly abbe felix fontana discovered acted voluntary muscles rather

suggesting use muscle relaxants drugs similar curare increased death due anesthesia nearly refuted modern anesthetists disposal variety muscle relaxants use anesthesia ability produce muscle
