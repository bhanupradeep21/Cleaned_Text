geoengineering would help environment many secular even nonsecular individuals advocate geoengineering altering climate simply perceived risks due lack understanding humans regarding consequences putting different chemicals atmosphere seeding oceans opponents geoengineering suggest abandoned hartman however climate scientists support geoengineering idea ken caldeira stanford university suggest instead abandoning idea due risk continued research consequences geoengineering exact probabilities effects consequences scientists also argue geoengineering instances cheaper quite financially feasible however opposition mere quick fix moves attention away development longterm solutionscitation needed scientists past years attempting create advanced artificial intelligence seeks rival
