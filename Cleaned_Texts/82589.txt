hemispatial neglect neuropsychological condition damage one hemisphere brain eg stroke deficit attention awareness towards side space opposite brain damage contralesional space observed defined inability person process perceive stimuli towards contralesional side body hemispatial neglect commonly contralateral damaged hemisphere instances ipsilesional neglect side lesion hemispatial neglect results commonly strokes brain unilateral injury right cerebral hemisphere rates critical stage causing visual neglect lefthand side space neglect often produced massive strokes middle cerebral artery region variegated sufferers exhibit syndromes rightsided spatial neglect rare redundant processing right space left right cerebral hemispheres whereas leftdominant brains left space processed right cerebral hemisphere although strikingly affects visual perception visual neglect neglect forms perception also found either alone combination visual example stroke affecting right parietal lobe brain lead neglect left side visual field causing patient neglect behave left side sensory space nonexistent although still turn left extreme case patient neglect might fail eat food left half plate even though complain hungry someone neglect asked draw clock drawing might show numbers numbers might one half clock face half distorted blank neglect patients may also ignore contralesional side body instance might shave apply makeup nonneglected side patients may frequently collide objects structures door frames side neglect may also present delusional form patient denies ownership limb entire side body since delusion often occurs alone without accompaniment delusions often labeled monothematic delusioncitation needed neglect affects present sensation memory recall perception well patient suffering neglect may also asked recall memory certain object draw said object draw half object unclear however due perceptive deficit memory patient lost pieces spatial information memory whether information within memory whole intact simply ignored way portions physical object patients presence would ignoredcitation needed forms neglect may also example condition called extinction competition ipsilesional stimulus impedes perception contralesional stimulus patients asked fixate examiners nose detect fingers wiggled affected side examiner wiggle fingers affected unaffected sides patient

lack attention left side space manifest visual auditory proprioceptive olfactory domains although hemispatial neglect often manifests sensory deficit frequently comorbid sensory deficit essentially failure pay sufficient attention sensory inputcitation needed although hemispatial neglect identified following left hemisphere damage resulting neglect right side space common damage right disparity thought reflect fact right hemisphere brain specialized spatial perception memory whereas left hemisphere specialized language redundant processing right visual fields hemispheres hence right hemisphere able compensate loss left hemisphere function vice neglect confused hemianopsia hemianopsia arises damage primary visual pathways cutting input cerebral hemispheres retinas neglect damage processing areas cerebral hemispheres receive input error processing well understoodcitation needed researchers debated whether neglect disorder spatial attention spatial even nonspatial deficits attention combined directional bias results unilateral brain spatial attention process objects one location chosen processing objects another would imply neglect intentional patient affinity direct attention unaffected neglect caused decrease stimuli contralesional side lack ipsilesional stimulation visual cortex increased inhibition contralesional theory neglect seen disorder attention orientation caused disruption visual cortex patients disorder direct attention movements ipsilesional side neglect stimuli contralesional side despite preserved visual fields result increased sensitivity visual performance unaffected patient shows affinity ipsilesional side unable disengage attention spatial representation way space represented theory believed underlying cause neglect

disorder manifests radically differently different patients single mechanism account different vast array impaired mechanisms found neglect mechanisms alone would cause complexity attention one several mechanisms may generated multiple competing hypothetical explanations neglect surprising proven difficult assign particular presentations neglect specific neuroanatomical loci despite limitations may loosely describe unilateral neglect four overlapping variables type range axis orientationcitation needed types hemispatial neglect broadly divided disorders input disorders output neglect input inattention includes ignoring contralesional sights sounds smells tactile stimuli surprisingly inattention even apply imagined stimuli whats termed representational neglect patients may ignore left side memories dreams hallucinations output neglect includes motor premotor deficits patient motor neglect use contralesional limb despite neuromuscular ability one premotor neglect directional hypokinesia move unaffected limbs ably ipsilateral space difficulty directing contralesional space thus patient premotor neglect may struggle grasp object left side even using unaffected right armcitation needed hemispatial neglect wide range terms patient neglects first range neglect commonly referred egocentric neglect found patients neglect body personal patients tend neglect

straight ahead position rightward true midline shift may account success therapeutic prism glasses shift left visual space toward right shifting visual input seem correct minds sense midline result amelioration visual neglect also tactile motor even representational neglect important question studies neglect left say frame reference subject adopt neglecting left half visual auditory tactile

slanted mirrorimage presentations patient looking mirror image map world may neglect see western hemisphere despite inverted placement onto right side map various neuropsychological research studies considered role frame reference hemispatial neglect offering new evidence support allocentric egocentric neglect begin one study conducted dongyun li hansotto karnath christopher rorden examined whether allocentric neglect varies egocentric position experimental design consisted testing eleven right hemispheric stroke patients five patients showed spatial neglect contralesional side remaining six patients showed spatial study patients presented two arrays seven triangles first array ran southwest northeast swne second array ran southeast northwest senw portion experimental trials middle triangle array contained gap along one side participants tested ability perceive presence gap instructed press one response button gap present second response button gap test neglect frame reference two different arrays carefully situated gap triangle fell opposite sides allocentric field swne array gap triangle fell allocentric right objectcentered axis along triangle pointed senw configuration gap triangle fell allocentric left objectcentered furthermore varying position arrays respect participants trunk midline used test egocentric neglect arrays therefore presented ie line participants trunk midline left ultimately varying position array within testing visual field allowed simultaneous measurement egocentric neglect allocentric neglect results experimental design showed spatial neglect patients performed poorly allocentric left side triangle well objects presented egocentric left side furthermore poor accuracy detecting features object left side objects axis severe objects presented contralesional side body thus findings illustrate allocentric egocentric biases present simultaneously egocentric information influence severity allocentric second study conducted moscovitch behrmann investigated reference frame neglect respect somatosensory system eleven patients parietal lobe lesions subsequent hemispatial neglect analyzed double simultaneous stimulation procedure utilized patients touched lightly simultaneously left right side wrist one hand patients tested palms facing palms facing experimental condition allowed scientists determine whether neglect somatosensory system occurs respect sensory receptor surface egocentric respect higherorder spatial frame reference allocentric results experiment showed hemispatial neglect patients neglected somatosensory stimuli contralesional side space regardless hand findings suggest within somatosensory system stimuli neglected respect allocentric spatial frame reference addition egocentric sensory

pharmaceutical treatments mostly focused dopaminergic therapies bromocriptine levodopa amphetamines though tests mixed results helping cases accentuating hemispatial neglect others caloric vestibular
