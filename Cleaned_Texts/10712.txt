folivory frugivory granivory among early terrestrial vertebrates feeding leaves stems roots rhizomes herbivorous use massive crushing dentition palate caseids belong basal clade synapside caseasauria

suggests feeding strategy originated sometime late pennsylvanian early caseids show dental specializations leaflike large serrations present marginal locomotion casea involves threevertebra sacrum
