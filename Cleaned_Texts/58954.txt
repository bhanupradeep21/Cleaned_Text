plays role outofcontrol patients dysfunction caused tumors experience symptoms similar kls specifically medial temporal regions thalamus may although examinations kls patients consistently found abnormalities temporal lobe also appears play role condition possibly causing cognitive difficulties apathy disinhibition found kls suggest condition may include frontal lobe dysfunction well involvement thalamus temporal lobe frontal lobe brain suggests multifocal localized encephalopathy also persistent subclinical abnormalities another possible explanation concerns metabolism serotonin dopamine imbalance neurotransmitter pathways chemicals could play viral infections also suggested possible cause evidence role includes lesions found csf samples kls patients indicate condition different cause influenzaassociated triggers kls may also affect bloodbrain barrier could play role limited evidence role hypocretin may play although often influences androgen might indirectly block melatonin receptors possibly means vasodilation cause cholinergic abnormalities cases syndromecitation needed kls occurs much higher rate jews families likely genetic component addition environmental
