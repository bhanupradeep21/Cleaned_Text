genetic erosion also known genetic depletion process limited gene pool endangered species diminishes even reproductive individuals die reproducing others endangered low population term sometimes used narrow sense describing loss particular alleles genes well used broadly referring loss phenotype whole species genetic erosion occurs individual organism many unique genes get lost dies without getting chance breed low genetic diversity population wild animals plants leads diminishing gene pool inbreeding weakening immune system fasttrack species towards eventual extinction definition endangered species suffer varying degrees genetic erosion many species benefit humanassisted breeding program keep population viablecitation needed thereby avoiding extinction long timeframes small populations susceptible genetic erosion larger populations genetic erosion gets compounded accelerated habitat loss habitat fragmentation many endangered species threatened habitat loss fragmentation habitat fragmented habitat create barriers gene flow populations gene pool species population complete set unique alleles would found inspecting genetic material every living member species population large gene pool indicates extensive genetic diversity associated robust populations survive bouts intense selection meanwhile low genetic diversity see inbreeding population bottlenecks cause reduced biological fitness increase chance extinction species population population bottlenecks create shrinking gene pools leave fewer fewer fertile mating partners genetic implications illustrated considering analogy highstakes poker game crooked dealer consider game begins deck representing high genetic diversity reduction number breeding pairs unique genes resembles situation dealer deals five cards producing limited hands specimens begin inbreed physical reproductive congenital effects defects appear often abnormal sperm increases infertility rises birthrates decline perilous effects immune defense systems become weakened less less able fight increasing number bacterial viral fungal parasitic diseaseproducing threats thus even endangered species bottleneck withstand whatever human development may eating away habitat still faces threat epidemic could fatal entire genetic erosion agricultural livestock loss biological genetic diversity including loss individual genes loss particular recombinants genes gene complexes manifested locally adapted landraces domesticated animals plants become adapted natural environment originated major driving forces behind genetic erosion crops variety replacement land clearing overexploitation species population pressure environmental degradation overgrazing governmental policy changing agricultural systems main factor however replacement local varieties domestic plants animals varieties species nonlocal large number varieties also often dramatically reduced commercial varieties introduced traditional farming systems many researchers believe main problem related agroecosystem management general tendency towards genetic ecological uniformity imposed development modern agriculture case animal genetic resources food agriculture major causes genetic erosion reported include indiscriminate crossbreeding increased use exotic breeds weak policies institutions animal genetic resources management neglect certain breeds lack profitability competitiveness intensification production systems effects diseases disease management loss pastures elements production environment poor control advances modern bioscience several techniques safeguards emerged check relentless advance genetic erosion resulting acceleration endangered species towards eventual extinction however many techniques safeguards expensive yet practical best way protect species protect habitat let live naturally possible wildlife sanctuaries national parks created preserve entire ecosystems web species native area wildlife corridors created join fragmented habitats see habitat fragmentation enable endangered species travel meet breed others kind scientific conservation modern wildlife management techniques expertise scientifically trained staff help manage protected ecosystems wildlife found wild animals also translocated reintroduced locations physically fragmented wildlife habitats far isolated able link together via wildlife corridor local extinctions already occurred modern policies zoo associations zoos around world begun putting dramatically increased emphasis keeping breeding wildsourced species subspecies animals registered endangered species breeding programs specimens intended chance reintroduced survive back wild main objectives zoos today changed greater resources invested breeding species subspecies ultimate purpose assisting conservation efforts wild zoos maintaining extremely detailed scientific breeding records ie studbooks loaning wild animals zoos around country often globally breeding safeguard inbreeding attempting maximize genetic diversity however possible costly sometimes controversial exsitu conservation techniques aim increase genetic biodiversity planet well diversity local gene pools guarding genetic erosion modern concepts like seedbanks sperm banks tissue banks become much commonplace valuable sperm eggs embryos frozen kept banks sometimes called modern noahs arks frozen zoos cryopreservation techniques used freeze living materials keep alive perpetuity storing submerged liquid nitrogen tanks low temperatures thus preserved materials used artificial insemination vitro fertilization embryo transfer cloning methodologies protect diversity gene pool critically endangered species possible save endangered species extinction preserving parts specimens tissues sperm eggs etc even death critically endangered animal collected one found freshly dead captivity wild new specimen resurrected help cloning give another chance breed genes living population respective threatened species resurrection dead critically endangered wildlife specimens help cloning still perfected still expensive practical time advancements science methodology may well become routine procedure far future recently strategies finding integrated approach situ ex situ conservation techniques given considerable attention progress httpsenwikipediaorgwikigeneticerosion
