biocide defined european legislation chemical substance microorganism intended destroy deter render harmless exert controlling effect harmful organism us environmental protection agency epa uses slightly different definition biocides diverse group poisonous substances including preservatives insecticides disinfectants pesticides used control organisms harmful human animal health cause damage natural manufactured products compared two definitions roughly imply although us epa definition includes plant protection products veterinary medicines terms biocides pesticides regularly interchanged often confused plant protection products clarify pesticides include biocides plant protection products former refers substances nonfood feed purposes latter refers substances food feed discussing biocides distinction made biocidal active substance biocidal product biocidal active substances mostly chemical compounds also microorganisms eg bacteria biocidal products contain one biocidal active substances may contain nonactive coformulants ensure effectiveness well desired ph viscosity colour odour etc final product biocidal products available market use professional andor nonprofessional consumers although biocidal active substances relative high toxicity also examples active substances low toxicity exhibit biocidal activity certain specific conditions closed systems cases biocidal product combination active substance device ensures intended biocidal activity ie suffocation rodents closed system trap another example biocidal products available consumers products impregnated biocides also called treated articles clothes wristbands impregnated insecticides socks impregnated antibacterial substances etc biocides commonly used medicine agriculture forestry industry biocidal substances products also employed antifouling agents disinfectants circumstances chlorine example used shortlife biocide industrial water treatment disinfectant swimming pools many biocides synthetic naturally occurring biocides classified natural biocides derived eg bacteria biocide europe biocidal products divided different product types pt based intended use product types total bpr grouped four main groups namely disinfectants preservatives pest control biocidal products example main group disinfectants contains products used human hygiene pt veterinary hygiene pt main group preservatives contains wood preservatives pt main group pest control contains rodenticides pt repellents attractants pt main group biocidal products contains antifouling products pt noted one active substance used several product types example sulfuryl fluoride approved use wood preservative pt well insecticide pt biocides added materials typically liquids protect biological infestation growth example certain types quaternary ammonium compounds quats added pool water industrial water systems act algicide protecting water infestation growth algae often impractical store use poisonous chlorine gas water treatment alternative methods adding chlorine used include hypochlorite solutions gradually release chlorine water compounds like sodium dichlorostriazinetrione dihydrate anhydrous sometimes referred dichlor trichlorostriazinetrione sometimes referred trichlor compounds stable solids may used powdered granular tablet form added small amounts pool water industrial water systems chlorine atoms hydrolyze rest molecule forming hypochlorous acid hocl acts general biocide killing germs microorganisms algae halogenated hydantoin compounds also used biocides biocides intended kill living organisms many biocidal products pose significant risk human health welfare great care required handling biocides appropriate protective clothing equipment used use biocides also significant adverse effects natural environment antifouling paints especially utilising organic tin compounds tbt shown severe longlasting impacts marine ecosystems materials banned many countries commercial recreational vessels though sometimes still used naval disposal used unwanted biocides must undertaken carefully avoid serious potentially longlasting damage environment classification biocides biocidal products

regulatory framework managed european food safety authority efsa due intrinsic properties patterns use biocides rodenticides insecticides cause adverse effects humans animals environment therefore used utmost care example anticoagulants used rodent control caused toxicity nontarget species predatory birds due long halflife ingestion target species ie rats mice high toxicity nontarget species pyrethroids used insecticides shown cause unwanted effects environment due unspecific toxic action also causing toxic effects nontarget aquatic organisms light potential adverse effects ensure

degradation pathways order perform accurate risk assessment environment areas concern endocrine disruption pbtproperties secondary poisoning mixture toxicity biocidal products often composed mixtures one active substances together coformulants stabilisers preservatives colouring agents since substances may act together produce combination effect assessment risk substances alone may underestimate real risk product whole several concepts available predicting effect mixture basis known toxicities concentrations single components approaches mixture toxicity assessments regulatory purposes typically advocate assumptions additive means substance mixture assumed contribute mixture effect direct proportion concentration potency strict sense assumption thereby substances act mode mechanism
