animal song welldefined term scientific literature use broadly defined term vocalizations common use song generally consists several successive vocal sounds incorporating multiple sources distinguish simpler vocalizations termed calls reserving term song complex songlike productions identified several groups animals including cetaceans whales dolphins avians birds anurans frogs humans social transmission song found groups including birds cetaceans mammalian species produce sound passing air lungs across larynx vibrating vocal sound enters supralaryngeal vocal tract adjusted produce various changes sound output providing refinement although morphological differences species affect production sound neural control thought essential factor producing variations within human speech song compared cetacean vocalizations exception general mechanism toothed whales odontocetes pass air system air sacs muscular phonic lips vibrate produce audible vocalizations thus serving function vocal folds sound vibrations conveyed organ head called melon changed shape control direct unlike humans mammals toothed whales able recycle air used vocal production allowing whales sing without releasing cetaceans humpback whales sing continuously like mammals anurans possess larynx vocal folds used create vibrations sound however frogs also use structures called vocal sacs elastic membranes base mouth inflate sound sacs provide amplification finetuning sounds also allow air pushed back lungs allows air used sound production recycled thought evolved increase song increased efficiency sound production important frogs may produce calls lasting several hours mating new river tree frog trachycephalus hadroceps example spends hours producing calls single night made possible efficient recycling air vocal birds inhale air passed mouth trachea forks two bronchii connecting primary vocal organ birds called syrinx located fork trachea present air passes respiratory tract syrinx membranes within vibrate produce birds capable producing continuous song inhalation exhalation may sing continuously several example skylark alauda arvensis capable producing nonstop song one birds change song characteristics inhalation versus exhalation brewers sparrow spizella breweri alternates rapid trilling exhalation interspersed lowerrate trills short two halves syrinx connect separate lungs controlled independently allowing birds produce two separate notes insects crickets family gryllidae well known ability produce loud song however mechanism sound production differs greatly animals many insects generate sound mechanical rubbing body structures mechanism known orthopteran insects including crickets katydids family tettigoniidae especially wellstudied sound production insects use scraperlike structures one wing sweep filestructures opposing wing create vibrations producing variety trilling chirping locusts grasshoppers suborder caelifera stridulate rubbing hind legs pegs wing surfaces downward cicadas superfamily cicadoidea produce sound much greater volumes orthopterans relying pair organs called tymbals base abdomen behind muscle contraction rapidly deforms tymbal membrane emitting several different types insects thus produce variety sounds using various mechanisms distinct animals vocalizations play wide variety different roles groups anurans birds several distinct types notes incorporated form songs sung different situations serve distinct example many frogs may use trilling notes mate attraction switch different vocal patterns aggressive territorial species single song incorporates several note types serve different purposes one type note eliciting responses females another note song responsible warning competitor males vocalizations play important role mating behaviour many animals many groups birds frogs crickets whales etc song production common males species often used attract bird song thought evolved sexual selection female songbirds often assess potential mates using song based qualities high song output complexity difficulty songs well presence local song output serves fitness indicator males since vocalizations require energy time produce thus males capable producing high song output long durations may higher fitness less vocal thought song complexity may serve indicator male fitness providing indication successful brain development despite potential earlylife stressors lack social transmission songs allows development local dialects song female songbirds also typically prefer choose mates producing local song one hypothesis phenomenon selecting local mates allows female choose genes specially adapted suit local frog song also plays prominent role courtship t√∫ngara frogs engystomops pustulosus male frogs increase complexity calls adding additional note types greater numbers competitor males present found attract greater numbers female species change courtship calls females especially nearby male glass frogs hyalinobatachium fleichmanni long frequencymodulated vocalization produced upon noticing another nearby frog changed short chirping song female several species eg dendrobatid frogs mannophryne trinitatis ornate frogs cophixalus ornatus splendid poison frogs dendrobates speciosus switch longrange loud trilling sounds shortrange quieter chirps females move closer thought allow mate attraction without alerting competitor males female although highly complex songlike production identified whales function still somewhat elusive thought involved courtship behaviour sexual selection singing behaviour becomes common breeding another major function song output indicate aggression among males breeding seasons anurans birds use singing territorial displays confer aggressive eastern smooth frogs geocrinia victoriana example courtship songs involve shorter notes attract potential mates followed longer tones repel frequency sounds produced generally negatively correlates body size within among species allows competing males assess body size vocalizing neighbouring male frogs typically approach higher frequency sounds readily lower frequencies likely frog producing sound assessed smaller less dangerous territorial birds males increase song production rate neighbouring males encroach great tits parus major nightingales luscinia megarhynchos blackbirds turdus merula sparrows family passeridae playing song recordings slows rate males establish territories unoccupied region suggesting birds rely song output establishing territorial experimentally muted scotts seaside sparrow ammodramus maritimus lose control territories thus territorial birds often rely song production repel conspecific males like human voice bird song typically contains sufficient individual variability allow discrimination individual vocal patterns discrimination important mate recognition many monogamous species seabirds example often use vocalization patterns recognize mate upon reunion breeding many colonial nesting birds parentoffspring recognition critical allow parents locate offspring upon return nesting cliff swallows petrochelidon pyrrhonota demonstrated preferentially respond parental songs young age providing means vocalizationbased offspring learned vocalizations identified groups including whales elephants seals primates however wellestablished examples learned singing many species young birds learn songs adult males species typically first demonstrated chaffinches fringilla coelabs chaffinches raised social isolation develop abnormal songs however playing recordings chaffinch songs allows young birds learn speciesspecific song learning generally involves sensitive learning period early life young birds must exposed song tutor animals
