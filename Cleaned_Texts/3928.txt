jaxtasuchus extinct genus armored doswelliid archosauriform reptile known middle triassic ladinian stage erfurt formation germany type species jaxtasuchus salomoni named basis several incomplete skeletons isolated remains like doswelliids members genus heavily armored four longitudinal rows bony plates called osteoderms covering body jaxtasuchus first doswelliid known europe closely related doswellia late triassic eastern united states however specialized doswellia retaining several generalized archosauriform characteristics less armor jaxtasuchus fossils found aquatic mudstones alongside fossils temnospondyl amphibians crustaceans mollusks suggesting jaxtasuchus semiaquatic like modern fossils jaxtasuchus found lower keuper southern germany dates back end middle triassic osteoderms jaxtasuchus originally interpreted dermal bones temnospondyl amphibians later plates aetosaur reptiles archosauriforms currently known lower keuper zanclodon laevis known jaw fragment several teeth batrachotomus kupferzellensis large pseudosuchian archosaur known several skeletons jaxtasuchus abundant archosauriform reptile lower keuper remains uncovered six fossil localities

salomoni named hans michael salomon discovered holotype specimen donated staatliches museum f√ºr naturkunde stuttgart maxilla long low tooth sockets covered irregular pits incision rear edge likely representing antorbital fenestra fragments premaxilla nasal bones also preserved similar texturing maxilla teeth sharp slightly curved oval shaped crosssection uniquely lacked serrations also pronounced longitudinal ridges along labial lingual cheek tonguefacing sides threepronged bone identified postorbital structure similar diapsid reptiles indicating jaxtasuchus likely retained lower temporal fenestra like diapsids contrasts doswellia smaller stouter postorbital bone lower temporal fenestra completely closed giving euryapsid skull braincase bones also preserved one specimen occipital condyle formed basioccipital bone projected rest skull contrast archeopelta paired exoccipital bones lied upon contact similar doswelliids doswellia pronounced peglike extension rear surface supraoccipital bone jaxtasuchus vertical ridge preserved bone lower jaw angular concave upper edge may formed base mandibular fenestra hole jaw common archosauriforms absent cervical neck vertebrae jaxtasuchus characteristically longer high increasing size towards base neck neural spines low rectangular slightly taller base neck dorsal torso vertebrae hand wide neural spines roughly textured upper surface rough texturing signified vertebrae attached overlying osteoderms dorsal vertebrae also longer high keels lower surface much like doswellia ribs jaxtasuchus unusual shape long slender rod bent degree angle also like doswellia corner bend rough ridge front nevertheless ribs jaxtasuchus extend outwards extent doswellia caudal tail vertebrae also jaxtasuchus covered armor plates known osteoderms osteoderms lay body four longitudinal rows two inner rows paramedian osteoderms ie ones adjacent midline body single row side placed lateral paramedian rows osteoderms roughly textured radiating web ridges pits although also flat smooth front edge thinner rest plate middle osteoderm plate moundlike prominence covered small pits paramedian osteoderms generally wider lateral ones higher prominence osteoderms level axis vertebra second cervical trapezoidal third cervical broad rest cervicals elongated rectangular osteoderms paramedians twice long wide lateral osteoderms three times long dorsal osteoderms flexed rather perfectly flat slightly longer wide however dorsal osteoderms directly front hip wider long base tail squareshaped paramedian osteoderms gradually lose texture lateral osteoderms keep tail paramedian osteoderms become longer finely pitted lateral osteoderms shrink triangular structures disappear small keeled osteoderms present limbs based flexed paramedian osteoderms jaxtasuchus likely tall narrow torso doswellia possessed six medial rows osteoderms flexure started despite heavy armor torso limb bones jaxtasuchus fairly small slender hindlimbs longer forelimbs bones forelimb slender unspecialized similar euparkeria rather robust structures erythrosuchus metacarpals long slender hand complete enough come specific conclusions structure hindlimbs also typical generalized early archosauriforms femur thigh bone apparent fourth trochanter metatarsals also similar cladogram schoch sues mesosuchus prolacerta proterosuchus erythrosuchus euparkeria turfanosuchus avemetatarsalia pseudosuchia chanaresuchus vancleavea tarjadia archeopelta doswellia jaxtasuchus fossils jaxtasuchus vellberg come mudstones likely deposited brackishwater lakes marshes fossils common probably swept aquatic environments terrestrial areas jaxtasuchus probably semiaquatic like modern crocodilians resembled heavy armor short limbs long tail sharp teeth suggest jaxtasuchus likely carnivorous aquatic temnospondyl amphibians callistomordax kupferzellia mastodonsaurus common components fossil assemblage fossils bivalves ostracode crustaceans
