pure physical rehearsal practice motor imagery defined dynamic state individual mentally simulates physical action type phenomenal experience implies subject feels performing corresponds socalled internal imagery first person perspective sport mental practice refers use visuomotor imagery purpose improving motor behavior visuomotor imagery requires use ones imagination simulate action without physical movement come fore due relevance imagery enhancing sports surgical mental practice combined physical practice beneficial beginners learning sport even helpful professionals looking enhance physical practice generates physical feedback necessary improve mental practice creates cognitive process physical practice easily surgeons medical practitioners mentally rehearse procedures along

retain many properties terms temporal regularities programming rules biomechanical constraints observed corresponding real action comes execution instance experiment participants instructed walk mentally gates given apparent width positioned different apparent distances gates presented participants visual display virtual reality helmet involved calibration external cues possibility subject refer known environment participants asked indicate time started walking time passed gate mental walking time found increase increasing gate distance decreasing gate width thus took participant longer walk mentally narrow gate walk larger gate placed finding led neurophysiologists marc jeannerod jean decety propose similarity mental states action simulation functional equivalence action imagination goes beyond motor movements instance similar cortical networks mediate music performance music imagery large number functional neuroimaging studies demonstrated motor imagery associated specific activation neural circuits involved early stage motor control ie motor programming circuits includes supplementary motor area primary motor cortex inferior parietal cortex basal ganglia physiological data gives strong support common neural mechanisms imagery motor measurements cardiac respiratory activity motor imagery actual motor performance revealed covariation heart rate pulmonary ventilation degree imagined motor imagery activates motor pathways muscular activity often increases respect rest motor imagery case emg activity limited muscles participate simulated action tends proportional amount imagined motor imagery widely used technique enhance motor learning improve neurological rehabilitation patients stroke effectiveness demonstrated motor imagery close notion simulation used cognitive social neuroscience account different processes individual engaging simulation may replay past experience order extract pleasurable motivational strictly informational properties view clearly described swedish physiologist author simulation hypothesis states thinking consists simulated interaction environment rests following three core assumptions simulation actions activate motor structures brain way resembles activity normal action cause overt movement simulation perception imagining perceiving something essentially actually perceiving perceptual activity generated brain rather external stimuli anticipation exist associative mechanisms enable behavioral perceptual activity elicit perceptual activity sensory areas brain importantly simulated action elicit perceptual activity resembles activity would occurred action actually performed mental simulation may also representational tool understand self others philosophy mind developmental psychology also draw
