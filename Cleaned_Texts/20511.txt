disease progression cardiovascular diabetes several complications one hypertension high blood pressure data indicate least percent individuals develop diabetes eventually develop high blood pressure high blood pressure gradual early stages may take least years fully develop besides diabetes factors may also increase high blood pressure include obesity insulin resistance high cholesterol levels general fewer percent diabetics good control blood pressure presence high blood pressure diabetes associated fold increase death chiefly heart disease also shown recent epidemiological studies variability blood pressure independent mean blood pressure level contributes microvascular macrovascular diabetes including heart variability associations may especially deleterious persons either particularly high particularly low blood chief reason people diabetes develop high blood pressure hardening arteries diabetes tends speed process atherosclerosis fact diabetes affects large small blood vessels body time blood vessels become clogged fatty depots become noncompliant lose elasticity process atherosclerosis lot faster diabetic individuals good control blood sugars high blood

increases diabetics know even mild elevations blood pressure detrimental health studies shown diabetics even slight elevation blood pressure times risk heart disease compared individuals without blood pressure readings vary experts recommend blood pressure range secondly high blood pressure silent disease thus vital diabetics regularly check blood pressure checked doctors office regular basis american diabetes association recommends diabetics get blood pressure measured health care professional least times blood pressure found high diabetics ways treat medications like angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors acei widely used control blood pressure diabetics medications control blood pressure also delay prevent development kidney disease diabetes many studies shown acei drugs first choice diabetics high blood pressurecitation needed medications used treat high blood pressure include water pills sometimes combination medications used treat high blood pressure diabetics quit smoking combination diabetes smoking usually leads amputations toes feet measure blood sugars regularly make sure well balanced majority complications diabetes prevented ensuring blood sugars stay within normal also recommended eat healthy diet avoid sugary foods limit intake salt also ensure cholesterol levels control exercise must diabetics walking twice day minutes fair
