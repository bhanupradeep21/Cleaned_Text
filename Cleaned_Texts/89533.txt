cope marshs archrival bone wars argued distinctive features nasal horn merely showed c nasicornis distinct species insufficient justify distinct genus consequently assigned c nasicornis genus megalosaurus creating new combination megalosaurus although ceratosaurus retained distinct genus subsequent relationships remained controversial following century ceratosauridae ceratosauria widely

theropod known triassic closely related contemporary theropod known time thus warrants family establishment cladistic analysis however marshs original claim ceratosauria distinct group gained ground newly discovered south american genera abelisaurus carnotaurus found closely related ceratosaurus gauthier recognized coelophysoidea closely related ceratosaurus although clade falls outside ceratosauria recent analyses many additional members ceratosauria recognized since ceratosauria split early evolutionary line leading modern birds considered basal within ceratosauria contains group

ceratosaurians debate analyses considered ceratosaurus derived basal members forming sister taxon oliver rauhut proposed genyodectes sister taxon ceratosaurus genera characterized exceptionally long

fauna outnumbered allosaurus average rate sites several studies attempted explain sympatric species could reduced direct competition donald henderson argued ceratosaurus cooccurred two separate

greater similarity sympatric species regarding morphology physiology behavior intense competition species henderson came conclusion shortsnouted allosaurus morph occupied different ecological niche longsnouted morph ceratosaurus shorter skull morph would reduced bending moments occurring biting thus increased bite force comparable condition seen cats ceratosaurus allosaurus morph though longsnouted skulls better compared dogs longer teeth would used fangs deliver quick slashing bites bite force concentrated smaller area due narrower skull according henderson great similarities skull shape ceratosaurus longsnouted allosaurus morph indicate forms engaged direct competition therefore ceratosaurus might pushed habitats dominated longsnouted morph indeed ceratosaurus rare clevelandlloyd quarry contains longsnouted allosaurus morph appears common garden park dry mesa quarry cooccurs shortsnouted furthermore henderson suggested ceratosaurus could avoided competition preferring different prey items evolution extremely elongated teeth might direct result competition longsnouted allosaurus morph species could also preferred different parts carcasses acting scavengers elongated teeth ceratosaurus could served visual signals facilitating recognition members species social functions addition large size theropods would tended decrease competition number possible prey items increases foster daniel chure study concurred henderson ceratosaurus allosaurus generally shared habitats preyed upon types prey meaning likely different feeding strategies avoid
