sympathetic nervous system sns one three divisions autonomic nervous system others parasympathetic nervous system enteric nervous enteric nervous system sometimes considered part autonomic nervous system sometimes considered independent autonomic nervous system functions regulate bodys unconscious actions sympathetic nervous systems primary process stimulate bodys fight flight response however constantly active basic level maintain sympathetic nervous system described antagonistic parasympathetic nervous system latter stimulates body feed breed restanddigest two kinds neurons involved transmission signal sympathetic system preganglionic postganglionic shorter preganglionic neurons originate thoracolumbar division spinal cord specifically travel ganglion often one paravertebral ganglia synapse postganglionic neuron long postganglionic neurons extend across synapses within ganglia preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine neurotransmitter activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors postganglionic neurons response stimulus postganglionic neurons release norepinephrine activates adrenergic receptors present peripheral target tissues activation target tissue receptors causes effects associated sympathetic system however three important sympathetic nerves arise near middle spinal cord intermediolateral nucleus lateral grey column beginning first thoracic vertebra vertebral column thought extend second third lumbar vertebra cells begin thoracolumbar division thoracic lumbar regions spinal cord sympathetic nervous system said thoracolumbar outflow axons nerves leave spinal cord anterior root pass near spinal sensory ganglion enter anterior rami spinal nerves however unlike somatic innervation quickly separate white rami connectors called shiny white sheaths myelin around axon connect either paravertebral lie near vertebral column prevertebral lie near aortic bifurcation ganglia extending alongside spinal column reach target organs glands axons must travel long distances body accomplish many axons relay message second cell synaptic transmission ends axons link across space synapse dendrites second cell first cell presynaptic cell sends neurotransmitter across synaptic cleft activates second cell postsynaptic cell message carried final destination presynaptic nerves axons terminate either paravertebral ganglia prevertebral ganglia four different paths axon take reaching terminal cases axon enters paravertebral ganglion level originating spinal nerve either synapse ganglion ascend superior descend inferior paravertebral ganglion synapse descend prevertebral ganglion synapse postsynaptic postsynaptic cell goes innervate targeted end effector ie gland smooth muscle etc paravertebral prevertebral ganglia close spinal cord presynaptic neurons much shorter postsynaptic counterparts must extend throughout body reach destinations notable exception routes mentioned sympathetic innervation suprarenal adrenal medulla case presynaptic neurons pass paravertebral ganglia prevertebral ganglia synapse directly suprarenal tissue tissue consists cells pseudoneuron like qualities activated presynaptic neuron release neurotransmitter epinephrine directly bloodstream sympathetic nervous system components peripheral nervous system synapses made sites called ganglia cell sends fiber called preganglionic cell cell whose fiber leaves ganglion called postganglionic cell mentioned previously preganglionic cells sympathetic nervous system located first thoracic segment third lumbar segments spinal cord postganglionic cells cell bodies ganglia send axons target organs glands ganglia include sympathetic trunks also cervical ganglia superior middle inferior send sympathetic nerve fibers head thorax organs celiac mesenteric ganglia send sympathetic fibers gut messages travel sympathetic nervous system bidirectional flow efferent messages trigger changes different parts body simultaneously example sympathetic nervous system accelerate heart rate widen bronchial passages decrease motility movement large intestine constrict blood vessels increase peristalsis oesophagus cause pupillary dilation piloerection goose bumps perspiration sweating raise blood pressure one exception certain blood vessels cerebral coronary arteries dilate rather constrict increase sympathetic tone proportional increase presence adrenergic receptors rather receptors receptors promote vessel dilation instead constriction like receptors alternative explanation primary direct effect sympathetic stimulation coronary arteries vasoconstriction followed secondary vasodilation caused release vasodilatory metabolites due sympathetically increased cardiac inotropy heart rate secondary vasodilation caused primary vasoconstriction termed functional sympatholysis overall effect coronary arteries target synapse postganglionic neuron mediated adrenergic receptors activated either norepinephrine noradrenaline epinephrine adrenaline sympathetic nervous system responsible downregulating many homeostatic mechanisms living organisms fibers syns innervate tissues almost every organ system providing least regulation functions diverse pupil diameter gut motility urinary system output perhaps best known mediating neuronal hormonal stress response commonly known fightorflight response response also known sympathoadrenal response body preganglionic sympathetic fibers end adrenal medulla also sympathetic fibers secrete acetylcholine activates great secretion adrenaline epinephrine lesser extent noradrenaline norepinephrine therefore response acts primarily cardiovascular system mediated directly via impulses transmitted sympathetic nervous system indirectly via catecholamines secreted adrenal medulla sympathetic nervous system responsible priming body action particularly situations threatening one example priming moments waking sympathetic outflow spontaneously increases preparation action sympathetic nervous system stimulation causes vasoconstriction blood vessels including many skin digestive tract kidneys occurs result activation adrenergic receptors norepinephrine released postganglionic sympathetic neurons receptors exist throughout vasculature body inhibited counterbalanced adrenergic receptors stimulated epinephrine release adrenal glands skeletal muscles heart lungs brain sympathoadrenal response net effect shunting blood away organs necessary immediate survival organism increase blood flow organs involved intense physical activity afferent fibers

arcs normally undetectable certain instances may send pain sensations cns masked referred pain peritoneal cavity becomes inflamed bowel suddenly distended body interpret afferent pain stimulus somatic
