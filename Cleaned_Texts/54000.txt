flammer syndrome described clinical entity comprising complex clinical features caused mainly dysregulation blood supply previously known vascular dysregulation manifest many symptoms cold hands feet often associated low blood pressure certain cases associated predisposes development diseases normal tension flammer syndrome named swiss ophthalmologist josef flammer symptoms flammer syndrome result impaired regulation blood supply symptoms affect patient depends organs body parts blood supply inhibited typical symptoms flammer syndrome cold hands feet low blood pressure occasional white red patches face neck migrainelike pain feeling pressure behind upper eyelid addition symptoms directly resulting dysregulations blood supply prolonged time needed fall reduced feeling thirst high sensitivity cold also odors vibrations psychological stress certain medications eg calcium antagonists beta blockers pain muscle spasms many people glaucoma cause disease perfusion issues optic nerve retina intraocular pressure normal many patients normal tension glaucoma basic constitution corresponds flammer syndrome features formerly summarized term primary vascular dysregulation signs flammer syndrome include disease prevalent following groups people flammer syndrome sleep decreased sensation diagnosis flammer syndrome primarily based patients history typical features well findings nail fold capillaroscopy test shows excessive constriction narrowing smallest blood vessels capillaries fingers response exposed cold patients vasospastic symptoms characteristic flammer syndrome shown unique gene expression lymphocytes underwent gene expression flammer syndrome necessarily mean individual sick affected remain healthy certain diseases arteriosclerosis consequences probably even rarer best known higher risk normal tension glaucoma disease impaired regulation blood flow large number glaucomatous damage occurs despite normal eye pressure glaucomatous damage progressive despite normalized intraocular pressure frequently flammer syndrome cause eyes elevated pressure retinal veins glaucoma patients flammer syndrome show specific clinical signs like increased frequency optic disc haemorrhages activated retinal astrocytes elevated retinal venous pressure optic nerve compartmentalization fluctuating diffuse visual field association normal tension glaucoma syndrome recently confirmed group chinese review risk factors normal tension glaucoma ophthalmologists asia form glaucoma much prevalent europe north america flammer syndrome attributed increase likelihood ganglion cell damage patients disc hemorrhages characteristic clinical migraine attacks common feature flammer syndrome described risk factor glaucoma progression openangle glaucoma well normal tension flammer syndrome may also predispose eye diseases vascular occlusion especially retinal vein relatively young people central serous retinopathy muscle spasms tension common among individuals flammer syndrome tinnitus sometimes even acute hearing loss occur currently insufficient data available cases flammer syndrome suspected like sudden unexpected deaths young athletes people retinitis pigmentosa seem flammer syndrome quite frequently possible associations vascular factor flammer syndrome requires therapy long individual experience symptoms pathological sequelae occur treatment based three pillars lifestyle interventions diet medication healthy lifestyle include regular sleep weight stabilization sense underweight avoiding periods fasting avoidance known trigger factors cold regular physical exercise beneficial extreme sports might detrimental nutrition contain many antioxidants found green tea black filter coffee red wine blueberries fruits fatty acids especially form fish improve regulation blood flow blood pressure low salt intake increased drugs lead vasoconstriction avoided blood pressure low sleeping pills taken cautiously magnesium calcium antagonists may help vascular dysregulation lifestyle interventions pronounced symptoms massive cold extremities tinnitus migrainelike avoided reduced stabilizing weight ie underweight avoidance periods fasting medical treatment necessary normal tension glaucoma present cases addition ophthalmologic treatment glaucoma patients usually low blood pressure addressed dietary measures salt intake sometimes lowdose steroids drop blood pressure especially sleep often prevented nightly dips blood pressure normal tension glaucoma patients flammer syndrome significantly damage sensory cells years vasospasms known particularly vessels supplying retina blood vasospasms temporary narrowings arteries arterioles resulting insufficient supply blood corresponding organs parts organs spasms occur various locations human body case medical terminology calls vasospastic syndrome years established spasms usually part general dysregulation blood vessels dysregulations occur spasms well excessive insufficient dilation arteries veins capillaries blood vessels individuals vasospastic syndrome respond stimuli insufficiently identifiable disease cause called primary vascular dysregulation pvd case underlying disease called secondary pvd pvd almost always associated vascular nonvascular symptoms entire complex pvd accompanying symptoms today called flammer syndromecitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikiflammersyndrome
