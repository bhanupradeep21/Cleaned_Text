giganhinga genus giant darter lived late miocene early pleistocene uruguay argentina largest species anhinga known science estimates suggest may weighed around kg lb likely flightless weight likely helped dive prey anatomy pelvis indicates good maneuverable swimmer single species currently recognized g kiyuensis giganhinga described rinderknecht noriega year based specimen mnhn incomplete pelvis

camacho formation san josé formation libertad formation however based sand gravel attached fossil rinderknecht noriega rule camacho libertad formations concluding material could stem pliocene pleistocene sediments san josé formation another indication colour fossil although surface taken darker coloration areas filled sand managed preserve original colour pinkish thus matches fossils san

anhinga genus including modern darter species derives tupi language means devil bird snake bird species name kiyuensis based beach kiyü balneario southern uruguay rio de la holotype pelvis giganhina somewhat deformed heavily eroded lost original texture original colour undergone remineralisation pelvis notably robust extant extinct darter species strong attachment points musculature lacking pneumatization addition incredibly robust fossil also large size approximately larger known material secondlargest anhinga species macranhinga paranensis cranial section synsacrum composed strongly united vertebrae taller wide laterally compressed said compression growing pronounced vertebral column however compression relatively less developed cormorants anhingas like anhingas first vertebra synsacrum opisthosacral ventral margin synsacrum remains parallel axis body opposing first two vertebrae project dorsally onset third vertebra creating angle bone similar observed south american fossil anhingas level sacral vertebrae notable fossa deeper towards caudal end similar anhinga developed either meganhinga macranhinga type material shows six preacetabular foramina side fossil growing smaller diameter back located somewhat larger gap last two foramina socket received femur closed notably enlarged space cavities one preserved located ventrally relatives giganhinga neural spine sockets higher pelecaniform gradually decreases height approaches acetabulum bifurcating socket ending two robust postrochanteric processes process higher anhinga even meganhinga terminates back either two taxa bearing closer resemblance macranhinga antitrocanter large surface oriented perpendicular fashion relative femur recovered argentina shows intermediate condition anhingas cormorants robust shaft wider distal end like holotype fossil exceeds size corresponding bone known anhinga species main reasoning behind tentative referral giganhinga overlap material meanwhile bone resemble material known macranhinga many times size known material belonging said genus common way calculate mass estimates fossil birds utilizing measurements proportions limb bones although direct approach possible giganhinga absence limb material rinderknecht noriega nevertheless calculated weight based proportions macranhinga recovered three results based specific region used calculations mean result kg lb heavier extinct extant member family almost five times heavy nextbig fossil paper areta noriega agnolin argue results vastly overestimate weight giganhinga noting lack similarly sized equivalent makes accurate estimates difficult results based modern american anhinga rather extinct taxa suggests weight kg lb half mass previous estimates calculating weight argentinian specimen resulted estimated mass kg lb however authors still treat results caution exceed average weight swimming life giganhinga may stood around ft phylogenetic analysis conducted guilherme colleagues recovered giganhinga closely related largebodied species genus macranhinga notably however giganhinga found sister taxon macranhinga ranzii specifically paranensis occupying basal position renders macranhinga paraphyletic may suggest giganhinga macranhinga however additional research required determine relationship certainty consensus tree results guilherme colleagues figured northern gannet moros bassanus

bougainvilliorum meganhinga chilensis oriental darter anhinga melanogaster grandis american darter anhinga anhinga paranensis ranzii kiyuensis immense size giganhinga may played important role foraging behavior weight would decreased buoyancy allowed dive greater depths relative anhinga species typically shallow water similar conclusion found macranhinga previously idea size increase adaptation swimming diving supported anatomy antitrocanter serves counteract forces produced kicks birds use propelling underwater subsequently stronger antitrocanter suggests giganhinga performed strong kicks associated locomotion water antitrocanter also forces femur closer parallel position rest body likewise advantageous swimming caudal musculature giganhinga may allowed stronger movement tail allowing bird effectively steer given size weight giganhinga possibly httpsenwikipediaorgwikigiganhinga
