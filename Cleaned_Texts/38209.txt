dualenergy xray absorptiometry dxa means measuring bone mineral density bmd using spectral imaging two xray beams different energy levels aimed patients bones soft tissue absorption subtracted bone mineral density bmd determined absorption beam bone dualenergy xray absorptiometry widely used thoroughly studied bone density measurement technology dxa scan typically used diagnose follow osteoporosis contrasted nuclear bone scan sensitive certain metabolic diseases bones bones attempting heal infections fractures tumors also sometimes used assess body composition soft tissue bone different attenuation coefficients xrays single xray beam passing body attenuated soft tissue bone possible determine single beam much attenuation attributable bone however attenuation coefficients vary energy xrays crucially ratio attenuation coefficients also varies dxa uses two energies xray difference total absorption two used suitable weighting subtract absorption soft tissue leaving absorption bone related bone density one type dxa scanner uses cerium filter tube voltage kv resulting effective photon energies also dxa scanner type using samarium filter tube voltage kv resulting
