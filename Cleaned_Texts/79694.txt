coumestrol natural organic compound class phytochemicals known coumestans coumestrol first identified compound estrogenic properties e bickoff ladino clover alfalfa garnered research interest estrogenic activity prevalence foods including soybeans brussels sprouts spinach variety legumes highest concentrations coumestrol found clover kala chana type chick pea alfalfa coumestrol phytoestrogen mimicking biological activity estrogens phytoestrogens able pass cell membranes due low molecular weight stable structure able interact enzymes receptors coumestrol binds erα erβ similar affinity estradiol relative binding affinity estradiol erα erβ although estrogenic activity coumestrol receptors much less case coumestrol estrogenic activity times greater chemical shape coumestrol orients two hydroxy groups position two hydroxy groups estradiol allowing inhibit activity aromatase enzymes involved biosynthesis steroid hormones inhibition enzymes results interference hormone levels coumestrol within individual plants species variable studies coumestrol levels alfalfa suggest may positive correlation coumestrol production infection plant viruses bacteria fungi higher levels coumestrol also found plants damaged aphids study required fully explain cause correlation damage infection coumestrol according united states department agriculture iowa state university database isoflavanes coumestrol coumestrol found following food items based extrapolation studies done animals maximum tolerable daily intake coumestrol human beings estimated μg per kg body mass calculated extrapolating lowest level adverse effects seen animals although due variability human diet exact amount coumestrol average person consumes calculated studies phytoestrogen intake suggest human diets result negligible intake coumestrol relative maximum tolerable daily coumestrol estrogen mimic endocrine disruptor potential affect organ systems regulated hormonally via estrogens coumestrol phytoestrogens shown effect sexual behavior rats antagonizing action estrogen within brain male rats nursed females coumestrol diets less likely mount female rat less likely ejaculate despite producing normal levels testosterone exposure produced similar decreases sexual behavior female rats result disruption estrogen dependent gene expression brain effects seen three areas hypothalamus ventromedial nucleus paraventricular nucleus medial preoptic area play role sexual behavior sexual female rats exposed coumestrol neonatally adopt lordosis position much exposed coumestrol shown accelerate onset puberty exposure coumestrol immediately birth resulted initial increase uterine weight however continued exposure inhibited growth uterus decreased levels estrogen receptors within uterine tissue rats also showed altered vaginal development including cornification metaplasia vaginal tissue delayed opening neonatal female mice treated coumestrol similar reproductive irregularities occurred months old atypical collagen distribution observed uterine day old male wistar rats injected coumestrol daily exhibit decrease size lumens seminiferous tubules germ cells go increased rates apoptosis bulls graze pastures containing coumestrol metaplasia occurs prostate bulbourethral glands sperm maturation suppressed female cows consumed alfalfa experienced lower pregnancy rates spontaneous abortions well abnormal estrogen levels high coumestrol diet also shown induce early development vulva udder female lambs addition anatomical abnormalities exposure coumestrol also shown alter estrus cycle number animals including cows sheep resulting lower rates coumestrol shown decrease bone resorption promote mineralization bone vitro vivo daily injections coumestrol shown reduce bone loss rats undergone coumestrol shown clastogenic properties certain concentrationspecify studies shown coumestrol mutagen induces formation micronuclei hamster cells cell line well human lymphoblastoid cells dosedependent manner exposure coumestrol also causes single stranded breaks hamster dna compromising genome studies shown coumestrol beneficial properties carbohydrate metabolism ovariectomized rats decreasing glycogen levels skeletal muscle also data indicating coumestrol lowers plasma cholesterol levels chicks results point possibility coumestrol positive role play human obesity diabetes coumestrol phytoestrogens sometimes used substitute hormone therapy treatment menopausal symptoms hot flashes night sweats however studies indicated phytoestrogenenriched foods supplements necessarily effective addition studies indicate coumestrol phytoestrogens antiestrogenic effect brain result produce mental health benefits seen estrogen replacement coumestrol phytoestrogens also investigated possible substitute hormone therapy chemotherapy breast cancer patients results various studies regarding use phytoestrogens treating breast cancer somewhat contradictory ambiguous result researchers clearly define phytoestrogens like coumestrol chemoprotective agents potentially negative effects inducing growth existing breast cancer tumors activating erα researchers georgetown university medical center investigated matter concluded phytoestrogens may used effective treatment breast cancer apoptotic properties safe menopause women much lower level estrogen bodies used conjunctively antiestrogen research biological effects coumestrol conducted animals ethical concerns need human studies better understand potential human health impacts due addition research required fully understand biosynthesis pathway coumestrol although believed similar flavones isoflavones research required understand exact nature relationship levels
