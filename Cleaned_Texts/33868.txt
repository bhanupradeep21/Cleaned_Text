speech production process thoughts translated speech includes selection words organization relevant grammatical forms articulation resulting sounds motor system using vocal apparatus speech production spontaneous person creates words conversation reactive name picture read aloud written word imitative speech repetition speech production language production since language also produced manually signs ordinary fluent conversation people pronounce roughly four syllables ten twelve phonemes two three words vocabulary contain thousand words errors speech production relatively rare occurring rate every words spontaneous words commonly spoken learned early life easily imagined quicker say ones rarely said learnt later life normally speech created pulmonary pressure provided lungs generates sound phonation glottis larynx modified vocal tract different vowels consonants however speech production occur without use lungs glottis alaryngeal speech using upper parts vocal tract example alaryngeal speech donald duck vocal production speech may associated production hand gestures act enhance comprehensibility development speech production throughout individuals life starts infants first babble transformed fully developed speech age first stage speech doesnt occur around age one holophrastic phase ages one half two half infant produce short sentences telegraphic phase two half years infant develops systems lemmas used speech production around four five childs lemmas largely increased enhances childs production correct speech produce speech like adult adult develops speech four stages activation lexical concepts select lemmas needed morphologically phonologically encode speech word phonetically production spoken language involves three major levels processing conceptualization formulation first processes conceptualization conceptual preparation intention create speech links desired concept particular spoken words expressed preverbal intended messages formulated specify concepts second stage formulation linguistic form required expression desired message created formulation includes grammatical encoding morphophonological encoding phonetic grammatical encoding process selecting appropriate syntactic word lemma selected lemma activates appropriate syntactic frame conceptualized message morphophonological encoding process breaking words syllables produced overt speech syllabification dependent preceding proceeding words instance icomprehend vs final part formulation stage phonetic encoding involves activation articulatory gestures dependent syllables selected morphophonological process creating articulatory score utterance pieced together order movements vocal apparatus third stage speech production articulation execution articulatory score lungs glottis larynx tongue lips jaw parts vocal apparatus resulting motor control speech production right handed people depends mostly upon areas left cerebral hemisphere areas include bilateral supplementary motor area left posterior inferior frontal gyrus left insula left primary motor cortex temporal also subcortical areas involved basal ganglia cerebellum aids sequencing speech syllables fast smooth rhythmically organized words longer speech production affected several disorders late research speech focused comprehension researchers collected greater volumes speech error data began investigate psychological processes responsible production speech sounds contemplate possible processes fluent findings speech error research soon incorporated speech production models evidence speech error data supports following conclusions speech production ideas include models speech production must contain specific elements viable include elements speech composed listed accepted models speech production discussed detail incorporate stages either explicitly implicitly ones outdated disputed criticized overlooking one following attributes accepted speech models conceptual stage speaker abstractly identifies wish b syntactic stage frame chosen words placed frame usually sentence c lexical stage search word occurs based meaning word selected retrieved information becomes available speaker involving phonology phonological stage abstract information converted speech like e phonetic stage instructions prepared sent muscles also models must allow forward planning mechanisms buffer monitoring mechanism following influential models speech production account incorporate previously mentioned stages include information discovered result speech error studies disfluency tipofthetongue research utterance generator model proposed fromkin composed six stages attempt account previous findings speech error research stages utterance generator model based possible changes representations particular utterance first stage person generates meaning wish convey second stage involves message translated onto syntactic structure message given third stage proposed fromkin wherewhen message gains different stresses intonations based meaning fourth stage fromkin suggested concerned selection words lexicon words selected stage message undergoes phonological fifth stage applies rules pronunciation produces syllables outputted sixth final stage fromkins utterance generator model coordination motor commands necessary speech phonetic features message sent relevant muscles vocal tract intended message produced despite ingenuity fromkins model researchers criticized interpretation speech production although utterance generator model accounts many nuances data found speech error studies researchers decided still room recent fromkins attempt explain speech production published garrett garrett also created model compiling speech error data many overlaps model fromkin model based added things fromkin model filled gaps pointed researchers garrett fromkin models distinguish three conceptual level sentence level motor level three levels common contemporary understanding speech dell proposed model lexical network became fundamental understanding way speech model lexical network attempts symbolically represent lexicon turn explain people choose words wish produce words organized speech dells model composed three stages semantics words phonemes words highest stage model represent semantic category image words representing

model contains syllabic information information stored form stratum level sent motor cortex vocal apparatus coordinated physically produce speech sounds physical structure human nose throat vocal cords allows productions many unique sounds areas broken places articulation different sounds produced different areas different muscles breathing ability utilize skills create various sounds needed communicate effectively essential speech production speech psychomotor activity speech two people conversation casual formal factual transactional language structure narrative genre employed differs depending upon context affect significant factor controls speech manifestations disrupt memory language use due affect include feelings tension states apprehension well physical signs like nausea language level manifestations affect brings could observed speakers hesitations repetitions false starts incompletion syntactic blends etc difficulties manner articulation contribute speech difficulties suggested infants capable making entire spectrum possible vowel consonant sounds ipa created system understanding categorizing possible speech sounds includes information way sound produced sounds extremely useful understanding speech production speech transcribed based sounds rather spelling may misleading depending language spoken average speaking rates words per minute wpm range recommended guidelines recording audiobooks people grow accustomed particular language prone lose ability produce certain speech sounds also distinguish articulation often associated speech production people physically produce speech sounds people speak fluently articulation automatic allows speech sounds produced per effective articulation speech include following elements fluency complexity accuracy even producing sound infants imitate facial expressions around months age infants start experiment communicative sounds trying coordinate producing sound opening closing mouths first year life infants produce coherent words instead produce reoccurring babbling sound babbling allows infant experiment articulating sounds without attend meaning repeated babbling starts initial production speech babbling works object permanence understanding location support networks first lexical items infant vocabulary growth increases substantially able understand objects exist even present first stage meaningful speech occur around age one stage holophrastic holistic stage refers infant speech consists one word time ie papa next stage telegraphic phase stage infants form short sentences ie daddy sit mommy drink typically occurs ages one half two half years old stage particularly noteworthy explosive growth lexicon stage infants must select match stored representations words specific perceptual target word order convey meaning enough vocabulary infants begin extract sound patterns learn break words phonological segments increasing number words point infants development speech lexicon consists words able understand even reach two half years speech production becomes increasingly complex particularly semantic structure detailed semantic network infant learns express wider range meanings helping infant develop complex conceptual system lemmas around age four five child lemmas wide range diversity helps select right lemma needed produce correct reading infants enhances lexicon age children read exposed uncommon complex words million words child linguistically age child able speak full complete sentences similar adult httpsenwikipediaorgwikispeechproduction
