pegylation processes used date protein conjugation broadly classified two types namely solution phase batch process oncolumn fedbatch simple commonly adopted batch process involves mixing reagents together suitable buffer solution preferably temperature followed separation purification desired product using suitable technique based physicochemical properties including size exclusion

reactive group molecule coupled peg proteins typical reactive amino acids include lysine cysteine histidine arginine aspartic acid glutamic acid serine threonine tyrosine nterminal amino group
