common variable immunodeficiency cvid immune disorder characterized recurrent infections low antibody levels specifically immunoglobulin ig types igg igm symptoms generally include high susceptibility foreign invaders chronic lung disease inflammation infection gastrointestinal cvid affects males females equally condition found children teens generally diagnosed recognized adulthood average age diagnosis however symptoms vary greatly people variable refers heterogeneous clinical manifestations disorder include recurrent bacterial infections increased risk autoimmune disease lymphoma well gastrointestinal cvid lifelong disease symptoms cvid vary affected main features hypogammaglobulinemia recurrent infections hypogammaglobulinemia manifests significant decrease levels igg antibodies usually alongside iga antibodies igm antibody levels also decreased half infections direct result low antibody levels circulation adequately protect pathogens microorganisms frequently cause infections cvid haemophilus influenzae streptococcus pneumoniae staphylococcus aureus pathogens less often isolated affected include neisseria meningitidis pseudomonas aeruginosa giardia lamblia infections mostly affect respiratory tract nose sinuses bronchi lungs ears also occur sites eyes skin gastrointestinal tract infections respond antibiotics recur upon discontinuation antibiotics bronchiectasis develop severe recurrent pulmonary infections left untreated addition infections people cvid develop complications include anxiety depression occur result dealing cvid patients generally complain severe antibody deficiency common types infections illnesses involve ears sinuses nose lungs common infections include gastrovascular infections inflammation common cvid signs gastrovascular infection include abdominal pain nausea bloating vomiting diarrhea weight loss many individuals cvid impaired ability absorb nutrients including vitamins proteins minerals fats sugar within digestive due changes b cell development individuals cvid accumulations lymphocytes lymphoid cause mild severely swollen lymph nodes inflammation spleen addition certain percentage individuals cvid susceptible developing certain forms cancer without condition two common cancers patients common variable immunodeficiency include lymphoma certain stomach risk given cancers almost fifty times greater patients common variable immunodeficiency without people common variable immunodeficiency trouble fighting infections due lack antibodies produced normally resist invading due impaired antibody development vaccines effective recurring bacterial infections generally found upper lower areas respiratory tract many recurring lung infection report developing chronic lung diseases potentially lifethreatening complications later life cause cvid poorly understood likely cause deletions genes encode cell surface proteins cytokine receptors additionally disease defined cell defects namely reduced proliferative condition hard diagnose taking average six seven years cvid primary underlying causes cvid largely genetic mutations identified cause disease people familial inheritance accounts rather arising single genetic mutation cvid seems result variety mutations contribute failure antibody production mutations genes encoding icos taci baffr identified causative susceptibility cvid may also linked major histocompatibility complex mhc genome particularly drdq mutation gene recently shown cause cvidlike symptoms murine model frequency mutation cvid population however yet according european registry study mean age onset symptoms years per criteria laid esid european society immunodeficiencies pagid panamerican group immunodeficiency cvid diagnosed diagnosis chiefly exclusion ie alternative causes hypogammaglobulinemia xlinked agammaglobulinemia must excluded diagnosis cvid made diagnosis difficult diversity phenotypes seen people cvid example serum immunoglobulin levels people cvid vary greatly generally people grouped follows immunoglobulin production immunoglobulin ig production normal igm igg additionally b cell numbers also highly variable people detectable b cells reduced b cells within normal general people cvid display higher frequencies naive b cells lower frequencies classswitched memory b cells frequencies b cell populations igd memory b cells transitional b cells b cells also affected associated specific disease features although cvid often thought serum immunoglobulin b cellmediated disease cells display abnormal behavior affected individuals typically present low frequencies tcell marker decreased circulation regulatory cells inkt cells notably approximately people display cell counts lower particular phenotype cvid named locid late onset combined immunodeficiency poorer prognosis classical cvid following types cvid identified correspond mutations different gene segments treatment options limited usually include lifelong immunoglobulin replacement therapy thought help reduce bacterial infections treatment alone wholly effective many people still experience symptoms lung disease noninfectious inflammatory symptoms treatment replenishes ig subtypes person lacks given frequent intervals life thought help reduce bacterial infections boost immune therapy begins plasma donations tested known bloodborne pathogens pooled processed obtain concentrated igg samples infusions administered three different forms intravenously subcutaneously scig intramuscularly imig administration intravenous immunoglobulins requires insertion cannula needle vein usually arms hands highly concentrated product used ivig infusions take place every three four weeks subcutaneous infusions slowly release ig serum underneath skin needle take place every intramuscular infusions longer widely used painful likely cause reactions people often experience adverse side effects immunoglobulin infusions including addition ig replacement therapy treatment may also involve immune suppressants control autoimmune symptoms disease highdose steroids like cases antibiotics used fight chronic lung disease resulting outlook people varies greatly depending level lung organ damage prior diagnosis treatment cvid estimated prevalence disease seems less prevalent among asians african americans males females equally affected however among children boys recent study people europe primary immunodeficiencies found cvid opposed different people inherit disease typically autosomaldominant inheritance given rarity disease yet possible generalize prevalence among ethnic racial groups cvid shortens lifespan study currently median age recorded one study suggests median age death men women years old respectively patients involved study still people accompanying disorders worst prognosis survival years diagnosis cvidcaused frequent infections longest survival rates another study stating life expectancy almost equaling general uk additionally people cvid one noninfectious complications times higher risk death compared people infections immunodeficiencies comprise many diseases genetic defects affecting immune system roughly immunodeficiencies spanning genetic charles janeway sr generally credited first description case cvid case involved recurrent infections bronchiectasis cvid since emerged predominant class primary antibody deficiencies thought affect people worldwide though described standard definition cvid caused widespread confusion diagnosis european society immunodeficiency esid panamerican group immunodeficiency pagid developed diagnostic criteria disease including minimum age diagnosis need exclude conditions since publication criteria changed increasing minimum age diagnosis current research aimed studying large cohorts people cvid attempt better understand age onset well mechanism genetic factors progression funding research us provided national institutes
