na integrin alpha itgam one protein subunit forms heterodimeric integrin alpham molecule also known antigen complement receptor itgam also known cluster differentiation molecule second chain common integrin subunit known integrin thus belongs subfamily leukocyte expressed surface many leukocytes involved innate immune system including monocytes granulocytes macrophages natural killer cells subsets b mediates inflammation regulating leukocyte adhesion migration implicated several immune processes phagocytosis cellmediated cytotoxicity chemotaxis cellular involved complement system due capacity bind inactivated complement component itgam alpha subunit integrin directly involved causing adhesion spreading cells mediate cellular migration without presence genomewide association studies single nucleotide polymorphisms itgam strongest association systemic lupus erythematosus odds ratio allele histopathology immunohistochemistry antibodies frequently used identify macrophages microglia integrin molecule surface leukocytes plays important role cell migration adhesion transmigration across blood vessels bind components extracellular matrix intracellular adhesion molecules icams endothelial surface process important leukocyte recruitment site moreover important processes involvement precisely integrin involvement whole one phagocytosis opsonised particles complement component opsonised particles could bacteria apoptotic cells even immune complexes binding leads production antiinflammatory cytokines eg interleukin tumour growth factor beta tgfβ process important regulation inflammatory also involved differentiation osteoclasts bone remodelling cells expressed osteoclast progenitors seems part negative feedback also modulates functions leukocytes eg oxidative burst apoptosis binding fibrinogen circulating leukocytes expressed closed conformation switch active conformation follows quickly stimulation tolllike receptors tlr activated bind ligands high affinity eg binding molecules endothelium subsequent adhesion signalling also known interfere tlr signalling cell tlr stimulation results production proinflammatory cytokines eg via series phosphorylation signalling factors one nfκb transcription signalling fact negatively affected signalling consequently leads reduced activation nfκb lower production abovementioned proinflammatory cytokines conclude signalling negatively regulates leukocyte activation tlr beside tlr signalling also negatively regulates b cell receptor bcr signalling suppresses cell activation dendritic cell maturation regarding function apparent plays important role immune cell regulation regulation disrupted may lead higher susceptibility inflammatory autoimmune diseases examples would systemic lupus erythematosus sle lupus nephritis certain types genome wide association studies helped uncover main single nucleotide polymorphisms snps associated risk developing sle cardiovascular disease lupus nephritis complication usually occurring along sle snps result lower ability properly bind thus decreased cell adhesion phagocytosis reduced ability negatively regulate production proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor α tnfα tlr stimulation also observed plays protective role sle lupus nephritis owing antiinflammatory properties lupus nephritis characterised accumulation immune complexes kidneys overall immune infiltration kidneys results renal damage debilitating complication sle associated abovementioned mutations patients itgam snps higher serum levels interferon type ifni one risk factors developing sle lupus nephritis moreover higher levels proinflammatory cytokines tnfα tlr stimulation observed patients itgam snps drive inflammation disease causing tissue damage creation immune hence represents possible therapeutic target treatment sle indeed many attempts target made firstly antibodybased therapy proved ineffective case however therapies using small allosteric agonists seem promising tool activation leads regulation tlrdependant proinflammatory pathways protection renal seems potent player managing certain types solid tumours even though nowadays many tools cancer treatment exist multiple factors illness remain challenging topic one myeloidderived suppressor cells mdsc tumourassociated macrophages tams myeloid cells present tumour microenvironment possessing suppressor properties thus favouring tumour growth tams however tumourpromoting properties also display tumourinhibiting properties depends stimulation tumourinhibiting properties include production proinflammatory cytokines ability present using agonists seems importance tumour treatment agonist stabilize active conformation result higher adhesion endothelial ligands consequently impair ability transendothelial migration site inflammation agonist therapy development one promising candidate currently first clinical phase beginning agonist shows impaired transmigration suppressive tams site tumour modulation tams towards proinflammatory phenotype higher antigen presentation production proinflammatory cytokines therefore promising better tumour domain
