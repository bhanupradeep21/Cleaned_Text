colostrum first milk first form milk produced mammary glands humans mammals immediately following delivery may called beestings referring first milk cow similar species begin generate colostrum prior giving birth colostrum especially high amount bioactive compounds compared mature milk give newborn best possible start life specifically colostrum contains antibodies protect newborn disease infection immune growth factors bioactives help activate newborns immune system jumpstart gut function seed healthy gut microbiome first days life bioactives found colostrum essential newborns health growth colostrum strengthens babys immune system filled white blood cells protect infection birth surroundings newborn mammal change relatively sterile environment mothers uterus constant nutrient
