throughout recorded history attempts producing state general anesthesia traced back writings ancient sumerians babylonians assyrians egyptians indians chinese despite significant advances anatomy surgical technique renaissance surgery remained lastresort treatment largely due pain associated however scientific discoveries late early centuries paved way development modern anesthetic techniquescitation needed late century two major advances enabled transition modern surgery development application antiseptic techniques result germ theory disease reduced morbidity mortality rates advances pharmacology physiology led development general anesthesia pain control century general anesthesias safety efficacy improved routine use tracheal intubation advanced airway management techniques monitoring new anesthetic agents improved characteristics standardized training programs anesthesiologists nurse anesthetists emerged period moreover application economic business
