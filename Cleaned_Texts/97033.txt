social psychology group polarization refers tendency group make decisions extreme initial inclination members extreme decisions towards greater risk individuals initial tendencies risky towards greater caution individuals initial tendencies phenomenon also holds groups attitude toward situation may change sense individuals initial attitudes strengthened intensified group discussion phenomenon known attitude group polarization important phenomenon social psychology observable many social contexts example group women hold moderately feminist views tend demonstrate heightened profeminist beliefs following group similarly studies shown deliberating together mock jury members often decided punitive damage awards either larger smaller amount individual juror favored prior studies indicated jurors favored relatively low award discussion would lead even lenient result jury inclined impose stiff penalty discussion would make even moreover recent years internet online social media also presented opportunities observe group polarization compile new research psychologists found social media outlets facebook twitter demonstrate group polarization occur even group physically together long group individuals begins fundamental opinion topic consistent dialogue kept going group polarization research suggested wellestablished groups suffer less polarization groups discussing problems well known however situations groups somewhat newly formed tasks new group polarization demonstrate profound influence attitude polarization also known belief polarization polarization effect phenomenon disagreement becomes extreme different parties consider evidence issue one effects confirmation bias tendency people search interpret evidence selectively reinforce current beliefs people encounter ambiguous evidence bias potentially result interpreting support existing attitudes widening rather narrowing disagreement effect observed issues activate emotions political hotbutton issues new evidence produce polarization issues polarization found mere thinking issue without contemplating new evidence produces social comparison processes also invoked explanation effect increased settings people repeat validate others apparent tendency interest psychologists also since late psychologists carried number studies various aspects attitude polarization charles lord lee ross mark performed study selected two groups people one group strongly favor capital punishment strongly opposed researchers initially measured strength people held position later pro anticapital punishment people put small groups shown one two cards containing statement results research project written example kroner phillips compared murder rates year year adoption capital punishment states states murder rates lower adoption death penalty research supports deterrent effect death palmer crandall compared murder rates pairs neighboring states different capital punishment laws pairs murder rates higher state capital punishment research opposes deterrent effect death researchers asked people strength beliefs deterrence effect death penalty time also asked effect research attitudes next stage research participants given information study described card received including details research critiques research researchers responses critiques participants degree commitment original positions remeasured participants asked quality research effect research beliefs finally trial rerun participants using card supported opposite position initially seen researchers found people tended believe research supported original views better conducted convincing research whichever position held initially people tended hold position strongly reading research supported lord et al point reasonable people less critical research supports current position seems less rational people significantly increase strength attitudes read supporting people read research supported views research tended hold original attitudes strongly received results understood context several problems implementation study including fact researchers changed scaling outcome variable measuring attitude change impossible measured polarization using subjective assessment attitude change direct measure much change group polarization choice shifts similar many ways however differ one distinct way group polarization refers attitude change individual level due influence group choice shift refers outcome attitude change namely difference average group members pregroup discussion attitudes outcome group risky cautious shifts part generalized idea known groupinduced attitude polarization though group polarization deals mainly riskinvolving decisions andor opinions discussioninduced shifts shown occur several nonriskinvolving levels suggests general phenomenon choiceshifts exists apart riskrelated decisionsclarification needed stoner found decision impacted values behind circumstances study found situations normally favor risky alternative increased risky shifts situations normally favor cautious alternative increased cautious shifts findings also show importance previous group shifts choice shifts mainly explained largely differing human values highly values held individual according moscovici et al interaction within group differences opinion necessary group polarization take extremist group may sway opinion shift occur sufficient proper interaction within group words extremist impact without interaction also moscovici et al found individual preferences irrelevant differences opinion cause finding demonstrates one opinion group sway group combination individual opinions make impact study group polarization traced back unpublished masters thesis mit student james stoner observed socalled risky concept risky shift maintains groups decisions riskier average individual decisions members group met early studies riskyshift phenomenon measured using scale known choicedilemmas questionnaire measure required participants consider hypothetical scenario individual faced dilemma must make choice resolve issue hand participants asked estimate probability certain choice would benefit risk individual discussed consider following example mr electrical engineer married one child working large electronics corporation since graduating college five years ago assured lifetime job modest though adequate salary liberal pension benefits upon retirement hand unlikely salary increase much retires attending convention mr offered job small newly founded company highly uncertain future new job would pay start would offer possibility share owner ship company survived competition larger firms participants asked imagine advising mr would provided series probabilities indicate whether new company offered position financially stable would read following please check lowest probability would consider acceptable make worthwhile mr take new job chances company prove financially sound chances company prove financially sound chances company prove financially sound chances company prove financially sound chances company prove financially sound place check think mr take new job matter probabilities individuals completed questionnaire made decisions independently others later would asked join group reassess choices indicated shifts mean value initial studies using method revealed group decisions tended relatively riskier made individuals tendency also occurred individual judgments collected group discussion even individual postdiscussion measures delayed two six discovery risky shift considered surprising counterintuitive especially since earlier work allport researchers suggested individuals made extreme decisions groups leading expectation groups would make decisions would conform average risk level seemingly counterintuitive findings stoner led spurt research around risky shift originally thought special case exception standard decisionmaking practice many people concluded people group setting would make decisions based assumed overall risk level group stoners work necessarily address specific theme seem contrast stoners initial definition risky shift additional controversy arose leading researchers examine topic late however become clear risky shift one type many attitudes became extreme groups leading moscovici zavalloni term overall phenomenon group subsequently decadelong period examination applicability group polarization number fields lab field settings began substantial amount empirical evidence demonstrating phenomenon group polarization group polarization widely considered fundamental group decisionmaking process well established remained nonobvious puzzling mechanisms fully understood almost soon phenomenon group polarization discovered number theories offered help explain account explanations gradually narrowed grouped together two primary mechanisms remained social comparison informational influence social comparison theory normative influence theory widely used explain group polarization according social comparison interpretation group polarization occurs result individuals desire gain acceptance perceived favorable way group theory holds people first compare ideas held rest group observe evaluate group values prefers order gain acceptance people take position similar everyone elses slightly extreme individuals support groups beliefs still presenting admirable group leaders presence member extreme viewpoint attitude polarize studies regarding theory demonstrated normative influence likely judgmental issues group goal harmony personoriented group members public informational influence persuasive arguments theory also used explain group polarization recognized psychologists today persuasive arguments interpretation holds individuals become convinced views hear novel arguments support position theory posits group member enters discussion aware set items information arguments favoring sides issue lean toward side boasts greater amount information words individuals base individual choices weighing remembered pro con arguments items arguments shared among members items unshared one member considered arguments assuming group members lean direction discussion items unshared information supporting direction expressed provides members previously unaware reason lean direction group discussion shifts weight evidence group member expresses arguments shedding light onto number different positions research indicated informational influence likely intellective issues group goal making correct decision taskoriented group members private furthermore research suggests simply sharing information predicts group polarization rather amount information persuasiveness arguments mediate level polarization significant arguments occurred whether persuasive argumentation alone accounted group polarization daniel isenbergs metaanalysis data gathered persuasive argument social comparison camps succeeded large part answering questions predominant mechanisms isenberg concluded substantial evidence effects operating simultaneously persuasive arguments theory operated social comparison vice two theories widely accepted explanations group polarization alternative theories proposed popular theories selfcategorization theory selfcategorization theory stems social identity theory holds conformity stems psychological processes member group defined subjective perception self member specific accordingly proponents selfcategorization model hold group polarization occurs individuals identify particular group conform prototypical group position extreme group mean contrast social comparison theory persuasive argumentation theory selfcategorization model maintains intergroup categorization processes cause group polarization support selfcategorization theory explains group polarization conformity polarized norm found hogg turner davidson experiment participants gave pretest posttest group consensus recommendations three choice dilemma itemtypes risky neutral cautious researchers hypothesized ingroup confronted risky outgroup polarize toward caution ingroup confronted caution outgroup polarize toward risk ingroup middle social frame reference confronted risky cautious outgroups polarize converge pretest results study supported hypothesis participants converged norm polarized toward risk risky items toward caution cautious another similar study found ingroup prototypes become polarized group becomes extreme social lends support selfcategorization explanation group polarization rising popularity increased number online social media platforms facebook twitter instagram enabled people seek share ideas others similar interests common values making group polarization effects increasingly evident particularly generation generation z similar social media platforms video streaming platforms like youtube forming groups unconsciously intelligent algorithm seeking extreme owing technology possible individuals curate sources information opinions exposed thereby reinforcing strengthening views effectively avoiding information perspectives one study analyzed tweets twitter regarding shooting george tiller late term abortion doctor tweets analyzed conversations among supporters opponents abortion rights post shooting study found likeminded individuals strengthened group identity whereas replies differentminded individuals reinforced split study conducted sia et al group polarization found occur online computermediated discussions particular study found group discussions conducted discussants distributed see one another anonymous identify one another environment lead even higher levels group polarization compared traditional meetings attributed greater numbers novel arguments generated due persuasive arguments theory higher incidence oneupmanship behaviors due social however research suggests important differences arise measuring group polarization laboratory versus field experiments study conducted taylor macdonald featured realistic setting computermediated discussion group polarization occur level studys results also showed groupthink occurs less computermediated discussions people face face moreover computermediated discussions often fail result group consensus lead less satisfaction consensus reached compared groups operating natural environment furthermore experiment took place twoweek period leading researchers suggest group polarization may occur shortterm overall results suggest may group polarization prevalent previous studies suggest group theories general may simply transferable seen computerrelated group polarization widely discussed terms political behavior see political polarization researchers identified increase affective polarization among united states electorate report hostility discrimination towards opposing political party increased dramatically group polarization similarly influential legal contexts study assessed whether federal district court judges behaved differently sat alone small groups demonstrated judges sat alone took extreme action time whereas judges sat group three took extreme action time results noteworthy indicate even trained professional decisionmakers subject influences group group polarization reported occur wartime times conflict helps account partially violent behavior researchers suggested instance ethnic conflict exacerbates group polarization enhancing identification ingroup hostility towards polarization occur type conflict damaging effects largescale intergroup public policy international conflicts smaller scale group polarization also seen everyday lives students higher education study myers reported initial differences among american college students become accentuated time example students belong fraternities sororities tend liberal politically difference increases course college careers researchers theorize least partially explained group polarization group members tend reinforce one anothers proclivities
