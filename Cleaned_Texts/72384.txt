filippi syndrome also known syndactyly type microcephaly mental retardation rare autosomal recessive genetic limited number cases reported filippi syndrome associated diverse symptoms varying severity across affected individuals example malformation digits craniofacial abnormalities intellectual disability growth diagnosis filippi syndrome done clinical observation radiography genetic filippi syndrome cured directly hence main focus treatments tackling symptoms observed affected first reported symptoms filippi syndrome congenital apparent occurrence severity symptoms variable across affected progression symptoms ones lifetime thoroughly studied due small number people filippi syndrome malformations digits expressed among people filippi one common malformations webbing fusion digits termed particular syndactyly third fourth fingers second third fourth toes termed syndactyly type degree syndactyly may differ across affected individuals exhibiting syndactyly soft tissues skin severe cases exhibiting syndactyly digital malformations digits include clinodactyly curving fifth fingers brachydactyly abnormal shortening brachydactyly believed largely due abnormalities arising bones inside hands feet specifically metacarpals furthermore people filippi syndrome exhibit craniofacial craniofacial abnormalities birth defects observed head face region affected craniofacial abnormalities present people filippi syndrome include microcephaly skull smaller normal prominent elevated nasal bridge hypertelorism ones pair eyes apart normal underdeveloped nasal alae underdeveloped tissues surrounding less common craniofacial abnormalities include broad forehead thin vermilion border thin upper lip frontal hirsutism hairy people filippi syndrome may also demonstrate varying degrees intellectual affected individuals may experience defective speech development aphasia experiencing difficulty finding appropriate words use vision impairment inability another characteristic symptom people filippi syndrome occurrence growth retardation also referred growth growth delays may either prenatal postnatal meaning occur particular delayed bone maturation observed patients filippi people filippi syndrome may exhibit physical abnormalities examples abnormalities include dwarfism severely short stature dislocated elbows decreased joint mobility muscular hypotonia weak muscle tone involuntary muscle may also exhibit abnormal conditions skin moreover portion affected males may demonstrate cryptorchidism condition testes fail descend filippi syndrome genetic disease autosomal recessive inheritance pattern cytoskeleton associated protein like autosomal recessive inheritance pattern means disease trait exhibited individual copies disease gene

mutation ultimately results premature termination codon formation termination codon position forward mutations include base pair transition start codon starting site translation transition mutation occurring codon disrupts codon sequence abolishes prevents cell carrying translation gene diagnosis filippi syndrome mostly done initial diagnosis disease relies clinical observation symptoms including different degrees syndactyly craniofacial abnormalities exhibited affected diagnosis also done radiography checks malformation confirmation diagnosis requires use genetic specifically done detecting mutations gene total eight causative variants genetic testing filippi syndrome makes use three major techniques currently filippi syndrome direct cure treated according observed symptoms affected syndactyly exhibit varying degrees severity hence affected individuals condition must undergo surgical example syndactyly occurs proximal end digits may limited effect normal functioning hand foot correction surgery simple syndactyly condition cutaneous fusion two digits treated surgically rebuilding hourglass shape web space surgery incision first carried separate fused followed reconstruction web spaces side walls using dorsal advancement flaps skin grafts obtained affected individuals reconstruction additional fingerpulp flaps required rebuilding nailfold nail bed surrounding skin occurrence syndactyly tip treatment complex syndactyly refers bony fusion two digits higher degree complexity involves reconstruction web space well highly specific surgical procedures accordance different types bony may also require separation relocation flexor digitorum profundus tendondiverted transplantation structure tendons fused digits also affected professionals usually advice affected individuals receive surgical treatment first two years life avoid hindrance motor ability craniofacial abnormalities corrected surgical methods affected individuals severe hypertelorism may undergo orbital two major osteotomy methods box osteotomy facial bipartition operate different osteotomy sites follow general surgery part bone sometimes excessive skin selectively removed central area nasofrontal region part skull close correct addition bone grafts placed provide support eyeballs protect underdeveloped nasal alae corrected orofacial reconstruction procedure recreates nasal alae use cartilage grafts cartilage taken patients ear septum afterwards nasolabial flaps placed sustain shape nose specifically alar patients affected speech impairments treated speech speech disability manifestation various physical psychological causes symptomatic treatment carried diagnostic tests video fluoroscopic barium study cookie swallow test fiberoptic endoscopic despite diversity speech therapy techniques treatment plans follow posttreatment monitoring computerbased speech therapy makes use instructional software provide computerled practices aftercare quantify performances outside conventional filippi syndrome rare estimated prevalence less one around thirty cases recorded medical number affected males recorded twice number affected however insufficient conclude male higher risk due small number reported however cdc says less cases national organization rare disorders says cases national center advancing translational sciences says cases
