ejaculation two phases emission ejaculation proper emission phase ejaculatory reflex control sympathetic nervous system ejaculatory phase control spinal reflex level spinal nerves via pudendal nerve refractory period succeeds ejaculation sexual stimulation precedes human penis argued several evolutionary adaptations purpose adaptations maximise reproductive success minimise sperm competition sperm competition sperm two males simultaneously resides within reproductive tract female compete fertilise sperm competition results rival males sperm fertilising egg cuckoldry could occur process whereby males unwittingly invest resources offspring another male evolutionarily speaking researched human penis adaptations testis penis size ejaculate adjustment semen evolution caused sexually selected adaptations occur penis testis size order maximise reproductive success minimise sperm sperm competition caused human penis evolve length size sperm retention achieve penis must sufficient length reach rival sperm maximally fill order ensure female retains males sperm adaptations length human penis occurred ejaculate placed close female achieved complete penetration occurs penis pushes adaptations occurred order release retain sperm highest point vaginal tract result adaptation also leaves sperm less vulnerable sperm displacement semen loss another reason adaptation due nature human posture gravity creates vulnerability semen loss therefore long penis places ejaculate deep vaginal tract could reduce loss another evolutionary theory penis size female mate choice associations social judgements modernday study illustrates female mate choice influence penis size presented females lifesize rotatable computer generated males varied height body shape flaccid penis size aspects examples female ratings attractiveness male revealed larger penises associated higher attractiveness relations penis size attractiveness therefore led frequently emphasized associations masculinity penis size popular led social bias existing around penis size larger penises preferred higher social status reflected association believed sexual prowess penis size social judgement penis size relation like penis sperm competition caused human testicles evolve size sexual means large testicles example sexually selected adaptation human testicles moderately sized compared animals gorillas chimpanzees placing somewhere large testicles advantageous sperm competition due ability produce bigger research shown positive correlation exists number sperm ejaculated testis larger testes also shown predict higher sperm quality including larger number motile sperm higher sperm research also demonstrated evolutionary adaptations testis size dependent breeding system species singlemale breeding monogamous show smaller testis size multimale breeding systems extrapair copulation epc societies human males live largely monogamous societies like gorillas therefore testis size smaller comparison primates multimale breeding systems chimpanzees reason differentiation testis size order succeed reproductively multimale breeding system males must possess ability produce several fully fertilising ejaculations one however case monogamous societies reduction fertilising ejaculations effect reproductive reflected humans sperm count ejaculations decreased copulation occurs three five times one primary ways males ejaculate evolved overcome sperm competition speed travels ejaculates travel centimetres timequantify combined placement highest point vaginal tract acts increase males chances egg fertilised sperm opposed potential rival males sperm thus maximising paternal addition males ejaculates response sperm competition according likely costbenefits mating particular research focused primarily two fundamental ways males go achieving adjusting ejaculate size adjusting ejaculate quality number sperm given ejaculate varies one ejaculate variation hypothesised males attempt eliminate reduce sperm competition male alter number sperm inseminates female according perceived level sperm inseminating higher number sperm suspects greater level competition males support ejaculate adjustment research shown male typically increases amount inseminates sperm partner separated period largely due fact less time couple able spend together chances female inseminated another male hence greater sperm competition increasing number sperm male inseminates female acts get rid rival males sperm may stored within female result potential extrapair copulations epcs separation increasing amount inseminates partner following separation male increases chances paternal certainty increase number sperm male produces response sperm competition observed masturbatory males also adjust ejaculates response sperm competition terms quality research demonstrated example simply viewing sexually explicit image female two males ie high sperm competition cause males produce greater amount motile sperm viewing sexually explicit image depicting exclusively three females ie low sperm much like increasing number increasing quality sperm male inseminates female enhances paternal certainty threat sperm competition high females phenotypic quality key determinant males ejaculate research shown males produce larger ejaculates containing better motile sperm mating higher quality largely reduce males sperm competition since attractive females likely approached subsequently inseminated males less attractive females increasing investment females high quality phenotypic traits therefore acts offset ejaculate investment addition female attractiveness shown indicator reproductive quality greater value higher quality therefore beneficial males increase ejaculate size quality mating attractive females since likely maximise reproductive success also assessing females phenotypic quality males judge whether invest invest particular female influence subsequent ejaculate adjustment shape human penis thought evolved result sperm semen displacement adaptation shape penis draw foreign semen away cervix means event rival males sperm residing within reproductive tract female human penis able displace rival sperm replacing semen displacement two main benefits male firstly displacing rival males sperm risk rival sperm fertilising egg reduced thus minimising risk sperm secondly male replaces rivals sperm therefore increasing chance fertilising egg successfully reproducing female however males ensure displace sperm thought relatively quick loss erection ejaculation penile hypersensitivity following ejaculation shallower slower thrusting male ejaculation prevents coronal ridge part human penis thought evolved allow semen displacement research studied much semen displaced differently shaped artificial research showed combined thrusting coronal ridge penis able remove seminal fluid rival male within female reproductive tract forcing semen frenulum coronal ridge causing collect behind coronal ridge model penises without coronal ridge used less half artificial sperm displaced compared penises coronal presence coronal ridge alone however sufficient effective semen displacement must combined adequate thrusting successful shown deeper thrusting larger semen displacement semen displacement occurs shallow therefore termed thrusting semen displacement behaviours associated semen displacement namely thrusting number thrusts depth thrusts duration sexual shown vary according whether male perceives risk partner infidelity high males females report greater semen displacement behaviours following allegations infidelity particular following allegations infidelity males females report deeper quicker thrusting sexual circumcision suggested affect semen displacement circumcision causes coronal ridge pronounced hypothesised could enhance semen supported females reports sexual intercourse circumcised males females report vaginal secretions diminish intercourse circumcised male progresses circumcised males thrust therefore suggested pronounced coronal ridge combined deeper thrusting causes vaginal secretions female displaced
