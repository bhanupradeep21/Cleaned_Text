tianyuraptor dromaeosaurinae velociraptorinae andrea cau argues halszkaraptor characteristics allowed spend time water land including strong hindlimbs running smaller flipperlike forelimbs swimming short tail would brought centre gravity front useful swimming walking torso would held vertical normal theropods end adaptations improved extension hindlimb hip joint thighbone many sharp backwardcurving teeth mouth long neck sensory neurons snout may allowed detect vibrations water leading scientists believe hunted aquatic prey come onto land reproduce like dinosaurs needed lay eggs recent analysis performed cau specifically points similarities modernday mergansers stated birds probably closest ecological analogs halszkaraptor share similar traits dromaeosaurid taxon long neck serrated snout edge used catch small prey less active moving land assuming hipextended body posture water use distinct swimming model including forelimbpropelled locomotion particular behaviour also inferred halszkaraptor seems support piscivorous aquatic lifestyle similar researchers either disagreed merely followed caus interpretation brownstein argued features noted halszkaraptor directly support ability swim also suggested dinosaur may basal dromaeosaur transitional although cau rebutted claims year hone holtz noted since halszkaraptor many modern aquatic birds flattened unguals said semiaquatic flattened unguals like spinosaurus necessarily suggest animal swim didnt propose view dinosaurs potential ability fabbri colleagues argued semiaquatic ecology halszkaraptor noting low bone density trait observed semiaquatic response cau pointed blog swans similarly low bone density yet adaptations semiaquatic httpsenwikipediaorgwikihalszkaraptor
