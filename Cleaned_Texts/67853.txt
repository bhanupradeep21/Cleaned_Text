sulfonylureas sulphonylureas class organic compounds used medicine agriculture functional group consists sulfonyl group sulphur atom bonded nitrogen atom ureylene group nndehydrourea dehydrogenated derivative urea side chains distinguish various sulfonylureas sulfonylureas divided classes basis therapeutic efficiency antidiabetic action include acetohexamide carbutamide chlorpropamide glycyclamide tolcyclamide metahexamide tolazamide tolbutamide include glibenclamide glyburide glibornuride glipizide gliquidone glisoxepide glyclopyramide include glimepiride although sometimes considered secondgeneration widely used antidiabetic drugs management diabetes mellitus type act increasing secretion insulin beta cells sulfonylureas ineffective absolute deficiency insulin production type diabetes postpancreatectomycitation needed sulfonylureas used treat types neonatal diabetes historically people hyperglycemia low blood insulin levels diagnosed type diabetes default found patients receive diagnosis months age often candidates receiving sulfonylureas rather insulin throughout cochrane systematic review evaluated effects treatment latent autoimmune diabetes adults lada found sulfonylureas improve metabolic control glucose months even worsening levels cases compared review find improvement fasting cpeptide following treatment still important highlight studies available included review presented considerable flaws quality prior sulfonylureas associated worse outcomes newer agents appear increase risk death heart attacks reinforced cochrane systematic review find enough evidence reduction allcause mortality serious adverse events cardiovascular mortality nonfatal myocardial infarction nonfatal stroke endstage renal disease comparing metformin monotherapy review also find improvement healthrelated quality individuals impairedglucose tolerance systematic review found one suitable trial comparing effects sulphonylurea metformin reduction delay risk developing type diabetes however trial report patientrelevant another systematic review completed year suggested limited evidence combined used metformin sulphonylurea compared combination metformin plus another glucoselowering intervention provides benefit harm mortality severe adverse events macrovascular microvascular combined metformin sulphonylurea therapy appear lead higher risk sulfonylureas also used experimentally inhibit release interleukin beta many sulfonylureas also used herbicides interfere plant biosynthesis certain amino sulfonylureas opposed metformin thiazolidinediones pramlintide newer treatments may induce hypoglycemia result excesses insulin production release hypoglycemia appears happen often sulfonylureas compared typically occurs dose high patient fasting people attempt change eating habits prevent however counterproductive like insulin sulfonylureas induce weight gain mainly result effect increase insulin levels thus use glucose metabolic fuels sideeffects gastrointestinal upset headache hypersensitivity reactions safety sulfonylurea therapy pregnancy unestablished prolonged hypoglycemia days reported children borne mothers taking sulfonylureas time impairment liver kidney function increase risk hypoglycemia contraindications since antidiabetic drugs used either circumstances insulin therapy typically recommended pregnancy liver kidney failure although newer agents offer potentially better options cochrane review found evidence treatment lada using sulfonylureas lead earlier insulin dependence approximately cochrane review found tentative evidence people treated sulfonylureas fewer nonfatal cardiovascular events treated metformin rr higher risk severe hypoglycemia rr enough data available determine risk mortality cardiovascular earlier review group found statistically significant increase risk cardiovascular death first generation sulfonylureas relative placebo rr enough data determine relative risk first generation sulfonylureas relative insulin rr likewise possible determine relative mortality risk second generation sulfonylureas relative metformin rr insulin rr fda requires sulfonylureas carry label warning regarding increased risk cardiovascular cochrane systematic review comparing metformin monotherapy sulfonylureas find enough evidence reduction allcause mortality serious adverse events cardiovascular mortality nonfatal myocardial infarction nonfatal stroke endstage renal secondgeneration sulfonylureas increased potency weight compared firstgeneration sulfonylureas similarly accord action control cardiovascular risk vadt veterans affairs diabetes studies showed reduction heart attack death patients assigned tight glucose control various drugs drugs potentiate prolong effects sulfonylureas therefore increase risk hypoglycemia include acetylsalicylic acid derivatives allopurinol sulfonamides fibrates drugs worsen glucose tolerance contravening effects antidiabetics include corticosteroids isoniazid oral contraceptives estrogens sympathomimetics thyroid hormones sulfonylureas tend interact wide variety drugs interactions well clinical significance vary substance
