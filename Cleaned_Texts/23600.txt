kind autonoetic selfknowing consciousness required firstperson subjective experience previously lived events whereas semantic memory associated noetic knowing consciousness require mental become increasingly clear semantic episodic memory integral thinking mental time travel however specifically refers autonoetic systems thus selectively comprises episodic memory episodic foresight close link

mental time travel including individual differences relating instantiation artificial intelligence relationship theory study mental time travel general terms also related distinct study way individuals differ terms future time temporal various neuroimaging studies elucidated brain systems underlying capacity mental time travel adults early fmri studies topic revealed number close correspondences remembering past experiences imagining future experiences brain addis et al conducted fmri study examine neural regions mediating construction elaboration past future elaboration phase unlike construction phase overlap cortical areas comprising autobiographical memory retrieval network study also found left hippocampus right middle occipital gyrus significantly activated past future event construction right hippocampus significantly deactivated past event construction activated creation future eventscitation needed episodic future thinking involves multiple component processes retrieval integration relevant information memory processing subjective time selfreferential dargembeau et als study found ventral medial prefrontal cortex posterior cingulate cortex activated areas imagining future events relevant ones personal goals unrelated ones shows brain regions play role personal goal processing critical feature episodic future thinkingcitation needed cabeza et al conducted positron emission tomography pet scan study group human test subjects identify brain regions involved temporal memory based linear progression events since recollecting past episode involves remembering happened also happened pet scans used find areas brain activated trying remember certain word results show temporalorder memory past events involves frontal posterior brain regions item retrieval shows neural activity medial temporal basal fore brain ability travel mentally time especially future highlighted potential prime mover human evolution enabling humans prepare plan shape future however question whether extent animals human beings engage mental time travel remained one proposal bischofk√∂hler posits nonhuman animals act upon drive states currently possess example seeking water currently fully quenched proposals suggest different species may capacities limited shortcomings range component capacities mental scenario building number studies claimed demonstrated mental time travel animals including notably various great apes crows ravens western scrub subjected number criticisms simpler alternative explanations proposed debate mental time travel unique humans

identified rely degree capacity remember past imagine functions include predicting future emotional reactions affective deliberate intertemporal prospective counterfactual osvath et al conducted study apes show ability foresight study consisted testing selfcontrol associative learning envisioning chimpanzees orangutans series critics questioned whether animals truly exhibited mental time travel whether associative learning caused behave bischofkohler hypothesis says animals anticipate future needs study osvath tried disprove hypothesiscitation needed scientists showed apes presented food item conjunction utensil could used actually eat particular food animals chose utensil instead food anticipated future need utensil overcame current want food reward example mental time travel animals result associative learning actually chose utensil instead food reward since scientists ran another experiment account examples food caching birds may examples mental time travel nonhumans even survival instinct certain animals elephants response imminent danger could involve mental time travel mechanismscitation needed another study show great apes ability foresight conducted martinordas g et al scientists able show apes remember integrated fashion particular event two experiments conducted study first investigation content memories apes ie could animals remember two types food shown hidden second experiment explored structure memories found apes memories formed integrated structure findings suggest instinctive learning predispositions made animals behave way rather ability mentally time travel however comparative psychologists divided conclusion study show birds exhibit episodiclike memory clayton et al used behavioral criteria content structure flexibility decide whether food caching habits birds evidence ability recall past plan content involved remembering happened based specific past experience structure required formation whatwherewhen representation event finally flexibility used see well information could organized reorganized based facts experiences mental time travel involves use episodic future thinking semantic knowledge study also contradicts bischofkohler hypothesis showing animals may mentally time travel future back past however interpretation remained controversial studies development mental time travel infancy suggest involved component processes come online piece piece required psychological subcomponents appear available approximately age includes fundamental capacity prepare two mutually exclusive possible future events appears develop ages two threeyearold children report information upcoming events ages four five children talk clearly future however concern children may understand articulate may say things without fully understanding thus researchers tried examine futureoriented carefully controlled study found fouryearolds could already remember specific problem saw different room sufficiently enough prepare future results suggest children end preschool years developed fundamental capacity foresight capacities continue develop throughout childhood studies mental time travel require measurement episodic memory episodic foresight episodic memory typically measured human adults asking people report describe past events experienced many studies provide participants information one point study assess memory information later point study advantage studies allow accuracy recall assessed however cheke clayton found different measurements memory mutually correspond enough may therefore capture different facets general limitation studies field fail capture peoples actual memories reallife events like studied animals many studies focus asking people recall episodes lives attempt verify accuracy recall comparing participants memories family friends relatives experienced cases comparing peoples memories event public information however always easy verify accuracy recall many measures episodic memory focusing instead aspects peoples verbal descriptions memories three commonly used measures verify accuracy peoples memories follows dritschel et al adapted controlled oral word association test assess fluency people recall personal autobiographical episodes specific given time periods eg last week last year last years etc specific time limit eg baddeley wilson used scale
