occipital bone ˌɒkˈsɪpɪtəl cranial dermal bone main bone occiput back lower part skull trapezoidal shape curved like shallow dish occipital bone overlies occipital lobes cerebrum base skull occipital bone large oval opening called foramen magnum allows passage spinal cord like cranial bones classed flat bone due many attachments features occipital bone described terms separate parts front back basilar part also called basioccipital sides foramen magnum lateral parts also called exoccipitals back named squamous part basilar part thick somewhat quadrilateral piece front foramen magnum directed towards pharynx squamous part curved expanded plate behind foramen magnum largest part occipital bone due embryonic derivation paraxial mesoderm opposed neural crest many craniofacial bones derived posited occipital bone whole could considered giant vertebra enlarged support occipital bone like seven cranial bones outer inner layers also called plates tables cortical bone tissue cancellous bone tissue known cranial bones diploë bone especially thick ridges protuberances condyles anterior part basilar part inferior cerebellar fossae thin semitransparent without diploë near middle outer surface squamous part occipital largest part prominence external occipital protuberance highest point called inion inion along midline squamous part foramen magnum runs ridge external occipital crest also called medial nuchal line gives attachment nuchal ligament running across outside occipital bone three curved lines one line medial line runs foramen magnum known nuchal lines give attachment various ligaments muscles named highest superior inferior nuchal lines inferior nuchal line runs across midpoint median nuchal line area highest nuchal line termed occipital plane area line termed nuchal plane inner surface occipital bone forms base posterior cranial fossa foramen magnum large hole situated middle clivus smooth part occipital bone travelling upwards front median internal occipital crest travels behind internal occipital protuberance serves point attachment falx cerebri sides foramen sitting junction lateral base occipital bone hypoglossal canals junction occipital petrous portion temporal bone lies jugular inner surface occipital bone marked dividing lines shallow ridges form four fossae depressions lines called cruciform crossshaped eminence midpoint lines intersect raised part formed called internal occipital protuberance side eminence runs groove transverse sinuses two midline skull landmarks foramen magnum basion anterior point opening opisthion point opposite posterior part basion lines dens foramen magnum latin large hole large oval foramen longest front back wider behind front encroached upon occipital condyles clivus smooth bony section travels upwards front surface foramen median internal occipital crest travels behind foramen passes medulla oblongata membranes accessory nerves vertebral arteries anterior posterior spinal arteries tectorial membrane alar ligaments superior angle occipital bone articulates occipital angles parietal bones fetal skull corresponds position posterior fontanelle lateral angles situated extremities groove transverse sinuses received interval mastoid angle parietal bone mastoid portion temporal bone inferior angle fused body sphenoid bone superior borders extend superior lateral angles deeply serrated articulation occipital borders parietals form union lambdoidal suture inferior borders extend lateral angles inferior angle upper half articulates mastoid portion corresponding temporal lower half petrous part bone two portions inferior border separated one another jugular process notch anterior surface forms posterior part jugular foramen lambdoid suture occipitomastoid suture lambdoid suture joins occipital bone parietal bones occipitomastoid suture joins occipital bone mastoid portion temporal bone sphenobasilar suture joins basilar part occipital bone back sphenoid bone body petrousbasilar suture joins side edge basilar part occipital bone petrouspart temporal bone occipital plane fig squamous part occipital bone developed membrane may remain separate throughout life constitutes interparietal bone rest bone developed cartilage number nuclei occipital plane usually given four two appearing near middle line second month two little distance middle line third month fetal life nuchal plane squamous part ossified two centers appear seventh week fetal life soon unite form single piece union upper lower portions squamous part takes place third month fetal life occasional centre kerckring appears posterior margin foramen magnum fifth month forms separate ossicle sometimes double unites rest squamous part birth lateral parts begins ossify single center eighth week fetal life basilar portion ossified two centers one front appear sixth week fetal life rapidly coalesce occipital plane said ossified two centers basilar portion one fourth year squamous part two lateral parts unite sixth year bone consists single piece years occipital sphenoid bone become united forming single bone trauma occiput cause fracture base skull called basilar skull fracture basiondens line seen radiograph distance basion top dens used diagnosis dissociation genetic disorders cause prominent occiput found edwards syndrome syndrome identification location fetal occiput important delivery occipital stems latin occiput back skull ob behind caput head distinguished sinciput anterior part many animals parts stay separate throughout life example dog four parts squamous part supraoccipital lateral right parts exoccipital basilar part basioccipital occipital bone part endocranium basal portion skull chondrichthyes agnatha occipital form separate element remains part chondrocranium throughout life higher vertebrates foramen magnum surrounded ring four bones basioccipital lies front opening two exoccipital condyles lie either side larger supraoccipital lies posterior forms least part rear cranium many bony fish amphibians supraoccipital never ossified remains cartilage throughout life primitive forms basioccipital exoccipitals somewhat resemble centrum neural arches vertebra form similar manner embryo together latter bones usually form single concave circular condyle articulation first mammals however condyle divided two pattern otherwise seen amphibians mammals also single fused occipital bone formed four separate elements around foramen magnum along paired postparietal bones form rear cranial roof position occipital bone shown green
