minutes prerendered cutscenes created game makoto kamiya professional film director hired direct work elements camera angles would look dino crisis received mixed reviews according review aggregator ign gave game describing missedopportunity advance series betrayed minor repetitive gamespot branded game mediocre found game frustrating fun due flaws though finding game enjoyable common criticism camera system named ign worst camera ever problem due high speeds player frequently travel first two dino crisis titles early elements resident evil series rooms dino crisis separated separate invisible zones camera set change boundary crossed fastmoving jetpack players would travel boundaries rapidly multiple camera changes leading confusion player supposed going resulting inadvertently turning back large size zones longrange autoaim system ign expected players would spend game firing enemies view dodging attacks gamespot suggested game would lot playable player given opportunity least move angle gamepro also frustrated camera stylization saying awkward camera stopped game reaching potential could disappointment regarding variety enemies ign counted three nonboss enemies present game admired unique designs particularly simianesque dinosaurs support boss enemies though ign citing key victory avoid attacks rather simply gamepro disappointed enemies entry battles literally appearing thin ign supportive capcoms decision turn ozymandias giant puzzle ship able routinely change formation puzzle method compared ign also admired uniqueness rooms within ozymandias questioned decision avoid environments cafeteria mess hall would made ship feel like actually crew begin gamespot saw little uniqueness designs noting shiny metallic look ships interiors everywhere without using map feature would hard get lost moving around partly camera map helpful also considered arduous process voice acting thought reasonable quality ign felt surprising japanese game using englishspeaking actors ign mention presence corny dialogue gamespot considered passable bgrade aspects sound design score sound effects also found good passable criticised limited repetitive rooms gametrailers included game top ten worst sequels feature stating good sign abysmal sequel developer respectfully declines follow
