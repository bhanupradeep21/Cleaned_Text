foot drop gait abnormality dropping forefoot happens due weakness irritation damage deep fibular nerve deep peroneal including sciatic nerve paralysis muscles anterior portion lower leg usually symptom greater problem disease foot drop characterized inability impaired ability raise toes raise foot ankle dorsiflexion foot drop may temporary permanent depending extent muscle weakness paralysis occur one feet walking raised leg slightly bent knee prevent foot dragging along ground foot drop caused nerve damage alone muscle spinal cord trauma abnormal anatomy toxins disease toxins include organophosphate compounds used pesticides chemical agents warfare poison lead damage body neurodegenerative disorder called organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy disorder causes loss function motor sensory neural pathways case foot drop could result paralysis due neurological dysfunction diseases cause foot drop include trauma posterolateral neck fibula amyotrophic lateral sclerosis muscular dystrophy poliomyelitis charcot marie tooth disease multiple sclerosis cerebral palsy hereditary spastic paraplegia syndrome welander distal myopathy friedreichs ataxia chronic compartment syndrome may also occur result hip replacement surgery knee ligament reconstruction surgery foot drop characterized steppage walking people suffering condition drag toes along ground bend knees lift foot higher usual avoid serves raise foot high enough prevent toe dragging prevents accommodate toe drop patient may use characteristic tiptoe walk opposite leg raising thigh excessively walking upstairs letting toe drop gaits wide outward leg swing avoid lifting thigh excessively turn corners opposite direction affected limb may also indicate foot patients painful disorders sensation dysesthesia soles feet may similar gait foot drop extreme pain evoked even slightest pressure feet patient walks walking barefoot hot sandcitation needed causes foot drop causes neurological lesions approached using localizationfocused approach etiologies considered time foot drop result neurological disorder rarely muscle diseased nonfunctional source neurological impairment central spinal cord brain peripheral nerves located connecting spinal cord endsite muscle sensory receptorcitation needed foot drop rarely result pathology involving muscles bones make lower leg anterior tibialis muscle picks foot although anterior tibialis plays major role dorsiflexion assisted fibularis tertius extensor digitorum longus extensor hallucis longus drop foot caused neurological disorder muscles could affected innervated deep fibular peroneal nerve branches sciatic nerve sciatic nerve exits lumbar plexus root arising fifth lumbar nerve spacecitation needed occasionally spasticity muscles opposite anterior tibialis gastrocnemius soleus exists presence foot drop making pathology much complex foot drop isolated foot drop usually flaccid condition gradations weakness seen foot drop follows according mrccitation needed foot slap heel strike abnormality audible slapping foot floor step occurs foot first hits floor step sometimes visible diagnosis done actually hearing slap treated systematically possible lesion sites causing foot drop include going peripheral central nerve root involved common cause herniated disc causes foot drop diabetes due generalized peripheral neuropathy trauma motor neuron disease mnd adverse reaction drug alcohol multiple sclerosiscitation needed drop foot foot drop interchangeable terms describe abnormal neuromuscular disorder affects patients ability raise foot ankle drop foot characterized inability point toes toward body dorsiflexion move foot ankle inward outward therefore normal gait cycle affected drop foot syndrome normal gait cycle follows drop foot gait cycle requires exaggerated phases drop foot inability dorsiflex evert invert foot looking gait cycle part gait cycle involves dorsiflexion action would heel contact foot gait cycle entire swing phase gait cycle also known gait abnormalitiescitation needed initial diagnosis often made routine physical examination diagnosis confirmed medical professional physiatrist neurologist orthopedic surgeon neurosurgeon person foot drop difficulty walking heels unable lift front foot balls toes ground therefore simple test asking patient dorsiflex may determine diagnosis problem measured scale observes mobility lowest point determine complete paralysis highest point determine complete mobilitycitation needed tests may help determine underlying etiology diagnosis tests may include mri mrn emg assess surrounding areas damaged nerves damaged nerves respectively nerve communicates muscles lift foot peroneal nerve nerve innervates anterior muscles leg used dorsiflexion ankle muscles used plantar flexion innervated tibial nerve often develop tightness presence foot drop muscles keep ankle supination ankle sprain also innervated peroneal nerve uncommon find weakness area well paraesthesia lower leg particularly top foot ankle also accompany foot drop although instances common yoga kneeling exercise varjrasana name yoga foot drop linked foot underlying disorder must treated example spinal disc herniation low back impinging nerve goes leg causing symptoms foot drop herniated disc treated foot drop result peripheral nerve injury window recovery months years often advised apparent recovery nerve function takes place surgical intervention repair graft nerve considered although results type intervention mixedcitation needed nonsurgical treatments spinal stenosis include suitable exercise program developed physical therapist activity modification avoiding activities cause advanced symptoms spinal stenosis epidural injections antiinflammatory medications like ibuprofen aspirin necessary decompression surgery minimally destructive normal structures may used treat spinal stenosiscitation needed nonsurgical treatments condition similar nonsurgical methods described spinal stenosis spinal fusion surgery may required treat condition many patients improving function experiencing less pain nearly half vertebral fractures occur without significant back pain pain medication progressive activity brace support help fracture two minimally invasive procedures vertebroplasty kyphoplasty may options ankles stabilized lightweight orthoses available molded plastics well softer materials use elastic properties prevent foot drop additionally shoes fitted traditional springloaded braces prevent foot drop walking regular exercise usually prescribedcitation needed functional electrical stimulation fes technique uses electrical currents activate nerves innervating extremities affected paralysis resulting spinal cord injury sci head injury stroke neurological disorders fes primarily used restore function people disabilities sometimes referred neuromuscular electrical stimulation nmes latest treatments include stimulation peroneal nerve lifts foot step many stroke multiple sclerosis patients foot drop success often individuals foot drop prefer use compensatory technique like steppage gait hip hiking opposed brace splint fes applied lower extremities improving functional walking stroke patients correction foot drop benefited patients improving gait speed muscle strength treatment easy underside l shaped footup ankle support anklefoot orthoses another method uses cuff placed around patients ankle topside spring hook installed shoelaces hook connects ankle cuff lifts shoe patient walks techniques show significant
