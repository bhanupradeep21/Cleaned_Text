contraindicated ppis acidsuppressing effect ppis suppress acid thereby raising ph alkalizing stomachs contents rilpivirine best absorbed acidic conditions therefore rabeprazole would expected decrease absorption rilpivirine decrease concentration rilpivirine blood possibly lead therapeutic failure resistance general rabeprazole fairly well tolerated even five years clinical trial side effect profile similar common side effects include headache nausea rare side effects include rashes flulike symptoms infections including gastrointestinal pathogen clostridium rare instances rabeprazoleinduced liver injury also known hepatotoxicity reported characteristic protonpump inhibitor hepatoxicity usually occurs within first four weeks starting rabeprazole associated elevated serum gastrin levels thought dependent upon degree metabolism drug undergoes comparison rabeprazole significantly metabolized enzyme compared medications class like elevated serum gastrin may associated gastric acid suppression via rabeprazole decrease absorption vitamin magnesium leading serious side effects reported people taking rabeprazole effects correlated directly use include syndrome serious hematological abnormalities coma possible side effects common ppis medications class include bone fractures due osteoporosis serious infections clostridium signs symptoms reported overdoses rabeprazole mg case examples notably rabeprazole used higher doses treatment hypersecretory conditions like zollingerellison syndrome mg animal experiments ultrahigh doses rabeprazole demonstrated lethality unknown mechanisms lethal overdose syndrome animals characterized convulsion rabeprazole interfere plasma concentration drugs also metabolized enzymes ie metabolized therefore expected react substrates like theophylline warfarin diazepam however acidsuppression effects rabeprazole like ppis may interfere absorption drugs require acid ketoconazole evidence omeprazole esomeprazole two medications class rabeprazole disturb conversion anticoagulant medication called clopidogrel active metabolite however thought mediated effect omeprazole esomeprazole enzyme activates clopidogrel drug interaction expected occur strongly rabeprazole however whether effect omeprazole esomeprazole clopidogrels metabolism actually leads poor clinical outcomes still matter intense debate among healthcare clinically serious drugdrug interactions may involve acidsuppression effects rabeprazole example rabeprazole used concomitantly rilpivirine antihiv therapy requires acid absorption lowered plasma concentrations rilpivirine could lead progression hiv infection drugs require acid absorption include antifungal drugs like ketoconazole itraconazole digoxin iron mycophenolate tyrosine kinase inhibitors like erlotinib dasatinib clinically relevant drug interaction rabeprazole food affect amount rabeprazole enters delay onset effect rabeprazoles mechanism action first involves getting absorbed parietal cells stomach cells responsible secreting hydrochloric acid point rabeprazole however rabeprazole secreted secretory canaliculus parietal cells space acid secretion acid secretion mediated energydependent acid pumps called hydrogen potassium adenosine triphosphatase hk atpase enzymatic pumps cysteine amino acid activated gastric stomach acid reactive sulfenamide rabeprazole permanently binds cysteine residues forming covalent disulfide action fundamentally alters configuration acid pump thereby inhibiting activity thus acid longer secreted gastric lumen empty space stomach ph stomach increases decrease concentration hydrogen ions due permanent inhibition individual proton pump molecule rabeprazole bound acid secretion effectively suppressed new proton pumps produced parietal rabeprazole like medications class inhibit hk atpase pumps found lysosomes cellular organelle degrades biological molecules pumps found organelles lack cysteine residues involved rabeprazoles mechanism unique feature rabeprazoles mechanism action inhibiting acid secretion involves activation pka ph drug becomes positively charged rabeprazole around meaning doesnt take lot acid activate theoretically translates faster onset action rabeprazoles acidinhibiting effect clinical implications fact yet rabeprazoles bioavailability approximately meaning orally administered dose expected enter systemic circulation blood rabeprazole approximately bound plasma proteins biological halflife rabeprazole humans approximately one takes hours rabeprazole reach maximum concentration human plasma single orally administered dose oral absorption independent dose rabeprazole extensively metabolized drug rendered metabolites liver excreted
