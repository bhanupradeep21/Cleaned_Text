boii extinct genus microsaur within family found carboniferous coal mines near community kounov czech republic remains genus consist crushed skull shoulder girdle bones scales similar microsaurian elements originally referred asaphestera boii characterized heavily sculptured skull thin ventral plate clavicles larger number fangs roof many years type known species boii crassidens considered species robert carroll assigned specimen designated boii crassidens first described antonin frič one notable paleontologists late century region bohemia part czech republic frič made many contributions knowledge carboniferous tetrapods lifetime including particular article published sitzungsberichte der königlichen böhmischen gesellschaft der wissenschaften prague notable bohemian scientific journal day article published within volume journal list carboniferous animals associates recently discovered gaskohle bituminous coal mines near localities nýřany kounová list included short preliminary descriptions many new genera species tetrapods including microbrachis branchiosaurus hyloplesion time called stelliosaurus saurier reptiles amphibians tetrapods discussed article hailed nýřany mines two diagnostic examples found within kounová mines one supposed amphibian designated labyrinthodon shwarzenbergii known amphibian rather early synapsid named specimen known boii crassidens named batrachocephalus crassidens specimen consisted crushed skull preserved slab counterslab coal jaw bones scales shoulder girdle elements preserved slabs currently held national museum prague designation čgh article preliminary review creatures frič associates discovered elaborate description published part personal monograph focusing solely creatures discovered mines description renamed batrachocephalus crassidens sparodus crassidens genus name batrachocephalus already taken batrachocephalus mino indonesian species catfish frič also assigned isolated maxilla upper jaw bone designation čgh species although quite bit larger maxilla crushed review microsaurs published robert carroll sparodus crassidens found member genus sparodus instead reevaluated belonging family early microsaurs known tuditanidae prompted carroll create new genus name specimens previously considered belong sparodus crassidens new name found boii crassidens named boii tribe inhabited area bohemia time roman crushed skull pressed two plates coal preserved outer impressions bones underside upper side specimen although bones preserved outer impressions helped reconstruct structure missing bones impressions used reconstruct skull lower jaws skull preserved palate better impressions removed encased canada balsam skull initially believed stout approximately long wide froglike skull responsible original genus name batrachocephalus greek frog however later reconstructions robert carroll interpreted wide shape result crushing skull experienced skull actually narrow somewhat triangular similar shape lizard rather orbits eye holes roughly midway length skull unlike fairly smooth skulls microsaurs skull boii covered numerous grooves ridges radiate middle respective bones maxillary premaxillary bones forming edge snout contained many conical teeth per side upper jaw number somewhat larger eponymous tuditanid tuditanus marginal edge teeth general slightly larger towards front skull although small palate roof mouth also possesses teeth palatine bones positioned right next maxillae possess fair number teeth notable assortment palatal teeth bundle large fangs preserved midway skull large palatal fangs also shared sparodus explaining boii crassidens considered part genus frič considered fangs grown vomers front skull possibly parasphenoid back carroll reconstructed fangs part long pterygoid bones originally reported dentaries main bones lower jaws also preserved covered teeth similar upper jaws row small pits run symphysis chin along upper portion outer face bones shoulder girdle known pair vshaped bones preserved behind skull frič identified coracoids however research carroll indicated microsaurs possess coracoid bones bones identified frič actually clavicles clavicles possess two bladelike regions pointing away right angles seen front lower regions point inwards laying along chest upper regions point upwards along sides body lower regions aka ventral plates boiis clavicles thin akin typical many tetrapods boii also possessed interclavicle positioned behind clavicles center chest however remnant bone specimen large yet indistinct impression single arm bone also present specimen although paleontologists disagree whether humerus according frič radius ulna according carroll boii possessed large scales preserved known specimen scales back animal tilelike rounded corners tightly overlapped alternating rows possessed bulging rear edge scales belly animal also overlapping however belly scales wider back scales rows stacked frequently small portion individual scale frič considered boii crassidens member family branchiosauridae along species branchiosaurids group small gilled temnospondyls believed distant relatives sparodus boii john william dawson listed three sparodus species microsaurs rather branchiosaurids explicitly note individual species instead clumping sparodus sp unsure whether valid members dawsons suspicions rectified carroll split boii crassidens sparodus skull structure boii considered similar asaphestera similar tuditanus placed boii along asaphestera tuditanidae tuditanids basal microsaurs evolve unusual adaptations advanced families microsaurs terrestrial lizardlike creatures welldeveloped legs jaw joints set far back neck joint although boii crassidens quite old microsaur standards one last known species carroll suggested may descended asaphestera supposedly one earliest known microsaurs however asaphestera recognized chimeric taxon based specimens potential eothyridid along newlynamed microsaur
