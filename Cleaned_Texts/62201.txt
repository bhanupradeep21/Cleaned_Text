praiseworthy conscious choices may lead irreversible reversible outcomes making irreversible choices existential choices may reduce choice choosing options one must make judgments quality options attributes example one choosing candidates job quality relevant attributes previous work experience college high school gpa letters recommendation judged option decision likely based attribute judgments however attribute different level evaluability extent one use information attribute make judgment example highly evaluable attribute sat score widely known united states sat score bad sat score exceptionally good distribution scores attribute relatively well known highly evaluable attribute compare sat score poorly evaluable attribute number hours spent homework employers would know hours spent homework means idea distribution scores potential workers population attribute result evaluability cause preference reversals joint separate evaluations example review theoretical looked people choose options directly compared presented time compared one given single option canonical example hiring decision made two candidates hired programming job subjects experiment asked give starting salary two candidates candidate j candidate however viewed candidates time joint evaluation whereas others viewed one candidate separate evaluation candidate j experience ky programs gpa whereas candidate experience ky programs gpa results showed joint evaluation candidates received roughly starting salary subjects apparently thought low gpa high experience approximately equal high gpa low experience however separate evaluation subjects paid candidate one high gpa substantially money explanation ky programs attribute difficult evaluate thus people base judgment attribute separate evaluation several research studies economic psychology concentrated examining variations individual behavior confronted low versus high choice set size refers number available options particular area interest lies determining whether individuals demonstrate higher propensity purchase product larger choice set compared smaller onecurrently effect choice set size probability purchase unclear cases large choice set sizes discourage individuals making cases either encourages one study compared allure choice tyranny much choice individuals went virtual shopping different stores randomly determined set choices ranging good choices bad researchers found stronger effect allure choice however speculate due random assignment number choices goodness choices many shops fewer choices included zero one option reasonably good may made easier make acceptable choice options evidence greater choice potential improve persons welfare sometimes thing much choice example one experiment involving choice free soda individuals explicitly requested choose six opposed sodas benefit smaller choice set would reduce cognitive burden recent study supports research finding human services workers indicated preferences scenarios limited options extensiveoptions scenarios number choices within extensiveoptions scenarios increased preference limited options increased attempts explain choice demotivate someone purchase focuses two factors one assumes perusing larger number choices imposes cognitive burden assumes individuals experience regret make suboptimal choice sometimes avoid making choice avoid experiencing research expanded choice overload suggesting paradox choice increasing options available three problems emerge first issue gaining adequate information choices order make decision second choices leads escalation expectation increased options peoples standards acceptable outcome rise words choice spoils third many options available people may come believe blame unacceptable result many choices able pick best one one choice available ends disappointing world held accountable many options choice one makes disappointing individual however recent metaanalysis literature choice overload calls studies many cases researchers found effect choice set size peoples beliefs feelings behavior indeed overall effect many options minimal best might expected preferable keep ones options open research shown opportunity revise ones decisions leaves people less satisfied decision recent study found participants experienced higher regret made reversible decision results suggest reversible decisions cause people continue think still relevant choice options might increase dissatisfaction decision individual personality plays significant role individuals deal large choice set sizes psychologists developed personality test determines individual lies satisfier spectrum maximizer one always seeks best option choice set may anguish choice made whether indeed best satisfiers may set high standards content good choice place less priority making best choice due different approach decisionmaking maximizers likely avoid making choice choice set size large probably avoid anguish associated knowing whether choice one study looked whether differences choice satisfaction two partially due difference willingness commit ones choices found maximizers reported stronger preference retaining ability revise choices additionally making choice buy poster satisfiers offered higher ratings chosen poster lower ratings rejected alternatives maximizers however less likely change impressions posters making choice left less satisfied maximizers less happy life perhaps due obsession making optimal choices society people frequently confronted one study found maximizers reported significantly less life satisfaction happiness optimism selfesteem significantly regret depression satisfiers regards buying products maximizers less satisfied consumer decisions regretful also likely engage social comparison analyze relative social standing among peers affected social comparisons others appeared higher standing example maximizers saw peer solve puzzles faster expressed greater doubt abilities showed larger increase negative hand people refrain taking better choices drugs forms escapism tend much happier life otherswho say never much choice difference happiness satisfaction person tries find better decisions often dissatisfied necessarily unhappy since attempts finding better choices improve lifestyle even wasnt best decision continually try incrementally improve decisions takes choice architecture process encouraging people make good choices grouping ordering decisions way maximizes successful choices minimizes number people become overwhelmed complexity abandon attempt choose generally success improved presenting smaller simpler choices first choosing promoting sensible default certain choices personal preferences
