keloid also known keloid disorder keloidal formation type scar depending maturity composed mainly either type iii early type late collagen result overgrowth granulation tissue collagen type iii site healed skin injury slowly replaced collagen type keloids firm rubbery lesions shiny fibrous nodules vary pink color persons skin red dark brown color keloid scar benign contagious sometimes accompanied severe itchiness changes texture severe cases affect movement skin united states keloid scars seen times frequently people subsaharan african descent people european descentcitation needed higher tendency develop keloid among family history keloids people ages yearscitation needed keloids confused hypertrophic scars raised scars grow beyond boundaries original wound keloids expand clawlike growths normal capability hurt needlelike pain itch degree sensation varying person personcitation needed keloids form within scar tissue collagen used wound repair tends overgrow area sometimes producing lump many times larger original scar also range color pink although usually occur site injury keloids also arise spontaneously occur site piercing even something simple pimple scratch occur result severe acne chickenpox scarring infection wound site repeated trauma area excessive skin tension wound closure foreign body wound keloids sometimes sensitive chlorine keloid appears someone still growing keloid continue grow wellcitation needed small size keloid papules keloid nodules cm diameter keloid tumor cm diameter two linear keloids patch flat keloid butterfly type keloid guttate keloid hyperinflammatory keloid chest wall superficially spreading keloid pedunculated keloid grows stalk much like mushroom bulky keloid large keloids scalp keloid occipital area earlobe keloid large earlobe keloid forming repeated surgeries posterior auricular keloid triggered otoplasty surgery facial nodular keloids african american male bulky keloid neck inflammatory keloid chest wall worsened surgery flat superficially spreading keloid upper arm area pedunculated umblical keloid multinodular conglomerate pubic area worsened surgery keloid sole foot patient large keloids elsewhere well healed midline scar surgery keloid forming navel area following piercing keloid formation triggered tattooing keloids develop place skin trauma occurred result pimples insect bites scratching burns skin injury keloid scars develop surgery common sites central chest sternotomy back shoulders usually resulting acne ear lobes ear piercings also occur body piercings common spots earlobes arms pelvic region collar bonecitation needed skin injury types contribute scarring includes burns acne scars chickenpox scars ear piercing scratches surgical incisions vaccination sites according us national center biotechnology information keloid scarring common young people ages studies shown darker complexions higher risk keloid scarring result skin trauma occur individuals subsaharan african asian latino ancestry significantly less caucasian background although previously believed people albinism get recent report described incidence keloids africans keloids tend genetic component means one likely keloids one parents however single gene yet identified causing factor keloid scarring several susceptibility loci discovered notably chromosome people ancestry subsaharan africa asia latin america likely develop keloid among ethnic chinese asia keloid common skin condition united states keloids common african americans hispanic americans european americans family history keloids also susceptible since people get keloids firstdegree blood relative mother father sister brother child also gets keloids family trait common people african andor asian descent development keloids among twins also lends credibility existence genetic susceptibility develop keloids marneros et al reported four sets identical twins keloids ramakrishnan et also described pair twins developed keloids time vaccination case series reported clinically severe forms keloids individuals positive family history black african ethnic origin histologically keloids fibrotic tumors characterized collection atypical fibroblasts excessive deposition extracellular matrix components especially collagen fibronectin elastin proteoglycans generally contain relatively acellular centers thick abundant collagen bundles form nodules deep dermal portion lesion keloids present therapeutic challenge must addressed lesions cause significant pain pruritus itching physical disfigurement may improve appearance time limit mobility located jointcitation needed keloids affect sexes equally although incidence young female patients reported higher young males probably reflecting greater frequency earlobe piercing among women frequency occurrence times higher highly pigmented people people african descent increased risk keloid prevention keloid scars patients known predisposition includes preventing unnecessary trauma surgery ear piercing elective mole removal whenever possible skin problems predisposed individuals eg acne infections treated early possible minimize areas inflammation treatments preventive therapeutic available pressure therapy silicone gel sheeting intralesional triamcinolone acetonide tac cryosurgery freezing radiation laser therapy pulsed dye laser interferon ifn fluorouracil surgical excision well multitude extracts topical appropriate treatment keloid scar agedependent radiotherapy antimetabolites corticosteroids would recommended used children order avoid harmful side effects like growth adults corticosteroids combined pdl triple therapy enhance results diminish side cryotherapy cryosurgery refers application extreme cold treat keloids treatment method easy perform effective safe least chance surgical excision currently still common treatment significant amount keloid lesions however used solitary form treatment large recurrence rate also known cause larger lesion formation recurrence always successful alone surgical excision combined therapies dramatically decreases recurrence rate examples therapies include limited radiation therapy pressure therapy laser ablation pressure therapy following surgical excision shown promising results especially keloids ear earlobe mechanism exactly pressure therapy works unknown present many patients keloid scars lesions benefited intralesional injection corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide kenalog appear aid reduction fibroblast activity inflammation tea tree oil salt topical oil effect keloid systematic review included multiple studies laser therapy treating keloid scars enough evidence review authors determine laser therapy effective treatments also unable conclude laser therapy leads harm benefits compared treatment different kinds another systematic review compared silicone gel sheeting treatment treatment nonsilicone gel sheeting treatment intralesional injections triamcinolone acetonide authors found two small studies participants total compared treatment options unable determine persons age develop keloid children less likely develop
