stimulation model behavior analysts infants deprived physical stimulation opportunity respond found delayed motor conditions extra stimulation motor behavior children rapidly research shown use

personality disorders focus reinforcement sensitivity theory states individuals less sensitive reinforcement others nelsongrey views problematic response classes maintained reinforcing consequences rule governance last decades studies supported idea contingent use reinforcement punishment extended periods time lead development prosocial antisocial however research shown reinforcement effective punishment teaching behavior child also shown modeling effective preaching developing prosocial behavior rewards also closely studied relation development social behaviors children building selfcontrol empathy cooperation implicated rewards successful tactic sharing strongly linked development social skills children largely affected classroom setting teachers peers reinforcement punishment play major roles well peers frequently reinforce others one major areas teachers peers influence sextyped behavior peers also largely influence modes initiating interaction peers likely punish crossgender play time reinforcing play specific gender studies found teachers likely reinforce dependent behavior behavioral principles also researched emerging peer groups focusing research shows takes different social skills enter groups maintain build ones status groups research also suggests neglected children least interactive aversive yet remain relatively unknown groups children social problems see improvement social skills behavior therapy behavior modification see applied behavior analysis modeling successfully used increase participation shy withdrawn shaping socially desirable behavior positive reinforcement seems positive effects children experiencing social development antisocial behavior etiological models antisocial behavior show considerable correlation negative reinforcement response matching see matching escape conditioning use coercive behavior powerful effect development use future antisocial tactics use antisocial tactics conflicts negatively reinforced eventually seen functional child moment moment antisocial behaviors also develop children imitation reinforced social approval approval given teachers parents often given peers example swearing imitating parent brother peer character tv child may engage antisocial behavior swearing upon saying may reinforced around lead increase antisocial behavior role stimulus control also extensively explored development antisocial recent behavioral focus study antisocial behavior focus rulegoverned behavior correspondence saying long interest behavior analysts normal development
