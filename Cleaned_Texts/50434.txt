nonverbal leakage form nonverbal behavior occurs person verbalizes one thing body language indicates another common forms include facial movements handtoface gestures term nonverbal leakage got origin literature leading many subsequent studies topic throughout including multiple studies american psychologist paul ekman related studies continuing nonverbal leakage prominent concept study body language others often able pick incongruity verbal nonverbal messages confusing cause cognitive even individual attempts suppress nonverbal leakage aspects voluntary control still expressed despite efforts contrary many participants studies deception facial expressions seen express emotional leakage capacity especially trying conceal highintensity early article nonverbal leakage paul ekman wallace friesen discuss many bodily facial movements associated nonverbal leakage especially context ekman wallace focus mostly nonverbal leakage expressed movements face hands feet describe areas like face parts body high sending capacity meaning signals body part sends easily visible quickly received observer areas like feet hands therefore areas lower sending capacities high sending capacity clear visibility face make nonverbal leakage obvious expressed face emotions expressed face discernible complex musculature movements face compared movements feet hands also much easier individual put hands pockets example hide face mask nonverbal facial expressions however facial expressions also first expressions masked one telling lie people tend aware obvious facial expressions individuals therefore likely mask expressions first words nonverbal leakage obvious face ones awareness facial expressions face also produce confusing nonverbal leakage areas like hands feet less visible expressing emotion also appear less consciously controlled therefore also indicative individuals true emotions studies found females tend responsive nonverbal cues comparison verbal knowing persons sex also give insight persons nonverbal leakage males females tend display particular nonverbal leakage telling truth also help indicate someone telling lie behaviors would study participants rated actors recorded verbal nonverbal cues scripted video nonverbal cues seen significantly influential verbal cues participants assessments actors performances dominant conversational behavior also seems connected differences nonverbal leakage people dominate conversations also express unique nonverbal leakage compared lessdominant relation age children successfully manipulate nonverbal expressions even enough deceive adults one however studies found results supporting idea children good controlling nonverbal expressions leakage reach certain emotional intelligence also found play role ones detection emotional leakage females people higher emotional intelligence tend better perceiving verbal leakages women also tend higher emotional intelligence compared men giving women better ability detect verbal leakage comparison men women performing better tasks facial decoding emotional intelligence study emotional intelligence communicative professional dancers actors skilled lawyers negotiators successful secondhand car salesmen less nonverbal leakage professions dancers actors trained using body movements convey information audience aware body language control movements better disguising nonverbal causes negotiators salesmen good nonverbal liars ambiguous might case develop skills careers may innate personalities determine career also possible certain circumstances feel guilty lying hence leak little however one study suggested lawyers receive enough training conveying information clients using body languages indicating may gain nonverbal deception skills one study found nonverbal leakage may easily detectable facetoface communications compared viewed video although people still detect nonverbal expressions examining someones communications video context facetoface versus videorecorded communications authors study able examine amount information participants receiving videos communications gestures speech versus speech audio recording people tend gain information viewing communication video gestures speech compared presented audio recordings however study also showed people gain information speech compared gestures alone although clearly still meaning understood gestures alone summary people tend get information communicating someone using nonverbal gestures speech indicating nonverbal leakage important aspect communication enhance speech may necessarily universal indicators nonverbal leakage especially indicate deception nonverbal cue differences among demographics culture facial movements telling also confusing movements people actively try mask trying hide emotion truth parts body including legs also sources nonverbal leakage parts body less conscious control communicating harder hide nonverbal leakage parts body like hands legs people easily leak nonverbal expressions parts summary although face expressive terms nonverbal expression also one easily controlled levels nonverbal leakage relatively low conscious control facial indicators facial leakage include facial expressions last long intensive monotonous lacking natural combination various instance liar may exhibit abnormally longlasting smile extremely serious frown expression fear without compared faces hands legs less obvious sending deception cues also weaker control liars may consciously control facial expression reveal confidence comfort hands feet speak fear discomfort leakage hand movements includes tearing fingernails poking cheeks defensive holding knees tight fists anxious tapping cigarettes snapping leakage feet legs movements includes restless foot kicks frequent leg shifts squeezing repetitive flirtatious leg foot experiments conducted ekman friesen supported idea body cues revealing deception compared face head psychiatric patients engaging deception medical consultation filmed clips shown two groups naive observers trained detecting deception cues one group observers could see patients head face group could view body movements neck found group observers saw body cues better detecting patients concealed anxiety delusion group viewed face cues misled patients deception healthy happy metaanalysis found one need special training able detect nonverbal leakage humans seem natural ability gain great deal information based another persons nonverbal another study assessed humans ability detect leakage gaze cues humanlike groups people participated guessing games nearhuman robots robots leaked information gaze people performed much better guessing game even though people reported identifying leakage cue demonstrating humans subconsciously pick respond nonverbal leakage nonverbal leakage telling deception even one consciously attempts control nonverbal multiple methods used order study behavioral differences truthful versus deceptive language communication including deception detection accuracy cue methods employ processes measure levels arousal someone purposefully deceptive experiences arousal response example investigators measure pupil dilation pitch errors speech indicators arousal due deceptive behaviors nonverbal behaviors physiological responses seen deceptive multiple studies used methods detecting deception nonverbal leakage along others involving outside raters subjective questionnaires one study found may differences nonverbal cues indicating deception based level deception person attempting level emotion trying suppress seem clear differences amount cognitive control takes mask different types nonverbal cues producing deceptive information liars tend put effort responses especially prepared answer question liars tend pause take time preparing response comparison truthtellers giving insight cognitive processing nonverbal leakage liars trying ekman suggests deception detected persons internal feedback loop nonverbal behavior problems causing nonverbal behaviors purposefully producing actually give information deceptive processes examined nonverbal leakage investigators able pick common verbal leakage expressed someone deceptive example people less dominant conversations tend hesitate comment less frequently conversation compared conversationdominant individuals tend hesitate less appear dominant telling rehearsed one study liars tended smile whether fake based multiple studies proposed theories behind nonverbal leakage clear necessarily take training able detect nonverbal leakage able pick another persons subtle nonverbal expressions however potentially experience detecting lies prisoners found exceptionally successful detecting verbal leakage uncovering dishonesty compared studies wacewicz żywiczyński suggest hard detect deception single nonverbal rather detection deception relies understanding deception demeanor includes groups nonverbal single nonverbal behavior treated cue combination cues gives rise inference deception example liars usually lean back avoid face interrogator directly talking turning away interrogator angle degrees typically regarded deception deception demeanor includes gaze aversion unnatural body movements deceivers usually avoid eye contacts interrogator blink frequently pupils enlarge micro also scratch rub pinch often relieve fear detecting emotion nonverbal leakage nonverbal behaviors effect verbal cues indicating someones emotional state particularly communicating positive negative psychology affect refers experience feelings emotions positive affect usually transmitted controllable nonverbal channels faces negative affect transmitted less controllable channels hands one study found biased teachers judge students stereotypically dogmatic teaching practices negative toward students low ethnic socioeconomic status showed nonverbal leakage less controllable channels unbiased able detect pain expressed nonverbal expression leakage could help provide information clinical setting always expressed clearly verbally one study participants able accurately discriminate another persons levels pain electric shock scenarios based nonverbal expression alone seems though expressions could potentially used form sensitive accurate pain index solely rely verbal similar study involving deliverance electric shocks pain expression evaluation author found measurable topographic changes occur face someone experiencing pain measurable responses give insight persons levels pain strictly nonverbal based results scientists believe nonverbal leakage detection may clinical value evaluating treating pain especially absence verbal wacewicz żywiczyński tried explain existence leakage cues evolutionary perspective behaviors leak liars intention selected removed instead poker faces favored natural selection leak little information two potential explanations happening first explanation lying imposes pressure peoples cognitive system changes physiological state leading increasing number cues including hard second explanation signal cost associated scientists believe people may express detect nonverbal attitudes communications innate emotional understanding support innate hypothesis metaanalysis interpersonal behaviors authors came conclusion evolutionarily advantageous emotional nonverbal expressions nonverbal leakage judged quickly processes help individual adapt new environment understand one theories behind deceptive nonverbal leakage particular person lying experiencing emotions guilt shame emotions associated lying cause person exhibit nonverbal leakage goes expressions consciously trying investigating women seem better detecting interpreting nonverbal leakage authors proposed women may attentive explicit emotional processes may socially motivated pay attention subtle emotions nonverbal communications whereas men attentive emotions based implicit detecting pain nonverbal stimuli one study also found nonverbal leakage give others clues whether person exaggerating pain response observers found people exaggerating pain levels tended show unnatural facial changes responding natural appropriate level intensity electric shock experienced charles darwin hypothesized humans consciously control strong emotions therefore inhibit facial muscles associated intense emotions thus limiting ability voluntary control nonverbal facial cues associated intense results multiple studies nonverbal leakage seen support darwins inhibition studies also found may impossible completely hide ones emotions nonverbal leakage involuntarily expressed especially face one creating falsified going darwins inhibition hypothesis ekman proposed facial movements voluntary controlled one experiencing intense emotions seen microexpressions expressions almost impossible see naked eye usual expression time less half emotional leakage found difficult prevent conceal highintensity emotions much likely result unintended emotional leakage compared lowintensity nonverbal leakage also studied study participants mental disorders particularly anxiety depression authors found unique characteristics nonverbal leakage expressed individuals disorders exposed nonverbal cues study participants able detect another persons anxiety especially movement anxious persons hands eyes mouth process participants able relatively accurately gauge persons anxiety levels well although nonverbal cues expressed subjects disorder similar eye contact also seem unique characteristics nonverbal cues associated disorder participants anxiety nonverbal leakage tends consist increases nonsignaling gestures tremors twitching hand gestures found telling nonverbal cues associated anxiety followed eyes mouth torso common observations hands include nervous twitching unnatural stiffness clammy hands along aspects darting eyes increased eye movements licking lips irregular breathing stiff upper depression telling nonverbal leakage observed clearly eyes followed mouth movements head angle lastly hand movement although movements may similar seen individuals anxiety patterns movements seem unique httpsenwikipediaorgwikinonverballeakage
