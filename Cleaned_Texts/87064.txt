allostasis ˌɑːloʊˈsteɪsɪs physiological mechanism regulation human body anticipates adjusts energy use according environmental demands first proposed peter sterling joseph eyer concept allostasis shifts focus away body maintaining rigid internal setpoint homeostasis brains ability role interpret environmental stress coordinate changes body using neurotransmitters hormones signaling mechanisms allostasis believed involved bodys stress response adaptation chronic stress may also role regulation immune system well development chronic diseases hypertension diabetes concept organisms ability stabilize internal bodily mechanisms independently environmental variations first popularized french physiologist claude bernard coined constancy milieu intérieur internal sought replace ancient greek notion vitalism proposed governing body nonphysical means physiological understanding mechanisms body feedback regulation harvard physiologist walter cannon took bernards theory milieu intérieur expanded incorporate evolutionary framework energy efficiency preservation cannon coined concept homeostasis demonstrating organisms body selfgoverning system regulation certain steadystate conditions optimal late neurobiologist peter sterling epidemiologist joseph eyer noticed generational patterns chronic stress effects various human physiological mechanisms could easily explained homeostasis developed concept allostasis greek ἄλλος állos different στάσις stasis standing still mean remaining stable variable incorporate bodys ability adjust steadystate conditions based perception interpretation environmental sterling eyer studying morbidity mortality rates agespecific cohorts united states noticed correlation mortality rates agespecific cohorts saturation labor market time agespecific cohorts entering labor discovered cohorts entered labor market great depression resulting economic boom lower increased mortality rate due less job competition insecurity compared cohorts prior since also noted correlation major stressful events bereavement divorce unemployment migration higher mortality rate despite preconceived notion reduced mortality rate younger cohort would experience chronic diseases later age sterling eyer found contradictory evidence younger cohorts higher mortality rates actually experienced chronic health problems cardiovascular disease later life following trend consistently increased morbidity mortality rates throughout generation explain epidemiological phenomena sterling eyer suggested social systemic stress setting advancing capitalism industrialization main driver increased morbidity mortality rates agespecific cohorts studies became foundation conceptualizing allostasis decade later sterling eyer proposed concept allostasis better explain process physiological changes individual level shaped largescale epidemiological noticed pattern populations united states greatest impact social disruption correlated higher morbidity mortality rates instance rate elevated blood pressure hypertension highest amongst groups experienced social disruption namely unemployed african americans previous physiological explanations attributed prevalence african americans genetically predisposed ineffective kidney filtration causing dysregulation blood pressure however genetics could explain high prevalence hypertension seen african americans close geneticallyrelated population west africans sterling eyer proposed mindbrainbody component permanent physiological changes bodys internal conditions setting external stress sterling eyer argued homeostasis paint whole picture bodys physiological motives although individual organs tissues taken body function homeostatically exhibit normal functioning negative feedback always case seen organisms another example completely follow homeostasis blood pressure abiding homeostasis blood pressure monitoring show body returning normal pressures negative feedback whenever deviance optimal functioning however human body exhibits wide range resting blood pressure numbers correction throughout day depending environment low pressures sleep higher pressures animal studies also shown nonhomeostatic patterns times arousal stress body elevates blood pressure stress returns normal stressor removed yet stress becomes chronic blood pressure may return normal instead stay allostasis depends brains ability coordinate organs functions innervating organ cells perform certain function well synthesizing releasing signaling mechanisms hormones neurotransmitters response stress brain directly innervates thyroid pancreas energy regulation sends signals cardiovascular system increase cardiac output stimulates adrenal glands release cortisol aldosterone releases hormones pituitary gland acth regulate urine output reninangiotensinaldosterone brain able overcome negative feedback localized systems continuously evaluate bodys internal setpoints body regulate resources energy storage efficiently another key component allostasis brains perception subsequent adaptation chronic stress sterling eyer theorized brain anticipate stressors prepare body respond adequately environmental demands classical conditioning brain persistently interprets even anticipates stress may cause epigenetic changes permanently adapt chronic state arousal results physiological changes thickened blood vessels support increased cardiac output downregulation stress hormone receptors brain normally coordinates immune response foreign threat involves synthesis differentiation migration immune cells release cytokines interleukins elevating internal temperature setpoint redirecting metabolic needs support however brain interprets external stress demand urgent may supersede immune inflammatory responses stimulate release immunesuppressing stress hormones acth cortisol stressor resolved body resumes amounting adequate immune inflammatory response may explain often seen person falls ill acute stress due interconnected nature brains regulation stress immune system endocrine system allostasis may play role development cancer allostasis emphasizes regulation must efficient whereas homeostasis makes reference efficiency prediction requires brain collect information across spatial temporal scales ii analyze integrate decide needed iii exert feedforward control parameters naturally many needs somewhat unpredictable errors inevitable errors homeostatic mechanisms feedback control available correct allostatic predictive regulation allows brain prioritize needs example sending oxygen nutrients organs need example peak exercise muscle requires increase oxygenated blood heart increase capacity therefore brain temporarily borrows blood digestive system kidney rerouting muscle later repays debt muscles increased need subsides without ability prioritize tradeoffs organ systems heart lungs would need far larger much costly extra capacity would go every system evolves operate particular range example cone photoreceptors evolved sense daylight range intensities whereas rod photoreceptors evolved different design sense moonlight starlight detection single photons function optimally across wide operating ranges systems adapt sensitivities rod photoreceptor adapts bright moonlight requires minutes increase sensitivity system chronically forced beyond intended operating chronic high carbohydrate diet limits adaptation exceeded systems break condition termed neuroscientist bruce mcewen allostatic health organism maintained operating within certain parameters dynamic variability much allostasis also known allostatic overload bodys attempts adapt environment cause harm benefit lead various negative consequences form mental physical metaphorical perspective

feldman barrett neuroscientist professor psychology argues evolution organisms internal systems became much advanced continuing several groups cells would poorly managed new systems bodies brain needed instead large size much capable efficient management however rare cases animal species rely brains similar allostatic process sea squirt one example larvae fully grown absorb brain sea squirts allostatic process would complex humans example since species ecological niches different complexities ie animals brains adapted environmental niches life cycles allostasis proposes broader hypothesis homeostasis key goal physiological regulation rigid constancy rather flexible variation anticipates organisms needs promptly meets rather simply responding environment allostasis utilizes predictive regulation complex goal evolution adaptation changing based anticipates rather staying balance response environmental changes homeostasis suggests places homeostasis function within allostasis however argue larger paradigm allostasis redefines health disease beyond stable measures lab tests blood pressure example expands define health flexibility values blood pressure one sterlings prime examples

organisms actively adjust predictable unpredictable events allostatic load refers cumulative cost body allostasis allostatic overload state serious pathophysiology occur using balance energy input expenditure basis applying concept allostasis two types allostatic overload sterling proposed several interrelated points constitute allostasis allostasis occurs cellular systems levels humans chronically stressed brain chronically raises blood pressure arterial muscles predict higher pressure respond hypertrophy like skeletal muscles lift weights gradually whole cardiovascular system adapts life elevated pressure level known chronic hypertension elevates mortality cardiovascular disease stroke similarly chronically high carbohydrate diet requires chronically high blood glucose leads chronically high levels insulin increase anticipation need manage high level carbohydrates cells express insulin receptors predicting high insulin adapt reducing sensitivity like photoreceptors bright light leads type diabetes elevated mortality many causes although physicians term response insulin resistance better understood consequent predictive allostasis carried means alteration hpa axis hormones autonomic nervous system cytokines number systems generally adaptive short allostasis essential order maintain internal viability amid changing allostasis provides compensation various problems compensated heart failure compensated kidney failure compensated liver failure however allostatic states inherently fragile decompensation occur quickly acute decompensated heart failure term
