upper gastrointestinal bleeding gastrointestinal bleeding hemorrhage upper gastrointestinal tract commonly defined bleeding arising esophagus stomach duodenum blood may observed vomit altered form black stool depending amount blood loss symptoms may include shock upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused peptic ulcers gastric erosions esophageal varices rarer causes gastric cancer initial assessment includes measurement blood pressure heart rate well blood tests determine hemoglobin significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding considered medical emergency fluid replacement well blood transfusion may required endoscopy recommended within hours bleeding stopped various proton pump inhibitors often tranexamic acid may also procedures tips variceal bleeding may used recurrent refractory bleeding may lead need surgery although become uncommon result improved endoscopic medical treatment upper gastrointestinal bleeding affects around people per year represents cases gastrointestinal uk study found estimated mortality risk admitted hospital gastrointestinal persons upper gastrointestinal bleeding often present hematemesis coffee ground vomiting melena hematochezia marooncoloured stool hemorrhage severe presentation bleeding depends amount location hemorrhage person upper gastrointestinal bleeding may also present complications anemia including chest pain
