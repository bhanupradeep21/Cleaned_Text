objectbased attention refers relationship object representation person visually stimulated selective attention opposed relationship involving either spatial feature representation although types selective attention necessarily mutually research objectbased attention suggests attention improves quality sensory representation selected object results enhanced processing object concept object apropos objectbased attention entails physical thing seen touched includes perceptual unit group namely elements visual field stimuli organised coherently gestalt factors collinearity closure early

three research theories commonly presented consideration given enhancing effect objectbased attention memory inhibitory effect certain kinds visual search first theory posits visually perceived objects affect distribution conscious unconscious therefore consciously attending one aspect object automatically facilitates processing aspects object including currently whether terms response visual search involves locating two features efficient features occur object opposed two features separated two different furthermore reviewing previously attended object recognition faster continuity representations form colour orientation etc object previewed second theory asserts objectbased attention shift quicker within object objects egly colleagues provided evidence objectbased component

third theory contends greater interference objectbased attention flanking distractors eg visual scene crowding noise present particularly distractors belong object objectgroup attended noise similar

target visual therefore important consideration perceptual resemblance distractors target object influences efficiency visual search increases similarity among distractors increases search efficiency similarly visual search efficiency increases less similar target effect objectbased attention memory also received increasing attention three experiments conducted bao colleagues shown binding
