epoxi compilation nasa discovery program missions led university maryland principal investigator michael ahearn cooperation jet propulsion laboratory ball aerospace epoxi uses deep impact spacecraft campaign consisting two missions deep impact extended investigation dixi extrasolar planet observation characterization epoch dixi aimed send deep impact spacecraft flyby another comet primary mission completed july epoch saw spacecrafts photographic instruments space observatory studying extrasolar dixi successfully sent deep impact spacecraft flyby comet hartley november revealing hyperactive small feisty comet three gravity assists earth december december june dixi mission without problems however spacecraft initially targeted december flyby comet boethin though comet could located later declared lost comet prompting mission planners reorganize flyby alternative target hartley flyby hartley spacecraft also set make close flyby apollo asteroid gt mission suspended altogether however contact spacecraft suddenly lost august attempts reestablish contact month following mission scientists theorized problem plagued spacecrafts software deep impact mission finished visit comet tempel spacecraft still plenty maneuvering fuel left nasa approved second mission called epoxi extrasolar planet observation deep impact extended investigation included visit second comet dixi component well observations extrasolar planets epoch july deep impact executed trajectory correction maneuver placed spacecraft course fly past earth december maneuver allowed spacecraft use earths gravity begin new mission path towards another comet january deep impact began studying stars several known extrasolar planets attempt find stars nearby larger spacecrafts two telescopes attempts find planets using transit initial plan december flyby comet boethin spacecraft coming within miles km spacecraft carry second impactor collide comet would observe comet compare various characteristics found ahearn deep impact team leader reflected upcoming project time propose direct spacecraft flyby comet boethin investigate whether results found comet tempel unique also found explained mission would provide half information collected collision tempel fraction epoxis low mission cost million achieved reusing existing deep impact spacecraft deep impact would use spectrometer study comets surface composition telescopes viewing surface however earth gravity assist approached astronomers unable locate comet boethin faint observed consequently orbit could calculated sufficient precision permit flyby instead team decided send deep impact comet requiring extra two years nasa approved additional funding required retargeted mission controllers jet propulsion laboratory began redirecting epoxi november commanded spacecraft perform threeminute rocket burn changed spacecrafts velocity epoxis new trajectory set stage three earth flybys first december placed spacecraft orbital holding pattern could encounter comet exciting send deep impact spacecraft new mission combines two totally independent science investigations help us better understand solar systems form evolve said december deep impact leader university maryland astronomer michael ahearn principal investigator overall epoxi mission dixi june epoxis spectrometer scanned moon way hartley discovered traces water hydroxyl confirming moon mineralogy mapper observation discovery announced late september flyby reorient comet encounter spacecraft used high resolution instrument larger two telescopes perform photometric observations previously discovered transiting extrasolar planets january august goal photometric observations measure quantity light necessarily resolve image aberration primary mirror hri allowed hri spread light observations pixels without saturating ccd effectively obtaining better data total images epochs goals study physical properties giant planets search rings moons small three earth also looked earth though extrasolar planet provide data could characterize earthtype planets future missions imaged earth hours capture moon passing front spacecraft used earths gravity second gravity assist december made two distant flybys earth june december may successfully fired engines second trajectory correction maneuver velocity change Î´v meters per second mph preparation third earth flyby june observations began september ended november diagram epoxi solar orbits see missions closest approach occurred edt november passing within kilometers mi small comet flyby speed kms spacecraft employed suite three science telescopes infrared deep impact spacecraft used prime mission guide impactor comet tempel july observe early results observations show comet powered dry ice water vapor previously thought images clear enough scientists link jets dust gas specific surface comet boethin could located went backup every bit interesting two years farther road said tom duxbury epoxi project manager nasas jet propulsion laboratory pasadena california hartley scientifically interesting comet boethin relatively small active nuclei said michael ahearn principal investigator epoxi university maryland college november epoxi used make testtraining deep sky observations using mri camera optimised cometary imagery images made dumbbell nebula veil nebula whirlpool galaxy httpsenwikipediaorgwikiepoxi
