term laterality refers preference humans show one side body examples include lefthandednessrighthandedness leftrightfootedness may also refer primary use left right hemisphere brain may also apply animals plants majority tests conducted humans specifically determine effects language majority humans righthanded many also rightsided general prefer use right eye right foot right ear forced make choice two reasons fully understood thought left cerebral hemisphere brain controls right side body right side generally stronger suggested left cerebral hemisphere dominant right humans humans left hemisphere language hemisphere human cultures predominantly righthanded rightsided trend may socially well biologically enforced quite apparent quick survey languages english word left comes anglosaxon word lyft means weak useless similarly french word left gauche also used mean awkward tactless sinistra latin word english word sinister derived means left similarly many cultures word right also means correct english word right comes anglosaxon word riht also means straight correct linguistic social bias restricted european cultures example chinese characters designed righthanders write significant lefthanded culture ever found world person forced use hand opposite hand would naturally use known forced laterality specifically forced dextrality study done department neurology keele university north staffordshire royal infirmary suggests forced dextrality may part reason percentage lefthanded people decreases higher age groups effects pressures toward righthandedness cumulative time hence increasing age given person subjected prevalence pressure decreasing fewer members younger generations face pressure begin ambidexterity person approximately equal skill hands andor sides body true ambidexterity rare although small number people write competently hands use sides body well even people usually show preference one side body however preference necessarily consistent activities people may instance use right hand writing left hand playing racket sports see also crossdominance also uncommon people preferring use right hand prefer use left leg eg using shovel kicking ball operating control pedals many cases may disposed lefthandedness trained righthandedness usually attached learning behavioural disorders term usually called cross sport cricket
