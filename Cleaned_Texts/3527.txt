neuropeptide npy aminoacid neuropeptide involved various physiological homeostatic processes central peripheral nervous systems secreted alongside neurotransmitters gaba autonomic system produced mainly neurons sympathetic nervous system serves strong vasoconstrictor also causes growth fat brain produced various locations including hypothalamus thought several functions including increasing
