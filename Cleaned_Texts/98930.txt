plays critical role several cellular processes determine whether cell may develop tumor apc protein helps control often cell divides attaches cells within tissue cell polarizes morphogenesis whether cell moves within away tissue protein also helps ensure chromosome number cells produced cell division correct apc protein accomplishes tasks mainly association proteins especially involved cell
