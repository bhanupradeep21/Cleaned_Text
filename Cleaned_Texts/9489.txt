consumer adoption technological innovations process consumers use determine whether adopt innovation process influenced consumer characteristics personality traits demographic socioeconomic factors characteristics new product relative advantage complexity social influences opinion leaders context technological innovations adoption process also influenced one several new technologies incorporated new product new technologies likely significantly affect innovations functionality interface functionality refers set potential benefits product provide consumer interface refers specific means consumer interacts product obtain particular functionality specifically new technologies suggest four types innovations unique characteristics likely affect adoption process alternatively looked paradox technology donald norman book design everyday things outlines idea paradox technology normans paradox states new functionality added technology also increases complexity thus technology intended make life easier providing functionality also makes complex making things harder learn good design must reduce difficulties use evergrowing information communications technologies facebook

debate preference new technology introduced user evaluates perceived benefits functionality aesthetics etc outweigh negative social nuances may introduce new technology changes way user interacts often also asks users embrace new however technologies increasingly becoming mobile new behaviors frequently take place public location become integral part users social often case every new

considered esoteric many sandra vannoy prashant palvia developed theoretical model called social influence model investigates technology adoption societal communal postulate social influence consists four overlapping phenomenon technology adoption typically measured two factors embedment embracement daily social influence deals embedment technology embedment daily life evaluated examining members

changes affect products appearance smart phones example usually black silver first introduced market available multiple colors several months later innovations provide benefits available existing products result new set actions consumer voice recognition software one example type innovation consumers create documents emails example dictating instead typing computer innovations change consumer interaction device offer however new functionality multimode cellphones example operate one frequency enable roaming different countries car gps navigation systems example fall category products provide consumer novel functionality doortodoor navigation realtime traffic information novel interface implies new set actions using device using touchscreen voice recognition interfaces innovations incorporate novel interface require significant learning cost consumer since imply learning new set tasks high learning cost likely hinder adoption innovations unless functionality provided new provides significant benefits consumer furthermore innovations incorporating novel interface often result fear technological complexity leading feelings ineptitude frustration conversely innovations provide consumer new functionality characterized high relative advantage likely facilitate adoption technologies improved past years privacy become major concern among consumers data revolution big data technological innovations recently seriously affected concerns changes people interact new technologies privacy broad concept hard define simple manners still controversial subject confusion consumers reject many innovations unknowingly give personal data third parties daniel j solove expert topic privacy recent book understanding privacy lays problems frameworks privacy era technology data another good example eli parisers concept filter bubble lays book filter bubble internet hiding innovations like personalized search google controversial mainly consumers idea even occurring
