theory regarding effect legalized abortion crime often referred hypothesis controversial hypothesis reduction crime decades following legalization abortion proponents argue availability abortion resulted fewer births children highest risk committing crime earliest research suggesting effect study sweden steven levitt university chicago john donohue yale university argued citing research earlier studies children unwanted whose parents support likelier become criminals idea popularized inclusion book freakonomics levitt cowrote critics argued donohue levitts methodologies flawed statistically significant relationship abortion later crime rates criticisms include assumption donohuelevitt study abortion rates increased substantially since supreme court case roe v wade critics use census data show changes overall abortion rate could account decrease crime claimed studys methodology legal abortions permitted limited circumstances many states prior critics state correlations births crime found adequately account confounding factors reduced drug use changes demographics population densities contemporary cultural changes part problem long uncertain time lag cause effect increased abortion rates reduce crime among cohort children born particular year effect would become apparent ten twenty years later isolate effect abortion crime necessary control factors affect birth cohorts eg relative cohort size prevalence crime childhood immediate effects later years eg wage incarceration rockefeller commission population american future cites study found children born women denied abortion turned registered often psychiatric services engaged antisocial criminal behavior dependent public particular study looked children women denied abortions hospital gothenburg sweden compared unwanted children another group next child born unwanted children hospital unwanted children likely grow adverse conditions divorced parents raised foster homes likely become delinquents engaged steven levitt university chicago john donohue yale university revived discussion claim paper impact legalized abortion donohue levitt point fact males aged likely commit crimes data indicates crime united states started decline donohue levitt suggest absence unwanted children following legalization led reduction crime years later starting dropping sharply would peak crimecommitting years unborn according donohue levitt states legalized abortion roe v wade alaska california hawaii new york oregon washington also earlier reductions crime states high abortion rate experienced greater reduction crime corrected factors like average finally studies canada australia claimclarification needed established correlation legalized abortion overall crime study criticized various authors including john lott john whitley argued donohue levitt assume states completely legalized abortion higher abortion rates states abortion legal certain conditions many states allowed abortion certain conditions prior roe cdc statistics substantiate claim addition abortion rates cause crime rates fall crime rates start fall among youngest people first gradually seen lowering crime rate older older people fact argue murder rates first start fall among oldest criminals next oldest criminals last falls among youngest individuals lott whitley argue donohue levitt right percent drop murder rates due solely legalization abortion results seen graphs without anything controlled opposite true addition lott whitley pointed using arrest rate data proxy crime rates flawed arrest murder take place many months even years crime occurred lott whitley claim using supplemental homicide report links murder data crime occurred later arrest rate data reverses donohue levitts regression study ted joyce concluded negative association legalized abortion crime rates reported donohue levitts study actually due unmeasured period effects among factors changes crack cocaine joyce reported similar negative results analyzing agespecific homicide murder arrest rates relation legalization abortion across us states levitt posted rebuttal criticisms freakonomics weblog reran numbers address shortcomings variables missing original study new results nearly identical original study levitt posits reasonable use data available reinforces results original study donohue levitt addressed joyces criticisms showing negative correlation still exists range years examined extended beyond analyzed joyce effects crack epidemic adequately later christopher foote christopher goetz claimed computer error levitt donohues statistical analysis led artificially inflated relationship legalized abortion crime reduction crimeassociated factors properly controlled claimed effect abortion arrests reduced half foote goetz also criticize levitt donohues use arrest totals rather arrests per capita takes population size account using census bureau population estimates foote goetz repeated analysis using arrest rates place simple arrest totals found effect abortion disappeared donohue levitt subsequently published response foote goetz acknowledged mistake showed different methodology effect legalized abortion crime rates still existed foote goetz however soon produced rebuttal showing even analyzing data using methods levitt donohue recommend data show positive correlation abortion rates crime conceded necessarily disprove levitts thesis however emphasized data messy incomplete may even possible prove disprove donohue levitts conclusion jessica reyes amherst college stated implies phaseout lead gasoline responsible approximately decline violent crime sensitivity testing confirms strength results results murder robust new york district columbia included suggest substantial elasticity well significant effects found property crime effect legalized abortion reported donohue levitt largely unaffected abortion accounts decline violent crime elasticity similar declines murder property
