gene transfer arguments support genetic diversity primary evolutionary function sex including bacterial transformation given barton otto however theoretical difficulties associated evolution sex suggest sex genetic diversity problematic specifically respect bacterial transformation competence requires high cost global protein synthesis switch example genes switched competence streptococcus however since bacteria tend grow clones dna available transformation would generally genotype recipient cells thus always high cost protein expression without general increase diversity differences
