research group first clone extensively characterize molecular level sodiumiodide symporter nis key plasma membrane protein mediates active transport iodide thyroid lactating breast carrascos group obtained great deal mechanistic information nis determining molecular requirements protein amino acid positions mutations found patients group also discovered although nis transports iodide chloride unlike chloride transporters channels transport nis also transports anions including environmental pollutant perchlorate addition group recently identified allosteric site occupied oxyanion perchlorate completely changes mechanism nis transports iodide finding indicates perchlorate pollution may well dangerous human health previously thought carrasco groups nis knockout mouse made possible generate animal model hypothyroidism without need use drugs eg methimazole propylthiouracil animal model proven extremely valuable tool investigating crosstalk different tissues regulated
