electrical tuning mechanism vertebrates frogs reptiles lack long cochlea discriminate sound mammals long cochleae able distinguish different sounds mechanisms mechanical tuning stiffness length hair cells stereocilia makes given cell best suited respond certain type stimulus basilar membrane animals long cochleae also vibrates different locations along membrane response different frequency sounds since reptilian ear lacks long cochlea electrical tuning provides alternative mechanism perceiving differences sound combination voltagegated calcium channels calcium sensitive k channels cells set oscillation voltage oscillate response depolarizing stimulus ca enters cell depolarizes opening k channels allow k leave hyperpolarize cell since exit k cell delayed voltage increases exit k cell overshoots membrane potential hyperpolarizes different cells different delays k leaving thus voltage oscillates different frequencies delays short ms long ms whereas entry always occurs within thus varying length delay k leave cells ion concentrations oscillate specific frequencies cells higher oscillating frequencies respond best higherfrequency sounds lower frequencies respond best lower frequency ones cells resonate best given sound tells brain frequency sound hair cells respond high frequency stimuli send information specific neurons information remains segregated brain thus information sound frequency preserved rather lost would information different hair cells converged neuron group neurons httpsenwikipediaorgwikielectricaltuning
