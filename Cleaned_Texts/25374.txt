parallel perilymphatic duct separate blindending duct lagena filled endolymph lagena separated perilymphatic duct basilar membrane contains sensory hair cells finally translate vibrations fluid nerve signals attached one end reptiles perilymphatic duct lagena relatively short sensory cells confined small basilar papilla lying however mammals birds crocodilians structures become much larger somewhat complicated birds crocodilians monotremes ducts simply extended together forming elongated less straight tube endolymphatic duct wrapped simple loop around lagena basilar membrane lying along
