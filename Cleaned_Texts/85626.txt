weasel program dawkins weasel thought experiment variety computer simulations illustrating aim demonstrate process drives evolutionary variation combined nonrandom cumulative different pure chance thought experiment formulated richard dawkins first simulation written various implementations program written others chapter book blind watchmaker dawkins gave following introduction program referencing wellknown infinite monkey theorem dont know first pointed given enough time monkey bashing away random typewriter could produce works shakespeare operative phrase course given enough time let us limit task facing monkey somewhat suppose produce complete works shakespeare short sentence methinks like weasel shall make relatively easy giving typewriter restricted keyboard one capital letters space bar long take write one little sentence scenario staged produce string gibberish letters assuming selection letter sequence characters random number possible combinations random sequence probability monkey produce given sequence extremely low particular sequence characters could selected target phrase equally improbable dawkinss chosen target methinks like weasel computer program could written carry actions dawkinss hypothetical monkey continuously generating combinations letters spaces high speed even rate millions combinations per second unlikely even given entire lifetime universe run program would ever produce phrase methinks like dawkins intends example illustrate common misunderstanding evolutionary change ie dna sequences organic compounds proteins result atoms randomly combining form complex structures types computations sequence amino acids protein extraordinarily improbable known hoyles fallacy rather evolution proceeds hill climbing adaptive landscapes dawkins goes show process cumulative selection take far fewer steps reach given target dawkinss words use computer monkey crucial difference program begins choosing random sequence letters duplicates repeatedly certain chance random error mutation copying computer examines mutant nonsense phrases progeny original phrase chooses one however slightly resembles target phrase methinks like weasel repeating procedure randomly generated sequence letters spaces gradually changed generation sequences progress generation dawkins continues exact time taken computer reach target doesnt matter want know completed whole exercise first time lunch took half hour computer enthusiasts may think unduly slow reason program written basic sort computer babytalk rewrote pascal took seconds computers bit faster kind thing monkeys difference really isnt significant matters difference time taken cumulative selection time computer working flat rate would take reach target phrase forced use procedure singlestep selection million million million million million years million million million times long universe far existed program aims demonstrate preservation small changes evolving string characters genes produce meaningful combinations relatively short time long mechanism select cumulative changes whether person identifying traits desirable case artificial selection criterion survival fitness imposed environment case natural selection reproducing systems tend preserve traits across generations offspring inherit copy parents traits differences offspring variations copying become basis selection allowing phrases closer target survive remaining variants die dawkins discusses issue mechanism selection respect biomorphs program human eye active role play story selecting agent surveys litter progeny chooses one breeding model words strictly model artificial selection natural selection criterion success direct criterion survival true natural selection true natural selection body takes survive genes automatically survive inside genes survive tend automatically genes confer bodies qualities assist survive regarding examples applicability biological evolution careful point limitations although monkeyshakespeare model useful explaining distinction singlestep selection cumulative selection misleading important ways one generation selective breeding mutant progeny phrases judged according criterion resemblance distant ideal target phrase methinks like weasel life isnt like evolution longterm goal longdistance target final perfection serve criterion selection although human vanity cherishes absurd notion species final goal evolution real life criterion selection always shortterm either simple survival generally reproductive success blind watchmaker dawkins goes provide graphical model gene selection involving entities calls biomorphs twodimensional sets line segments bear relationships drawn control genes determine appearance biomorph selecting entities sequential generations biomorphs experimenter guide evolution figures toward given shapes airplane octopus biomorphs simulation biomorphs much closer actual genetic behavior biological organisms like weasel program development shaped external factor case decisions experimenter chooses many possible shapes go forward following generation however serve illustrate concept genetic space possible gene treated dimension actual genomes living organisms make tiny fraction possible gene combinations produce viable organism dawkins puts however many ways may alive certain vastly ways dead climbing mount improbable dawkins responded limitations weasel program describing programs written parties modeled evolution spider web suggested programs realistic models evolutionary process since predetermined goal coming web caught flies trial error process spiderwebs seen good topics evolutionary modeling simple examples biosystems easily visualized modeling programs successfully generated range spider webs similar found nature although dawkins provide source code program weasel style algorithm could run follows purposes character uppercase letter space number copies per generation chance mutation per letter specified dawkinss book copies mutation rate examples correct letters locked correct letter may become incorrect subsequent generations terms program existence target phrase however mean
