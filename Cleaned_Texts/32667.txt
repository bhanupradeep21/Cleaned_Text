rhinorrhea rhinorrhoea informally runny nose free discharge thin mucus fluid common condition common symptom allergies hay fever certain viral infections common cold side effect crying exposure cold temperatures cocaine drug withdrawal methadone treatment rhinorrhea may aimed reducing symptoms treating underlying causes rhinorrhea usually resolves without intervention may require treatment doctor symptoms last days symptoms result foreign bodies term rhinnorhea coined greek rhino nose rhoia discharge rhinorrhea characterized excess amount mucus produced mucous membranes line nasal cavities membranes create mucus faster processed causing backup mucus nasal cavities cavity fills blocks air passageway causing difficulty breathing nose air caught nasal cavities namely sinus cavities released resulting pressure may cause headache facial pain sinus passage remains blocked chance sinusitis may mucus backs eustachian tube may result ear pain ear infection excess mucus accumulating throat back nose may cause postnasal drip resulting sore throat additional symptoms include sneezing nosebleeds nasal runny nose caused anything irritates inflames nasal tissues including infections common cold influenza allergies various irritants people chronically runny nose apparent reason nonallergic rhinitis vasomotor rhinitis less common causes include polyps foreign body tumor migrainelike headaches causes rhinorrhea include acute sinusitis nasal sinus infection allergies chronic sinusitis common cold coronaviruses decongestant nasal spray overuse deviated septum dry air eosinophilic granulomatosis polyangiitis granulomatosis polyangiitis hormonal changes influenza flu lodged object medicines used treat high blood pressure erectile dysfunction depression seizures conditions nasal polyps nonallergic rhinitis chronic congestion sneezing related allergies occupational asthma pregnancy respiratory syncytial virus rsv spinal fluid leak tobacco rhinorrhea especially common cold weather coldinduced rhinorrhea occurs due combination thermodynamics bodys natural reactions cold weather stimuli one purposes nasal mucus warm inhaled air body temperature enters body requires nasal cavities constantly coated liquid mucus cold weather mucus lining nasal passages tends dry mucous membranes must work harder producing mucus keep cavity lined result nasal cavity fill mucus time air exhaled water vapor breath condenses warm air meets colder outside temperature near nostrils causes excess water build inside nasal cavities spilling rhinorrhea symptom diseases common cold influenza infections nasal mucous membranes produce excess mucus filling nasal cavities prevent infection spreading lungs respiratory tract could cause far worse also suggested viral rhinorrhea result viral evolution whereby virus variants increase nasal secretion thus resistant bodys immune defenses selected rhinorrhea caused infections usually occur circadian course viral infection sinusitis inflammation nasal tissue may occur causing mucous membranes release mucus acute sinusitis consists nasal passages swelling viral infection chronic sinusitis occurs sinusitis continues longer three rhinorrhea also occur individuals allergies certain substances pollen dust latex soy shellfish animal dander exposed allergens people sensitized immune systems inhalation one substances triggers production antibody immunoglobulin e ige binds mast cells basophils ige bound mast cells stimulated pollen dust causing release inflammatory mediators nasal cavities inflammatory mediators cause inflammation swelling tissue well increased mucus production particulate matter polluted air chemicals chlorine detergents normally tolerated make condition considerably rhinorrhea also associated shedding tears lacrimation whether emotional events eye irritation excess tears produced liquid drains inner corner eyelids nasolacrimal duct nasal cavities tears shed liquid flows nasal cavities stimulating mucus production hydrating dry mucus already present nasal cavity buildup fluid usually resolved via mucus expulsion rhinorrhea caused head injury serious condition basilar skull fracture result rupture barrier sinonasal cavity anterior cranial fossae middle cranial fossae cause nasal cavity fill cerebrospinal fluid cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea csf rhinorrhea condition lead number serious complications including death addressed rhinorrhea occur symptom opioid withdrawal accompanied causes include cystic fibrosis whooping cough nasal tumors hormonal changes cluster headaches rhinorrhea also side effect several genetic disorders primary ciliary dyskinesia well common irritants spicy foods nail polish remover paint cases treatment rhinorrhea necessary since clear especially symptom infection general cases noseblowing get rid mucus buildup though blowing may quickfix solution increases mucosal production sinuses leading frequent higher mucus buildups nose medium term alternatively saline vasoconstrictor nasal sprays may used may become counterproductive several days use causing rhinitis cases due allergies sinus infections medicinal treatments available several types antihistamines obtained relatively cheaply treat cases caused allergies antibiotics may help cases bacterial sinus httpsenwikipediaorgwikirhinorrhea
