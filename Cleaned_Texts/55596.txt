buffer strip area land maintained permanent vegetation helps control air quality soil quality water quality along environmental problems dealing primarily land used agriculture buffer strips trap sediment enhance filtration nutrients pesticides slowing surface runoff could enter local surface waters root systems planted vegetation buffers hold soil particles together alleviate soil wind erosion stabilize stream banks providing protection substantial erosion landslides farmers also use buffer strips square existing crop fields provide safety equipment also farming efficiently buffer strips several different configurations vegetation found varying simply grass combinations grass trees shrubs areas diverse vegetation provide protection nutrient pesticide flow time provide better biodiversity amongst plants many country state local governments provide financial incentives conservation programs buffer strips help stabilize environment help reduce nitrogen emissions water soil loss wind erosion simultaneously providing substantial environmental cobenefits even land buffer strips stabilize land also provide visual demonstration land stewardship grassed waterway reduces soil erosion captures nutrients pesticides would normally wash crop fields major waters waterways help carry surface water nonerosive velocity area stable outlets must adequate enough allow water drain without ponding flooding area protected also preventing erosion water outlet accomplished use riprap limitation large runoff events soil saturated grassed waterways concentrated flow water making effective high rainfalls grassed waterways require little maintenance introduced major upkeep mowing grass reseeding farm machinery cattle cross waterways may hazardous wet periods one major

filter strips originally used mostly agriculture common practice urban areas water quality become increasingly important riparian forest buffers diverse communities trees shrubs native perennial grasses great providing habitat wildlife land water taller trees next streams help lower water temperatures shade improves aquatic communities shrubs grasses help slow flooding larger trees sometimes intercept nitrates reach water deep main purpose windbreak shelterbelt protect areas wind causing erosion bare soil croplands windbreaks also serve area separates fields protects spray drift buffer strips important helping provide habitat many species wildlife open farm lands causing edge effect much land open farms edge allows safehaven animals move different ecosystems buffers also helpful conserving biodiversity especially rare endangered species incorporation native grasses seeding landowner native grasses especially important pheasants quail chukar songbirds provide foods need well shelter predators since buffer strip areas limited disturbance farming allows shelter hide year round many species including insects birds mammals buffers run follow riparian areas along stream beds important larger vegetation like trees shrubs shade water open sun water able cooler allowing greater fish production aquatic plants biota thrive less disturbed area vegetation following body water noted riparian zone buffer areas often incorporate large trees protect stream banks excessive erosion shade aquatic areas shade provided larger trees reduces water temperatures light intensity ultraviolet light debris including leaves branches fell trees often contain aquatic invertebrates important structure water following river continuum since riparian zones contain larger variety plants overall diversity much greater well photosynthesis higher amounts available water plant primary production increase turn creating potential food usda shows grassed waterways less slopes chosen
