al saeed et al independently proved neither pathways actually discovered ebolavirus uses macropinocytosis enter host induction macropinocytosis leads formation macropinocytosisspecific endosomes macropinosomes large enough accommodate ebola virions discovery proven fact ebolavirus colocalizes sorting nexin consists large family peripheral membrane proteins associate newly formed also blocking
