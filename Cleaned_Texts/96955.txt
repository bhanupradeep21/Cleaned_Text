human musculoskeletal system also known human locomotor system previously activity system organ system gives humans ability move using muscular skeletal systems musculoskeletal system provides form support stability movement body made bones skeleton muscles tendons ligaments joints connective tissue supports binds tissues organs together musculoskeletal systems primary functions include supporting body allowing motion protecting vital skeletal portion system serves main storage system calcium phosphorus contains critical components hematopoietic system describes bones connected bones muscle fibers via connective tissue tendons ligaments bones provide stability body muscles keep bones place also play role movement bones allow motion different bones connected joints cartilage prevents bone ends rubbing directly onto muscles contract move bone attached joint however diseases disorders may adversely affect function overall effectiveness system diseases difficult diagnose due close relation musculoskeletal system internal systems musculoskeletal system refers system muscles attached internal skeletal system necessary humans move favorable position complex issues injuries involving musculoskeletal system usually handled physiatrist specialist physical medicine rehabilitation orthopaedic surgeon skeletal system serves many important functions provides shape form body support protection allows bodily movement produces blood body stores number bones human skeletal system controversial topic humans born bones however many bones fuse together birth maturity result average adult skeleton consists bones number bones varies according method used derive count consider certain structures single bone multiple parts others may see single part multiple five general classifications bones long bones short bones flat bones irregular bones sesamoid bones human skeleton composed fused individual bones supported ligaments tendons muscles cartilage complex structure two distinct divisions axial skeleton includes vertebral column appendicular skeletal system serves framework tissues organs attach system acts protective structure vital organs major examples brain protected skull lungs protected rib cage located long bones two distinctions bone marrow yellow red yellow marrow fatty connective tissue found marrow cavity starvation body uses fat yellow marrow red marrow bones important site blood cell production approximately million red blood cells per second order replace existing cells destroyed erythrocytes platelets leukocytes form adults red marrow erythrocytes platelets leukocytes migrate blood special tasks another function bones storage certain minerals calcium phosphorus among main minerals stored importance storage device helps regulate mineral balance bloodstream fluctuation minerals high minerals stored bone low withdrawn bone three types skeletal smooth smooth muscles used control flow substances within lumens hollow organs consciously controlled skeletal cardiac muscles striations visible microscope due components within cells skeletal smooth muscles part musculoskeletal system muscles move body cardiac muscles found heart used circulate blood like smooth muscles muscles conscious control skeletal muscles attached bones arranged opposing groups around muscles innervated whereby nervous signals nerves conduct electrical currents central nervous system cause muscles mammals muscle contracts series reactions occur muscle contraction stimulated motor neuron sending message muscles somatic nervous system depolarization motor neuron results neurotransmitters released nerve terminal space nerve terminal muscle cell called neuromuscular junction neurotransmitters diffuse across synapse bind specific receptor sites cell membrane muscle fiber enough receptors stimulated action potential generated permeability sarcolemma altered process known tendon tough flexible band fibrous connective tissue connects muscles extracellular connective tissue muscle fibers binds tendons distal proximal ends tendon binds periosteum individual bones muscles origin insertion muscles contract tendons transmit forces relatively rigid bones pulling causing movement tendons stretch substantially allowing function springs locomotion thereby saving energy joints structures connect individual bones may allow bones move cause movement three divisions joints diarthroses allow extensive mobility two articular heads amphiarthrosis joint allows movement false joints synarthroses joints immovable allow little movement predominantly fibrous synovial joints joints directly joined lubricated solution called synovial fluid produced synovial membranes fluid lowers friction articular surfaces kept within articular capsule binding joint taut ligament small band dense white fibrous elastic ligaments connect ends bones together order form joint ligaments limit dislocation prevent certain movements may cause breaks since elastic increasingly lengthen pressure occurs ligament may susceptible break resulting unstable joint ligaments may also restrict actions movements hyper extension hyper flexion restricted ligaments extent also ligaments prevent certain directional bursa small fluidfilled sac made white fibrous tissue lined synovial membrane bursa may also formed synovial membrane extends outside joint provides cushion bones tendons muscles around joint bursa filled synovial fluid found around almost every major joint body many body systems including vascular nervous integumentary
