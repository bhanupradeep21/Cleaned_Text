euthecodon extinct genus longsnouted crocodile common throughout much africa neogene fossils especially common kenya ethiopia libya although superficially resembling gharials long snout trait developed independently crocodilians suggests diet primarily fish euthecodon coexisted wide range crocodiles areas inhabited eventually going extinct pleistocene first remains euthecodon described

fossils euthecodon ever found outside africa among three recognized species ginsburg buffetaut note clear evolutionary series oldest youngest species according research euthecodon shows series adaptations present e arambourgi progressively exaggerated e nitriae reaching peak e brumpti adaptations include gradual loss second premaxillary tooth development additional maxillary teeth continued lengthening narrowing skull exaggeration preorbital boss spanning nasal lacrimal prefrontal frontal bones raising external nares prominence lacrimal crest eyes also face forward later species e arambourgi authors however note certain traits conform direct evolutionary series instead appear prominent intermediate e nitriae one example e nitriae prefrontals overflow orbits giving circular appearance compared e brumpti ginsburg buffetaut suggests could evidence two possible hypothesis first holds continuous lineage suggesting continued rise nasal frontal boss caused complete reshaping region around orbits effectively undoing adaptations seen earlier forms second hypothesis proposes euthecodon split two lineages evolving increasingly longirostral forms different ways latter interpretation favored fact euthecodon clearly already present east africa early miocene indicated remains ombo rusinga although genus considered tomistomine gavialoid even direct descendant early
