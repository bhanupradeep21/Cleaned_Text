neurology abulia aboulia ancient greek βουλή meaning refers lack initiative seen disorder diminished motivation ddm abulia falls middle spectrum diminished motivation apathy less extreme akinetic mutism extreme condition originally considered disorder aboulic individuals unable act make decisions independently condition may range severity subtle overwhelming case akinetic mutism many patients describe soon attempt movement counterwill resistance rises meet clinical condition denoted abulia first described however since time number different contradictory definitions abulia described loss drive expression behavior speech output slowing prolonged speech latency reduction spontaneous thought content considered recently reduction action emotion clinical features commonly associated abulia especially patients progressive dementia may affect patients may continue chew hold food mouths hours without swallowing behavior may evident patients eaten part meals longer strong appetitescitation needed neurologists psychiatrists recognize abulia distinct clinical entity status syndrome unclear although abulia known clinicians since subjected different interpretations pure lack absence motor paralysis recently considered reduction action emotion result changing definition abulia currently debate whether abulia sign symptom another disease disease seems appear presence wellresearched diseases alzheimers survey two movement disorder experts two neuropsychiatrists two rehabilitation experts seem shed light matter differentiating abulia ddms experts used terms apathy abulia interchangeably debated whether abulia discrete entity hazy gray area spectrum defined four experts said abulia sign symptom group split whether another survey consisted true false questions abulia distinct whether sign symptom syndrome lesions present cases abulia diseases commonly associated abulia current treatments used abulia sent neurologists psychiatrists experts agreed abulia clinically distinct depression akinetic mutism however believed abulia different apathy said different unsure yet disagreement whether abulia sign symptom needed study motivation mostly stimuli come acquire significance animals recently study motivational processes extended integrate biological drives emotional states explanation purposeful behavior human beings considering number disorders attributed lack motivation essential abulia apathy defined precisely avoid many different causes abulia suggested debate validity abulia separate disease experts mostly agree abulia result frontal lesions cerebellar brainstem result evidence showing mesolimbic mesocortical dopamine system key motivation responsiveness reward abulia may dopaminerelated abulia may also result variety brain injuries cause personality change dementing illnesses trauma intracerebral hemorrhage stroke especially stroke causing diffuse injury right injuries frontal lobe andor basal ganglia interfere individuals ability initiate speech movement social interaction studies shown patients traumatic brain injuries patients lesions basal ganglia experience form diminished may complicate rehabilitation stroke patient uninterested performing tasks like walking despite capable differentiated apraxia brain injured patient impairment comprehending movements necessary perform motor task despite paralysis prevents performing task condition also result lack initiation activity case study involving two patients acute confusional state abulia conducted see symptoms result infarct capsular genu using clinical neuropsychological mri evaluations baseline one year later showed cognitive impairment still one year stroke cognitive behavioral alterations due genu infarct likely thalamocortical projection fibers originate ventralanterior medialdorsal nuclei traverse internal capsule genu tracts part complex system cortical subcortical frontal circuits flow information entire cortex takes place reaching basal ganglia cognitive deterioration could occurred genu infarcts affecting inferior anterior thalamic peduncles case study patients show functional deficits followup one year stroke depressed show diminished motivations result supports idea abulia may exist independently depression anterior cingulate circuit consists anterior cingulate cortex also referred brodmann area projections ventral striatum includes ventromedial caudate loop continues connect ventral pallidum connects ventral anterior nucleus thalamus circuit essential initiation behavior motivation goal orientation things missing patient disorder diminished motivation unilateral injury injury along point circuit leads abulia regardless side injury bilateral damage patient exhibit extreme case diminished motivation akinetic well documented caudate nucleus involved degenerative diseases central nervous system huntington disease case study acute caudate stroke patients found experiencing abulia cases abulia present patients left caudate infarct extended putamen seen ct mri diagnosis abulia quite difficult falls two disorders diminished motivation one could easily see extreme case abulia akinetic mutism lesser case abulia apathy therefore treat patient appropriately confused apathy might lead attempts involve patient physical rehabilitation interventions source strong motivation would necessary succeed would still absent best way diagnose abulia clinical observation patient well questioning close relatives loved ones give doctor frame reference compare patients new behavior see fact case diminished recent years imaging studies using ct mri scan shown quite helpful localizing brain lesions shown one main causes lack motivation reported patients alzheimers disease depression also common patients disease abulia mere symptom depressions half patients alzheimers disease abulia depression several studies shown abulia prevalent cases severe dementia may result reduced metabolic activity prefrontal regions brain patients alzheimers disease abulia significantly older patients alzheimers lack motivation going along prevalence abulia increased patients mild case alzheimers disease patients severe case alzheimers disease likely developed time patient got current treatments abulia pharmacological including use antidepressants however antidepressant treatment always successful opened door alternative methods treatment first step successful treatment abulia ddm preliminary evaluation patients general medical condition fixing problems fixed easily may mean controlling seizures headaches arranging physical cognitive rehabilitation cognitive sensorimotor loss ensuring optimal hearing vision speech elementary steps also increase motivation improved physical status may enhance functional capacity drive energy thereby increase patients expectation initiative effort steps pharmacological case abulia transient ischemic attack frontal lobes depicted episode house
