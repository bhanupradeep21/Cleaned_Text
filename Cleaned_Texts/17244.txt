artery pl arteries greek ἀρτηρία artēríā windpipe blood vessel humans animals takes oxygenated blood away heart systemic circulation one parts body exceptions carry deoxygenated blood pulmonary arteries pulmonary circulation carry blood lungs oxygenation umbilical arteries fetal circulation carry deoxygenated blood placenta arteries contrast veins carry deoxygenated blood back towards heart pulmonary fetal circulations carry oxygenated blood lungs fetus anatomy arteries separated gross anatomy macroscopic level microanatomy must studied microscope arterial system human body divided systemic arteries carrying blood heart whole body pulmonary arteries carrying deoxygenated blood heart lungs outermost layer artery vein known tunica externa also known tunica adventitia composed collagen fibers elastic tissue largest arteries containing vasa vasorum small blood vessels supply large blood layers clear boundary however tunica externa boundary illdefined normally boundary considered meets touches connective inside layer tunica media media made smooth muscle cells elastic tissue also called connective tissue proper collagen innermost layer direct contact flow blood tunica intima commonly called intima elastic tissue allows artery bend fit places body layer mainly made endothelial cells supporting layer elastin rich collagen elastic arteries hollow internal cavity blood flows called lumen arterial formation begins ends endothelial cells begin express arterial specific genes ephrin arteries form part circulatory system carry blood oxygenated pumped heart coronary arteries also aid heart pumping blood sending oxygenated blood heart allowing muscles function arteries carry oxygenated blood away heart tissues except pulmonary arteries carry blood lungs oxygenation usually veins carry deoxygenated blood heart pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood two types unique arteries pulmonary artery carries blood heart lungs receives oxygen unique blood oxygenated yet passed lungs unique artery umbilical artery carries deoxygenated blood fetus mother arteries blood pressure higher parts circulatory system pressure arteries varies cardiac cycle highest heart contracts lowest heart relaxes variation pressure produces pulse felt different areas body radial pulse arterioles greatest collective influence local blood flow overall blood pressure primary adjustable nozzles blood system across greatest pressure drop occurs combination heart output cardiac output systemic vascular resistance refers collective resistance bodys arterioles principal determinants arterial blood pressure given moment arteries highest pressure narrow lumen diameter consists three tunics tunica media intima external systemic arteries arteries including peripheral arteries systemic circulation part cardiovascular system carries oxygenated blood away heart body returns deoxygenated blood back heart systemic arteries subdivided two relative compositions elastic muscle tissue tunica media well size makeup internal external elastic lamina larger arteries mm diameter generally elastic smaller ones mm tend muscular systemic arteries deliver blood arterioles capillaries nutrients gases exchanged traveling aorta blood travels peripheral arteries smaller arteries called arterioles eventually capillaries arterioles help regulating blood pressure variable contraction smooth muscle walls deliver blood capillaries smooth muscle contraction primarily influenced activity sympathetic vasomotor nerves innervating enhanced sympathetic activation prompts vasoconstriction reducing lumen diameter reduced lumen diameter consequently elevates blood pressure within conversely decreased sympathetic activity within vasomotor nerves causes vasodilation vessels thereby decreasing blood aorta root systemic artery ie main artery humans receives blood directly left ventricle heart via aortic valve aorta branches arteries branch turn become successively smaller diameter arterioles arterioles supply capillaries turn empty venules first branches aorta coronary arteries supply blood heart muscle followed branches aortic arch namely brachiocephalic artery left common carotid left subclavian arteries capillaries smallest blood vessels part microcirculation microvessels width single cell diameter aid fast easy diffusion gases sugars nutrients surrounding tissues capillaries smooth muscle surrounding diameter less red blood cells red blood cell typically micrometers outside diameter capillaries typically micrometers inside diameter red blood cells must distort order pass capillaries small diameters capillaries provide relatively large surface area exchange gases nutrients systemic arterial pressures generated forceful contractions hearts left ventricle high blood pressure factor causing arterial damage healthy resting arterial pressures relatively low mean systemic pressures typically mmhg psi kpa surrounding atmospheric pressure mmhg psi kpa sea level withstand adapt pressures within arteries surrounded varying thicknesses smooth muscle extensive elastic inelastic connective tissues pulse pressure difference systolic diastolic pressure determined primarily amount blood ejected heart beat stroke volume versus volume elasticity major arteries blood squirt also known arterial gush effect artery cut due higher arterial pressures blood spurted rapid intermittent rate coincides heartbeat amount blood loss copious occur rapidly time factors elevated arterial blood sugar particularly seen diabetes mellitus lipoprotein cholesterol high blood pressure stress smoking implicated damaging endothelium walls arteries resulting atherosclerosis atherosclerosis disease marked hardening arteries caused atheroma plaque artery wall buildup cell debris contain lipids cholesterol fatty acids variable amount fibrous connective tissue accidental intraarterial injection either iatrogenically recreational drug use cause symptoms intense pain paresthesia necrosis usually causes permanent damage limb often amputation among ancient greeks hippocrates blood vessels called φλέβες phlebes word

apollonia developed theory pneuma originally meaning air soon identified soul thought coexist blood blood arteries thought responsible transport air tissues connected trachea result finding arteries cadavers devoid blood medieval times supposed arteries carried fluid called spiritual blood vital spirits considered different contents veins theory went back galen late medieval period ligaments also
