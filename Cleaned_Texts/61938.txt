although diamonds earth rare extraterrestrial diamonds diamonds formed outside earth common diamonds small enough contain carbon atoms abundant meteorites formed stars solar system high pressure experiments suggest large amounts diamonds formed methane ice giant planets uranus neptune planets planetary systems may almost pure diamonds also found stars may first mineral ever formed team scientists examined primitive meteorites found grains diamond nanometers diameter nanodiamonds trapped noble gases whose isotopic signature indicated came outside solar system analyses additional primitive meteorites also found nanodiamonds record origins preserved despite long violent history started ejected star interstellar medium went formation solar system incorporated planetary body later broken meteorites finally crashed earths meteorites nanodiamonds make percent carbon parts per million grains silicon carbide graphite also anomalous isotopic patterns collectively known presolar grains stardust properties constrain models nucleosynthesis giant stars unclear many nanodiamonds meteorites really outside solar system small fraction contain noble gases presolar origin recently possible study individually average ratio matches earths atmosphere matches sun techniques atom probe tomography make possible examine individual grains due limited number atoms isotopic
