situational strength defined cues provided environmental forces regarding desirability potential situational strength said result psychological pressure individual engage andor refrain particular behaviors consequence psychological pressure act certain way likelihood despite individuals personality act certain manner strong situations situations situational strength high exist relationship personality variables example extraversion risktaking behaviors behaviors reduced matter personality individual act way dictated situation weak situations exist less structure ambiguity respect behaviors example strong situation red traffic light traffic rules dictate people supposed act see red light influence often prevents people engaging behaviors consistent personalities example people matter whether daring cautious stop front red traffic light therefore one could reasonably predict person would behave personality situation contrast example soft situation yellow traffic light appropriate course action especially well defined norms inconsistent thus individuals daring likely speed intersection yellow light whereas cautious individuals likely stop although difficult formally express situations restricting individual differences personality began psychology work conducted carl rogers suggested certain individual differences likely manifest situations psychological freedom safety compared situations psychological freedom safety additionally stanley milgram argued psychological forces conflict may brought play diluted however recent conceptualization study situational strength traced back work walter mischel mischel published classic book personality assessment argued personality studied vacuum instead complexity human behavior determinants must studied perspective accounts simultaneous interactive impact individual differences situational important note mischel imply people show consistencies behavior individual differences unimportant major theme rather trait approach personality sensitive influence situations books articles topic mischel stressed importance better understanding individual differences likely important predictors behavior likely nullified situational influences specifically mischel began laying foundation subsequent thought area arguing psychological situations treatments powerful degree lead persons construe particular events way induce uniform expectancies regarding appropriate response pattern provide adequate incentives performance response pattern instill skills necessary satisfactory construction execution p argued individual differences likely directly affect behavior situation ambiguously structured subjects uncertain categorize clear expectations behaviors likely appropriate normative reinforced situation p thus helped lay foundation general idea underlying typically referred situational strength situation strength mischels work led important shift social scientists thinking behavioral expression personality recently argued situational strength often viewed true without treating situational strength theoretical construct need conceptual development empirical meyer dalal hermida argue theoretical understanding practical application situational strength advanced least three important issues must four facets situational strength identified empirical study incorporated votecounting metaanalysis found conceptualizations situational strength currently exist psychological literature form interaction nonability individual differences additionally effect size interaction effect reasonably situational strength comes perception behavior metaanalysis performed bowling et al test relationship situational strength job satisfaction job performance results constraints consequences led negative relationship job satisfaction job performance related strong versus weak situations found situational strength mediator two example provided employer would use situational strength understand satisfied employee better performance opposite less satisfied employee worse performance holds true cases limitations employer holding job title employee lower level situational studies shown situational strength related counterproductive work behavior counterproductive work behavior lead absent stealing fraud aggression increases crime workplace happened every region counterproductive work behavior usually considered unacceptable lead harming others studies found two traits responsible effect counterproductive work behavior agreeableness contentiousness evident across many cultures continuousness found trait strongest prediction rate counterproductive work behavior influence trait likely stronger weaker situation group norms also considered studies performed one results group norm study seeing someone rewarded action observer like perform action expecting selfpromotion frequently used workplace lying job application high selfesteem act selfpromotion often caused narcissism personality trait study performed test situational strength ties narcissism used selfpromotion results showed situational strength moderator narcissistic selfpromotion resistance strong situations enough show plays role preventing perhaps important implication situational strength commonly believed explain crosssituational variability criterionrelated validity noncognitive individual suggests psychology focus whether personality constructs predict job performance rather conditions predict job performance also shows great practical implications personnel selection criterionrelated validity individual differences may vary across different occupations instance meyer dalal bonaccio found occupationlevel situational strength moderates relationship conscientiousness better predicts performance characteristically weak occupations characteristically strong another important implication revolves around idea personenvironment fit one core ideas expressed fit literature mismatch individuals needs environmental supplies deleterious effects performance attitudes within context situational strength employees may view highly constraining environments stifling frustrating whereas others may find regimented predictable nature constraining environments comforting relaxing differences fact exist would suggest employees psychological reactions partially function individual differences profile partially function nature situation experiencing two critical aspects situational strength fruitful future study httpsenwikipediaorgwikisituationalstrength
