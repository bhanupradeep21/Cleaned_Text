experiments series experiments conducted alfred hershey martha chase helped confirm dna genetic material dna known biologists since many scientists still assumed time proteins carried information inheritance dna appeared inert molecule since located nucleus role considered phosphorus storage experiments hershey chase showed bacteriophages composed dna protein infect bacteria dna enters host bacterial cell protein hershey chase subsequent discoveries served prove dna hereditary material hershey shared nobel prize physiology medicine max delbr√ºck salvador luria discoveries concerning genetic structure early twentieth century biologists thought proteins carried genetic information based belief proteins complex dna phoebus levenes influential tetranucleotide hypothesis incorrectly proposed dna repeating set identical nucleotides supported conclusion results experiment published suggested dna genetic material still hesitation within general scientific community accept set stage experimentcitation needed hershey chase along others done related experiments confirmed dna biomolecule carried genetic information oswald avery colin macleod maclyn mccarty shown dna led transformation one strain streptococcus pneumoniae another results experiments provided evidence dna biomolecule carried genetic informationcitation needed hershey chase needed able examine different parts phages studying separately needed distinguish phage subsections viruses known composed protein shell dna chose uniquely label different elemental isotope allowed observed analyzed separately since phosphorus contained dna amino acids radioactive used label dna contained phage radioactive used label protein sections phage sulfur contained protein hershey chase inserted radioactive elements bacteriophages adding isotopes separate media within bacteria allowed grow hours bacteriophage introduction bacteriophages infected bacteria progeny contained radioactive isotopes structures procedure performed sulfurlabeled phages phosphoruslabeled phages labeled progeny allowed infect unlabeled bacteria phage coats remained outside bacteria genetic material entered disruption phage bacteria agitation blender followed centrifugation allowed separation phage coats bacteria bacteria lysed release phage progeny progeny phages labeled radioactive phosphorus remained labeled whereas progeny phages labeled radioactive sulfur unlabeled thus experiment helped confirm dna protein genetic hershey chase showed introduction deoxyribonuclease referred dnase enzyme breaks dna solution containing labeled bacteriophages introduce solution demonstrated phage resistant enzyme intact additionally able plasmolyze bacteriophages went osmotic shock effectively created solution containing heavier solution containing structures called ghosts contained protein coat virus found ghosts could adsorb bacteria susceptible although contained dna simply remains original viral capsule concluded protein protected dna dnase two separated phage inactivated dnase could hydrolyze phage hershey chase also able prove dna phage inserted bacteria shortly virus attaches host using highspeed blender able force bacteriophages bacterial cells adsorption lack dna remaining solution bacteriophages allowed adsorb bacteria showed phage dna transferred bacterial cell presence almost radioactive solution showed protein coat protects dna adsorption stayed outside hershey chase concluded dna protein genetic material determined protective protein coat formed around bacteriophage internal dna conferred ability produce progeny inside bacterium showed growth protein function dna function determined amount radioactive material remaining outside cell remained outside cell demonstrating incorporated dna cells genetic material protein coats remained outside cell showing incorporated cell protein genetic materialcitation needed hershey chases experiment concluded little sulfurcontaining material entered bacterial cell however specific conclusions made regarding whether material sulfurfree enters bacterial cell phage adsorption research necessary conclude solely bacteriophages dna entered cell combination protein dna protein contain sulfur hershey chase concluded protein likely hereditary genetic material however make conclusions regarding specific function dna hereditary material said must undefined confirmation clarity came year later james watson francis crick correctly hypothesized journal article molecular structure nucleic acids structure deoxyribose nucleic acid double helix structure dna suggested copying mechanism dna functions hereditary material furthermore watson crick suggested dna genetic material responsible synthesis thousands proteins found cells made proposal based structural similarity exists two macromolecules protein dna linear sequences monomers amino acids nucleotides experiment published scientific community generally acknowledged dna genetic code material discovery led detailed investigation dna determine composition well structure using xray crystallography structure dna discovered james watson francis crick help previously documented experimental evidence maurice wilkins rosalind knowledge structure dna led scientists examine nature genetic coding turn understand process protein synthesis george gamow proposed genetic code composed sequences three dna base pairs known triplets codons represent one twenty amino genetic coding helped researchers understand mechanism gene expression process information gene used protein synthesis since much research conducted modulate steps gene expression process steps include transcription rna splicing translation posttranslational modification used control chemical structural nature moreover genetic engineering gives engineers ability directly manipulate genetic materials organisms using recombinant dna techniques first recombinant dna molecule created paul berg combined dna monkey virus lambda experiments hereditary material time experiment often used bacteriophages model organism bacteriophages lend experiments hereditary material incorporate genetic material host cells genetic material making useful tools multiply quickly easily collected experiment predecessors experiment successors served unequivocally establish hereditary information carried dna finding numerous applications forensic science crime investigation genealogy provided background knowledge applications dna forensics dna fingerprinting uses data originating dna protein sources deduce
