one way thinking holds mental process decisionmaking rational formal process based optimizing rational thinking decisionmaking leave much room fact emotions often considered irrational occurrences may distort however presently theories research rational decisionmaking emotional decisionmaking focusing important role emotions decisionmaking mental process logic important role rational decisionmaking loewenstein lerner divide emotions decisionmaking two types anticipating future emotions immediately experienced deliberating deciding damasio formulated somatic marker hypothesis smh proposes mechanism emotional processes guide bias behavior particularly decisionmaking pfister böhm believe issue rationality based validity emotional evaluations rather formal coherence loewenstein lerner divide emotions decisionmaking two types anticipating future emotions immediately experienced deliberating deciding anticipated expected emotions experienced directly expectations person feel gains losses associated decision great deal research focused riskreturn spectrum considered decisions example students may anticipate regret deciding section class best register participants weightloss plan might anticipate pleasure feel lose weight versus negative feelings unsuccessful efforts may generally contemplation incremental losses gains generates anticipated emotions decisionmakers opposed overall condition means investor imagines losing small amount money generally focus disappointment lost investment rather pleasure overall amount still owned similarly dieter anticipates losing two pounds may imagine feeling pleasure even though two pounds small percentage needs lost overall also decisionmakers tend compare possible result decision could happened rather current state instance game participants could win end nothing base disappointment loss hopedfor prize rather fact less money began game process anticipation emotion referred counterfactual comparison finally decisionmakers tend weight possible outcomes differently based amount delay choice outcome decisions made time delay intertemporal choice tend involve different weights outcomes depending delay involving hyperbolic discounting affective forecasting effects connected anticipated emotions decision contemplated true emotions experienced decisionmaking termed immediate emotions integrating cognition somatic bodily experienced components within autonomic nervous system outward emotional expressions may may connected decision hand however contemplation decision consequences may give rise immediate emotions known anticipatory integral influences immediate emotions also related current environment dispositional affect person although unrelated decision consideration type emotion still impact decisionmaking process incidental immediate emotions tend operate differently anticipated emotions first intense tend negate probability possible outcome example fear flying experienced deciding travel may lead person choose driving even though air safety statistics would show air travel statistically less likely present danger intense emotions exact higher influence decision probabilities consideration also immediate emotions sensitive vivid possible outcome decisionmaker fear flying may enhanced vividness mental image plane crash may mind decisionmaker finally soon outcome may happen impacts related immediate emotions sooner impending possible outcome intense emotion associated event overall emotions real experienced emotions opposed anticipated thinking possible outcomes powerfully impact somatic marker hypothesis smh formulated antonio damasio proposes mechanism emotional processes guide bias behavior particularly emotions defined damasio changes body brain states response different physiological changes eg muscle tone heart rate endocrine release posture facial expression etc occur body relayed brain transformed emotion tells individual something stimulus encountered time emotions corresponding bodily changes become associated particular situations past outcomes making decisions physiological signals somatic markers evoked emotion consciously unconsciously associated past outcomes bias decisionmaking towards certain behaviors avoiding instance somatic marker associated positive outcome perceived person may feel happy motivated pursue behavior somatic marker associated negative outcome perceived person may feel sad emotion may act internal alarm warn individual avoid course action situationspecific somatic states based reinforced past experiences help guide behavior favor advantageous choices therefore adaptive according smh two distinct pathways reactivate somatic marker responses first pathway emotion evoked changes body projected body loop instance encountering feared object like snake may initiate fightorflight response cause fear second pathway cognitive representations emotions activated brain without directly elicited physiological asif body loop instance imagining encounter snake would initiate similar flightorfight response asif particular situation albeit perhaps much weaker one words brain anticipate expected bodily changes allows individual respond faster external stimuli without waiting event actually according dunn somatic marker hypothesis proposes somatic marker biasing signals body represented regulated emotion circuitry brain particularly ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmpfc help regulate decisionmaking situations complexity uncertainty therefore situations complexity uncertainty marker signals allow brain recognise situation respond pfister böhm developed classification emotions function decisionmaking conceptualizes integral role emotions rather simply influencing four roles played emotions framework framework help exploring concepts ambivalence tendencies toward particular types action sustaining difficult choices time research done isen patrick put forth theory mood maintenance states happy decisionmakers reluctant gamble words happy people decide gambling since would want undermine happy alternatively influence negative feelings time decisionmaking studied raghunathan tuan pham conducted three experiments gambling decisions job selection decisions unhappy subjects found prefer highriskhighreward options unlike anxious subjects preferred lowrisklowreward options stated anxiety sadness convey distinct types information decisionmaker prime different goals found anxiety primes implicit goal uncertainty reduction sadness primes implicit goal reward thus emotions simply classified positive negative need consider consequences emotions ultimate decisionmaking another important factor memory events decision making mood someone works retrieval cue whereby happy feelings make positive materials come mind turn great impact decisions made true negative bower coined term statedependent remembering bower others stated emotions feelings extracted human mind emotions felt particular situation recorded emotional memory activated person faces similar situation make difficult decision short period time often decision maker unaware previous experiences similar much
