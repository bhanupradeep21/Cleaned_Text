changes either hearing perception hearing threshold episodes usually cyclical symptoms fluctuate time patients may symptomfree episodes may progressively worsen improve remain constant severity duration permanent damage occurs may left longterm hearing loss hearing distortion tinnitus andor feeling fullness affected study looking spiral ganglion cell counts compared hair cell counts inner ear patients menieres disease found maintained hair cells spinal ganglion thus could possible hydrops affects auditory nerves hair contrast article richard gacek posits hearing loss actually caused toxic nucleic acids released outer hair cells since outer hair cells ohc freely surrounded perilymph walls nerve terminals also bathed fluid typeii spiral ganglion cells contact ohc unlikely play significant role hearing loss low numbers lack known connection central auditory cochlear hydrops preferentially affects apex cochlea lowfrequency sounds interpreted due fluid imbalance area parts cochlea stretched tension usual lead distortions sound changes pitch perception hearing loss usually low frequencies common symptoms include menieres disease atypical early mild cases may present symptoms diagnosis based symptoms hearing test documents loss low mid frequencies usually one ear patients mild atypical hydrops hearing thresholds may normal may experience subjective unilateral distortion sounds lower frequencies diplacusis voices sounding robotic patients may also mention feeling pressure fullness objectively test presence hydrops electrocochleography ecog procedure done detect elevated inner ear also possible reveal presence hydrops vertigo experienced diagnosis progresses menieres disease occurs fluid increase leads leak rupture membranes inner ear causing mixture perilymph treatment cochlear hydrops menieres disease currently cure exists patient undergone sudden sensorineural hearing loss course steroids often prescribed attempt recover hearing steroids may injected directly like menieres disease low salt diet recommended preventative measure diuretic may prescribed help lower salt betahistine widely prescribed medication treatment menieres disease drug thought increase blood flow inner ear prevent frequency intensity episodes betahistine considered safe insufficient evidence effective fda approved united states yet still clinically observed benefit patients considered safer effective betahistine high doses mgday yield similar vertigo control intratympanic antivirals proven effective suspect viral cause cochlear surgery may effective endolymphatic sac decompression surgery often reserved cases measures proven ineffective andor vestibular issues main complaint runs risk causing hearing nerve symptoms cochlear hydrops fluctuate condition tends stabilize go away several years however organ corti undergoes stress hydrops episodes longterm hearing loss tinnitus hyperacusis possible considered cochlear hydrops early form menieres disease however people menieres disease form hydrops majority cochlear hydrops patients go develop menieres takes average one year onset symptoms someone develop full menieres disease data often progression menieres disease occurs mixed majority recent studies suggest low likelihood study japan looked patients menieres disease classified subcategories based first symptoms study found majority patients menieres disease presented vertigo first symptoms patients presented cochlear symptoms first tinnitus deafness however study found patients started cochlear hydrops diagnosis progressed menieres disease concluded cochlear menieres disease frequently develops menieres conversely study doctors house ear institute found conversion cochlear hydrops menieres disease occurred diagnosed patients study including study japan found diagnosed patients sudden lowfrequency hearing loss slfhl went develop full menieres disease recurring slfhl developed menieres study patients
