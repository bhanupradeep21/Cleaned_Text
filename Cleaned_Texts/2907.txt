dyspnea arise large number sources including carotid bodies medulla lungs chest wall chemoreceptors carotid bodies medulla supply information regarding blood gas levels lungs juxtacapillary j receptors sensitive pulmonary interstitial edema stretch receptors signal bronchoconstriction muscle spindles chest wall signal stretch tension respiratory muscles thus poor ventilation leading hypercapnia left heart failure leading interstitial edema impairing gas exchange asthma causing bronchoconstriction limiting airflow muscle fatigue leading ineffective respiratory muscle action could contribute feeling efferent signals motor neuronal signals descending respiratory muscles important respiratory muscle diaphragm respiratory muscles include external internal intercostal muscles
