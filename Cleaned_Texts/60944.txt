along increased proliferation ability discovery research tcadherin functions early studying blood cells v tkachuk colleagues discovered calcium ions get mobilized platelets influence lipoproteins leads aggregation effect pronounced influence adrenaline around time discovered mobilized smooth muscle cells smc influence angiotensin endothelin using smc culture fitting experiments researchers managed demonstrate low density lipoproteins capable stimulating exit endoplasmic reticulum effect occurs without involving classic apobe receptor goldstein brown received nobel prize discovering apobe receptor identify new lipoproteinbinding receptor purified segregated classified tcadherin protein group cadherins responsible hemophilic intracellular interaction research v tkachuk colleagues found unlike classical cadherins n e cadherin tcadherin bypass intracellular adhesion instead causes cells repel involved cell migration cytoskeleton restructuring research revealed tcadherin navigational receptor helps migrating cells growing blood vessels avoid certain tissues linking lipoproteins tcadherin disrupt angiogenesis affect heart vessel remodeling later determined tcadherin expressed endothelial cells able regulate endothelium permeability part tumor angiogenesis growth well melanoma metastasis research biological functions urokinasetype plasminogen activator upa since early v tkachuk colleagues e v parfyonova r sh bibilashvili p domogatskiy bobik others studying molecular mechanisms blood vessel growth particular lot research focused role urokinasetype plasminogen activator urokinase upa angiogenesis vessel remodeling revealed increased expression upa receptor upar occurred damaged vessel cells process accompanied increased taxis smooth muscle cells fibroblasts well narrowing lumen vessel upa suppressed counteractive antibodies intensity process reduced turned enhanced expression upa caused proliferation vessel cells stimulated synthesis oxidative stress inflammation proteins v tkachuk colleagues also first time showed urokinases ability transport core interact transcriptional factors regulate proliferation fibroblasts transformation myofibroblasts latest research showed urokinase system vessels necessary determining growth branching trajectory capillaries ie performs navigational function v tkachuks research revealed interesting results
