species specimen consisting nearly complete skeleton wellpreserved second species lufengosaurus l magnus also named young paper lufengosaurus huenei would fully described specific name suggests word magnus meaning large one latin species considered separate l huenei due significantly larger size third larger l huenei length however authors regarded junior synonym l huenei specimens said simply represent larger individuals type another prosauropod young named gyposaurus sinensis noted distinct lufengosaurus behalf limbs least smaller though similarities overall form genus subsequently referred lufengosaurus two separate occasions peter galton svp presentation wang referral however doubted lufengosaurus would referred another genus yet michael cooper suggesting lufengosaurus yunnanosaurus species south african genus massospondylus however reanalysis paul barrett colleagues performed skull lufengosaurus huenei established firmly valid genus separate massospondylus

lufengosaurus first complete dinosaur skeleton mounted china commemorative postage yuan issued april celebrate event first time ever dinosaur depicted skeleton display paleozoological museum china beijing young originally assigned lufengosaurus plateosauridae suborder prosauropoda noting stood close plateosaurus fraasianus still sometimes considered member plateosauridae though cladistic analyses found member massospondylidae instead matches current knowledge lufengosaurus anatomy proven similar taxa like coloradisaurus massospondylus previously thought lufengosaurus formerly considered anatomical similarities lufengosaurus historically maximum three named species one almost unilaterally considered valid nowadays l huenei two species l magnus l changduensis respectively considered junior synonym nomen specimens assigned l magnus past referred type species instead barret upchurch wang recovered lufengosaurus sister taxon gyposaurus sinensis cladistic differing result
