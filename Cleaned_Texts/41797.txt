junctional diversity describes dna sequence variations introduced improper joining gene segments process vdj recombination process vdj recombination vital roles vertebrate immune system able generate huge repertoire different tcell receptor tcr immunoglobulin molecules required pathogen antigen recognition tcells b cells respectively junctional diversity includes process somatic recombination vdj recombination different variable gene segments segments involved antigen recognition tcrs immunoglobulins rearranged unused segments removed introduces doublestrand breaks required segments ends form hairpin loops must joined together form single strand summarised diagram right joining inaccurate process results variable addition subtraction nucleotides thus generates junctional generation junctional diversity starts proteins recombination activating along dna repair proteins responsible singlestranded cleavage hairpin loops addition series palindromic p nucleotides subsequent enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase tdt adds random n nucleotides newly synthesised strands anneal one another mismatches common exonucleases remove unpaired nucleotides gaps filled dna synthesis repair exonucleases may also cause shortening junction however process still poorly junctional diversity liable cause frameshift mutations thus production nonfunctional proteins therefore considerable waste involved httpsenwikipediaorgwikijunctionaldiversity
