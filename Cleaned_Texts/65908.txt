eye movement includes voluntary involuntary movement eyes eye movements used number organisms eg primates rodents flies birds fish cats crabs octopus fixate inspect track visual objects interests special type eye movement rapid eye movement occurs rem sleep eyes visual organs human body move using system six muscles retina specialised type tissue containing photoreceptors senses light specialised cells convert light electrochemical signals signals travel along optic nerve fibers brain interpreted vision visual cortex primates many vertebrates use three types voluntary eye movement track objects interest smooth pursuit vergence types movements appear initiated small cortical region brains frontal corroborated removal frontal lobe case reflexes reflex shifting eyes moving light intact though voluntary control six extraocular muscles facilitate eye movement muscles arise common tendinous ring annulus zinn orbit eye cavity attach eyeball six muscles lateral medial inferior superior recti muscles inferior superior oblique muscles muscles contracting cause movement eyeball pulling eyeball towards muscle example lateral rectus lateral side eyeball contracts eyeball moves pupil looks outwards medial rectus causes eyeball look inwards inferior rectus downwards superior rectus upwards superior oblique muscle inferior oblique muscle attach angles eyeballcitation needed eye movement lateral rectus muscle superior view eye movement medial rectus muscle superior view eye movement inferior rectus muscle superior view eye movement superior rectus muscle superior view eye movement superior oblique muscle superior view eye movement inferior oblique muscle superior view anterior view three antagonistic pairs muscles control eye movement lateral medial recti muscles superior inferior recti muscles superior inferior oblique muscles muscles responsible movement eye along three different axes horizontal either toward nose adduction away nose abduction vertical either elevation depression torsional movements bring top eye toward nose intorsion away nose extorsion horizontal movement controlled entirely medial lateral recti muscles medial rectus muscle responsible adduction lateral rectus muscle abduction vertical movement requires coordinated action superior inferior recti muscles well oblique muscles relative contribution recti oblique groups depends horizontal position eye primary position eyes straight ahead groups contribute vertical movement elevation due action superior rectus inferior oblique muscles depression due action inferior rectus superior oblique muscles eye abducted recti muscles prime vertical movers elevation due action superior rectus depression due action inferior rectus eye adducted oblique muscles prime vertical movers elevation due action inferior oblique muscle depression due action superior oblique muscle oblique muscles also primarily responsible torsional movementcitation needed muscles supplied oculomotor nerve exception superior oblique supplied trochlear nerve lateral rectus supplied abducens brain exerts ultimate control voluntary involuntary eye movement three cranial nerves carry signals brain control extraocular muscles oculomotor nerve controls majority muscles trochlear nerve controls superior oblique muscle abducens nerve controls lateral rectus muscle addition movement muscles numerous areas brain contribute involuntary voluntary eye movement include providing conscious perception vision well areas facilitate tracking eye movement classified according two systems vergence movement convergence movement eyes make sure image object looked falls corresponding spot retinas type movement helps depth perception pursuit movement smooth pursuit movement eyes make tracking objects movement moving image remain maintained eyes never completely rest make frequent fixational eye movement even fixated one point reason movement related photoreceptors ganglion cells appears constant visual stimulus make photoreceptors ganglion cells become unresponsive hand changing stimulus eye movement constantly changes stimuli fall photoreceptors ganglion cells making image saccades rapid movement eyes used scanning visual scene subjective impression eyes move smoothly across printed page reading instead make short rapid movements called saccade eyes move fast speed consciously controlled movement worth minutes arc regular intervals three four per second one main uses saccades scan greater area highresolution fovea research conducted university south australia partnership university stuttgart revealed relationship eye moment personality traits ai visual system brain slow process information images slipping across retina degrees per thus able see moving brain must compensate motion head turning eyes another specialisation visual system many vertebrate animals development small area retina high visual acuity area called fovea covers degrees visual angle people get clear view world brain must turn eyes image object regard falls fovea eye movement thus important visual perception failure lead serious visual disabilities see quick demonstration fact try following experiment hold hand one foot cm front nose keep head still shake hand side side slowly first faster faster first able see fingers quite clearly frequency shaking passes hz fingers become blur keep hand still shake head left right matter fast shake head image fingers remains clear demonstrates brain move eyes opposite head motion much better follow pursue hand movement pursuit system fails keep moving hand images slip retina see blurred handcitation needed brain must point eyes accurately enough object regard falls corresponding points two retinas avoid perception double vision vertebrates humans mammals reptiles birds movement different body parts controlled striated muscles acting around joints movement eye slightly different eyes rigidly attached anything held orbit six extraocular muscles reading eye moves continuously along line text makes short rapid movements saccades intermingled short stops fixations considerable variability fixations point saccade jumps saccades readers even person reading single passage text eye movement music reading scanning musical score musicians eyes usually occurs music read performance although musicians sometimes scan music silently study sometimes perform memory without score eye movement music reading may first appear similar language reading since activities eyes move page fixations saccades picking processing coded meanings however music nonlinguistic involves strict continuous time constraint output generated continuous stream coded instructionscitation needed eye movement scene viewing refers visual processing information presented scenes core aspect studies area division eye movements rapid movement eyes saccades focus eyes point fixations several factors influence eye movement scene viewing including task knowledge viewer topdown factors properties image viewed bottomup factors typically presented scene viewers demonstrate short fixation durations long saccade amplitudes earlier phases viewing image followed longer fixations shorter saccades latter phases scene viewing also found eye movement behaviour scene viewing differs levels cognitive development fixation durations thought shorten saccade amplitudes lengthen increase eye movements fixate affected bottomup topdown factors even initial glimpse scene influence subsequent eye bottomup factors local contrast prominence features large contrast greater density affect guidance eye movements however topdown factors scenes greater impact eyes fixate areas containing meaningful areas colour aids discrimination objects influence eye images related previous images shown also eye movements also guided towards items heard verbally time seeing crossculturally found westerners inclination concentrate focal objects scene whereas east asians attend contextual average fixation durations last ms although large variability variability mostly due properties image task carried impact bottomup topdown processing masking degradations decrease luminance fixations factors affect bottomup processing found increase length fixation however enhancement image factors also increases fixation factors affect topdown processing eg blurring found increase decrease fixation following terms may used describe eye movement httpsenwikipediaorgwikieyemovement
