accurate characterization across life stages reference libraries used connect barcode sequences single species used identify species present dna samples libraries reference sequences also useful identifying species cases morphological ambiguity larval edna samples barcoding methods used water management species composition used indicator ecosystem barcoding metabarcoding methods particularly useful studying endangered elusive fish species detected without catching harming biomonitoring aquatic ecosystems required national international legislation eg water framework directive marine
