epileptogenesis gradual process typical brain develops epilepsy chronic condition seizures changes brain occasionally cause neurons fire abnormal hypersynchronous manner known causes epilepsy broadly classified genetic structuralmetabolic anything causes epilepsy causes epileptogenesis epileptogenesis process developing epilepsy structural causes epilepsy include neurodegenerative diseases traumatic brain injury stroke brain tumor infections central nervous system status epilepticus prolonged seizure series seizures occurring quick brain injury occurs frequently silent latent period lasting months years seizures canadian neurosurgeon wilder penfield called time injury seizure silent period strange latent period changes physiology brain result development process hyperexcitable neural networks form referred researchers come better understand epileptogenesis latent period may allow healthcare providers interfere development epilepsy reduce changes occur epileptogenesis poorly understood thought include cell death axonal sprouting reorganization neural networks alterations release neurotransmitters changes cause neurons become hyperexcitable lead spontaneous brain regions highly sensitive insults cause epileptogenesis include temporal lobe structures hippocampus amygdala piriform addition chemical processes physical structure neurons brain may altered acquired epilepsy humans animal models pyramidal neurons lost new synapses hyperexcitability characteristic feature epileptogenesis likelihood neural networks activated increased may due loss inhibitory neurons gabaergic interneurons would normally balance excitability neuronal circuits epileptic known hyperexcitable lacking normal balance glutamatergic neurons usually increase excitation gabaergic ones decrease addition levels gaba sensitivity gabaa receptors neurotransmitter may decrease resulting less another proposed mechanism epileptogenesis tbi damage white matter causes hyperexcitability effectively undercutting cerebral believed activation biochemical receptors surfaces neurons involved epileptogenesis include trkb neurotrophin receptor ionotropic glutamate receptors metabotropic glutamate receptors directly linked ion channel types receptor may activated cause increase concentration calcium ions within area cell receptors located activate enzymes src fyn may lead excessive

intracellular concentrations increase sharply cellular damage death excessive glutamatergic activity also feature neuronal circuits epilepsy developed glutamate appear play important role
