patagosaurus meaning patagonia extinct genus eusauropod dinosaur middlelate toarcian patagonia argentina first found deposits cañadón asfalto formation date around million years ago although originally twelve specimens assigned taxon least one may belong different genus patagosaurus probably lived alongside genera piatnitzkysaurus condorraptor volkheimeria since patagosaurus known many specimens including least one juvenile anatomy growth fairly well understood ages exhibit typical features sauropod long neck small head long tail quadrupedal juvenile exhibits features different adult regions like mandible pectoral girdle pelvis hindlimb although overall anatomy quite similar many known specimens help fill gaps anatomy genus forelimb skull parts skeleton like pectoral girdle tibia pubis robust others like forelimb ischium gracile material patagosaurus similar closely related taxa like cetiosaurus volkheimeria primitive genera barapasaurus amygdalodon derived sauropods like diplodocus camarasaurus many specimens previously unidentified dinosaur found associated together bed locality pebbly stratum near route cerro specimens first described josé bonaparte fossil erected genus patagosaurus well type species p generic name patagosaurus comes location find patagonia fact specific name honours ricardo farias whose land initial discovery made genus originally known almost complete postcranial skeleton lacking skull holotype many referred however found dentary referable species specimens probably skeleton found near piatnitzkysaurus volkheimeria layers originally suggested callovian oxfordianaged patagonian deposits cañadón asfalto layers recently redated finding thanks advanced zircon datation bones three genera vertebrates las charcitas member deposited million years middlelate patagosaurus almost completely known many articulated specimens found covering almost skeleton including parts twelve specimens referred although material probably unique bonaparte assigned three specimens holotype pvl pvl macn ch macn ch genus holotype includes postcranial skeleton others known cranial material nearly complete juvenile skeleton macn ch directly comparable type material patagosaurus confirms association genus specimen first referred patagosaurus mpefpv includes lower jaw also similar macn ch differences associated age therefore mpefpv presumably represents adult cranial material however teeth macn ch different lower jaws macn ch mpefpv identified another sauropod deposit patagosaurus thus taxon certainly includes pvl macn ch mpefpv patagosaurus sauropod possessed general unspecialized bauplan quadrupedal elongate neck small head long tail therefore similar cetiosaurus related genera possessed morphology estimated ft long weighed tonnes long tons short earlier estimate john mcintosh colleagues found patagosaurus approximately ft long also metric tons long tons short tons similar later estimates study donald henderson calculated weight patagosaurus long tons short tons smaller estimate skull patagosaurus well known revision oliver rauhut determining jaws certainly referrable opposed nearly entire skull mpefpv shows morphology adult subadult skull like macn ch represents juvenile individual based upon broad high short adult articulated mandibles patagosaurus snout would short high broad well typical feature teeth patagosaurus reminiscent derived sauropods similar morphology euhelopus concave one side well crowns fairly great expansions also similar camarasaurus although latter genus less concavity teeth also possess marginal denticles based histological studies individual patagosaurus would replaced tooth every days similar days camarasaurus days postcranial skeleton known patagosaurus cervical caudal dorsal vertebrae generally similar camarasaurus although sacrum possesses many distinct features sacrum well preserved showing patagosaurus possessed five sacral vertebrae vertebrae fifth fused together neural spines tall centra occasionally transversely narrow neural canal vertebrae unique among sauropods however starting end first vertebra extending almost end third enlargement canal forming welldefined cavity even though sacrum distinguishing sacral ribs resemble camarasaurus sacral vertebrae total length mm total sacral length mm pelvic girdle well preserved well studied holotype pelvic girdle almost complete lacking proximal ends ischium ilia holotype well known show many distinct features pubic peduncle ilium articulates pubis long straight expansion end many sauropods upper edge iliac blade curved thick rugosities rough spots cartilage attachment pubic elements large robust adults juveniles flat viewed front convex seen behind lapparentosaurus resembles patagosaurus comparing pubes ischia much gracile pubes small distal expansion ilia resemble barapasaurus pubes resemble lapparentosaurus ischia similar diplodocus hindlimbs patagosaurus based scant material femora tibia nondescript pedal bones two femora come adult single additional bone known juvenile adult femora proportionately different juvenile mostly straighter ovoid crosssection femoral head well preserved although lacking greater trochanter distal end rather symmetrical viewed behind two similarly sized condylar surfaces juvenile fourth trochanter completely proximal end tibia welldeveloped cnemial crest also short robust surface would articulated astragalus life anterior half raised posterior half pectoral girdle well known left right scapulae coracoids known though incomplete scapulae large robust thicken near glenoids scapular blades flat although convex along anterior edge scapulae coracoids articulate coracoids thickest become gradually thinner gain distance scapulae younger specimen patagosaurus possesses slightly different morphology pectoral girdle slightly differing proportions slightly smaller scapular blade coracoids resemble barapasaurus shape differ camarasaurus although directly compared forelimbs patagosaurus based three bones juvenile specimen manual elements preserved humeri slender elongate lacking great proximal distal expansions incomplete deltoid crest shows wide likely projection behind like humeri radius slender lacks large expansions either end edge closest ulna radius possesses ridge along edge corresponds radioulnar ligaments would attached ulna complete although sedimentfilled breaks might altered original shape forelimb patagosaurus much gracile different robust later sauropods like camarasaurus apatosaurus instead resembles originally described patagosaurus identified relative cetiosaurus family cetiosauridae distinguished cetiosaurus similar genus features ischium vertebrae another genus also identified cetiosaurid bonaparte volkheimeria named paper patagosaurus features uniting genera identified pelvic structure vertebrae specifically caudal neural spines ilium ischium characteristics show genera derived amygdalodon yet primitive later paul upchurch published paper early sauropods finding patagosaurus cetiosaurid found although earlier works distinguished two groups shunosaurines cetiosaurines family shunosaurus relatives actually closer euhelopus cetiosaurines cetiosaurus patagosaurus amygdalodon true cetiosaurids upchurch noted however work group might reveal different revision euhelopus jeffrey wilson upchurch published joint analysis primitive eusauropodan relationships found patagosaurus fact sister taxon cetiosaurus instead basal genus effectively invalidating
