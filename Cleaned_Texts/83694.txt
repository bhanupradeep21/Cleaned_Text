pain management children assessment treatment pain infants usually acute pain obvious cause expected last days weeks usually managed medication nonpharmacological treatment provide acute pain indication needed assessment treatment prevention child experiencing pain physiological consequences jeopardize healing recovery unrelieved pain cause alkalosis hypoxemia result rapid shallow breathing shallow breathing lead accumulation fluid lungs taking away ability cough pain cause increase blood pressure heart rate putting stress heart pain also increases release antiinflammatory steroids reduce ability fight infection increase metabolic rate affect healing another harmful outcome acute pain increase sympathetic effects inability urinate pain also slow gastrointestinal systemcitation needed inadequate pain management children lead psychosocial consequences including lack interest food apathy sleep problems anxiety avoidance discussions health fear hopelessness powerlessness consequences include extended hospital stays high readmission rates longer examples harmful consequences unrelieved pain neuropathic pain associated nerve injuries abnormal sensitivities touch contact though neuropathic pain relatively uncommon children compared adults greater awareness conditions causes may include past surgeries autoimmune degenerative injury spinal symptoms may include tingling shooting prickling burning sensation pain intermittent continual often exacerbates neuropathic pain peripheral central peripheral neuropathic pain refers disturbance function peripheral nerves central neuropathic pain refers nerves central nervous system though fdaapproved address pain children anticonvulsants gabapentin pregabalin used severe neuropathic impairment options serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors snris despite limited studies children limited depression snris venlafaxine shown cancer pain children may caused cancer side effects treatment tumors cause pain two different ways either physical pressure places organs occluding normal bodily functions treatment surgery injections also lead significant pain untreated pain suppress immune interfere sleep increase chance depression many different health care professionals manage childs pain referred patients palliative care team include oncologists anesthesiologists neurologists surgeons psychiatrists pharmacists hospitals may also hire individuals specialize music art therapy therapies include acupuncture biofeedback massage therapy treatment cancer pain tailored child based age treatment side effects goal achieve sufficient background control pain minimize acute exacerbation severe pain oftentimes medications nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids acetaminophen opiates used manage pain additionally nonpharmacological also used manage childs pain includes distracting child massages acupuncture heatcold therapy exercise quality chronic pain children unresolved pain affects activities daily living may result significant amount missed school days chronic pain present long periods time characterized mild severe chronic pain also described pain experienced child reports headache abdominal pain back pain generalized pain combination chronic pain develop disease injury occur simultaneously acute pain children experience chronic pain psychological effects caring child pain may cause distress caregiver may cause costs due healthcare lost wages time work may stop caregivers leaving housecitation needed assessment pain children depends cooperation developmental stage child children assist assessment matured enough cognitively emotionally following sections list signs distress possible pain children age group toddlers show signs distress possible pain schoolage children show signs distress possible pain adolescents show signs distress possible pain although pain subjective occur continuous spectrum intensities assessment tools compare pain levels time kind assessment incorporates pain scales requires high enough developmental level child respond verbal response always necessary quantify pain pain scale measures patients pain intensity features pain scales based observational behavioral physiological data well selfreport selfreport considered primary obtained possible pain measurements help determine severity type duration pain also used diagnosis determine treatment plan evaluate effectiveness treatment pain scales available neonates infants children adolescents adults seniors persons impaired communication pain assessments often regarded vital causes pain children similar causes adults pain experienced many ways depends following factors child clinicians responsible child monitor child frequently tertiary care centers hospitals pharmacological nonpharmacological treatments used manage pain parents caregivers also requested provide pain assessments beginning pharmacological treatment clinicians monitor child adverse reactions medications levels medications monitored ensure child overmedicated receive toxic levels drug levels also indicate whether would enough drug blood effective managing pain medications metabolized differently children age factors influence levels medications controlling pain include height weight body surface child well medications may paradoxical effect children effect opposite expected effect clinicians monitor reactions postprocedural treatment children primarily prescription opioids morphine effective relatively safe often used moderate severe codeine tramadol avoided especially children younger years old since metabolism varies due genetic differences case tramadol medication well studied however interventions include medications classified nonopioid analgesics useful post surgical example acetaminophen ibuprofen used nonopioid analgesics unlike acetaminophen ibuprofen antiinflammatory property useful pain inflammatory conditions aspirin used pediatric population due association reyes syndrome children process information differently adults treatment centers children often use atraumatic measures reduce anxiety stress examples include depending source pain many nonpharmacological options considered also depending age child different approaches may suitable nonpharmacological methods manage discomfort immunizations painful procedures young babies months age nonpharmacological treatments older children include nonpharmacological treatment pain associated venipuncture children includes hypnosis distraction treatments reduced selfreported pain combined cognitivebehavioural therapy cbt reduction pain even greater interventions found effective suggestion blowing air distraction parent coaching differ control pain children adolescents experience chronic pain behavioral treatment relaxation training cognitive behavioral therapy cbt acupuncture proven effective recurrent abdominal pain cochrane review found evidence cbt hypnotherapy effective reducing pain short children one year age strong evidence suggest eating sucking sweet tasting solution analgesic acute pain chronic pain neuropathic pain recurrent pain children often managed medication medications analgesics include acetaminophen nsaids local anesthetics opioids medications neuropathic pain regional anesthesia also effective recommended whenever possible important use caution administering opioids neonates young infants higher risk apnea hypoventilation population due decreased breathing effectiveness adverse effects associated use injectable nsaid ketorolac postoperatively following surgery clear due insufficient quantity quality clear clinical trials effective provide pain control around clock provide pain relief needed children recovering chronic pain treated variety medications nonpharmacological interventions world health organization recommends using two step treatment approach based level pain children first step explains mild pain treatment second step considers moderate severe pain opioids morphine example drug choice moderatesevere pain children medical side effects opioid use include cognition deficits dependence altered mood disturbances endocrine development nonpharmacological treatment children help relieve periodic pain includes counseling behavior modification therapymedical citation needed american association pediatrics states psychological interventions relaxation cognitive strategies strong evidence pain approach acute pain take account severity pain nonopioid analgesics paracetamol acetaminophen nsaids used alone treat mild moderate severe pain optimal use combination multiple agents including opioid nonopioid panel including american pain society american society regional anesthesia pain medicine recommends multimodal analgesia define combination pharmacological agents nonpharmacological techniques treat postoperative significant benefit technique nonopioid analgesics used combination opioids decrease amount opioids required reduce risk opioidrelated side medications delivered needed aroundtheclock depending patients needs children intravenous patientcontrolled analgesia ivpca used parenteral administration ivpca allows consistent opioid levels better alternative scheduled intramuscular addition studies shown children young years old use ivpca projected moderate severe pain analgesics used regular schedule first hours dental nsaids preferred analgesics treat acute mild moderate postoperative pain due inflammatory component dental alternating nsaids acetaminophen combination another addition two agents considered equivalent better opioids managing musculoskeletal pain includes dental cancer pain managed differently children typically medical history physical examinations age overall health child evaluated type cancer may influence decisions pain management extent cancer tolerance child specific medications procedures therapies also taken account well preferences parent caregivermedical citation needed medications used treat cancer pain include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids opioids frequency prescribing pain medications doubled adolescents complain headache back pain joint pain receiving prescribed adolescent young adult prescribed opioids screened risk factors opioid drug abuse prescription drug monitoring programs pdms available states states programs use opioids result number complications children including respiratory depression risk unintended overdose opioid misuse later life risks reduced use nsaids eg ibuprofen paracetamol using nsaids paracetamol opioidsparing leading less opioid use situations perioperative pain efficacy safety opioids children
