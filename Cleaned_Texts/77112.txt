speech repetition occurs individuals speak sounds heard another person pronounce say words saying one individual spoken vocalizations made another individual speech repetition requires person repeating utterance ability map sounds hear persons oral pronunciation similar places manners articulation vocal tract speech imitation often occurs independently speech comprehension speech shadowing people automatically say words heard earphones pathological condition echolalia people reflexively repeat overheard words links speech repetition words separate brain speech perception speech
