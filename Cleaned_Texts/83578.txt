baron jöns jacob berzelius swedish jœns contemporaries named jacob august august swedish chemist berzelius considered along robert boyle john dalton antoine lavoisier one founders modern berzelius became member royal swedish academy sciences served principal functionary known sweden father swedish chemistry berzelius day celebrated august honour although berzelius began career physician enduring contributions fields electrochemistry chemical bonding stoichiometry particular noted determination atomic weights experiments led complete understanding principles stoichiometry branch chemistry pertaining quantitative relationships elements chemical compounds chemical reactions occur definite proportions understanding came known law constant berzelius strict empiricist expecting new theory must consistent sum contemporary chemical knowledge developed improved methods chemical analysis required develop basic data support work stoichiometry investigated isomerism allotropy catalysis phenomena owe names berzelius among first articulate differences inorganic compounds organic among many minerals elements studied credited discovering cerium selenium first isolate silicon thorium following interest mineralogy berzelius synthesized chemically characterized new compounds elements berzelius demonstrated use electrochemical cell decompose certain chemical compounds pairs electrically opposite constituents research articulated theory came known electrochemical dualism contending chemical compounds oxide salts bonded together electrostatic interactions theory useful contexts came seen berzeliuss work atomic weights theory electrochemical dualism led development modern system chemical formula notation showed composition compound qualitatively quantitatively system abbreviated latin names elements one two letters applied superscripts designate number atoms element present compound later chemists changed use subscripts rather berzelius born parish väversunda östergötland sweden father samuel berzelius school teacher nearby city linköping mother elizabeth dorothea sjösteen parents families church pastors berzelius lost parents early age father died mother married pastor named anders eckmarck gave berzelius basic education including knowledge natural world following death mother relatives linköping took care attended school today known teenager took position tutor farm near home time became interested collecting flowers insects berzelius later enrolled medical student uppsala university anders gustaf ekeberg discoverer tantalum taught chemistry time worked apprentice pharmacy time also learned practical matters laboratory studies successfully repeated experimentation conducted swedish chemist carl william scheele led scheeles discovery also worked physician medevi mineral springs time conducted analysis water source additionally part studies berzelius learned alessandro voltas electric pile first device could provide constant electric current ie first battery constructed similar battery consisting alternating disks copper zinc initial work field thesis research medical studies examined influence galvanic current several diseases line experimentation produced clearcut evidence berzelius graduated medical doctor worked physician near stockholm chemist mineowner wilhelm hisinger recognized abilities analytical chemist provided berzelius appointed professor chemistry pharmacy karolinska berzelius worked together anna sundström acted assistant first female chemist elected member royal swedish academy sciences time academy stagnating several years since era romanticism sweden led less interest sciences berzelius elected academys secretary held post berzelius tenure credited revitalising academy bringing second golden era first astronomer pehr wilhelm wargentins period secretary elected foreign honorary member american academy arts sciences became correspondent royal institute netherlands associate elected member swedish academy chair number berzelius active temperance movement along bengt francsparre sv august von hartmansdorff sv anders retzius samuel owen george scott others one founders svenska nykterhetssällskapet swedish temperance society first berzelius wrote foreword one carl af ekenstams sv works topic copies much life berzelius suffered various medical ailments included recurrent migraine headaches later suffered gout also episodes berzelius nervous breakdown said due stress medical advice received travel take vacation however time berzelius traveled france work chemical laboratories claude louis age married elizabeth poppius daughter swedish cabinet died august home stockholm lived since buried solna soon arriving stockholm berzelius wrote chemistry textbook medical students lärbok kemien first significant scientific publication conducted experimentation preparation writing textbook compositions inorganic compounds earliest work definite published essay proportions elements compounds essay commenced general description introduced new symbolism examined known elements included table specific weights finished selection compounds written new compiled table relative atomic weights oxygen set included elements known work provided evidence favour atomic theory proposed john dalton inorganic chemical compounds composed atoms different elements combined whole number amounts discovering atomic weights integer multiples weight hydrogen berzelius also disproved prouts hypothesis elements built atoms berzeliuss last revised version atomic weight tables first published german translation textbook chemistry order aid experiments developed system chemical notation elements composing particular chemical compound given simple written oxygen fe proportions chemical compound denoted numbers berzelius thus invented system chemical notation still used today main difference instead subscript numbers used today eg berzelius used superscripts berzelius credited discovering chemical elements cerium selenium first isolate silicon thorium titanium zirconium berzelius discovered cerium selenium berzelius also discovered isolate silicon thorium students working berzeliuss laboratory also discovered lithium lanthanum berzelius discovered amorphous silicon repeating experiment performed gaylussac thénard reacted silicon tetrafluoride potassium metal produced impure silicon variation experiment berzelius heated potassium fluorosilicate potassium produced potassium silicide stirred water produce relatively pure silicon powder berzelius recognized powder new element silicon called name proposed earlier berzelius first isolate zirconium pure zirconium produced anton eduard van arkel jan hendrik de berzelius credited originating chemical terms polymer isomer protein allotrope although original definitions cases differ significantly modern example coined term polymer describe organic compounds shared identical empirical formulas differed overall molecular weight larger compounds described polymers time concept chemical structure yet developed considered numbers atoms element way viewed example glucose polymer formaldehyde even though know glucose polymer monomer berzelius first person make distinction organic compounds containing carbon inorganic compounds particular advised gerardus johannes mulder elemental analyses organic compounds coffee tea various proteins term protein coined berzelius mulder observed proteins seemed empirical formula came erroneous conclusion might composed single type large molecule term derived greek meaning first rank berzelius proposed name proteins fundamental living berzelius discovered lactic acid occurs muscle tissue milk term biliverdin coined berzelius although preferred bilifulvin yellowred bilirubin berzelius stated living things work mysterious vital hypothesis called vitalism vitalism first proposed prior researchers although berzelius contended compounds could distinguished whether required organisms synthesis organic compounds whether inorganic compounds however friedrich wöhler accidentally obtained urea organic compound heating ammonium cyanate showed organic compound urea could prepared synthetically exclusively living organisms berzelius corresponded wöhler urea synthesis findings however notion vitalism continued persist work abiotic synthesis organic compounds provided substantial evidence berzelius prolific correspondent leading scientists time gerardus johannes mulder claude louis berthollet humphry davy friedrich wöhler eilhard mitscherlich christian friedrich schönbein berzelius traveled london england including greenwich meet prominent british scientists time included humphry davy chemist william wollaston physicianscientist thomas young astronomer william herschel chemist smithson tennant inventor james watt among others berzelius also visited davys laboratory visit davys laboratory berzelius remarked tidy laboratory sign lazy humphry davy proposed chlorine element berzelius rejected claim belief acids based oxygen since chlorine forms strong acid muriatic acid modern hcl chlorine must contain oxygen thus element however bernard courtois proved iodine element josephlouis gaylussac demonstrated prussic acid hydrogen cyanide contains hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen findings persuaded berzelius acids contain oxygen davy gaylussac correct chlorine iodine indeed elements berzelius ennobled king carl xiv johan received title elected member american philosophical royal society london gave berzelius copley medal citation systematic application doctrine definite proportions analysis mineral bodies contained nouveau systeme de mineralogie workscitation needed berzelius named knight order received honor pour le mérite sciences mineral berzelianite copper selenide discovered named james dwight stockholm sweden built public park statue honor berzelius berzeliusskolan school situated next alma mater katedralskolan named fairly prominent street gothenburg named berzeliigatan berzelii street honour swedish academy sciences opened berzelius museum honor berzelius holdings museum included many items laboratory museum opened occasion fiftieth anniversary berzeliuss death invitees ceremony marking occasion included scientific dignitaries eleven european nations united states many gave formal addresses honor berzelius museum later moved observatory part swedish academy portrait appeared series postage stamps commemorating bicentenary founding swedish academy addition sweden grenada likewise honored berzelius secret society yale university named honor
