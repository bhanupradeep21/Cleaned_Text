asherman also known fritsch syndrome fritschasherman syndrome often characterized decrease flow duration bleeding absence menstrual bleeding little menstrual bleeding infrequent menstrual infertility menstrual anomalies often always correlated severity adhesions restricted cervix lower uterus may block menstruation pain menstruation ovulation sometimes experienced attributed blockages reported cases occur dc performed recently pregnant uterus following missed incomplete miscarriage birth elective termination abortion remove retained products cavity uterus lined endometrium lining composed two layers functional layer adjacent uterine cavity shed menstruation underlying basal layer adjacent myometrium necessary regenerating functional layer trauma basal layer typically dilation curettage dc performed miscarriage delivery abortion lead development intrauterine scars resulting adhesions obliterate cavity varying degrees extreme whole cavity scarred occluded even relatively scars endometrium may fail respond estrogencitation needed ashermans syndrome affects women races ages equally suggesting underlying genetic predisposition result pelvic surgeries including cesarean removal fibroid tumours causes iuds pelvic irradiation genital chronic endometritis genital tuberculosis significant cause severe intrauterine adhesions iua developing world often resulting total obliteration uterine cavity difficult artificial form surgically induced endometrial ablation women excessive uterine bleeding lieu hysterectomycitation needed history pregnancy event followed dc leading secondary amenorrhea hypomenorrhea typical hysteroscopy gold standard imaging sonohysterography hysterosalpingography reveal extent scar formation ultrasound reliable method diagnosing ashermans syndrome hormone studies show normal levels consistent reproductive functioncitation needed various classification systems developed describe ashermans syndrome citations added taking account amount functioning residual endometrium menstrual pattern obstetric history factors thought play role determining prognoses advent techniques allow visualization uterus classification systems developed take account location severity adhesions inside uterus useful mild cases adhesions restricted cervix may present amenorrhea infertility showing symptoms alone necessarily reflect severity patients may

outcome miscarriage similar pregnancy outcomes reported subsequent surgical management eg dc medical management conservative management watchful association surgical intervention uterus development intrauterine adhesions intrauterine adhesions pregnancy outcomes still clear evidence method prevention adverse pregnancy theory recently pregnant uterus particularly soft influence hormones hence easily injured dc including dilation curettage dilation evacuationsuction curettage manual vacuum aspiration blind invasive procedure making difficult avoid endometrial trauma medical alternatives dc evacuation retained placentaproducts conception exist including misoprostol mifepristone studies show less invasive cheaper method efficacious safe acceptable alternative surgical management suggested early incidence iua might lower following medical evacuation eg misoprostol uterus thus avoiding intrauterine instrumentation far one study supports proposal showing women treated missed miscarriage misoprostol develop iua undergoing dc advantage misoprostol used evacuation following miscarriage also following birth retained placenta hemorrhagingcitation needed alternatively dc could performed ultrasound guidance rather blind procedure would enable surgeon end scraping lining retained tissue removed avoiding injurycitation needed early monitoring pregnancy identify miscarriage prevent development case may recurrence longer period fetal death following dc likely adhesions may therefore immediate evacuation following fetal death may prevent iuathe use hysteroscopic surgery instead dc remove retained products conception placenta another alternative could theoretically improve future pregnancy outcomes although could less effective tissue abundant also hysteroscopy widely routinely used technique requires expertisecitation needed data indicate suction dc less likely sharp curette result ashermans recent article describes three cases women developed intrauterine adhesions following manual vacuum intrauterine adhesions also form hysteroscopic surgery myomectomy polypectomy septum mechanical barriers womed hyaluronic acid gels used prevent formation iua adhesiogenic procedures fertility may sometimes restored removal adhesions depending severity initial trauma individual patient factors operative hysteroscopy used visual inspection uterine cavity adhesion dissection adhesiolysis however hysteroscopy yet become routine gynaecological procedure us gynecologists perform office adhesion dissection technically difficult must performed care order create new scars exacerbate condition severe cases adjunctive measures laparoscopy used conjunction hysteroscopy protective measure uterine perforation microscissors usually used cut adhesions electrocauterization iua frequently reform surgery techniques developed prevent recurrence adhesions methods prevent adhesion reformation include use mechanical barriers foley catheter salinefilled balloon uterine gel barriers seprafilm spraygel autocrosslinked hyaluronic acid gel hyalobarrier mechanical barrier film womed maintain opposing walls apart thereby preventing reformation adhesions antibiotic prophylaxis necessary presence mechanical barriers reduce risk possible infections common pharmacological method preventing reformation adhesions sequential hormonal therapy estrogen followed progestin stimulate endometrial growth prevent opposing walls fusing however randomized controlled trials rcts comparing postsurgical adhesion reformation without hormonal treatment ideal dosing regimen length estrogen therapy known recent meta analysis compared different post surgical prevention barrier strategies concluded single clearly superior furthermore diagnostic severity outcomes assessed according different criteria eg menstrual pattern adhesion reformation rate conception rate live birth rate clearly comparable studies needed reproductive outcome analysed systematicallycitation needed followup tests hsg hysteroscopy shg necessary ensure adhesions reformed surgery may necessary restore normal uterine cavity according recent study among patients overall rate adhesion recurrence severe cases another study found postoperative adhesions reoccur close severe moderate mild iua unlike moderate severe synechiae appear reformcitation needed extent adhesion
