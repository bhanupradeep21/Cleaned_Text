show five gilmore also claimed alcovasaurus distinctive rear spike pair equaling front pair size galton carpenter found trait difficult confirm extant photographic evidence would make alcovasaurus differ known stegosaurians four spikes always show shorter rear pair also two pairs would positioned exceptionally far apart galton carpenter saw spikes primarily weapons interpreted side processes caudal vertebrae continuing tail end support increased muscle mass swing tail might also connected shortening caudal vertebrae resulting tail quarter shorter stegosaurus shorter tail could counteract torsion caused greater moment arm long however reinterpretation longispinus member clade dacentrurinae also prompted reinterpretation tail anatomy rather strongly muscled tail tip longispinus likely small tail vertebrae past first third tail like dacentrurines tail tip probably lacked strong muscles indeed much soft tissue creating flexible whiplike tail could propelled heavily muscled tail galton carpenter considered alcovasaurus member stegosauridae closely related kentrosaurus however phylogeny stegosaurids thomas raven susannah maidment found alcovasaurus lacked fusion trochanters femur seen adult eurypodans stegosaurians ankylosaurians means confidently placed stegosaur however may due fact specimen immature impossible verify since holotype costa mateus reinterpreted longispinus context newly recognized specimens miragaia found portugal remains allowed recognize longispinus close relative miragaia within stegosaurid clade dacentrurinae alcovasaurus shared traits either dacentrurus miragaia costa mateus concluded would definition belong one chose miragaia similar remained separate species though coined newly combined name miragaia
