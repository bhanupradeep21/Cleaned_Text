auditosensory cortex part auditory system associated sense hearing humans occupies bilateral primary auditory cortex temporal lobe mammalian term used describe brodmann area together transverse temporal gyri auditosensory cortex takes part reception processing auditory nerve impulses passes sound information thalamus brain abnormalities region responsible many disorders auditory abilities congenital deafness true cortical deafness primary progressive aphasia auditory hallucination auditosensory cortex defines brodmann area part primary auditory cortex also known posterior transverse temporal located superiorly within temporal lobe cerebral cortex cortical area studied variety mammals including humans functional region found serve essential roles hearing previous studies richard ladislaus heschl first revealed anatomical features cortical region heschl found cortical structure appeared differently temporal lobe distinct structure occupied brodmann area later named transverse temporal gyri discovery provided insight anatomical network within primary cortex first site process incoming sound information due close correspondence brodmann area also referred heschls mapped german neurologist korbinian brodmann auditosensory cortex one cortical regions identified cerebral cortex according histological characteristics density shape distribution cell body size subdivided cortical regions later known brodmann areas brodmann pioneer cerebral cortex mapping grouped several cortical regions based nervous function two areas auditory processing suggested brodmann area homotypical acoustic association primary auditory cortex lies medially superior temporal gyrus human responsible receiving signals medial geniculate nucleus within primary auditory cortex

brodmann area contrast temporal lobe gyri transverse temporal gyrus distinct feature stretching mediolaterally towards brain main apparent function auditosensory cortex hearing hearing sense sound reception perception sound reception receiving sound stimuli sound wave transmitted auditory external environment sensory signal converted electrical signal process called sensory electrical impulse carried inner ear brainstem via vestibulocochlear nerve cranial nerve furthermore auditory impulse recognised organised interpreted sensory information different properties sound waves necessary help comprehension language sound language competence directly correlates ability auditosensory cortex terms strength frequency neuronal activity primary auditory cortex includes auditosensory cortex brodmann area auditopsychic cortex brodmann area primary function auditosensory cortex sense hearing initial cortical destination auditory nerve impulses thalamus characteristics neural activities cortex correspond physical properties sound waves perception auditory signals came nervous impulse inner ear cochlear nuclei first relay station ascending pathway various acoustic reflexes sound localisation regulated via relay stations impulse reaches auditory cortical projections superior temporal gyrus auditosensory cortex first site unprocessed recognition sound impulse propagates across auditosensory area auditopsychic area eventually entire temporal lobe therefore allows formation memory comprehension sound take place posterior auditopsychic region site especially understanding speech called wernickes area brodmann area auditosensory cortex solely insufficient complete production reception language subcortical structures thalamus necessary controlling emotional cognitive integration cerebellum coordinating movements auditosensory cortex analyse acrostic characteristics namely pitch loudness higher frequency gives higher pitch whereas lower frequency gives lower pitch larger amplitude gives higher volume contrary smaller amplitude gives lower volume amplitude determination intensity timbre characteristic tone distinguish sound pitch volume factors affecting timbre harmonics vibration envelope wave transverse temporal gyrus contains auditosensory cortex processes sound impulse low lateral aspect maps sound impulse tonotopic organisation produces mirror image spatial gradients frequency depends duration intensity sound stimuli early processing speech recognition requires ability transverse temporal gyrus discriminate frequency hence region distinguish phonetic characteristics sound responsiveness prosody corresponds sensitivity slight variation frequency duration time language competence acquired ability auditosensory cortex interpret sound information processing pathway transverse temporal gyrus necessary recognise comprehend speech called twostreams ventral pathway responsible processing linguistic semantic information allows understanding meaning dorsal stream responsible processing phonological information forms structure language neuroplasticity includes auditory perception shaped stimuli environment memory attentional

impaired ability distinguish different vowels consonant sounds impaired capability comprehend auditory subjective experience unable process acoustic impulse may learn identify meaning nonverbal sounds correctly primary progressive aphasia characterised progressive impairment speech production comprehension communication secondary neurodegenerative diseases instance alzheimers disease frontotemporal lobar heschl gyrus undergoes deterioration shown low activity primary auditory cortex symptoms difficulty delay communication speech organisation patients may become reluctant communicate even unable understand verbal written language eventually causing primary progressive aphasia difficulty auditory processing complication mild traumatic brain injury mtbi mtbi patients reduced activation primary
