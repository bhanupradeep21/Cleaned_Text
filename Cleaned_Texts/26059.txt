coronary circulation circulation blood arteries veins supply heart muscle myocardium coronary arteries supply oxygenated blood heart muscle cardiac veins drain away blood deoxygenated rest body especially brain needs steady supply oxygenated blood free slightest interruptions heart required function continuously therefore circulation major importance tissues entire body even level consciousness brain moment moment interruptions coronary circulation quickly cause heart attacks myocardial infarctions heart muscle damaged oxygen starvation interruptions usually caused coronary ischemia linked coronary artery disease sometimes embolism causes like obstruction blood flow vessels coronary arteries supply blood myocardium components heart two coronary arteries originate left side heart beginning root left ventricle three aortic sinuses dilations wall aorta superior aortic semilunar valve two left posterior aortic sinus anterior aortic sinus give rise left right coronary arteries respectively third sinus right posterior aortic sinus typically give rise vessel coronary vessel branches remain surface heart follow sulci heart called epicardial coronary left coronary artery distributes blood left side heart left atrium ventricle interventricular septum circumflex artery arises left coronary artery follows coronary sulcus left eventually fuse small branches right coronary artery larger left anterior descending artery lad second major branch arising left coronary artery follows anterior interventricular sulcus around pulmonary trunk along way gives rise numerous smaller branches interconnect branches posterior interventricular artery forming anastomoses anastomosis area vessels unite form interconnections normally allow blood circulate region even may partial blockage another branch anastomoses heart small therefore ability somewhat restricted heart coronary artery blockage often results myocardial infarction causing death cells supplied particular right coronary artery proceeds along coronary sulcus distributes blood right atrium portions ventricles heart conduction system normally one marginal arteries arise right coronary artery inferior right atrium marginal arteries supply blood superficial portions right ventricle posterior surface heart right coronary artery gives rise posterior interventricular artery also known posterior descending artery runs along posterior portion interventricular sulcus toward apex heart giving rise branches supply interventricular septum portions vessels remove deoxygenated blood heart muscle cardiac veins include great cardiac vein middle cardiac vein small cardiac vein smallest cardiac veins anterior cardiac veins cardiac veins carry blood poor level oxygen myocardium right atrium blood coronary veins returns coronary sinus anatomy veins heart variable generally formed following veins heart veins go coronary sinus great cardiac vein middle cardiac vein small cardiac vein posterior vein left ventricle oblique vein marshall heart veins go directly right atrium anterior cardiac veins smallest cardiac veins thebesian anastomoses branches two coronary arteries however coronary arteries functionally end arteries meetings referred potential anastomoses lack function opposed true anastomoses like palm hand blockage one coronary artery generally results death heart tissue due lack sufficient blood supply branch two arteries branches join area myocardium receives dual blood supply junctions called anastomoses one coronary artery obstructed atheroma second artery still able supply oxygenated blood myocardium however occur atheroma progresses slowly giving anastomoses chance proliferatecitation needed common configuration coronary arteries three areas anastomoses small branches lad left anterior descendinganterior interventricular branch left coronary join branches posterior interventricular branch right coronary interventricular sulcus groove superiorly anastomosis circumflex artery branch left coronary artery right coronary artery atrioventricular groove also anastomosis septal branches two coronary arteries interventricular septum photograph shows area heart supplied right left coronary arteriescitation needed left right coronary arteries occasionally arise common trunk number may increased three additional branch posterior coronary artery smaller size rare cases person third coronary artery run around root aortacitation needed occasionally coronary artery exist double structure ie two arteries parallel ordinarily would onecitation needed artery supplies posterior third interventricular septum posterior descending artery determines coronary approximately general population rightdominant codominant precise anatomic definition dominance would artery gives supply av node ie av nodal artery time right coronary arterycitation needed papillary muscles attach mitral valve valve left atrium left ventricle tricuspid valve valve right atrium right ventricle wall heart papillary muscles functioning properly mitral valve may leak contraction left ventricle causes blood travel reverse left ventricle left atrium instead forward aorta rest body leaking blood left atrium known mitral regurgitation similarly leaking blood right ventricle tricuspid valve right atrium also occur described tricuspid insufficiency tricuspid regurgitationcitation needed anterolateral papillary muscle frequently receives two blood supplies left anterior descending lad artery left circumflex artery therefore frequently resistant coronary ischemia insufficiency oxygenrich blood hand posteromedial papillary muscle usually supplied makes posteromedial papillary muscle significantly susceptible ischemia clinical significance myocardial infarction involving pda likely cause mitral regurgitationcitation needed contraction ventricular myocardium systole subendocardial coronary vessels vessels enter myocardium compressed due high ventricular pressures compression results momentary retrograde blood flow ie blood flows backward toward aorta inhibits perfusion myocardium systole however epicardial coronary vessels vessels run along outer surface heart remain open blood flow subendocardium stops ventricular contraction result myocardial perfusion occurs heart relaxation diastole subendocardial coronary vessels open lower pressure flow never comes zero right coronary artery since right ventricular pressure less diastolic blood heart regulates amount vasodilation vasoconstriction coronary arteries based upon oxygen requirements heart contributes filling difficulties coronary arteries compression remains failure oxygen delivery caused decrease blood flow front increased oxygen demand heart results tissue ischemia condition oxygen deficiency brief ischemia associated intense chest pain known angina severe ischemia cause heart muscle die hypoxia myocardial infarction chronic moderate ischemia causes contraction heart weaken known myocardial hibernationcitation needed addition metabolism coronary circulation possesses unique pharmacologic characteristics prominent among reactivity adrenergic stimulationcitation needed following named branches coronary circulation rightdominant heartcitation needed vessels deliver oxygenrich blood myocardium coronary arteries arteries healthy capable autoregulating maintain coronary blood flow levels appropriate needs heart muscle relatively narrow coronary arteries commonly affected atherosclerosis become blocked causing angina heart attack
