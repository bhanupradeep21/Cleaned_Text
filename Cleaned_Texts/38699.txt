flail chest lifethreatening medical condition occurs segment rib cage breaks due trauma becomes detached rest chest wall two symptoms flail chest chest pain shortness occurs multiple adjacent ribs broken multiple places separating segment part chest wall moves independently number ribs must broken varies differing definitions sources say least two adjacent ribs broken least two require three ribs two flail segment moves opposite direction rest chest wall ambient pressure comparison pressure inside lungs goes rest chest moving vice versa socalled paradoxical painful increases work involved breathing flail chest usually accompanied pulmonary contusion bruise lung tissue interfere blood often contusion flail segment main cause respiratory problems people surgery fix fractures appears result better two symptoms flail chest chest pain shortness characteristic paradoxical motion flail segment occurs due pressure changes associated respiration rib cage normally resists paradoxical motion late sign flail segment therefore absence paradoxical motion mean patient flail segment constant motion ribs flail segment site fracture extremely painful untreated sharp broken edges ribs likely eventually puncture pleural sac lung possibly causing pneumothorax concern mediastinal flutter shift mediastinum paradoxical diaphragm movement appear pulmonary contusions commonly associated flail chest lead respiratory failure due paradoxical motions chest wall fragments interrupting normal breathing chest movement typical paradoxical motion associated stiff lungs requires extra work normal breathing increased lung resistance makes air flow respiratory failure flail chest requires mechanical ventilation longer stay intensive care damage lungs flail segment lifethreatening common causes flail chest injuries vehicle collisions account flail chest another main cause flail chest injuries falling mainly occurs elderly impacted falls result weak frail bones unlike younger counterparts fall without impacted severely falls account flail chest flail chest typically occurs three adjacent ribs fractured two places allowing segment thoracic wall displace move independently rest chest wall flail chest also occur ribs fractured proximally conjunction disarticulation costal cartilages distally condition occur generally must significant force applied large surface thorax create multiple anterior posterior rib fractures rollover crushing injuries commonly break ribs one point whereas flail chest occur significant impact required breaking ribs two caused forceful accidents aforementioned vehicle collisions significant falls elderly caused deterioration bone although rare children majority flail chest injuries result common blunt force traumas metabolic bone diseases including group genetic disorders known osteogenesis diagnosis physical examination performed physician diagnosis may assisted confirmed use medical imaging either plain x ray ct scan treatment flail chest initially follows principles advanced trauma life support treatment includes person may intubated double lumen tracheal tube double lumen endotracheal tube lumen may connected different ventilator usually one side chest affected lung may require drastically different pressures flows adequately ventilate surgical fixation help significantly reducing duration ventilatory support conserving pulmonary surgical intervention also shown reduce need tracheostomy reduces time spent intensive care unit following traumatic flail chest injury could reduce risk acquiring pneumonia order begin rehabilitation program flail chest important treat persons pain able perform proper exercises due underlying conditions flail segment caused onto respiratory system chest physiotherapy important reduce complications proper positioning body key including postural alignment proper drainage mucous therapy consist variety postural positioning changes order increase normal breathing along postural repositioning variety breathing exercises also important order allow chest wall reposition back normal conditions breathing exercises also include coughing furthermore range motion exercises given reduce atrophy progression resistance exercises added regimen shoulder arm side containing injury moreover trunk exercises introduced sitting progress hip flexion exercises done expand thorax done lying supine flat surface flexing knees hips bringing toward chest knees come toward chest person inhales exhale knees exercise done sets repetitions pause sets person always make

condition ranging systematic review comparing safety effectiveness surgical fixation versus nonsurgical methods treatment flail chest reported statistically significant difference reported deaths
