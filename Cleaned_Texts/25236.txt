carpal bones eight small bones make wrist carpus connects hand forearm term carpus carpal derived latin carpus greek καρπός karpós meaning wrist human anatomy main role carpal bones articulate radial ulnar heads form highly mobile condyloid joint ie wrist provide attachments thenar hypothenar muscles form part rigid carpal tunnel allows median nerve tendons anterior forearm muscles transmitted hand fingers tetrapods carpus sole cluster bones wrist radius ulna metacarpus bones carpus belong individual fingers toes quadrupeds whereas metacarpus corresponding part foot tarsus carpal bones allow wrist move rotate eight carpal bones may conceptually organized either two transverse rows three longitudinal columns considered paired rows row forms arch convex proximally concave distally palmar side carpus concave forms carpal tunnel covered flexor proximal row comprising scaphoid lunate triquetrum psiform articulates surfaces radius distal carpal row thus constantly adapts mobile surfaces within proximal row carpal bone slight independent mobility example scaphoid contributes midcarpal stability articulating distally trapezium trapezoid contrast distal row rigid transverse arch moves biomechanically clinically carpal bones better conceptualized three longitudinal context pisiform regarded sesamoid bone embedded tendon flexor carpi ulnar column leaves gap ulna triquetrum therefore radial scaphoid central capitate columns articulate radius wrist stable flexion extension strength various capsules ligaments interlocking parts almost carpals except pisiform six surfaces palmar anterior dorsal posterior surfaces rough ligamentous attachment dorsal surfaces broader except lunate superior proximal inferior distal surfaces articular superior generally convex inferior concave medial lateral surfaces also articular contact contiguous bones otherwise rough tuberculated structure similar cancellous tissue enclosed layer compact bone occasionally accessory bones found carpus described bones four central styloid secondary trapezoid secondary pisiform bones considered proven accessory bones sometimes scaphoid triquetrum pisiform bones divided two carpal bones ossified endochondrally within cartilage ossific centers appear birth formation centers roughly follows chronological spiral pattern starting capitate hamate first year life ulnar bones ossified radial bones sesamoid pisiform arises tendon flexor carpi ulnaris ten years commencement ossification bone occurs period like bones useful forensic age four groups ligaments region hand said straight position third finger runs capitate bone straight line forearm confused midposition hand corresponds ulnar deviation degrees straight position two pairs movements hand possible abduction movement towards radius called radial deviation abduction degrees adduction movement towards ulna called ulnar deviation adduction degrees arm strict supination slightly greater strict pronation flexion tilting towards palm called palmar flexion extension tilting towards back hand called dorsiflexion possible total range degrees radial abduction scaphoid tilted towards palmar side allows trapezium trapezoid approach radius trapezoid rigidly attached second metacarpal bone also flexor carpi radialis extensor carpi radialis attached radial abduction effectively pulls combined structure towards radius radial abduction pisiform traverses greatest path carpal bones radial abduction produced order importance extensor carpi radialis longus abductor pollicis longus extensor pollicis longus flexor carpi radialis flexor pollicis longus ulnar adduction causes tilting dorsal shifting proximal row carpal produced extensor carpi ulnaris flexor carpi ulnaris extensor digitorum extensor digiti radial abduction ulnar adduction occurs around dorsopalmar axis running head capitate bone palmar flexion proximal carpal bones displaced towards dorsal side towards palmar side dorsiflexion flexion extension consist movements around pair transverse axes passing lunate bone proximal row capitate bone distal row palmar flexion occurs mainly radiocarpal joint dorsiflexion midcarpal joint dorsiflexion produced order importance extensor digitorum extensor carpi radialis longus extensor carpi radialis brevis extensor indicis extensor pollicis longus extensor digiti minimi palmar flexion

shoulder joints intermediate combined movements wrist approximate ballandsocket joint necessary restrictions maximum palmar flexion blocking anteroposterior gliding movements adjacent carpal bones along midcarpal joint achieved stabilizing individual bones moving another ie gripping bone thumb index finger structure carpus varies widely different groups tetrapods even among retain full set five digits primitive fossil amphibians eryops carpus consists three rows bones proximal row three carpals second row four bones distal row five bones proximal carpals referred radiale intermedium ulnare proximal articulations homologous scaphoid lunate triquetral bones respectively remaining bones simply numbered first fourth centralia singular centrale first fifth distal carpals primitively distal bones appears articulated single metacarpal however vast majority later vertebrates including modern amphibians undergone varying degrees loss fusion primitive bones resulting smaller number carpals almost mammals reptiles example lost fifth distal carpal single centrale even missing humans pisiform bone somewhat unusual first appears primitive reptiles never found amphibians many tetrapods fewer five digits forelimb even greater degrees fusion common huge array different possible combinations found wing modern bird example two remaining carpals radiale scaphoid mammals bone formed fusion four
