avocados bananas potatoes among anaphylaxis medical emergency may require resuscitation measures airway management supplemental oxygen large volumes intravenous fluids close passive leg raise may also helpful emergency administration intravenous fluid bolus epinephrine treatment choice antihistamines used period inhospital observation hours recommended people returned normal due concerns biphasic epinephrine adrenaline primary treatment anaphylaxis absolute contraindication recommended epinephrine solution given intramuscularly mid anterolateral thigh soon diagnosis suspected injection may repeated every minutes insufficient second dose needed episodes two doses rarely intramuscular route preferred subcutaneous administration latter may delayed recommended diagnosis treatment anaphylaxis patient kept observation appropriate clinical setting symptoms fully minor adverse effects epinephrine include tremors anxiety headaches people βblockers may resistant effects situation epinephrine effective intravenous glucagon administered mechanism action independent necessary also given intravenously using dilute epinephrine solution intravenous epinephrine however associated

usually death occurs due either respiratory failure typically involving asphyxia cardiovascular complications cardiovascular cases causing cases death occurring within outcomes exerciseinduced anaphylaxis typically good fewer less severe episodes people get number people get anaphylaxis per persons per lifetime risk people get one exerciseinduced anaphylaxis affects young rates appear increasing numbers approximately per per year per per increase appears primarily foodinduced risk greatest young people anaphylaxis leads many deaths per year per million united states deaths per year united kingdom per million deaths per year australia per another estimate united states puts death rate per mortality rates decreased australia death foodinduced anaphylaxis occur primarily women deaths due insect bites primarily occur death anaphylaxis commonly triggered conditions anaphylaxis known since ancient french physician françois magendie described rabbits killed repeated injections egg albumin however phenomenon discovered two french physiologists charles richet paul albert prince monaco requested richet portier join scientific expedition around french coast atlantic specifically study toxin produced cnidarians like jellyfish sea richet portier boarded alberts ship princesse alice ii ocean exploration make collections marine richet portier extracted toxin called hypnotoxin collection jellyfish real source later identified portuguese man sea anemone actinia first experiment ship injected dog toxin attempt immunise dog instead developed severe reaction hypersensitivity repeated injections laboratory found dogs normally tolerated toxin first injection reexposure three weeks later dose always developed fatal shock also found effect related doses toxin used even small amounts secondary injections thus instead inducing tolerance prophylaxis expected discovered effects toxin richet introduced term aphylaxis describe condition lack protection later changed term anaphylaxis grounds term greek ἀνά ana meaning φύλαξις phylaxis meaning february richet portier jointly presented findings societé de biologie moment regarded birth allergy term invented clemens von pirquet study richet continued study phenomenon eventually awarded nobel prize physiology medicine work anaphylaxis ongoing efforts develop sublingual epinephrine treat anaphylaxis trials
