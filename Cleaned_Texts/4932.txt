honest signal aposematic warning signal generally visual given poisonous dangerous animals wasps poison dart frogs pufferfish warning signals honest indications noxious prey conspicuousness evolves

distinguish real fake signal sets evolutionary arms race making fake signals evolutionarily unstable honest signal hand faked sender feathers look resplendent unless bird healthy faked without cost
