alternative mating strategy strategy used male female animals often distinct phenotypes differs prevailing mating strategy sex strategies diverse variable across within species animal sexual behaviour mate choice directly affect social structure relationships many different mating systems whether monogamous polygamous polyandrous polygynous though males females given population typically employ predominant reproductive strategy based overarching mating system individuals sex often use different mating strategies among reptiles frogs fish large males defend females small males may use sneaking tactics mate without alternative mating strategies observed among male female typically alternative strategies adopted face competition within sex especially species mate multiply scenarios

frequency males adopting alternative mating techniques female small selection males mate males lower quality likely chosen females fewer options means males would normally adopt alternative mating

equivalent strategies within within evolutionarily stable strategy several scenarios possible including pure mixed strategies pure strategy one affected chance individual expresses one strategic contrast mixed strategy describes scenario involving probabilistic expression behaviours among individuals example individual mixed strategy could express one mating tactic sneaking certain frequency another tactic mate guarding though mixed strategy theoretically possible documented context alternative mating behaviours instead conditional strategy involving alternative behaviours may best characterize alternative mating conditiondependent behaviour context mating may result changes resource availability intrasexual competition mates competition decreases expression alternative

mating strategies order maximize reproductive fitness especially common malemale competition access mates cases alternative strategies successful obtaining mates predominant strategy coexistence different mating strategies evolve common examples male alternative mating strategies sneaking strategy allows male access female partner avoiding dominant males example guarding harem red deer elephant behaviour occurs many different animal groups including birds example reptiles example marine fish example cichlid herichthys invertebrates example phanaeus horned beetles onthophagus acuminatus demonstrate alternative mating strategies due different nutritious conditions development affect adult body size species males receive high levels nutrition development surpass size threshold develop large horns males pass threshold develop either small nonexistent horns varying phenotypes lead individual males adopt different mating strategies develop long horns practice mate guarding protecting entrance tunnel female resting feeding males fight male attempts enter common strategy observed populations females dispersed synchronized periods fertility well females found clusters guarded maintain access one female smaller males little horns little chance beating larger males altercations thus adopt alternative sneaking strategy digging new tunnel allow intercept females tunnel without noticed guarding male strategies proven thus far reproductively effective males practicing adoption alternative mating strategies contributed maintenance dimorphic male pygmy swordtail xiphophorus multilineatus males offer another example alternative mating strategies males mature later larger size always use courtship behaviour males mature early smaller size sometimes using courtship behaviour alone female often using sneaky behaviour behaviour preferred female therefore successful courtship gaining matings however higher probability surviving reach sexual maturity due maturing early enough maintain smaller sneakier males male red paper wasps polistes canadensis engage role patroller alternative mating tactic role territorial male chases away intruders patrollers smaller body size territorial males significant competition possession territories although territories necessarily hold resources nesting sites owning territory tends lead greater number mating opportunities males attract females territories rubbing abdomens across territories apply pheromones inability successfully compete larger territorial males territories smaller males resort

granted one continues beneficial historically male alternative strategies well documented alternative female strategies studied extensively large discrepancy information mostly due two factors first male mating behaviour typically driven competition mates physical competition territoriality parental care investment thus male alternative behaviours arise direct result various forms competition however females typically compete directly resources mates instead females indirectly compete differences premating mating postmating subtle nature female competition makes alternative behaviours difficult study relative males second males likely experience sexual selection females due increased selection statistically likely alternative strategies evolve males however though subtle slightly less commonly females experience limitations access males male parental care thus alternative female strategies evolved circumvent limitations examples alternative female strategies seen nature guppy poecilia reticulata females copy another females mate choice given opportunity watch female choose older females copy younger females younger females copy older copying behaviour arises difference ability assess males since behaviour arises presence another female behavioural alternative norm choosing male mate based personal assessment damselfish chromis multilineata females often become infected parasite anilocra chromis event infection males allow infected females nest mate thus bypass limitation mating infected females often sneak male although female often immediately chased behaviour serves evidence sneaking alternative male strategy fact sneaking common strategy sex denied mating certain class animals strategy infected females therefore another behavioural alternative strategy damselflies ischnura females frequently harassed males wish mate significant variation females physical abilities tolerate male mating harassment species physical dimorphism one type cryptic heteromorphic type looks like male andromorph many cases andromorph even behaves like male among males studies found andromorph mates half often decrease mating would devastating males often advantage females females excessive mating waste time energy increases exposure predators thus ability ward extra mating gives andromorphs frequency dependent selective advantage example traditionally male
