characteristics przewalskis horse differ seen modern domestic horses indicating neither ancestor supporting status przewalski horses remnant wild population derived modern domestic evolutionary divergence two populations estimated occurred archaeological record places first horse domestication ybp ancient centralasian botai two lineages thus split well domestication likely due climate topography environmental several subsequent dna studies produced partially contradictory results molecular analysis using ancient dna recovered archaeological sites placed przewalskis horse middle domesticated however mitochondrial dna analysis suggested przewalskis modern domestic horses diverged years analysis based whole genome sequencing calibration dna old horse bones gave divergence date

reevaluation botai horses reached conclusion favor traditional view przewalskis horses neverdomesticated authors viewed tooth wear previously attributed bridle mouthpieces likely caused natural processes age structure botai horses seemed inconsistent domesticated herding furthermore specimens found associated arrowheads suggesting hunted concluded horses associated botai culture wild instead domesticated animals przewalskis horse lineage indeed viewed feral lineage one always case botai horses found negligible genetic contribution ancient modern domestic horses studied indicating
