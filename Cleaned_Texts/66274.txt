ecology competitive exclusion sometimes referred gauses proposition two species compete limited resource coexist constant population values one species even slightest advantage another one advantage dominate long term leads either extinction weaker competitor evolutionary behavioral shift toward different ecological niche principle paraphrased maxim complete competitors competitive exclusion principle classically attributed georgy although actually never formulated principle already present darwins theory natural throughout history status principle oscillated priori two species coexisting must different niches experimental truth find species coexisting different based field observations joseph grinnell formulated principle competitive exclusion two species approximately food habits likely remain long evenly balanced numbers region one crowd georgy gause formulated law competitive exclusion based laboratory competition experiments using two species paramecium p aurelia p caudatum conditions add fresh water every day input constant flow food although p caudatum initially dominated p aurelia recovered subsequently drove p caudatum extinct via exploitative resource competition however gause able let p caudatum survive differing environmental parameters food water thus gauses law valid ecological factors constant gause also studied competition two species yeast finding saccharomyces cerevisiae consistently outcompeted schizosaccharomyces kefirclarification needed producing higher concentration ethyl competitive exclusion predicted mathematical theoretical models models competition however poorly understood reasons competitive exclusion rarely observed natural ecosystems many biological communities appear violate gauses law bestknown example socalled paradox plankton species live limited number resources primarily solar energy minerals dissolved water according competitive exclusion principle small number plankton species able coexist resources nevertheless large numbers plankton species coexist within small regions open sea communities appear uphold competitive exclusion principle macarthurs darwins though latter still overlap ecologically strongly affected negatively competition extreme partial solution paradox lies raising dimensionality system spatial heterogeneity trophic interactions multiple resource competition competitioncolonization tradeoffs lag may prevent exclusion ignoring stochastic extinction longer timeframes however systems tend analytically intractable addition many theory support unlimited number species new paradox created wellknown models allow stable coexistence allow unlimited number species coexist yet nature community contains handful species recent studies addressing assumptions made models predicting competitive exclusion shown assumptions need reconsidered example slight modification assumption growth body size related leads different conclusion namely given ecosystem certain
