chemokine receptors g proteincoupled receptors containing transmembrane domains found predominantly surface leukocytes making one rhodopsinlike receptors approximately different chemokine receptors

conserved cysteine residues nterminal end chemokine receptor binds chemokines important ligand specificity gproteins couple cterminal end important receptor signaling following ligand binding although chemokine receptors share high amino acid identity primary sequences typically bind limited number chemokine receptors redundant function one chemokine able bind single intracellular signaling

given time period smallpox collectively taken smallpox dated back years longer time period would given smallpox enough time exert selective pressure given earlier origin population genetic models
