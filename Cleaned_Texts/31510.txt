deidentified order comply hipaa regulations define stipulate patient privacy laws applied metadata general data identification process also known data anonymization common strategies include deleting masking personal identifiers personal name suppressing generalizing quasiidentifiers date birth reverse process using deidentified data identify individuals known data reidentification successful cast

deidentification adopted one main approaches toward data privacy commonly used fields communications multimedia biometrics big data cloud computing data mining internet social networks surveys

anonymization refers irreversibly severing data set identity data contributor study prevent future reidentification even study organizers deidentification may also include preserving identifying information relinked trusted party certain debate technology community whether data relinked even trusted party ever considered deidentified common strategies deidentification masking personal identifiers generalizing quasiidentifiers pseudonymization main technique used mask personal identifiers data records kanonymization usually adopted generalizing quasiidentifiers pseudonymization performed replacing real names temporary id deletes masks personal identifiers make individuals unidentified method makes possible track individuals record time even though record updated however prevent individual identified specific combinations attributes data record indirectly identify individual kanonymization defines attributes indirectly points individuals identity quasiidentifiers qis
