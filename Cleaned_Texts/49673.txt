molecular cloning vector particle eg plasmids cosmids lambda phages used vehicle artificially carry foreign nucleic sequence usually dna another cell replicated andor vector containing foreign dna termed recombinant dna four major types vectors plasmids viral vectors cosmids artificial chromosomes commonly used vectors common engineered vectors origin replication multicloning site selectable marker vector generally carries dna sequence consists insert case transgene larger sequence serves backbone vector purpose vector transfers genetic information another cell typically isolate multiply express insert target cell vectors may used cloning therefore cloning vectors also vectors designed specially cloning others may designed specifically purposes transcription protein expression vectors designed specifically expression transgene target cell called expression vectors generally promoter sequence drives expression transgene simpler vectors called transcription vectors capable transcribed translated replicated target cell expressed unlike expression vectors transcription vectors used amplify insert manipulation dna normally conducted e coli vectors contain elements necessary maintenance e coli however vectors may also elements allow maintained another organism yeast plant mammalian cells vectors called shuttle vectors vectors bacterial viral elements may transferred nonbacterial host organism however vectors termed intragenic vectors also developed avoid transfer genetic material alien insertion vector target cell usually called transformation bacterial transfection eukaryotic although insertion viral vector often called plasmids doublestranded extra chromosomal generally circular dna sequences capable replication using host cells replication plasmid vectors minimalistically consist origin replication allows semiindependent replication plasmid host plasmids found widely many bacteria example escherichia coli may also found eukaryotes example yeast saccharomyces bacterial plasmids may conjugativetransmissible nonconjugative plasmids speciallyconstructed features commonly used laboratory cloning purposes plasmid generally nonconjugative may many features notably multiple cloning site multiple restriction enzyme cleavage sites allow insertion transgene insert bacteria containing plasmids generate millions copies vector within bacteria hours amplified vectors extracted bacteria manipulation plasmids may used specifically transcription vectors plasmids may lack crucial sequences protein expression plasmids used protein expression called expression vectors would include elements translation protein ribosome binding site start stop codons viral vectors genetically engineered viruses carrying modified viral dna rna rendered noninfectious still contain viral promoters also transgene thus allowing translation transgene viral promoter however viral vectors frequently lacking infectious sequences require helper viruses packaging lines largescale transfection viral vectors often designed permanent incorporation insert host genome thus leave distinct genetic markers host genome incorporating transgene example retroviruses leave characteristic retroviral integration pattern insertion detectable indicates viral vector incorporated host genome artificial chromosomes manufactured chromosomes context yeast artificial chromosomes yacs bacterial artificial chromosomes bacs human artificial chromosomes hacs artificial chromosome carry much larger dna fragment yacs bacs carry dna fragment nucleotides long three structural necessities artificial chromosome include origin replication centromere telomeric end transcription cloned gene necessary component vector expression gene required one gene may amplified transcription generate multiple copies mrnas template protein may produced larger number mrnas would express greater amount protein many copies mrna generated depends promoter used expression may constitutive meaning protein produced constantly background may inducible whereby protein expressed certain condition example chemical inducer added two different types expression depend types promoter operator used viral promoters often used constitutive expression plasmids viral vectors normally force constant transcription many cell lines types inducible expression depends promoters respond induction conditions example murine mammary tumor virus promoter initiates transcription dexamethasone application drosophila heat shock promoter initiates high temperatures vectors designed transcription example vitro mrna production vectors called transcription vectors may lack sequences necessary polyadenylation termination therefore may used protein production expression vectors produce proteins transcription vectors insert followed translation mrna produced therefore require components simpler transcriptiononly vectors expression different host organism would require different elements although share similar requirements example promoter initiation transcription ribosomal binding site translation initiation termination signals eukaryote expression vectors require sequences encode modern artificiallyconstructed vectors contain essential components found vectors may contain additional features found vectors
