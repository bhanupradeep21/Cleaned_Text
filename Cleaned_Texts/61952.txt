sperm sorting means choosing type sperm cell fertilize egg cell several conventional techniques centrifugation swimup newly applied methods flow cytometry expand possibilities sperm sorting new techniques sperm sorting developed used sort sperm healthy well determination specific traits sex selection spermatozoa separated x female male chromosome bearing populations based difference dna content resultant sexsorted spermatozoa able used conjunction assisted reproductive technologies artificial insemination invitro fertilization ivf produce offspring desired sex farming animals also human medical practice several methods used sort sperm advent flow cytometry density gradient centrifugation continuous discontinuous gradient concentrate semen samples low concentration sperm using density sperm measure similarly socalled swimup techniques apply centrifugation step sperm allowed swim medium thus enriching subpopulation motile sperm however use sperm centrifugation detrimental sperm viability elicits production reactive oxygen conventional techniques routinely used assisted reproductive flow cytometry another method used sort sperm adaptations technique opens new opportunities sperm sorting however flow cytometrybased sperm sorting often uses fluorescent dyes often stain dna safety technique human reproductive medicine matter scientific however flow cytometry currently used technique able determine sex future progeny measuring dna content individual sperm cells evaluates contain larger x chromosome giving rise female offspring smaller chromosome leading male progeny allows separation x socalled beltsfield sperm sexing technology developed usda conjunction lawrence livermore national laboratories relying dna difference x prior flow cytometric sorting semen labeled fluorescent dye called hoechst binds dna spermatozoon x chromosome larger ie dna chromosome female xchromosome bearing spermatozoa absorb greater amount dye male ychromosome bearing counterpart consequence exposed uv light flow cytometry x spermatozoa fluoresce brighter spermatozoa spermatozoa pass flow cytometer single file spermatozoon encased single droplet fluid assigned electric charge corresponding chromosome status eg xpositive charge ynegative charge stream x droplets separated means electrostatic deflection collected separate collection tubes subsequent another cytometric technique used sperm sorting magneticactivated cell sorting macs routinely applied assisted reproduction hospitals sort sperm fragmented dna achieved using antibodies surface markers programmed cell death apoptosis annexin v coupled magnetic beads following binding antibodies spermatozoa undergo apoptosis sorted applying magnetic field sperm macs obviates need fluorescent dna binding molecules dna damage sperm cells may detected using raman specific enough detect individual traits sperm cells least dna damage may subsequently injected egg cell intracytoplasmic sperm injection many methods sperm sorting proposed currently select spermatozoa low dna damage index population sperm could enriched spermatozoa nonfragmented dna techniques like z macs magnetic activating cell sorting combination density gradient centrifugation single sperm preparation protocols results spermatozoa superior hyaluronic acid ha binding sites sperm plasma membrane indicator sperm maturity huszar et al yudin et two methods based fact physiological intracytoplasmic sperm injection picsi sperm slow procedure methods require sperm preparation via sperm washing centrifugation sperm undergoes process natural selection millions sperm enter vagina reach egg cell one usually allowed fertilize sperm selected highest motility also factors dna integrity production reactive oxygen species viability selection largely circumvented case invitro fertilization leads higher incidence birth defects associated assisted reproductive techniques egg cells often fertilized sperm would low chance fertilizing natural sperm sorting could thus used decrease risks associated assisted reproduction additionally ongoing debate using sperm sorting choosing childs sex conventional methods sperm sorting widely used assess quality sperm subsequent artificial insemination invitro fertilization verified sperm sorted using techniques superior quality however important characteristics sperm dna integrity remain untested conventional methods new flowcytometry based techniques yopro staining discriminate apoptotic dead spermatozoa viable example annexin v staining followed macs significantly improve pregnancy rates couples previous assisted reproduction sperm sorting flow cytometry established technique veterinary practice dairy industry female cows artificially inseminated sorted semen increase number female calves using sperm sorting less common species farm animals however artificial insemination artificial insemination farm animals sorted sperm recognized food agriculture organization fao promising way increasing efficiency agriculture needed produce enough food growing human population utilizing artificial insemination sorted sperm seen way create optimal ratio male female calves increase dairy milk choosing sex children might help prevent sexassociated heritable diseases duchene muscular dystrophy haemophilia families history diseases hand sperm sorting humans raises ethical concerns implicit idea sex selection applied largescale potential elicit sexratio imbalance could also implications gender equality parents consistently choose boy firstborn firstborns shown likely succeed country world explicitly permits sex selection nonmedical purposes countries allowed sex selection case sexlinked disease risk medical us humans application sperm sorting sex selection tightly regulated fda establishment microsort technique offered parents part clinical trial procedure made available limited number participants month addition fulfilling certain criteria disease sex linkage least one child family currently microsort laboratories collaborating physicians several countries general purposes offering service case genetic disease risks associated one highly accurate sperm sorting flow cytometry produce two completely separate populations say always male sperm among female sperm vice versa exact percentage purity population dependent species sorted gates operator places around total population visible machine general larger dna difference x chromosome species easier produce highly pure population sheep cattle purities sex usually remain
