myoclonic dystonia myoclonus dystonia syndrome rare movement disorder induces spontaneous muscle contraction causing abnormal posture prevalence myoclonus dystonia reported however disorder falls umbrella movement disorders affect thousands myoclonus dystonia results mutations sgce gene coding integral membrane protein found neurons muscle fibers suffering disease exhibit symptoms rapid jerky

exhibit symptoms cure found myoclonus dystonia treatment options available suffering disease ethanol often ameliorates symptoms well syndrome also called alcoholresponsive dystonia alcohol may substituted benzodiazepines clonazepam work mechanism deep brain stimulation dbs another viable option alleviate symptoms without unwanted side effects medications successful treating movement myoclonus dystonia characterized two primary features myoclonus dystonia majority individuals myoclonus dystonia myoclonus component disorder often primary disabling feature comparison dystonia component symptoms myoclonus dystonia vary substantially severity myoclonus characterized rapid contractions affect upper body including neck torso arms may also affect legs movements stimulated various factors including stress noise caffeine physical stimuli myoclonus characterized multiple ways including neurological basis muscular activity stimuli myoclonus positive negative positive

origin specifically nonsegmented myoclonus brainstem myoclonus symptoms within classification include startle response reticular reflex myoclonus sudden stimuli like noise touch areas around head chest cause startle response go brain stem spinal cord causing jerklike movements hyperekplexia heightened brainstem response affected person continue elicit response repeated stimuli contrast

syndrome many drugs used treat myoclonus dystonia significant impact individually combined work different brain mechanisms best alleviate symptoms method treatment used depends severity symptoms presented individual whether underlying cause syndrome known benzodiazepines clonazepam improve tremors caused myoclonus aspect syndrome binding allosterically gabaa ionotropic receptors causing influx chloride ions produce inhibitory effect calm myoclonic antiepileptics like valproate must act upon gaba receptors manipulate ionic conductance reduce tremors spasms myoclonus dystonia gaba neurons fire rapidly affect motor cortex blocked antiepileptics addition changes sodium calcium concentrations excite neuron different antiepileptics vary sufficiency control ionic conductance also produce seizures myoclonus symptoms another agent used anticholinergics like benzatropine alleviate dystonia symptoms blocking activity acetylcholine acetylcholine involved pathophysiology dystonia within basal ganglia although exact role determined acetylcholine involved dopamine glutamate pathways basal ganglia addition presynaptic muscarinic receptors involved motor control acetylcholine usually overactive dystonia patients blocking neurotransmitter would reduce contortion upper body produce side effects drowsiness confusion memory issues botulinum toxin injections also act upon acetylcholine reduce dystonia symptoms neurotoxin active presynaptic terminals blocks exocytosis acetylcholine synaptic cleft reduces muscle activity botulinum may also role inhibiting glutamate changing muscle movement studies also shown possible axon transport neurotoxin well function pain reliever without effect overactive muscle movement myoclonus dystonia consumption alcohol also found effective agent temporarily easing severity tremors associated myoclonus dystonia alcohol causes increase gaba transmission interneurons purkinje cells reduces transmission glutamate granule
