autocatalytic set collection entities created catalytically entities within set whole set able catalyze production way set whole said autocatalytic autocatalytic sets originally concretely defined terms molecular entities recently metaphorically extended study systems sociology ecology economics autocatalytic sets also ability replicate split apart two physically separated spaces computer models illustrate split autocatalytic sets reproduce reactions original set half much like cellular mitosis effect using principles autocatalysis small metabolism replicate little high level organization property autocatalysis contender foundational mechanism complex evolution prior watson crick biologists considered autocatalytic sets way metabolism functions principle ie one protein helps synthesize another protein discovery double helix central dogma molecular biology formulated dna transcribed rna translated protein molecular structure dna rna well metabolism maintains

make part rs autocatalytic set extends quickly growing number molecules reason theoretical results make autocatalytic sets attractive scientific explanation early origin life formally difficult treat molecules anything unstructured entities since set possible reactions molecules would become infinite therefore derivation arbitrarily long polymers needed model dna rna proteins possible yet studies rna world suffer problem contrary definition applies field artificial chemistry agreedupon notion autocatalytic sets exists today notion catalyst secondary insofar set whole catalyse production primary definitions giving term autocatalytic set different emphasis every reaction function transformation mediated catalyst consequence mediating respective reaction every catalyst denotes reaction resulting self denoting system interesting two reasons first real metabolism structured manner second self denoting systems considered intermediate step towards self describing systems structural natural historical point view one identify acs seized formal definition original concept second reflection system already brought explicit presentation since catalysts represent reaction induced acs literature concept present differently emphasised complete classification side generalised self reproducing systems move beyond selfdenotation unstructured entities carry transformations anymore structured described ones formally generalised self reproducing system consists two function u c together descriptions descu descc along following definition function u universal constructor constructs everything domain appropriate descriptions c copy function description practically u c fall apart many subfunctions catalysts note trivial copy function c necessary though universal constructor u would able construct description description would base would general longer result rendering full self replication impossible last concept attributed von neumanns work self reproducing automata holds self description necessary nontrivial generalised self reproducing system avoid interferences von neumann planned design system model chemistry virtually articles autocatalytic sets leave open whether sets considered autonomous often autonomy sets silently assumed likely context strong emphasis autonomous self replication early origin life concept autocatalytic sets really general practical use various technical areas eg selfsustaining tool chains handled clearly sets autonomous objects human agency examples practical importance nonautonomous autocatalytic sets found eg field compiler construction operating systems selfreferential nature respective constructions explicitly discussed often bootstrapping autocatalytic sets constitute one several current theories life
