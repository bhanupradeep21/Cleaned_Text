mutualism seed dispersal important plants allows progeny move away parents time advantages seed dispersal may led evolution fleshy fruits entice animals consume move plants seeds place place many fruitproducing plant species would disperse far without frugivores seeds usually germinate even fall ground directly parentcitation needed many types animals seed dispersers mammal bird species represent majority seeddispersing species however frugivorous tortoises lizards amphibians even fish also disperse example cassowaries keystone species spread fruit digestion many seeds grow unless digested animal frugivores fruitproducing plant species present worldwide evidence tropical forests frugivore seed dispersers temperate zonescitation needed frugivore seed dispersal common phenomenon many ecosystems however highly specific type interaction example single species frugivorous bird may disperse fruits several species plants species bird may disperse seeds one plant lack specialization could fruit availability varies season year tends discourage frugivore animals focusing one plant furthermore different seed dispersers tend disperse seeds different habitats different abundances distances depending behavior number fruit characteristics seem adaptive characteristics attract frugivores animaldispersed fruits may advertise palatability animals bright colors attractive smells mimetic fruit pulp generally rich water carbohydrates low protein lipids however exact nutritional composition fruits varies widely seeds animaldispersed fruits often adapted survive digestion frugivores example seeds become permeable water passage animals gut leads higher germination mistletoe seeds even germinate inside dispersers many seeddispersing animals specialized digestive systems process fruits leave seeds intact bird species shorter intestines rapidly pass seeds fruits frugivorous bat species longer intestines seeddispersing frugivores short gutretention times others alter intestinal enzyme composition eating different types since plants invest considerable energy fruit production many evolved encourage mutualist frugivores consume fruit seed dispersal also evolved mechanisms decrease consumption fruits unripe nonseeddispersing predators predators parasites fruit include seed predators insects microbial plants developed chemical physical adaptations physical

across environments aotus species tropical forests eat fruit throughout year readily available compared dry forests fruit limited dry season owl monkeys dependent species fish frugivorous since seed dispersal allows plant species disperse areas loss frugivores could change plant communities lead local loss particular plant species since frugivore seed dispersal important tropics many researchers studied loss frugivores related changed plant population dynamics several studies noted even loss large frugivores monkeys could negative effect since responsible certain types longdistance seed dispersal seen frugivore types like however plant species whose seeds dispersed animals may less vulnerable fragmentation plant frugivores also benefit invasion exotic fruitproducing species vectors
