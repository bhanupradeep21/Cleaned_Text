symptoms may rarely occur along joint pain including fatigue high longstanding elevated uric acid levels hyperuricemia may result symptoms including hard painless deposits uric acid crystals called tophi extensive tophi may lead chronic arthritis due bone elevated levels uric acid may also lead crystals precipitating kidneys resulting kidney stone formation subsequent acute uric acid
