unicompartmental knee arthroplasty uka surgical procedure used relieve arthritis one knee compartments damaged parts knee replaced uka surgery may reduce postoperative pain shorter recovery period total knee replacement particularly people years moreover ukas may require smaller incision less tissue damage faster recovery united states procedure constitutes approximately knee comparisons extensive surgical procedure called high tibial osteotomy uka equal better early duncan c mckeever theorized osteoarthritis could isolated one compartment knee replacement entire knee might necessary one knee compartment uka concept designed cause less trauma damage traditional total knee replacement removing less bone trying maintain persons bone concept also designed use smaller implants thereby keep persons bone helping return normal function initially ukas always successful implants poorly designed people needing surgery thoroughly screened suitability optimal surgical techniques advancements made improve design also choosing bestsuited people emphasized ensure surgeons followed indications contraindications partial replacement proper following indicationscontraindications performing surgery well key factors success uka may suitable people moderate joint disease caused painful osteoarthritis traumatic injury history unsuccessful surgical procedures poor bone density precludes types knee people may eligible uka include active suspected infection knee joint may known sensitivity device materials bone infections disease result inability support fixate new implant

andor instability knee ligaments postoperative stability uka would anterior cruciate ligament acl although debated clinicians people need medial compartment people needing lateral compartment replacement acl intact contraindicated people acldeficient knees lateral component motion medial physical examination getting subjects history performed getting person pain one area knee may candidate however person pain multiple areas knee may good candidate doctor may take radiographs eg xrays check degeneration knee compartments evaluate physical exam may also include special tests designed test ligaments knee anatomical likely surgeon decide uka surgery heshe directly see status surgeon may choose type incision implant use subjects knee surgery surgeon may align instruments determine amount bone surgeon removes bone tibia thigh bone surgeon may decide check appropriate amount bone removed order make sure proper size implant used surgeon may choose use temporary trial making sure proper size implant selected surgeon put implant ends bone secure pegs finally surgeon close wound unicompartmental replacement minimally invasive option people whose arthritis isolated either medial lateral compartment procedure offers several benefits patients moderately active lifestyle arthritis one knee compartment within normal weight ranges surgeon uses incision inches total knee replacement typically requires incision inches partial replacement disrupt knee cap makes shorter rehabilitation period partial replacement also causes minimal blood loss procedure results considerably less postoperative pain hospitalization time compared total knee replacement also greatly potential benefits uka include smaller incision uka implants smaller total knee replacements surgeon may make smaller may lead smaller another potential benefit less postoperative pain less bone also quicker operation shorter recovery period may result less bone removed operation soft tissue may sustain less also rehabilitation process may specific benefits uka may improve range motion reduce blood loss surgery reduce persons time spent hospital decrease two significant benefits uka partial knee replacements arecitation needed partial knee replacement subjects report replaced knee feels like original nonreplaced knee compared total knee replacement partial knee replacements leave options open advances replacing rest knee metal plastic options exist years come arthritis areas partial knee replacement burn bridge blood clots also known deep vein thrombosis common complication however doctor may prescribe certain medications help prevent blood infection may occur however antibiotics may prescribed doctor help prevent individual factors eg anatomy weight prior medical history prior joint surgeries addressed surgery subject causes longterm failure ukas include polyethylene wear loosening implant degeneration adjacent knee longterm studies reported excellent outcomes uka partly due subject minimizing amount bone using proper surgical one study found minimum years follow time initial surgery overall survival rate implant also people study excellent good another study reported years follow time initial surgery overall rate implant people reported good excellent httpsenwikipediaorgwikiunicompartmentalkneearthroplasty
