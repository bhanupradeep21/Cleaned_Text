spelt venjukovia english literature stems spelling error made russian palaeontologist ivan efremov mistakenly replaced j subsequently permeated therapsid literature mistake caught venyukovia namesake venyukovioidea group small russian basal anomodonts also including closely related otsheria suminia parasuminia ulemica although also one poorest known like venyukovioids large projecting incisorlike teeth front lacked canines although remaining teeth simple compared venyukovioids eg ulemica suminia may resemble otsheria little said overall anatomy venyukovia beyond mandibles teeth partial jaw preserved measures mm long mm high including crowns like venyukovioids venyukovia large procumbent incisorlike teeth jaw tips possibly two either side superficially resembling incisors mammals canines remaining ten cheek teeth identified amalitskii molars premolars relatively simple shape pointed laterally compressed ivakhnenko compared venyukovia favourably otsheria identifying similar shearing dental apparatus compared specialised jaws like otsheria cheek teeth bulbous roughly wide notably venyukovia appears lack lower dentary shelf bony structure lower jaws venyukovioids ulemica suminia dicynodonts shelf attachment point powerful lateral adductor jaw muscle allowed anomodonts chew pulling mandible backwards absence lateral dentary shelf venyukovia suggests may also lacked muscle restricting jaws simple upanddown known fossil venyukovia discovered russian geologist pavel nikolaevich venyukov would later formally named specimen catalogued pin paleontological institute found venyukov isolated spoil heap kargaly mines mines excavated copperbearing sandstones southern cisural mountains centuries russian copper mines historical palaeontological significance discovery first albeit fragmentary fossils permian therapsids however since shut time venyukovia discovered precise mining locality collected venyukov brought finds russian palaeontologist vladimir p amalitskii aka amalitzky posthumous publication notes formally named briefly described venyukovia amalitskii described two specimens partial left mandible first right incisor attached pin smaller specimen interpreted tip snout teeth later shown mandibular notably type specimen v prima given publication would amended russian palaeontologist peter konstantinovich chudinov formally designated pin amalitskii recognised venyukovia nonmammalian synapsid instead thought triconodont mammal similar first therapsid fossils russian copper mines also initially mistaken true mammals nonmammalian nature venyukovia recognised american palaeontologist george gaylord simpson six years later although regarded clearly venyukovia later correctly shown therapsid efremov although interpreted dinocephalian true anomodont affinities venyukovia recognised english palaeontologist watson would later coin infraorder venyukovioidea similar forms russia discovered since american palaeontologist alfred romer historically numerous complete skulls jaws referred venyukovia isheevo tatarstan named second species v invisa efremov chudinov synonymised v invisa v prima however v invisa material moved genus entirely russian palaeontologist mikha√Øl ivakhnenko consequently much historically written morphology functional anatomy venyukovia actually based upon ulemica eg barghusen king paper ivakhnenko commented similarities type specimen venyukovia otsheria highlighting jaw dental anatomy venyukovia matches would expected otsheria venyukovioid known skull even regarded potential time ivakhnenko also regarded referred specimen pin similar ulemica venyukovia thus venyukovia represented solely lecotype venyukovia member infraorder venyukovioidea clade basal anomodonts related dicynodonts anomodonts highly successful group therapsids largely represented dicynodonts also handful basal genera venyukovia one first basal anomodonts discovered although mistaken early mammal first amalitskii due mammallike subsqeuent discoveries since identified venyukovia part radiation basal anomodonts eastern europe namesake venyukovioidea venyukovia additionally also variously assigned familylevel subfamilylevel ranked groups venyukoviidae venyukoviinae despite groups namesake unclear venyukovia related venyukovioids subgroups reliably defined largely due incompleteness venyukovia included phylogenetic analyses basal anomodonts due low number characteristics scored although found across various individual mines mixed spoil heaps fossil flora fauna kargaly mines recognised fossil assemblage namely correlated better known ocher assemblage zone east kargaly mines produced diverse array tetrapod fish invertebrate including bivalves conchostracans insects plant fossils although due often fragmentary nature specific identifications apart venyukovia therapsids mostly represented dinocephalians including dubious predatory anteosaur admetophoneus possibly synonym titanophoneus potentially syodon though uncertain referred specimen comes deposits well tapinocephalians deuterosaurus jubilaei ulemosaurus although fragmentary remains therocephalians tetrapods include chalcosaurus lanthanosuchoid parareptile early tetrapods seymouriamorph discosauriscus netschajevi unidentified gephyrostegid temnospondyls known archegosauroid numerous fossils wide variety plants also discovered copper sandstones kargaly mines include sporebearing plants like lycopods horsetails paracalamites phyllothecalike species trunks treelike calamites well indeterminate ferns seed ferns represented mostly peltaspermaceans including pinnate permocallipteris monopinnate compsopteris leaf fronds whereas angaropeltacean phylladoderma rarer ginkgophytes represented leaves psygmophyllum
