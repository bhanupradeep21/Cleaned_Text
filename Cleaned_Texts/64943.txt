gene duplication chromosomal duplication gene amplification major mechanism new genetic material generated molecular evolution defined duplication region dna contains gene gene duplications arise products several types errors dna replication repair machinery well fortuitous capture selfish genetic elements common sources gene duplications include ectopic recombination retrotransposition event aneuploidy polyploidy replication duplications arise event termed unequal crossingover occurs meiosis misaligned homologous chromosomes chance happening function degree sharing repetitive elements two chromosomes products recombination duplication site exchange reciprocal deletion ectopic recombination typically mediated sequence similarity duplicate breakpoints form direct repeats repetitive genetic elements transposable elements offer one source repetitive dna facilitate recombination often found duplication breakpoints plants replication slippage error dna replication produce duplications short genetic sequences replication dna polymerase begins copy dna point replication process polymerase dissociates dna replication stalls polymerase reattaches dna strand aligns replicating strand incorrect position incidentally copies section replication slippage also often facilitated repetitive sequences requires bases similaritycitation needed retrotransposons mainly occasionally act cellular mrna transcripts reverse transcribed dna inserted random place genome creating retrogenes resulting sequence usually lack introns often contain poly sequences also integrated genome many retrogenes display changes gene regulation comparison parental gene sequences sometimes results novel functions retrogenes move different chromosomes shape chromosomal aneuploidy occurs nondisjunction single chromosome results abnormal number chromosomes aneuploidy often harmful mammals regularly leads spontaneous abortions miscarriages aneuploid individuals viable example trisomy humans leads syndrome aneuploidy often alters gene dosage ways detrimental organism therefore unlikely spread populations polyploidy whole genome duplication product nondisjunction meiosis results

plants prolific genome duplicators example wheat hexaploid kind polyploid meaning six copies genome another possible fate duplicate genes copies equally free accumulate degenerative mutations long defects complemented copy leads neutral subfunctionalization process constructive neutral evolution ddc duplicationdegenerationcomplementation functionality original gene distributed among two copies neither gene lost perform important nonredundant functions ultimately neither able achieve novel functionality subfunctionalization occur neutral processes mutations accumulate detrimental beneficial effects however cases subfunctionalization occur clear adaptive benefits ancestral gene pleiotropic performs two functions often neither one two functions changed without affecting function way partitioning ancestral functions two separate genes allow adaptive specialization subfunctions thereby providing adaptive often resulting genomic variation leads gene dosage dependent neurological disorders rettlike syndrome detrimental mutations likely lost population preserved develop novel functions however many duplications fact detrimental beneficial neutral sequences may lost may spread population random fluctuations via genetic drift two genes exist gene duplication event called paralogs usually code proteins similar function andor structure contrast orthologous genes present
