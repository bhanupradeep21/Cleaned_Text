secodontosaurus meaning cuttingtooth lizard extinct genus pelycosaur synapsids lived million years ago early permian like well known dimetrodon secodontosaurus carnivorous member eupelycosauria family sphenacodontidae similar tall dorsal sail however skull long low narrow slender jaws teeth similar size shorter deep skull dimetrodon twomeasure tooth large prominent caninelike teeth front smaller slicing teeth back unusual long narrow jaws suggest secodontosaurus may specialized catching fish hunting prey lived hid burrows although complete skeletons currently known secodontosaurus likely ranged metres ft length weighing kilograms lb fossils secodontosaurus found texas north america wichita clear fork groups early permian formations recent years teams houston museum natural science

limbs tail incomplete probably resembled dimetrodon well like dimetrodon secodontosaurus would short neck robust body short limbs long tail light similarities skeletal remains missing fragmentary skulls previously identified dimetrodon may fact belong secodontosaurus key noncranial difference found axis neck vertebra tall broad neural spine dimetrodon lower neural spine robert r reisz described skull detail based mostly nearly complete skull specimen mcz cm long preserved left mandible addition long low skull nearly uniform size teeth contrast dimetrodon anterior teeth upper jaw slanted back lower jaw directed forward grasping prey rather crocodilelike skull suggests secodontosaurus could semiaquatic may fed fish small swimming amphibians however reisz coauthors noted tall sail would seem hindrance pursuit quickmoving creatures underwater instead long narrow snout forward slanting teeth mandible tip might allowed secodontosaurus probe small animals hiding burrows tight

determining exactly members sphenacodontidae dimetrodon sphenacodon ctenospondylus cryptovenator related posed evolutionary puzzle paleontologists dimetrodon secodontosaurus similar postcranial skeletons tall dorsal sail supported thin rodlike cylindrical neural spines contrast sphenacodon ctenospondylus lower dorsal crest formed flat bladelike neural spines relatively low sphenacodon taller
