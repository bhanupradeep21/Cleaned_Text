metres ft total length including although later study mentioned head total length ratio stratiotosuchus teeth ziphodont meaning laterally compressed curved serrated like baurusuchids stratiotosuchus reduced number teeth three premaxilla five maxilla jaw closed teeth upper jaw overlie lower jaw shear closely together stratiotosuchus one large caniniform tooth premaxilla several large maxillary teeth behind enlarged fourth dentary tooth lower jaw also forms canine visible jaw like crocodyliforms stratiotosuchus quadrupedal unlike sprawling gait crocodilians living today stratiotosuchus thought fully erect quadruped transition sprawling low ground posture ancestors stratiotosuchus erect elevated posture involved significant transformation limbs hips large crests present acetabulum hip socket stabilizing hip known pillarerect stance acetabular crest lies like shelf top femur form pillar ischium bone extends backward hip large projection life would serve strong attachment site puboischiotibialis muscle puboischiotibialis also present living crocodilians used primarily keep legs upright known high walk hold legs underneath walking puboischiotibialis weak living crocodilians sustain high walk long stratiotosuchus thought much stronger puboischiotibialis allowing permanent upright stratiotosuchus also relatively straight femur bone bone somewhat twisted along length degree torsion high crocodyliforms shape femur similar rauisuchids poposaurids early crocodile relatives known erect gaits femur even shares similarities early theropod dinosaurs fully bipedal compared crocodilians top femur stratiotosuchus rotated toward front femoral head faces backward rather medially inward position restricts movement hindlimbs along forwardbackward parasagittal axis muscles attach side leg crocodilians would attached back leg stratiotosuchus enabling powerful backward extension hind arm socket faces backwards downwards bone shoulder girdle called coracoid suggesting arms held beneath body large articular surface head humerus implies arms wide range movement restricted parasagittal axis deltopectoral crest front humerus would anchored large arm muscles bring arm forward walking modern crocodilians also deltopectoral crest positioned laterally anchors muscles pull arms sides forward muscle thought facilitated forward movement stratiotosuchus called deltoideus clavicularis also present modern crocodilians use high features suggest erect posture tightly clustered metacarpals forming narrow hands wellsuited walking backwardprojecting calcaneal tuberosity ankle would attached muscles fixed lower limb parasagittal axis backwardprojecting calcaneal tuberosity present early crocodilian relatives including thought sprawling gaits yet modern crocodilians

baurusuchidae even defined recent common ancestor baurusuchus stratiotosuchus descendants thus definition baurusuchidae relies inclusion stratiotosuchus baurusuchus belong large clade called metasuchia includes living crocodilians many extinct relatives extending back jurassic however exact position stratiotosuchus baurusuchus within metasuchia still uncertain several possibilities uncovered various phylogenetic analyses montefeltro et al found support baurusuchids advanced notosuchians divided family two subfamilies baurusuchinae pissarrachampsinae stratiotosuchus belonged
