dicynodontoid kunpania could reveal information evolution radiation bidentalian dicynodonts capitanian age correct would indicate bidentalian dicynodonts radiated earlier fossil record indicates capitanian mass extinction event early history bidentalians otherwise unknown fossil record would also create extensive ghost lineages amongst bidentalians including three traditional lineages
