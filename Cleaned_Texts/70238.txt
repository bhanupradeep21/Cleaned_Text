provides visibility accessibility complete calculus removal thorough smoothing roots creating favourable environment gingival healing restoration physiologic gingival contour procedure may also carried access subgingival caries crown margins common aesthetic reason gingivectomy gummy smile due gingival gingivectomy primary treatment method available reducing pocket depths patients periodontitis suprabony retrospective comparison different treatment approach periodontitis management based initial final gingival health conventional gingivectomy proven successful reducing pocket depths inflammation compared nonsurgical treatments pockets measured removal suprabony deep pockets allow better visibility access removal calculus result provides suitable environment healing gingiva physiological contour gingiva cases gingival enlargement induced drugs surgical treatment gingivectomy proved effective patients showing clinical sign recurrence one even though frequent method treatment indicated overgrowth another cause gingival enlargement would hereditary condition known gingival fibromatosis extensive overgrowth gingival tissue usually treated gingivectomy produces good aesthetic however recurrence cases means affected face possibility undergoing repeated gingivectomy also done increase clinical crown height teeth suitable treatment planning teeth inadequate tissue retention prosthetic restorations result subgingival carious lesions coronal surgical treatment resets margin maintaining biological width clinical gingival display smiling described cosmetically acceptable gummy smiles often used describe smiles gingival tissue seen clinically usually deemed unaesthetic similar subgingival crevices margins gingivectomy increase crown height performed provide better aesthetics normal gingival dentalgingival morphologic characteristics perioral variables influence patients smile frame essential achieving predictable successful rehabilitation patients males females mean vertical height maxillary central incisors averages lip line rest mean maxillary incisors display men women nearly double recent studies done confirm statistically significant sexual dimorphism relative height visible maxillary incisor crown data study also clearly indicates higher smile lines common among female lower smile patterns among male high smile line displays entire

especially surgical crown lengthening achieve aesthetically pleasing gingival architecture blending harmoniously gingival contours maxillary anterior posterior apart black triangles likely develop

postoperative pain minimised pain may experienced initially following procedure subside within days appropriately controlled drugs alleviate pain patient also advised avoid using area surgery performed chewing initial healing stage adequate plaque control important ensuring longterm results procedure postoperative infection control levels maintained patient able keep healthy periodontium however outcome procedure may influenced general factors systemic status patient patients maintain appropriate oral hygiene levels postoperative care inevitable disease return patients may struggle selfperformed oral hygiene initially procedure due pain discomfort regular visits professional tooth cleaning advised immediately surgery patients recommended rinse appropriate antiplaque agent sutures removed area irrigated teeth polished area ready mechanical tooth brushing begin gentle brushing demonstrated patient using toothbrush softened hot water early stages procedure use interdental brushes strongly advised due potential damage interdental tissues operated area toothpicks recommended alternative patient asked visit every two weeks monitoring plaque levels time visits gradually
