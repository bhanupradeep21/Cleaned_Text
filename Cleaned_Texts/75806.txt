juvenile tarbosaurus suggests may also crepuscular nocturnal hunters whether adult tarbosaurus also nocturnal currently unknown due lack fossil evidence suggest tarbosaurus skull found soviet mongolian scientists pin originally called gorgosaurus lancinator included skull cavity held brain making plaster cast called endocast inside cavity allowed maleev make preliminary observations shape tarbosaurus newer polyurethane rubber cast allowed detailed study tarbosaurus brain structure endocranial structure tarbosaurus similar differing positions cranial nerve roots including trigeminal accessory nerves tyrannosaurid brains similar crocodilians nonavian reptiles birds total brain volume meters ft long tarbosaurus estimated cubic centimeters cu large size olfactory bulbs well terminal olfactory nerves suggest tarbosaurus highly keen sense smell also case tyrannosaurus vomeronasal bulb large differentiated olfactory bulb initially suggested indicative welldeveloped jacobsens organ used detect pheromones may imply tarbosaurus complex mating however identification vomeronasal bulb challenged researchers present living auditory nerve also large suggesting good hearing may useful auditory communication spatial awareness nerve welldeveloped vestibular component well implies good sense balance coordination contrast nerves brain structures associated eyesight smaller undeveloped midbrain tectum responsible visual processing reptiles small tarbosaurus optic nerve oculomotor nerve controls eye movement unlike tyrannosaurus forwardfacing eyes provided accurate binocular vision tarbosaurus narrower skull typical tyrannosaurids eyes faced primarily sideways suggests tarbosaurus relied senses smell hearing suggested lack binocular vision asian tyrannosaurs like tarbosaurus might correlated greater amount scavenging resources provided sauropod carcasses might afforded less active predatory lifestyle compared north american forms meaning would need less predatory however contradicted numerous lines evidence indicating tarbosaurus actively preying hadrosaurs titanosaur sauropods large bodied herbivores skull tarbosaurus completely described first time scientists noted key differences tarbosaurus north american tyrannosaurids many differences related handling stress skull bones bite upper jaw bit object force transmitted maxilla primary toothbearing bone upper jaw surrounding skull bones north american tyrannosaurids force went maxilla fused nasal bones top snout firmly connected rear lacrimal bones bony struts struts locked two bones together suggesting force transmitted nasals tarbosaurus lacked bony struts connection nasals lacrimals weak instead backwards projection maxilla massively developed tarbosaurus fit inside sheath formed lacrimal projection thin bony plate north american tyrannosaurids large backwards projection suggests force transmitted directly maxilla lacrimal tarbosaurus lacrimal also firmly anchored frontal prefrontal bones tarbosaurus welldeveloped connections maxilla lacrimal frontal prefrontal would made entire upper jaw much another major difference tarbosaurus north american relatives rigid mandible many theropods including north american tyrannosaurids degree flexibility bones rear mandible dentary front tarbosaurus locking mechanism formed ridge surface angular articulated square process rear scientists hypothesized rigid skull tarbosaurus adaptation hunting massive titanosaurid sauropods found nemegt formation exist north america late cretaceous differences skull mechanics also affect tyrannosaurid phylogeny tarbosauruslike articulations skull bones also seen alioramus mongolia suggesting closest relative tarbosaurus similarities tarbosaurus tyrannosaurus might related large size independently developed convergent bruce rothschild others published study examining evidence stress fractures tendon avulsions theropod dinosaurs implications behavior since stress fractures caused repeated trauma rather singular events likely caused regular behavior types injuries none eighteen tarbosaurus foot bones examined study found stress fracture one ten examined hand bones found one stress fractures hands special behavioral significance compared found feet since stress fractures obtained running migration hand injuries contrast likely obtained contact struggling prey presence stress fractures tendon avulsions general provide evidence active predationbased diet instead obligate bite force revealed tarbosaurus bite force around pounds per square inch force meaning could crush bones like north american relative david w e hone mahito watabe reported left humerus nearly complete saurolophus skeleton mpcd bügiin tsav locality nemegt formation heavily damaged bite marks attributed tarbosaurus suggested lack damage rest skeleton large wounds skeletal remains indicative predation tyrannosaurid likely scavenging already dead saurolophus unlikely largebodied predator tarbosaurus would left sparse feeding traces single humerus entire carcass feed humerus shows three distinctive feeding methods interpreted punctures drag marks marks hone watabe noted bite marks mostly located deltopectoral crest suggesting tarbosaurus actively selecting biting style employ could scavenge bite marks two fragmentary gastralia holotype specimen large ornithomimosaur deinocheirus mirificus reported size shape bite marks match teeth tarbosaurus largest known predator nemegt formation various types feeding traces identified include punctures gouges striae fragmentary teeth combinations marks bite marks probably represent feeding behavior instead aggression species fact bite marks found elsewhere body indicates predator focused internal organs tarbosaurus bite marks also identified hadrosaur sauropod fossils theropod bite marks bones theropods rare fossil study involving stable isotopes found tarbosaurus primarily hunted large dinosaurs environment notably titanosaurs vast majority known tarbosaurus fossils recovered nemegt formation gobi desert southern mongolia geologic formation never dated radiometrically fauna present fossil record indicate probably deposited early maastrichtian stage near end late million years subashi formation shanshanosaurus remains discovered also maastrichtian tarbosaurus found chiefly nemegt formation whose sediments preserve large river channels soil deposits indicate far humid climate suggested underlying barun goyot djadochta formations however caliche deposits indicate least periodic droughts sediment deposited channels floodplains large rivers rock facies formation suggest presence mudflats shallow lakes sediments also indicate existed rich habitat offering diverse food abundant amounts could sustain massive cretaceous fossils unidentified tyrannosaur older djadochta formation closely resemble tarbosaurus may indicate also lived earlier time arid ecosystem occasional mollusk fossils found well variety
