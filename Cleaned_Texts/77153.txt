anisogamy form sexual reproduction involves union fusion two gametes differ size andor form smaller gamete male sperm cell whereas larger gamete female typically egg cell anisogamy predominant among multicellular plants animals gamete size difference fundamental difference females anisogamy likely evolved since biological definition male female based gamete size evolution anisogamy viewed evolutionary origin male female anisogamy outcome natural selection sexual led sexes different primary secondary sex including sex differences geoff parker robin baker vic smith first provide mathematical model evolution anisogamy consistent modern evolutionary theory widely accepted alternative hypotheses evolution anisogamy comes ancient greek words aniso meaning unequal gamy meaning first known use term anisogamy year anisogamy form sexual reproduction involves union fusion two gametes differ size andor smaller gamete considered male sperm cell whereas larger gamete regarded female typically egg cell several types anisogamy gametes may flagellated therefore motile alternatively flowering plants conifers gnetophytes neither gametes flagellated groups male gametes nonmotile cells within pollen grains delivered egg cells means pollen tubes red alga polysiphonia nonmotile eggs fertilized nonmotile sperm form anisogamy occurs animals including humans oogamy large nonmotile egg ovum fertilized small motile sperm spermatozoon egg optimized longevity whereas small sperm optimized motility speed size resources egg cell allow production pheromones attract swimming sperm anisogamy core element sexual dimorphism helps explain phenotypic differences researchers estimate eukaryotes reproduce way male female sexes optimized reproductive potential due differently sized shaped gametes males females developed physiological behavioral differences optimize individuals since egg laying females typically must bear offspring limited reproductive cycle typically makes females limiting factor reproductive success rate males species process also true females selecting males assuming males females selecting different traits partners would result phenotypic differences sexes many generations hypothesis known batemans principle used understand evolutionary pressures put males females due although assumption criticism generally accepted model sexual selection within anisogamous species selection different traits depending sex within species known sexspecific selection accounts differing phenotypes found sexes species sexspecific selection sexes time also leads development secondary sex characteristics assist males females reproductive success species sexes choose mates based available phenotypes potential phenotypes speciesspecific resulting varying strategies successful sexual reproduction example large males sexually selected elephant seals large size helps male fight males small males sexually selected spiders mate female quickly avoiding sexual however despite large range sexually selected phenotypes anisogamous species follow set predictable desirable traits selective behaviors based general reproductive success models internal fertilizers female investment high reproduction since typically expend energy throughout single reproductive event seen early oogenesis female sacrifices gamete number gamete size better increase survival chances potential zygote process energetically demanding spermatogenesis oogenesis occurs ovary female specific organ also produces hormones prepare femalespecific organs changes necessary reproductive organs facilitate egg delivery external fertilizers zygote development internal fertilizers egg cell produced large sometimes even immobile requiring contact mobile sperm instigate since process energydemanding timeconsuming female mate choice often integrated females females often selective males choose reproduce phenotype male indicative males physical health heritable traits females employ mate choice pressure males displaying desirable traits females courtship successful male gets reproduce encourages males females specific species invest courtship behaviors well traits display physical health potential mate process known sexual results development traits ease reproductive success rather individual survival inflated size termite queen also important females select potential mates may sexually transmitted infection disease could hurt females reproductive ability also damage resulting although uncommon males females associated parental care since females limited reproductive schedule males female often invests protecting offspring sexual maturity male like mate choice level parental care varies greatly species often dependent number offspring produced per sexual many species including ones major vertebrate groups females utilize sperm process female store excess sperm mate fertilize eggs long reproductive event mating opportunities drop quality mates decreases able save sperm desirable mates female gains control reproductive success thus allowing female selective males well making timing fertilization potentially frequent males males species sperm cells produce optimized ensuring fertilization female egg sperm cells created spermatogenesis form gametogenesis focuses developing possible gametes per sexual spermatogenesis occurs testes male specific organ also produces hormones trigger development secondary sex characteristics since males gametes energetically cheap abundant every ejaculation male greatly increase sexual success mating far frequently sperm unlike egg cells also mobile allowing sperm swim towards egg females sexual organs sperm competition also major factor development sperm cells one sperm fertilize egg since females potentially mate one male fertilization occurs producing sperm cells faster abundant viable produced males give male reproductive since females often limiting factor species reproductive success males often expected females search compete female known intraspecific seen organisms bean beetles male searches females frequently often successful finding mates reproducing species undergoing form selection fit male would one fast refined sensory organs spatial secondary sex characteristics meant attracting mates also competing males copulation opportunities structures antlers deer provide benefits males reproductive success providing weapon prevent rival males achieving reproductive however structures large colorful tail feathers found male peacocks result fisherian runaway well several species specific factors due females selecting specific traits males time traits exaggerated point could hinder males however since traits greatly benefit sexual selection usefulness providing mating opportunities overrides possibility trait could lead shortening lifespan predation starvation desirable traits extend beyond physical body parts often extend courtship behavior nuptial gifts well although behaviors males meant work within parameters female choice male traits work strong enough males cases force upon female forcing fertilization overriding female

according john avise anisogamy probably originated around time sexual reproduction multicellularity billion years anisogamy first evolved multicellular haploid species different mating types become three main theories evolution anisogamy gamete competition gamete limitation intracellular conflicts last three well supported current gamete competition gamete limitation assume anisogamy originated disruptive selection acting ancestral isogamous population external fertilization due tradeoff larger gamete number gamete size turn affects zygote survival total resource one individual invest reproduction assumed first formal mathematical theory proposed explain evolution anisogamy based gamete model assumed natural selection would lead gamete sizes result largest populationwide number successful assumed certain amount resources provided gametes needed survival resulting zygote tradeoff size number gametes optimum shown one small male large female gametes produced however early models assume natural selection acts mainly population level something today known problematic first mathematical model explain evolution anisogamy via individual level selection one became widely accepted theory gamete sperm selection happens individual level individuals produce smaller gametes also gain larger proportion fertilizations simply produce larger number gametes seek larger type however zygotes formed larger gametes better survival prospects process lead divergence gametes sizes large small female male gametes end result one seems numerous small gametes compete large gametes tasked providing maximal resources offspring recent theoretical work challenged gamete competition theory showing gamete limitation lead divergence gamete sizes even selection individual possible also
