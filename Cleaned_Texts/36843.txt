chlorfenvinphos organophosphorus compound widely used insecticide molecule described enol ester derived dichloroacetophenone diethylphosphonic acid chlorfenvinphos included many products since first use however toxic effect cholinesterase inhibitor banned several countries including united states european union use united states cancelled pure chemical colorless solid commercial purposes often marketed amber liquid insecticides mostly used liquid form contain chlorfenvinphos substance easily mixes acetone ethanol propylene glycol furthermore chlorfenvinphos corrosive metal hydrolyzes classified extremely hazardous substance united states defined section us emergency planning community righttoknow act usc subject strict reporting requirements facilities produce store use significant dermaton first registered product containing chlorfenvinphos introduced united states used insecticide acaricide controlling fleas ticks domestic pets animals additional uses registered including use fly spray surface spray larvicide effects chlorfenvinphos often used farms control adult flies dairy barns milk rooms poultry houses yards animal buildings furthermore used control larval flies manure storage pits piles refuse accumulation areas around dairies early chlorfenvinphos registered additional uses dust formulation use dog kennels dog collars control fleas outside united states chlorfenvinphos registered trade names birlane cga sapecron steladone supona used soil insecticide controlling root maggots root worms cutworms chlorfenvinphos also used colorado beetles potatoes scale insects mite eggs citrus furthermore compound uses united states quantitative information total volume chlorfenvinphos really used pesticide united states elsewhere since uses chemical united states canceled use likely declined although data showing trend international regulations exist use chlorfenvinphos although standards guidelines set protect people possible harmful effects toxin regulation exists inhalation exposure multiple minimal risk levels mrl estimated oral exposure data developed lowest observed adverse effect levels loael test rats based adverse neurological effects acute oral mrl established mgkgday chronic mrl established somewhat lower mgkgday furthermore chlorfenvinphos one chemicals regulated emergency planning community righttoknow act means owners operators certain facilities manufacture import process otherwise use chemical obligated report annual release chemical environmental however use chlorfenvinphos banned european union united states europe banned plant protection product exception switzerland chlorfenvinphos still allowed use crops certain vegetables brand name birlane australia chlorfenvinphos partially banned thus withdrawn alfalfa potatoes mushrooms still used veterinary medicine combating ectoparasites chlorfenvinphos first introduced united states shell international chemical company ltd ciba ag cibageigy ag allied chemical corporation main use insecticide acaricide used control insect pests livestock household pests flies fleas since first application many manufacturers included chlorfenvinphos products common trade names birlane dermaton sapercon steladone since however information current production chlorfenvinphos conflicting one source lists base producers compound american cyanamid however producers chlorfenvinphos identified directory chemical producers united states moreover registered uses compound pesticide united states since chlorfenvinphos produced reaction triethylphosphite acetophenone production process z e isomers formed ratio ze technical grade material therefore contains unfortunately data available toxics release inventory tri database total environment releases compound facilities mainly chlorfenvinphos considered dangerous toxin early therefore chlorfenvinphos one compounds facilities required report toxic release chlorfenvinphos commonly absorbed body either ingestion food products treated pesticide dermal absorption though latter much less efficient absorbed chlorfenvinphos widely distributed throughout body detected variety bodily however organophosphorus compound accumulate well tissues first important step metabolism chlorfenvinphos humans accomplished enzyme cytochrome liver microsomes enzyme facilitates oxidative dealkylation compound acetaldehyde vinylethylhydrogen phosphate latter quickly breaks acetophenone acetophenone reduced alcohol conjugated glutathione excretion chlorfenvinphos fairly rapid rats administered dose excreted days mostly toxicity chlorfenvinphos primarily caused inhibition cholinesterase activity chlorfenvinphos reacts acetylcholine binding sites enzymes hydrolyze acetylcholine thereby preventing catalysis reaction reaction phosphorylation reversible phosphorylated enzymes undergo conformational changes additional reactions however prevent dephosphorylation aging results irreversible inhibition acetylcholine neurotransmitter nervous system targets muscarinic nicotinic receptors receptors central nervous system receptors used pass action potential across synaptic cleft neurons inhibition acetylcholinesterase enzymes results accumulation acetylcholine receptors leads continuous excessive stimulation neurons respond acetylcholine cholinergic poisoning leads different symptoms depending part nervous system affected likely cause death chlorfenvinphos respiratory failure due paralysis toxic effects accumulation acetylcholine divided three categories based upon actions different parts nervous system muscarinic receptors respond acetylcholine found smooth muscles heart exocrine glands muscarinic symptoms cholinergic poisoning therefore tightness chest wheezing due bronchoconstriction bradycardia miosis increased salivation lacrimation sweating increased peristalsis leads nausea vomiting diarrhea nicotinic receptors responding acetylcholine found skeletal muscle autonomic ganglia nicotinic symptoms cholinergic poisoning therefore fatigue involuntary twitching muscular weakness hypertension hyperglycemia symptoms accumulation acetylcholine central nervous system diverse include tension anxiety ataxia convulsions depression respiratory circulatory centers acute toxicity chlorfenvinphos varies widely species oral values range mgkg rats mgkg though direct data acute toxicity humans available vitro study detoxification chlorfenvinphos shown human liver enzymes almost effective rabbits oral prolonged exposure chlorfenvinphos observed decrease plasma erythrocyte cholinesterase activity significant genotoxicity carcinogenicity teratogenicity reported basis noael mgkg observed rats acceptable daily intake humans mgkg traces unchanged chlorfenvinphos polar metabolites detected animals exposed chlorfenvinphos small amounts used prove chlorfenvinphos exposure occurred method analysis noninvasive another method assess chlorfenvinphos exposure measure activity cholinesterases blood two pools cholinesterases exist blood acetylcholinesterase erythrocytes pseudocholinesterase plasma acetylcholinesterase erythrocytes identical acetylcholinesterase found neuromuscular tissue function plasma pseudocholinesterase unknown activity considered sensitive biomarker organophosphate exposure erythrocyte cholinesterase activity inhibition individual cholinesterases inhibition combined activity used marker exposure however cholinesterase inhibition caused anticholinesterase compounds therefore specific biomarker chlorfenvinphos addition activity cholinesterases blood varies populations studies measured correlation chlorfenvinphos exposure cholinesterase inhibition suggestions chlorfenvinphos metabolites would better biomarker exposure cholinesterase activity combination analysis reductions cholinesterase activity blood symptoms organophosphate poisoning used identify victims organophosphate poisoning symptoms specific
