called tumors produce excessive growth hormone compress surrounding brain tissues grow larger cases may compress optic nerves expansion tumor may cause headaches visual disturbances addition compression surrounding normal pituitary tissue alter production hormones leading changes menstruation breast discharge women impotence men reduced testosterone marked variation rates gh production

associated insulin cases reported due minoxidil unusually high also caused selective post receptor defect insulin signalling leading impairment metabolic preservation mitogenic goals treatment reduce gh production normal levels thereby reversing ameliorating signs symptoms acromegaly relieve pressure growing pituitary tumor exerts surrounding brain areas preserve normal pituitary function currently treatment options include surgical removal tumor drug therapy radiation therapy pituitarycitation needed primary current medical treatment acromegaly use somatostatin analogues octreotide sandostatin lanreotide somatuline somatostatin analogues synthetic forms brain hormone somatostatin stops gh production longacting forms drugs must injected every weeks effective treatment people acromegaly respond medication many people acromegaly gh levels fall within one hour headaches improve within minutes injection octreotide lanreotide effective longterm treatment octreotide lanreotide also used successfully treat people acromegaly caused nonpituitary tumorscitation needed somatostatin analogues also sometimes used shrink large tumors octreotide inhibits gastrointestinal pancreatic function longterm use causes digestive problems loose stools nausea gas one third people addition approximately percent people acromegaly develop gallstones usually cases octreotide treatment cause diabetes due fact somatostatin analogues inhibit release insulincitation needed aggressive adenoma able operated may resistance octreotide case second generation ssa pasireotide may used tumor control however insulin glucose levels carefully monitored pasireotide associated hyperglycemia reducing insulin unresponsive somatostatin analogues otherwise contraindicated possible treat using one dopamine agonists bromocriptine cabergoline tablets rather injections cost considerably less drugs also used adjunct somatostatin analogue therapy effective whose pituitary tumours cosecrete prolactin side effects dopamine agonists include gastrointestinal upset nausea vomiting lightheadedness standing nasal congestion side effects reduced eliminated medication started low dose bedtime taken food gradually increased full therapeutic dose bromocriptine lowers gh levels reduces tumor size fewer half people acromegaly people report improvement symptoms although gh levels still elevatedcitation needed latest development medical treatment acromegaly use growth hormone receptor antagonists available member family pegvisomant somavert blocking action endogenous growth hormone molecules compound able control disease activity acromegaly virtually everyone acromegaly pegvisomant administered subcutaneously daily injections combinations longacting somatostatin analogues weekly injections pegvisomant seem equally effective daily injections pegvisomantcitation needed surgical removal pituitary tumor usually effective lowering growth hormone levels two surgical procedures available use first endonasal transsphenoidal surgery involves surgeon reaching pituitary incision nasal cavity wall wall reached passing nostrils microsurgical instruments second method transsphenoidal surgery incision made gum beneath upper lip incisions made cut septum reach nasal cavity pituitary located endonasal transsphenoidal surgery less invasive procedure shorter recovery time older method transsphenoidal surgery likelihood removing entire tumor greater reduced side effects consequently endonasal transsphenoidal surgery common surgical choicecitation needed procedures normally relieve pressure surrounding brain regions lead lowering gh levels surgery successful people blood gh levels ngml operation pituitary tumors larger mm diameter success depends skill experience surgeon success rate also depends level gh defined cure best measure surgical success normalization gh levels ideally gh less ngml oral glucose load review gh levels people worldwide immediately surgery revealed random gh levels ngml complications surgery may include cerebrospinal fluid leaks meningitis damage surrounding normal pituitary tissue requiring lifelong pituitary hormone replacementcitation needed even surgery successful hormone levels return normal people must carefully monitored years possible recurrence commonly hormone levels may improve return completely normal people may require additional treatment usually medicationscitation needed radiation therapy used primary treatment combined surgery drugs usually reserved people tumor remaining surgery people often also receive medication lower gh levels radiation therapy given divided doses four six weeks treatment lowers gh levels percent years people monitored years show significant improvement radiation therapy causes gradual loss production pituitary hormones time loss vision brain injury reported rare complications radiation treatmentscitation needed initial treatment chosen individualized depending persons characteristics age tumor size tumor yet invaded surrounding brain tissues removal pituitary adenoma experienced neurosurgeon usually first choice surgery person must monitored longterm increasing gh levelscitation needed surgery normalize hormone levels relapse occurs doctor usually begin additional drug therapy current first choice generally octreotide lanreotide however bromocriptine cabergoline cheaper easier administer medications longterm therapy necessary withdrawal lead rising gh levels tumor reexpansioncitation needed radiation therapy generally used people whose tumors completely removed surgery people good candidates surgery health problems people respond adequately surgery medicationcitation needed life expectancy people acromegaly dependent early disease life expectancy successful treatment early disease equal general acromegaly often go years diagnosis resulting poorer outcome suggested better growth hormone controlled better upon successful surgical treatment headaches visual symptoms tend one exception sleep apnea present around cases tend resolve successful treatment growth hormone hypertension complication cases typically responds well regular regimens blood pressure diabetes occurs acromegaly treated typical medications successful lowering growth hormone levels often alleviates symptoms hypogonadism without gonad destruction reversible
