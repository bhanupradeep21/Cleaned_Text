epigenetics chronic pain study epigenetic modifications genes affect development maintenance chronic pain chromatin modifications found affect neural function synaptic plasticity memory formation important mechanisms chronic pain adults dealt chronic epigenetics provide new perspective biological mechanisms potential treatments chronic pain chronic pain often caused peripheral tissue inflammation nerve tissue damage chronic pain variety causes one potential cause production pain windup increase pain intensity response persistent activation pain signals persistent pain reduces threshold feel pain time amplifies pain response site injury surrounding around million adults chronic pain us economic loss caused chronic pain around million dollars chronic pain accompanying chronic health conditions take physical mental toll suffer rates depression shown higher people chronic pain found highly comorbid treatment predominantly two options opioids antiinflammatory drugs drugs target side effects chronic pain help manage pain however dont address root cause pain often bad side effects risk substance abuse example opioids beneficial harmful others adverse effects opioids include impaired immune system physical dependence overdose understanding epigenetic modifications associated chronic pain potentially help identify biological mechanism development inform future treatment plans epigenetic alterations involve lasting changes gene expression without changes dna sequence instead due chemical modification persistent addition chromatin enhance suppress gene
