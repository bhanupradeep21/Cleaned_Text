paroxysmal dyskinesias pd group movement disorders characterized attacks hyperkinesia intact paroxysmal dyskinesia rare disorder however number individuals affects remains unclear three different subtypes pd include paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia pkd paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia pnkd paroxysmal exerciseinduced dyskinesia ped neurological diseases similar symptoms pd epilepsy parkinsons different subtypes make accurate quick diagnosis pd challenging thus pd often reported misdiagnosed making difficult accurately study prevalence human populations onset pd usually late childhood early adolescence new drug regimens help treat symptoms pd cure disorder known movement disorders classified three main types based triggers duration frequency attacks characterized attacks involuntary movements dystonia chorea ballism typically triggered sudden voluntary movements also triggered involuntary movements well example hyperventilating voluntary movements usually involve whole body activity standing walking running age onset typically childhood early adolescence cases reporting improvement complete remission attacks last seconds minutes known higher risk occurring stress fear cold heat menstruation similar pkd characterizing episodic movement disorder triggered voluntary movements attacks pnkd spontaneous last hours days autosomal dominant disorder passing nearly offspring predisposing factors include stress excitement alcoholic beverages tea beverages caffeine extremely rare type paroxysmal dyskinesia characterized sudden involuntary dystonic movements often including repetitive twisting motions painful posturing attacks triggered exercise physical exertion usually last minutes hour attacks usually appear body part exercised exerted period time perhaps symptoms pkd varied case case however typically consist involuntary movements contractile movements include dystonia chorea athetosis ballism example attacks characterized sudden unilateral stiffness upper lower limbs followed involuntary extrarotation arm leg another frequently occurring symptom presence aura attack sensations manifest several forms usually described tingling target single limb frequently affected area however possible attack affect one limb one limb affected two limbs usually unilateral side even though cases bilateral opposite sides symptoms also another frequently affected area torso pkd patients twisting attacks experienced pkd patients typically last less however longer attacks also occur distinguish pkd epilepsy patients typically retain consciousness attacks able recall attacks even ended despite retaining consciousness patients usually incapable speech attack may experience great pain affected frequency attacks vary greatly patients noted hundreds attacks per day others go months without attacks consist dystonia chorea athetosis like pkd mostly limbs usually unilateral asymmetric sets pnkd apart pkd attacks last anywhere four minutes four hours shorter longer attacks reported well attacks also affect limbs usually unilaterally bilateral symptoms also experienced pnkd patients usually report presence aura attack well however usually different pkd patients aura varies typically felt target limb another frequently noted aura dizziness pnkd patients experience attacks last much longer pkd attacks vary length last anywhere four minutes four hours similar difference length attacks intervals attacks much longer interval pnkd patients attacks one day several ped attacks characterized multiple ways one distinguishing characteristic ped patients typically experience longer durations dystonia attacks frequent target attacks legs bilaterally rather unilateral attacks also known affect upper half body well cases patients attacks affected posturing neck usually indicative aura symptom prior ped attack nature onset attacks duration frequency ped attacks fall pkd pnkd attacks relieved rest typically

auralike sensation attack occurs unlike pkd pnkd attacks usually last minutes occur day physical examination brain imaging examinations show normal results eeg shows specific abnormalities ped rarest paraoxysmal dyskinesia subtype pkd patients usually show good response anticonvulsants commonly used medications sodium blockers carbamazepine phenytoin drugtesting study patients reported decreasing response latter use anticonvulsants switched carbamazepine refraining established triggers sudden movement shown lessen attacks occurrences avoidance predisposing factors stress excitement fatigue also help manage attacks treatment pknd difficult paroxysmal dyskinesias majority patients experience relief low dosages clonazepam muscle relaxant anticonvulsant similar pkd avoidance stress excitement fatigue lower frequency pnkd attacks many patients also avoid known methyglyoxal containing foods beverages alcohol coffee tea chocolate ped patients usually avoid prolonged continuous exertion prevent occurrence attacks use anticonvulsants benzodiazepines show little success ped patients cases shown patients able lessen attacks high carbohydrate snack new approach managing ped
