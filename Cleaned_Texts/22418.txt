affect displays verbal nonverbal displays affect displays facial expressions gestures body language volume tone voice laughing crying etc affect displays altered faked one may appear one way feel another eg smiling sad affect conscious nonconscious discreet display positive emotions smiling laughing etc termed positive affect displays negative emotions crying tense gestures respectively termed negative affect affect important psychology well communication mostly comes interpersonal communication nonverbal communication psychology communication multitude theories explain affect impact humans quality life affect taken indicate instinctual reaction stimulation occurring typical cognitive processes considered necessary formation complex emotion robert b zajonc asserts reaction stimuli primary human beings dominant reaction lower organisms zajonc suggests affective reactions occur without extensive perceptual cognitive encoding made sooner greater confidence cognitive hand considers affect postcognitive affect elicited certain amount cognitive processing information accomplished view affective reaction liking disliking evaluation experience pleasure displeasure based prior cognitive process variety content discriminations made features identified examined value weighted divergence narrow reinforcement model emotion allows perspectives affect influences emotional development thus temperament cognitive development socialization patterns idiosyncrasies ones family subculture mutually interactive nonlinear ways example temperament highly reactive low selfsoothing infant may disproportionately affect process emotion regulation early months relation perception type nonconscious affect may separate cognitive processing environmental stimuli monohierarchy perception affect cognition considers roles arousal attentional tendencies affective evolutionary covert within sensing processing preferences discrimination emotions complex chains events triggered certain stimuli way completely describe emotion knowing components verbal reports feelings often inaccurate people may know exactly feel may feel several different emotions time also situations arise individuals attempt hide feelings believe public private events seldom coincide exactly words feelings generally ambiguous words objects events affective responses hand basic may less problematic terms assessment brewin proposed two experiential processes frame noncognitive relations various affective experiences prewired dispositions ie nonconscious processes able select total stimulus array stimuli casually relevant using criteria perceptual salience spatiotemporal cues predictive value relation data stored automatic ie subconscious processes characterized rapid relatively inflexible difficult modify requiring minimal attention occur capable activated without intention awareness p arousal basic physiological response presentation stimuli occurs nonconscious affective process takes form two control mechanisms one mobilization immobilization within human brain amygdala regulates instinctual reaction initiating arousal process either freezing individual accelerating mobilization arousal response illustrated studies focused reward systems control foodseeking researchers focused learning processes modulatory processes present encoding retrieving goal values organism seeks food anticipation reward based environmental events becomes another influence food seeking separate reward food therefore earning reward anticipating reward separate processes create excitatory influence rewardrelated cues processes dissociated level amygdala functionally integrated within larger neural systems mood like emotion affective state however emotion tends clear focus ie selfevident cause mood tends unfocused diffused mood according batson shaw oleson involves tone intensity structured set beliefs general expectations future experience pleasure pain positive negative affect future unlike instant reactions produce affect emotion change expectations future pleasure pain moods diffused unfocused thus harder cope last days weeks months even moods hypothetical constructs depicting individuals emotional state researchers typically infer existence moods variety behavioral positive affect negative affect represent independent domains emotion general population positive affect strongly linked social interaction positive negative daily events show independent relationships subjective wellbeing positive affect strongly linked social activity recent research suggests high functional support related higher levels positive exact process social support linked positive affect remains unclear process could derive predictable regularized social interaction leisure activities focus relaxation positive mood enjoyment shared activities research indicated many differences affective displays due gender gender opposed sex ones selfperception masculine feminine ie male perceive feminine female perceive masculine also argued however hormones typically determined sex greatly affect affective displays mood according studies done late early infants within first year life able begin recognizing affect displays begin mimicking displays also begin developing empathy study followed earlier studies testing fifteen month old infants arousal via pupil dilation looking positive negative displays results showed presented negative affect infants pupil dilate stay dilated longer period time compared neutral affect presented positive affect however pupil dilation much larger stays dilated shorter amount time study prove infants ability empathize others show infants recognize acknowledge positive negative displays early period seven years study done children whose mother history juvenileonset unipolar depressive disorder simply depression children cases unipolar depression person generally displays negative affect less positive affect person without depression likely show sad upset excited happy study published discovered children mothers unipolar depression lower levels positive affect compared control group even children grew older negative affect began stay children still showed consistently lower positive affect study suggests reduced pa positive affect may one source developmental vulnerability familial depression meaning family depression increases risk children developing depression reduced positive affect increases risk development knowing aspect depression might also able help prevent onset depression young children well diseases physical disabilities mental health disorders change way persons affect displays conveyed reduced affect persons emotions properly conveyed displayed physically actual change intensely truly feel emotions simply disparity emotions felt intensely conveyed disorders greatly affect persons quality life depending intense disability symptoms affected person feels emotion display flat severe little absolutely show emotions restricted blunted respectively less severe disorders involving reduced affect displays commonly include schizophrenia post traumatic stress disorder depression autism persons traumatic brain one study shown people schizophrenia experience flat affect also experience difficulty perceiving emotions healthy people facial deformities paralysis may also physically incapable displaying emotions beginning corrected though facial reanimation surgery proving successfully improve patients affect displays also bettering psychological multiple types surgeries help fix facial paralysis popular types include fixing actual nerve damage specifically damage hypoglossal nerve facial grafts nerves taken donors leg transplanted patients face damage muscular versus actual nerves muscle may transferred patients emotions displayed order elicit desired behaviors others people known display positive emotions various settings service workers often engage emotional labor strive maintain positive emotional expressions despite difficulties working conditions rude customers order conform organizational rules strategic displays always effective since detected lower customer satisfaction perhaps notable attempt feign negative emotion could seen nixons madman theory nixons administration attempted make leaders countries think nixon mad behavior irrational volatile fearing unpredictable american response leaders hostile communist bloc nations would avoid provoking united diplomatic strategy ultimately successful effectiveness strategic display depends ability expresser remain undetected may risky strategy since detected persons original intent could discovered undermining future relationship according appraisal theory emotions experience emotions preceded evaluation object significance individual individuals seen display emotions serves signal others event important thus deliberately altering emotion display toward object could used make targets strategic emotion
