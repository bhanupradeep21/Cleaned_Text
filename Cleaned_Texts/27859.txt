postcanine tooth surface area hominid specimens comparing measurements hominid species australopithecus dated lived million years ago earliest hominid genus demonstrate postcanine enlargement average

convergence compared form function teeth found many modern postcanine megadontia associated specific food material properties allows great insight diets early hominins exhibited trait postcanine megadontia commonly linked diets rich foods small chemically sealed resistant bolus formation larger teeth comparison oral cavity size breaks food particles increase effectiveness natural processes food processing occur within example large transverse dimensions corpses homo floresiensis liang bua cave flores island indonesia suggest early hominids postcanine megadontia diet great masticatory however homo evolved amount masticatory stress involved eating decreased behavioral adaptations extraoral food processing developed thus tool making liang bua corpses would comparatively smaller transverse dimensions skull meaning mascilatory functional morphology deviates greatly pleistocene megadontia works increasing ratio minimum maximum second moments area efficiency shape resist bending resistance tied whichever specific axis bending also called mandible robusticity characteristic allows much stronger mastication food however calculations made using biomechanical models necessarily perfectly predict efficiency different mandibular compositions resistance bending forces shearing also important factor mastication effectiveness resistance shear proportional cross sectional area teeth postcanine megadontia specimens cross sectional area average much larger modern hominids implies greater shear stress important genes involved development regulation tooth formation include homeobox genes shh name research suggests homeobox genes mainly responsible much variance tooth morphogenesis observed fossilized theorized tooth enlargement due several different gene mechanisms none fully understood selection acts molars premolars singular unit rather individual theories concerning selection mechanisms one theory selection acts variation molars premolars presented homeobox genes hominid another theory suggests postcanine megadontia resulted spatial reassignment homeobox genes increased postcanine tooth size simultaneously decreasing size transition megadontia normalsized post canine teeth inverse relationship brain size one hypothesis proposes inactivation gene resulted increase brain size decreased temporal muscle decrease muscle allowed brain grow might allowed early
