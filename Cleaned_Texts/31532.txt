statistics procrustes analysis form statistical shape analysis used analyse distribution set shapes name procrustes greek προκρούστης refers bandit greek mythology made victims fit bed either stretching limbs cutting mathematics shape compared another set shapes compared arbitrarily selected reference shape procrustes analysis sometimes qualified classical ordinary opposed generalized procrustes analysis gpa compares three shapes optimally determined mean shape compare shapes two objects objects must first optimally superimposed procrustes superimposition ps performed optimally translating rotating uniformly scaling objects words placement space size objects freely adjusted aim obtain similar placement size minimizing measure shape difference called procrustes distance objects sometimes called full opposed partial ps scaling performed ie size objects preserved notice full ps objects exactly coincide shape identical instance full ps two spheres different radii always coincide exactly shape conversely partial ps never coincide implies strict definition term shape geometry shape analysis performed using full ps statistical analysis based partial ps pure shape analysis sensitive shape differences also size differences full partial ps never manage perfectly match two objects different shape cube sphere right hand left hand cases full partial ps may also include reflection reflection allows instance successful possibly perfect superimposition right hand left hand thus partial ps reflection enabled preserves size allows translation rotation reflection full ps reflection enabled allows translation rotation scaling reflection optimal translation scaling determined much simpler operations see consider objects made finite number k points n dimensions
