glycoproteins cell membrane receptors virion internalized dismantled allowing viral dna migrate cell nucleus within nucleus replication viral dna transcription viral genes occurscitation needed symptomatic infection infected cells transcribe lytic viral genes host cells small number viral genes termed latencyassociated transcript lat accumulate instead fashion virus persist cell thus host indefinitely primary infection often accompanied selflimited period clinical illness longterm latency symptomfreecitation needed chromatin dynamics regulate transcription competency entire herpes virus genomes virus enters cell cellular immune response protect cell cell wrapping viral dna around histones condensing chromatin causing virus become dormant latent cells unsuccessful chromatin loosely bundled viral dna still accessible viral particles turn genes replicate using cellular machinery reactivate starting lytic reactivation latent viruses implicated number diseases eg shingles pityriasis rosea following activation transcription viral genes transitions lat multiple lytic genes lead enhanced replication virus production often lytic activation leads cell death clinically lytic activation often accompanied emergence nonspecific symptoms lowgrade fever headache sore throat malaise rash well clinical signs swollen tender lymph nodes immunological findings reduced levels natural killer cellscitation needed animal models local trauma system stress found induce reactivation latent herpesvirus infection cellular stressors like transient interruption protein synthesis hypoxia also sufficient induce viral three mammalian subfamilies alpha beta gammaherpesviridae arose approximately major sublineages within subfamilies probably generated mammalian radiation mya speciations within sublineages took place last million years probably major component cospeciation host lineagescitation needed currently known bird reptile species alphaherpesviruses although branching order herpes viruses yet resolved herpes viruses hosts tend coevolve suggestive alphaherpesviruses may earliest branchcitation needed time origin genus iltovirus estimated mya mardivirus simplex genera estimated herpesviruses known ability establish lifelong infections one way possible immune evasion herpesviruses many different ways evading immune system one way encoding protein mimicking human interleukin another downregulation major histocompatibility complex ii mhc ii infected cells research conducted cytomegalovirus cmv indicates viral human homolog important inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine synthesis protein identity one conserved residue nine amino acids make functional site cytokine synthesis inhibition however much similarity functions shown regulate ifnγ gmcsf tnfα proinflammatory cytokines also shown play role downregulating mhc mhc ii regulating hlag nonclassical mhc two events allow immune evasion suppressing cellmediated immune response natural killer cell response respectively similarities may explained fact use cell surface receptor receptor one difference function causes human peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc increase decrease proliferation whereas causes decrease proliferation pbmcs indicates may lack stimulatory effects found functions phosphorylation protein originally thought phosphorylation result jakstat pathway however despite evidence jak indeed phosphorylate inhibition significant influence cytokine synthesis inhibition another protein also found phosphorylate inhibition unlike jak inhibition significant impact cytokine synthesis difference jak phosphorylation phosphorylates residue whereas jak phosphorylates residue difference phosphorylation positions seems key factor activation leading inhibition proinflammatory cytokine synthesis fact inhibitor added cells cytokine synthesis levels significantly restored fact cytokine levels completely restored indicates another pathway activated inhibiting cytokine system synthesis proposed mechanism activates turn activates pkb akt pkb may activate mtor may target phosphorylation another one many ways herpes viruses evade immune system regulation mhc mhc ii observed almost every human herpesvirus regulation mhc mhc ii come many different mechanisms causing mhc absent cell surface discussed one way viral chemokine homolog another mechanism regulate mhcs encode viral proteins detain newly formed mhc endoplasmic reticulum er mhc reach cell surface therefore activate cell response mhcs also targeted destruction proteasome lysosome er protein tap also plays role mhc regulation viral proteins inhibit tap preventing mhc picking viral antigen peptide prevents proper folding mhc therefore mhc reach cell nine distinct viruses family known cause
