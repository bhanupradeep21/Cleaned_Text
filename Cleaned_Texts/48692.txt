smoke inhalation breathing harmful fumes produced byproducts combusting substances respiratory cause smoke inhalation injury subtype acute inhalation injury damage respiratory tract caused chemical andor heat exposure well possible systemic toxicity smoke smoke inhalation occur fires various sources residential vehicle wildfires morbidity mortality rates fire victims burns increased smoke inhalation victims smoke inhalation injury present cough difficulty breathing low oxygen saturation smoke debris andor burns smoke inhalation injury affect upper respiratory tract larynx usually due heat exposure lower respiratory tract larynx usually due exposure toxic initial treatment includes taking victim away fire smoke giving oxygen high flow face mask nonrebreather available checking victim injuries treatment smoke inhalation injury largely supportive varying degrees consensus benefits specific us fire administration reported almost million fires causing deaths almost residential fires found often cooking related resulted highest amount deaths compared fire types vehicle outdoor found men higher rates firerelated death injury women african american american indian men higher rates firerelated death injury ethnic racial groups age group highest rate death smoke inhalation people age group highest injury rate people ages reports also show increased rates death injury children due lower physical mental overall us national fire death rate people per million population injury rate people per million smoke inhalation injury common cause death fire fire victims burns body smoke inhalation injury increased mortality rate length hospital stay compared burns signs symptoms smoke inhalation injury include recent fire exposure followed cough wheezing stridor confusion difficulty breathing low oxygen saturation smoke debris especially face andor saliva burns especially face singed facial nose hairs andor hoarse careful history helpful determining fire occurred therefore chemical fumes could inhaled accompanying systemic smoke inhalation injury lead respiratory complications ranging minor major acute respiratory distress syndrome ards relatively delayed complication smoke inhalation injury caused chemical fumes inducing inflammatory response lung tissue especially small air sacs known alveoli critical gas exchange another potential complication swelling upper airway heat chemical damage become profound enough obstruct breathing onset airway swelling relatively delayed making difficult intubate later thus endotracheal intubation considered early certain possible complications include pneumonia vocal cord damage andor dysfunction tracheal stenosis usually inhalation chemical toxins produced combusting materials cause damage tissues upper larynx lower respiratory tract larynx damage lower airways air sacs lung tissue due inflammatory cascade response noxious chemicals causes variety downstream effects increased secretions exudative material thus clogging airways andor air sacs collapse air sacs atelectasis vascular permeability leading pulmonary edema fluid lungs bronchoconstriction activation coagulation cascade impaired function mucociliary inhalation hot fumes cause thermal damage tissues usually limited upper respiratory tract larynx damage location result sloughing damaged tissue swelling cause obstruction respiratory tract ulceration increased secretions redness systemic toxicity occur inhalation chemical compounds produced byproducts combustion carbon monoxide poisoning common systemic toxicity smoke inhalation cause organ failure lack oxygen often heart carbon monoxide common byproduct combusting substances fires colorless odorless much higher binding affinity hemoglobin compared oxygen thus block oxygen binding hemoglobin causing hypoxia additionally carbon monoxide decreases ability oxygen dissociate hemoglobin diffuse tissues thus causing first responders often take victim away fire smoke give oxygen high flow face mask nonrebreather available assess level consciousness check victim burns andor injuries body initial upper respiratory tract injury due heat exposure often results swelling intubation considered early given swelling slow delayed onset present make intubation lower respiratory tract injury due exposure noxious fumes often consists supportive measures intubation ventilator support indicated suctioning airways pulmonary hygiene supportive intravenous fluids mainstay treatment fire victims extensive burns body however differing perspectives risksbenefits iv fluids fire victims burns smoke inhalation injury due potential worsening pulmonary edema large amounts iv fluids typically given burn treatments differing perspectives study findings utility smoke inhalation injury include nebulized bronchodilators iv corticosteroids nebulized corticosteroids nebulized epinephrine nebulized heparin nebulized carbon monoxide poisoning initially treated high flow oxygen hyperbaric oxygen therapy considered differing views clinical benefit terms products systemic effects mainly asphyxiating gases carbon monoxide carbon monoxide со absorbed lungs diffuses capillaries dissolves plasma erythrocytes binding haemoglobin affinity times oxygen amount oxygen bound haemoglobin reduced leading addition carbon monoxide released tissue level binds mitochondrial enzyme systems resulting inability cells utilise oxygen exposed excess co one bodys natural reactions breathe faster increases co level blood eventually leading cardiac arrest cyanide ion cn enters bloodstream diffuses body binds trivalent iron mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase causing inhibition hence tissue anoxia metabolism shifts towards anaerobic metabolism leading increase lactacidemia
