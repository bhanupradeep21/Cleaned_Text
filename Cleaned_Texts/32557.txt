trypsin enzyme first section small intestine starts digestion protein molecules cutting long chains amino acids smaller pieces serine protease pa clan superfamily found digestive system many vertebrates hydrolyzes trypsin formed small intestine proenzyme form trypsinogen produced pancreas activated trypsin cuts peptide chains mainly carboxyl side amino acids lysine arginine used numerous biotechnological processes process commonly referred trypsinogen proteolysis trypsinization proteins digestedtreated trypsin said trypsin discovered wilhelm k√ºhne named ancient greek word rubbing since first isolated rubbing pancreas duodenum trypsin catalyzes hydrolysis peptide bonds breaking proteins smaller peptides peptide products hydrolyzed amino acids via proteases rendering available absorption blood stream tryptic digestion necessary step protein absorption proteins generally large absorbed lining small trypsin produced inactive zymogen trypsinogen pancreas pancreas stimulated cholecystokinin secreted first part small intestine duodenum via pancreatic duct small intestine enzyme enterokinase also called enteropeptidase activates trypsinogen trypsin proteolytic cleavage trypsin activates additional trypsin chymotrypsin carboxypeptidase enzymatic mechanism similar serine proteases enzymes contain catalytic triad consisting catalytic triad formerly called charge relay system implying abstraction protons serine histidine histidine aspartate owing evidence provided nmr resultant alkoxide form serine would much stronger pull proton imidazole ring histidine current thinking holds instead serine histidine effectively equal share proton forming short lowbarrier hydrogen bonds needed means nucleophilicity active site serine increased facilitating attack amide carbon proteolysis enzymatic reaction trypsin catalyzes thermodynamically favorable requires significant activation energy kinetically unfavorable addition trypsin contains oxyanion hole formed backbone amide hydrogen atoms hydrogen bonding stabilize negative charge accumulates amide oxygen nucleophilic attack planar amide carbon serine oxygen causes carbon assume tetrahedral geometry stabilization tetrahedral intermediate helps reduce energy barrier formation concomitant lowering free energy transition state preferential binding transition state key feature enzyme chemistry negative aspartate residue asp located catalytic pocket trypsin responsible attracting stabilizing positively charged lysine andor arginine thus responsible specificity enzyme means trypsin predominantly cleaves proteins carboxyl side cterminal side amino acids lysine arginine except either bound cterminal although largescale mass spectrometry data suggest cleavage occurs even trypsin considered endopeptidase ie cleavage occurs within polypeptide chain rather terminal amino acids located ends polypeptides human trypsin optimal operating temperature contrast atlantic cod several types trypsins poikilotherm fish survive different body temperatures cod trypsins include trypsin activity range maximal activity well trypsin range maximal activity protein trypsin various molecular weights depending source example molecular weight kda reported trypsin bovine porcine sources activity trypsin affected enzyme inhibitor tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone tpck deactivates chymotrypsin trypsin stored cold temperatures prevent autolysis may also impeded storage trypsin ph using trypsin modified reductive methylation ph adjusted back ph activity returns human genes encode proteins trypsin enzymatic activity isoforms trypsin may also found organisms activation trypsin proteolytic cleavage trypsinogen pancreas lead series events cause pancreatic selfdigestion resulting pancreatitis one consequence autosomal recessive disease cystic fibrosis deficiency transport trypsin digestive enzymes pancreas leads disorder termed meconium ileus involves intestinal obstruction ileus due overly thick meconium normally broken trypsin proteases passed trypsin available high quantity pancreases purified rather easily hence used widely various biotechnological processes tissue culture lab trypsin used resuspend cells adherent cell culture dish wall process harvesting cell types adhere sides bottom dish cultivated vitro trypsin used cleave proteins holding cultured cells dish cells removed plates trypsin also used dissociate dissected cells example prior cell fixing sorting trypsin used break casein breast milk trypsin added solution milk powder breakdown casein causes milk become translucent rate reaction measured using amount time needed milk turn translucent trypsin commonly used biological research proteomics experiments digest proteins peptides mass spectrometry analysis eg ingel digestion trypsin particularly suited since well defined specificity hydrolyzes peptide bonds carbonyl group contributed either arginine lysine residue trypsin also used dissolve blood clots microbial form treat inflammation pancreatic form veterinary medicine trypsin ingredient wound spray products debrisol dissolve dead tissue pus wounds horses cattle dogs commercial protease preparations usually consist mixture various protease enzymes often includes trypsin preparations widely used food prevent action active trypsin pancreas highly damaging inhibitors
