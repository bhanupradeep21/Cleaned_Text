turing pattern concept introduced english mathematician alan turing paper titled chemical basis morphogenesis describes patterns nature stripes spots arise naturally autonomously homogeneous uniform pattern arises due turing instability turn arises due interplay differential diffusion ie different values diffusion coefficients chemical species chemical reaction instability mechanism unforeseen pure diffusion process would anticipated stabilizing influence system turing examined behaviour system two diffusible substances interact found system able generate spatially periodic pattern even random almost uniform initial prior discovery instability mechanism arising due unequal diffusion coefficients two substances diffusional effects always presumed stabilizing influences system turing hypothesized resulting wavelike patterns chemical basis turing patterning often found combination patterns vertebrate limb development one many phenotypes exhibiting turing patterning overlapped complementary pattern case french flag turing yakov zeldovich discovered instability mechanism connection cellular structures observed lean hydrogen zeldovich explained cellular structure consequence hydrogens diffusion coefficient larger thermal diffusion coefficient combustion literature turing instability referred instability original theory theory morphogenesis served important model theoretical systems attracted much interest prototype model pattern formation patterns fronts hexagons spirals stripes dissipative solitons found solutions turinglike turing proposed model wherein two homogeneously distributed substances p interact produce stable patterns morphogenesis patterns represent regional differences concentrations two substances interactions would produce ordered structure
