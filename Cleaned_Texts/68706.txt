vertebral augmentation including vertebroplasty kyphoplasty refers similar percutaneous spinal procedures bone cement injected small hole skin fractured vertebra order relieve back pain caused vertebral compression fracture decades medical research efficacy safety vertebral augmentation still lack consensus regarding certain aspects vertebroplasty kyphoplasty vertebroplasty kyphoplasty two common procedures spinal augmentation medical terms classical compounds suffix plasty meaning molding shaping surgically ancient greek plast√≥s molded formed prefixes vertebro vertebra latin vertebra joint joint spine kypho humped stooping forward ancient greek kyphos vertebroplasty typically performed spine surgeon interventional radiologist minimally invasive procedure patients usually go home next day procedure patients given local anesthesia light sedation procedure though performed using local anesthetic patients medical problems tolerate sedatives well procedure bone cement injected biopsy needle collapsed fractured vertebra needle placed fluoroscopic xray guidance cement commonly poly methyl methacrylate pmma although modern cements used well quickly hardens forms support structure within vertebra provide stabilization strength needle makes small puncture patients skin easily covered small bandage kyphoplasty variation vertebroplasty attempts restore height angle kyphosis fractured vertebra certain types followed stabilization using injected bone cement procedure typically includes use small balloon inflated vertebral body create void within cancellous bone
