achromatopsia also known rod monochromacy medical syndrome exhibits symptoms relating five conditions notably monochromacy historically name referred monochromacy general typically refers autosomal recessive congenital color vision condition term also used describe cerebral achromatopsia though monochromacy usually common symptom conditions include monochromatic color blindness poor visual acuity dayblindness syndrome also present incomplete form exhibits milder symptoms including residual color vision achromatopsia estimated affect live births worldwide five symptoms associated achromatopsia syndrome typically first noticed children around six months age due photophobia nystagmus nystagmus becomes less noticeable age symptoms syndrome become relevant school age approaches
