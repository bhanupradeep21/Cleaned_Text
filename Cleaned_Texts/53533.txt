organizational ambidexterity refers organizations ability efficient management todays business also adaptable coping tomorrows changing demand ambidextrous means able use left right hand equally organizational ambidexterity requires organizations use exploration exploitation techniques successful organizational ambidexterity defined organizations ability aligned efficient management todays business demands well adaptive changes environment term organizational ambidexterity first used however credited developing generating greater interest concept especially late early century ambidexterity organization achieved balancing exploration exploitation allows organization creative adaptable also continuing rely traditional proven methods exploration includes things search variation risk taking experimentation flexibility discovery innovation whereas exploitation includes things refinement choice production efficiency selection implementation companies focus exploration face risk wasting resources ideas may prove useful never developed hand companies focus exploitation may accept status quo performance products fail reach optimal levels success organizational ambidexterity defined broadly several terms also highly related similar construct ambidextrous organization including organizational learning technological innovation organizational adaptation strategic management organizational design things reconciling exploitation exploration simultaneity induced autonomous strategy processes synchronizing incremental discontinuous innovation balancing search stability also tend refer underlying construct ambidextrous studies structural behavioral mechanisms affect organizational ambidexterity studies ambidextrous organizational designs affect organizational ambidexterity whereas earlier studies structural behavioral mechanisms regarded tradeoffs exploration exploitation insurmountable recent research paid attention range organizational solutions engender existence ambidexterity one recent hot research topic area focused leadership characteristics enable organizations manage contradictions face achieve origin concept ambidextrous leadership several antecedents outcomes organizational ambidexterity well related moderators also identified studies structural behavioral mechanisms studies ambidextrous organizations take organization unit analysis ambidextrous organizing conceptualized simultaneous pursuit combination incremental discontinuous innovation ambidextrous organizations needed failure balance exploitation exploration overcome ability pursue simultaneously incremental discontinuous innovation results hosting multiple contradictory structures processes cultures tushman oreilly page empirically found competence exploitation negatively related radical innovation performance whereas effect competence exploration positive competence exploration valuable firm matched lower levels competence exploitation vice theorized ambidextrous organization solve tension alignment adaptability allows coping tension different types alignment order produce incremental discontinuous innovation ambidextrous organizations alternate exploration exploitation theres work empirically investigates processes ambidextrous organizing analyzing implementation ambidextrous organizations concept order study whether evidence companies applying concepts suggested ambidextrous organizations proponents actually manage processes exploitation organizational ambidexterity considered primarily two angles one architectural structural ambidexterity uses dual organizational structures strategies differentiate efforts towards exploitation structural ambidexterity includes dual parts one part focusing exploitation focusing exploration also known spatial separation dual strategies concepts outlined approach contextual ambidexterity uses behavioral social means integrate exploitation exploration organizational unit contextual ambidexterity balanced type takes midlevel position exploitation exploration also known parallel structures hybrid strategies although angles related theme organizational ambidexterity strongly differ way configured always debate two different approaches right dual type allows discrete orientations fit across dimensions unit level creates misfit organizational units researchers argued inconsistent structures may lead low also researchers trying investigate external internal contingencies different configurations found one factor would speed type technological change organizations confront hand balanced type ie contextual ambidexterity consistent systems approach fit across multiple contradicts opinion organizational choice environment changes slow sufficient time react radical changes constructing dual structures strategies however highcompetitive environment balanced structures may better prepared deal constant need future studies different organizational ambidexterity configurations compared find better solution dealing exploitation exploration paradox ambidexterity often considered capacity skill therefore facilitated managers ceos top structural ambidexteritys view organizations solve paradox temporarily cycling periods exploitation periods point view contextual ambidexterity firms ought address exploitation exploration simultaneously internally achieve goal contextual ambidexterity difficult achieve structural ambidexterity managing two inconsistent alignments within organization simultaneously far complex managing one consistent strategy thus studies build ambidextrous organizations literature focused contextual ambidexterity rather structural ambidexterity role leaders managers always highlighted towards building ambidextrous organization several recommendations made organizations achieve contextual ambidexterity including using metaroutines jobenrichment building trust using complex behavioral creation shared gender balanced executive teams addition several characteristics organizational culture also emphasized building ambidextrous organization successful organizations able balance hard elements discipline stretch soft elements support trust organizational also suggested establishing shared goals developing collective identity creating culture support giving personal meaning individuals contributions overall purpose organization contributes decentralized culture excellence recruitment also important aspects establishing ambidextrous organization ambidexterity beneficial organizations many aspects ability keep balance explorative exploitative processes core outcome ambidexterity innovation innovation needs explorative exploitative aspects innovation defined sequence activities new element introduced social unit intention benefiting unit part wider society west farr new element need entirely novel unfamiliar members unit must involve discernible change challenge status quo west farr theoretical models innovation differentiate least two processes idea generation idea implementation eg amabile west generation phase closely linked explorative activities implementation phase highly linked exploitative activities ambidextrous organization able pursue innovation creating new productsservices also maintaining continued use proven addition ambidexterity promote positive organizational outcomes besides innovation proved literature interaction explorative exploitative innovation strategies words ambidexterity positively related sales growth rate imbalance explorative exploitative innovation strategies negatively related sales growth rate wong various organizations able overcome organizational challenges become innovative ambidexterity study looking businesses found ambidexterity highly correlated similarly another study hightech organizations showed ability simultaneously execute exploration exploitation associated higher performance chandrasekaran et al companies apple general radio nordstrom british airways continued success throughout years capacity ambidexterity british airways experienced increased profits customer satisfaction top executives credited formation ambidextrous culture leadership companys improved moderators exist relationship organizational ambidexterity organizational outcomes environmental dynamism competitiveness moderate relationship exploitation exploration performance levinthal march lewin long carroll empirical studies also showed pursuing exploratory innovation effective dynamic environments whereas pursuing exploitative innovation beneficial units financial performance competitive environments jansen van den bosch volberda although directly testing ambidextrous orientation results indicated positive performance effect simultaneously pursuing exploitative exploratory innovation high dynamic competitive environments effects exploitative explorative balanced corporate alignment activities performance compared varying environmental conditions raisch hotz construct environmental munificence developed reflect organizations opportunities dynamism zahra found although exploration positively related performance high environmental munificence balanced orientation failed significantly affect performance times low environmental munificence raisch hotz market orientation also proved moderate relationship exploitationexploration performance market orientation defined capability generate disseminate respond intelligence pertaining current future customers kohli jaworski longitudinal study kyriakopoulos moorman showed market orientation positively moderates impact pursuing high levels exploitative exploratory marketing strategies new product performance however firms pursue ambidextrous orientation without strong market orientation display significant reduction new product financial performance another factor may moderate ambidexteritys effect performance firm resources kyriakopoulos moorman firms rich resources ability exploit explore simultaneously whereas firms less resources may able afford complex strategy similarly lubatkin et stated small firms lack amount slack resources kind hierarchical administration systems help impede larger firms managing contradictory knowledge processes thus affect attainment ambidexterity p idea supported empirical evidence small firms may benefit onesided orientation mixed strategies ebben johnson boundary conditions also addressed choosing structural contextual ambidexterity example spatial separation suggested appropriate solution environments characterized long periods stability disrupted rare events discontinuous research also found firms operating dynamic competitive environments rely contextual ambidexterity rather developing spatially separated units jansen van den bosch volberda functional definition ambidexterity originally used describe organizations recently concept extended multiple organizational levels including individuals teams leaders general level concept ambidexterity implies successfully managing dichotomy explorative variability creation exploitative variability reduction whenever needs explorative exploitive conflict occurs bledow frese anderson erez farr thats ambidexterity necessary actually regulating

behaviors foster exploration closing leader behaviors foster exploitation temporal flexibility switch situation requires rosing et al opening leadership behaviors include allowing multiple ways accomplish task experimentation errors whereas closing behaviors include monitoring routines sticking plans minimizing errors rosing et al model leadership innovation shown figure scholars well practitioners argued established companies simply lack flexibility explore new one contributing reason could socalled success trap ie focus historically successful current business activities walrave van oorschot romme possible solution big companies adopt venture capital model funding exploratory expeditions otherwise interfering much operations another suggestion use crossfunctional teams achieve breakthrough innovations still others suggested company may able alternate different organizational models focusing exploitation exploration different time periods example study biotechnology firms shown organizations management control system adjusted periodically achieve changing focus exploitation researchers also debate ambidexterity attained exploration exploitation tend emerge contradictory information knowledge inputs success due explorationexploitation tends selfreinforcing leading use methods empirical study ambidexterity organizations wong cautions low levels exploration exploitation sufficient contribute superior firm performance high firm performance may however need sustained continuous exploitation market side business model innovation technology ambidexterity also hampered employee desire receive organizational rewards organizations base evaluation reward systems completion routine tasks employees likely conform standardized avoid hindering
