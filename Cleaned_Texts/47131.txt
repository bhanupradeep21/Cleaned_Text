psoriatic arthritis psa longterm inflammatory arthritis occurs people affected autoimmune disease classic feature psoriatic arthritis swelling entire fingers toes sausagelike appearance sausage often happens association changes nails small depressions nail pitting thickening nails detachment nail skin changes consistent psoriasis eg red scaly itchy plaques frequently occur onset psoriatic arthritis psoriatic arthritis precede rash affected classified type seronegative spondyloarthropathy genetics thought strongly involved development psoriatic obesity certain forms psoriasis thought increase psoriatic arthritis affects people psoriasis occurs children approximately individuals psoriatic arthritis condition less common people asian african descent affects men women pain swelling stiffness one joints commonly present psoriatic psoriatic arthritis inflammatory affected joints generally red warm asymmetrical oligoarthritis defined inflammation affecting two four joints first six

onycholysis hyperkeratosis nails horizontal psoriasis classically presents scaly skin lesions commonly seen extensor surfaces scalp natal cleft umbilicus psoriatic arthritis pain occur area sacrum lower back result sacroiliitis spondylitis present cases pain occur around feet ankles especially enthesitis achilles tendon inflammation achilles tendon inserts bone plantar fasciitis sole along abovenoted pain inflammation extreme exhaustion go away adequate rest exhaustion may last days weeks without abatement psoriatic arthritis may remain mild may progress destructive joint disease periods active disease flares typically alternate periods remission severe forms psoriatic arthritis may progress arthritis xray gives pencilincup prolonged inflammation lead joint damage early diagnosis treatment slow prevent joint damage psoriatic arthritis inheritable polygenic disease many genes known theorized contribute clinical presentation lack thereof someone genes psoriatic arthritis comes contact certain substances substances may induce autoimmune reaction causing immune system target normal tissues body exact strength location clinical effects reaction depend genes involved individual substance triggers reaction typically genomic analysis identified several genes involved patients notably genes related class mhc including genes relating immune system central tolerance may also involved interleukin receptor genes thematically genes often identify human tissues normal healthy genes immune cells designed recognize identifiers genes functioning abnormally immune system higher risk attacking normal bone cells osteoclasts theorized involved patients psoriatic arthritis contrast people psoriasis whose bone cells significantly involved health environmental factors known associated psoriatic arthritis definitive test diagnose psoriatic arthritis symptoms psoriatic arthritis may closely resemble diseases including rheumatoid arthritis rheumatologist physician specializing autoimmune diseases may use physical examinations health history blood tests xrays accurately diagnose psoriatic arthritis factors contribute diagnosis psoriatic arthritis

psoriatic underlying process psoriatic arthritis inflammation therefore treatments directed reducing controlling inflammation firstline initial treatment patients tnf inhibitortype biological diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug biologics also called biological response modifiers class therapeutics developed using recombinant dna technology biologic medications derived living cells cultured laboratory unlike traditional dmards affect entire immune system biologics target specific parts immune system given injection intravenous iv infusion biologics prescribed psoriatic arthritis tnfα inhibitors including infliximab etanercept golimumab certolizumab pegol adalimumab well inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor risankizumab biologics may increase risk minor serious rarely may associated nervous system disorders blood disorders certain types cancercitation needed typically medications first prescribed psoriatic arthritis nsaids ibuprofen naproxen followed potent nsaids like diclofenac indomethacin etodolac nsaids irritate stomach intestine longterm use lead gastrointestinal coxibs inhibitors eg celecoxib etoricoxib associated statistically significant relative risk reduction gastrointestinal ulcers bleeding complications compared traditional nsaids carry increased rate cardiovascular events myocardial infarction mi heart attack inhibitors nonselective nsaids potential adverse effects include damage kidneys oral small molecules methotrexate leflunomide cyclosporin azathioprine sulfasalazine used persistent symptomatic cases without exacerbation rather reducing pain inflammation class drugs helps slow halt progression disease therefore limit amount joint damage occurs dmards act slowly may take weeks even months take full according recent cochrane review low dose oral methotrexate slightly effective immunosuppressant drugs also reduce psoriasis skin symptoms lead liver kidney problems increased risk serious infectioncitation needed firstinclass treatment
