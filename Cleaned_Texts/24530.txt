institute biomedical research cambridge research till early rudolf jaenisch helped specialize pluripotent stem cell research induced pluripotent stem cell postdoctoral research whitehead institute hanna focused studying embryonic stem cells escs epigenetic reprogramming somatic cells esclike cells called induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs developed transgenic mouse models address problems stem cell research utilized previous clinical knowledge phd training immunology provide first evidence ipscs could used blood genetic disease like sickle cell anemia combined gene cell therapy approach supervisor jaenisch awarded masri prize wolf prize research innovation citation read demonstration ips cells used cure genetic disease mammal thus establishing therapeutic hanna made scientific contributions understanding ipsc phenomenon early days developed novel doxycyclineinducible reprogrammable mouse transgenic models drug controlled expression yamanaka reprogramming factors technique allowed create reprogrammed b lymphocytes carrying endogenous genetic rearrangements bcell receptor bcr ipscs thus providing definitive proof feasibility reprogramming terminally differentiated b cells ipscs carried original genetic rearrangement mark scientists broad institute harvard hanna utilized reprogrammable mouse system conduct first depth integrative epigenomic

reprogramming factors originally described shinya yamanaka stochastic process low one rate limiting step stochastic ips formation efficiency directly increased accelerating cell proliferation april hanna joined department molecular genetics weizmann institute science israel assistant professor independent group leader ever awarded promotion tenure weizmann institute set laboratory pluripotent stem cell studies ex utero initially group identified number key epigenetic regulators influencing ipsc derivation efficiency role demethylase utx ips first demonstrated deterministic reprogramming efficiencies within days via optimized depletion core memberaxis nurd corepressor latter work set stage others show alternative methods obtain deterministic reprogramming example thomas graf group showed transient activation cebpα previously highlighted hanna jaenisch booster b cell yield deterministic ipsc reprogramming b cells within hanna also identified sumoylation linker major determinant transition totipotency naïve pluripotency states hanna team also tackled pathways resolve naive pluripotency programs delineated critical function rna methylation stem cell transitions periimplantation mouse development study published science provided first evidence absolute essentiality mrna epigenetic layer mammalian embryo viability uncovered opposing tolerance epigenetic repressor depletion naive primed cells hanna later used optimize naive conditions humans since naive cells tolerate genetic ablation rna dna methylation deposited maintained enzymes hanna used latter property screen conditions allow survival human pluripotent cells without enzymes termed conditions human enhanced naive stem cell media hannas lab also focused deciphering principles regulating naive
