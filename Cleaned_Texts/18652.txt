growth medium culture medium solid liquid semisolid designed support growth population microorganisms cells via process cell small plants like moss physcomitrella different types media used growing different types two major types growth media used cell culture use specific cell types derived plants animals used microbiological culture used growing microorganisms bacteria fungi common growth media microorganisms nutrient broths agar plates specialized media sometimes required microorganism cell culture organisms termed fastidious organisms require specialized environments due complex nutritional requirements viruses example obligate intracellular parasites require growth medium containing living cells common growth media microorganisms nutrient broths liquid nutrient medium lysogeny broth medium liquid media often mixed agar poured via sterile media dispenser petri dishes solidify agar plates provide solid medium microbes may cultured remain solid bacteria able decompose agar exception species genera cytophaga flavobacterium bacillus pseudomonas alcaligenes bacteria grown liquid cultures often form colloidal difference growth media used cell culture used microbiological culture cells derived whole organisms grown culture often grow without addition instance hormones growth factors usually occur case animal cells difficulty often addressed addition blood serum synthetic serum replacement medium case microorganisms limitations exist often unicellular organisms one major difference animal cells culture often grown flat surface attach medium provided liquid form covers cells contrast bacteria escherichia coli may grown solid liquid media important distinction growth media types defined versus undefined defined medium known quantities ingredients microorganisms consist providing trace elements vitamins required microbe especially defined carbon nitrogen sources glucose glycerol often used carbon sources ammonium salts nitrates inorganic nitrogen sources undefined medium complex ingredients yeast extract casein hydrolysate consist mixture many chemical species unknown proportions undefined media sometimes chosen based price sometimes necessity microorganisms never cultured defined media good example growth medium wort used make beer wort contains nutrients required yeast growth anaerobic conditions alcohol produced fermentation process complete combination medium dormant microbes beer ready consumption main types culture media contain elements bacteria need growth selective used general cultivation maintenance bacteria kept laboratory culture collections undefined medium also known basal complex medium contains undefined medium aminoacid source contains variety compounds exact composition unknown defined medium also known chemically defined medium synthetic medium medium examples nutrient media defined medium enough ingredients support growth called minimal medium number ingredients must added minimal medium varies enormously depending microorganism minimal media contain minimum nutrients possible colony growth generally without presence amino acids often used microbiologists geneticists grow wildtype microorganisms minimal media also used select recombinants exconjugants minimal medium typically contains supplementary minimal media minimal media also contains single selected agent usually amino acid sugar supplementation allows culturing specific lines auxotrophic recombinants selective media used growth selected microorganisms example microorganism resistant certain antibiotic ampicillin tetracycline antibiotic added medium prevent cells possess resistance growing media lacking amino acid proline conjunction e coli unable synthesize commonly used geneticists emergence genomics map bacterial chromosomes selective growth media also used cell culture ensure survival proliferation cells certain properties antibiotic resistance ability synthesize certain metabolite normally presence specific gene allele gene confers upon cell ability grow selective medium cases gene termed marker selective growth media eukaryotic cells commonly contain neomycin select cells successfully transfected plasmid carrying neomycin resistance gene marker gancyclovir exception rule used specifically kill cells carry respective marker herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase examples selective media differential indicator media distinguish one microorganism type another growing type media uses biochemical characteristics microorganism growing presence specific nutrients indicators neutral red phenol red eosin methylene blue added medium visibly indicate defining characteristics microorganism media used detection microorganisms molecular biologists detect recombinant strains bacteria examples differential media transport media fulfill criteria examples transport media enriched media contain nutrients required support growth wide variety organisms including fastidious ones commonly used harvest many different types microbes present specimen blood agar enriched medium nutritionally rich whole blood supplements basic nutrients chocolate agar enriched heattreated blood turns brown gives medium color choice culture medium might affect physiological relevance findings tissue culture experiments especially metabolic addition dependence cell line metabolic gene shown affected media performing study involving several cell lines utilizing uniform culture media cell lines might reduce bias generated datasets using growth medium better represents physiological levels nutrients improve physiological relevance vitro studies recently media types human plasmalike medium developed httpsenwikipediaorgwikigrowthmedium
