dna barcoding algae commonly used species identification phylogenetic studies algae form phylogenetically heterogeneous group meaning application single universal barcodemarker species delimitation unfeasible thus different markersbarcodes applied aim different algal groups diatom dna barcoding method taxonomical identification diatoms even species level conducted using dna rna followed amplification sequencing specific conserved regions diatom genome followed taxonomic assignment one main challenges identifying diatoms often collected mixture diatoms several species dna metabarcoding process identifying individual species mixed sample environmental dna also called edna dna extracted straight environment soil water samples newly applied method diatom dna metabarcoding used ecological quality assessment rivers streams specific response diatoms particular ecologic conditions species identification via morphology relatively difficult requires lot time highthroughput
