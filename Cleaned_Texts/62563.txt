jeholornis meaning jehol bird genus avialans lived approximately million years ago early cretaceous period china fossil jeholornis first discovered jiufotang formation hebei province china previously rehe province also known name additional specimens found older yixian jeholornis long tails small teeth approximately size making among largest avialans known late cretaceous diet included seeds cycads ginkgo similar plants jeholornis relatively large basal avialans maximum adult length cm ft estimated weight kg another estimation listed cm ft gr skulls short high similar basal paravians like epidexipteryx early oviraptorosaurs like incisivosaurus lower jaws short stout curved downward possibly adaptation eating jeholornis prima lacked teeth upper jaws three small teeth lower j palmapenis teeth middle upper jaw maxilla none front premaxilla upper teeth j palmapenis seem angled slightly forward basal avialans teeth three species small blunt peglike arms robust longer legs relatively welldeveloped shoulder girdles indicating strong wing musculature wishbone furcula ushaped j prima j palmapenis j curvipes fingers short compared archaeopteryx also robust lower legs particularly long indicating animals specialized first toe hallux reversed modern birds used perch trees partially reversed jeholornis species pointing inward slightly backward halluces jeholornis short claw strongly curved toes unlike deinonychosaurs mesozoic avialans claw second toe enlarged relative tail anatomy like dromaeosaurids archaeopteryx strongly interlocking vertebrae though similar number tail vertebrae jeholornis much longer overall wellpreserved tail feathers come type specimen j palmapenis study gregory erickson shown jeholornis along archaeopteryx relatively slow ontogenic development ie grew slowly compared modern birds grow quickly living kiwi birds however slow development speculated jeholornis could metabolism similar feather traces wing identified two specimens lpm j prima sdm j palmapenis first specimen shows flight feathers asymmetrical therefore aerodynamic modern flying birds centimeters long longer forearm hand exact number flight feathers determined known specimens however preservation tails several specimens preserve fan feathers rectrices tip shorter feather fan similar microraptor caudipteryx restricted tip tail unlike archaeopteryx similicaudipteryx rectrices extending much tail least one species jeholornis palmapenis tail feathers feathers short pointed arched away body tail entire array tail feathers resembled palm frond tail feathers overlap

jeholornis prima earliest known fruit eating birds trait possibly developed plants somewhere around million years ago started developing new kinds fruits birds like jeholornis evolved ability eat fruits coevolutionary relationship started million years ago study also found jeholornis eating seeds entire fruit would pooped uncrushed seeds helping plant spread grow fruit producing plants providing food scorces shoulder girdles jeholornis well developed probably allowed better flight capability seen archaeopteryx flight apparatus jeholornis overall quite similar confuciusornis form function forelimbs longer hindlimbs short robust however like basal nonornithothoracean avialans theropod dinosaurs shoulder blades jeholornis oriented along sides body rather top back meant shoulder girdle slung low according study phil senter would allowed typical dinosaurian motion shoulder primitive avialans like archaeopteryx confuciusornis jeholornis would able lift arms vertically achieve true flapping flight though semipowered gliding parachuting would examination claw curvature jeholornis suggests may able perch may least partly arboreal spending much time one key adaptation modern
