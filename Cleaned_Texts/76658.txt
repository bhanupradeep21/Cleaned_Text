stage mediumsized ichthyosaur long snout bears ridge running along side forelimbs chacaicosaurus small contain four main digits different authors classified chacaicosaurus different ways consider thunnosaur closely related ophthalmosaurids others instead place outside thunnosauria often near hauffiopteryx however similar stenopterygius researchers instead classify within genus cayi placement

limbs ichthyosaurs modified rigid flippers bodies jurassic ichthyosaurs streamlined spindleshaped short necks downward bend tail supported crescentic tail fin dorsal fin constructed soft tissue present skull holotype measures centimeters ft long mandible lower jaw bones centimeters ft long skull bears narrow snout characteristically heavily elongated making skulls length gradually sloping point front uniquely among ichthyosaurs snout bears elongate rounded ridges run longitudinally along premaxillae nasals one ridge side cranial proportions chacaicosaurus similar longsnouted ichthyosaurs eurhinosaurus though unlike genus chacaicosaurus overbite unusually adult chacaicosaurus appear either reduced teeth enlarged external nares openings nostrils chacaicosaurus measure centimeters long positioned especially close orbits eye openings orbits chacaicosaurus poorly preserved size unclear description genus fernández estimated sclerotic ring ring bony plates supporting eyeball diameter around centimeters considered also reasonable rough approximation width orbit thus concluding chacaicosaurus especially small ryosuke motani also stated orbits small michael maisch andreas matzke instead considered orbits especially wide basioccipital rear lower braincase bone chacaicosaurus lacks peglike projection front end surfaces basioccipital articulation two pairs braincase bones opisthotics stapedes angled towards top skull latter pair reclined occipital condyle knob back skull articulation spinal column clearly demarcated rest basioccipital occipital condyle

refraining assigning chacaicosaurus fernández published results phylogenetic analysis found closest relative chacaicosaurus stenopterygius two genera tentatively placed fernández ichthyosauridae along ichthyosaurus ophthalmosaurus mollesaurus though noted classification still provisional relationships jurassic ichthyosaurs poorly study motani published sought better understand ichthyosaur relationships phylogenetic analysis include chacaicosaurus analysis assigned group thunnosauria citing similarities snout forelimb stenopterygius acutirostris species since reassigned year later maisch matzke also conducted phylogenetic analysis ichthyosaur relationships though include chacaicosaurus analysis considered skull chacaicosaurus resemble ophthalmosaurus forelimbs much like stenopterygius noting chacaicosaurus lived stenopterygius ophthalmosaurus researchers considered possible chacaicosaurus intermediate two genera due similarity stenopterygius maisch matzke placed family stenopterygiidae within thunnosauria also considered possible rather belonging genus c cayi could derived member stenopterygius considered evidence insufficient combine two however fernández considered differences chacaicosaurus stenopterygius insufficient synonymized c cayi becoming stenopterygius cayi maisch retained chacaicosaurus separate genus assigning stenopterygiidae alongside stenopterygius valentin fischer colleagues conducted cladistic analysis thunnosaurian relationships including chacaicosaurus analysis found sister taxon closest relative ophthalmosauridae stenopterygius closest relative another analysis study also led fischer finding similar however erin maxwell colleagues criticized placement noting traits fischer colleagues used studies link chacaicosaurus ophthalmosauridae also seen stenopterygius maintained chacaicosaurus synonym nevertheless fischer colleagues constructed ran new analysis still found chacaicosaurus closely related ophthalmosauridae stenopterygius quadriscissus though aaleniensis sometimes found closer ophthalmosaurids reiterations analysis continued find another analysis conducted dirley cortés colleagues also found chacaicosaurus closer ophthalmosaurs however analyses found placement study benjamin moon find member thunnosauria though still recovered within neoichthyosauria group includes posttriassic
