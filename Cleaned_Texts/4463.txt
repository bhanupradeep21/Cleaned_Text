speak lowpitched voice particularly poor breath vocal syndrome affect men article published describing discrete type vocal dysfunction results men sounding like actor humphrey bogart women sounding like actress lauren bogart bacall married made several films together bbs medical term ongoing hoarseness often affects actors singers tvradio voice workers routinely speak low treatment usually involves voice therapy speech language signs symptoms syndrome appear differently depending vocal use individual singers symptoms may appear subtly due extreme sensitivity small changes laryngeal mechanism able control laryngeal muscles average person vocal control compensate irritation weakness change vibration patterns vocal folds signs symptoms vary casebycase basis depend vocal strain degree daily use women also susceptible men experience heightened symptoms due increased likelihood speaking lower pitch professional signs symptoms include cause syndrome commonly identified abuse overuse vocal cords individuals speak sing outside normal range develop bbs long period misuse individuals develop syndrome tend speak perform poor breath support laryngeal muscle tension causes include speech communication disorders throat conditions workrelated conditions speech communication disorders refers issues involving language related areas oral motor function examples include expressive language disorder receptiveexpressive language disorder phonologic disorder throat conditions one workrelated conditions typically affect individuals whose professions require extensive use overuse vocal cords examples include news television broadcasters radio hosts well singers actors teachers may also susceptible bbs depending volume much talk regular basis many plausible reasons vocal disorders occur determined certain due many factors play role speech production voice production requires coordination many muscles structures larynx many factors cause larynx become tensed changes position larynx affects cartilaginous structures within larynx leading abnormal phonation refers unnaturally deep voice lowering voice individuals may continue speak even air lungs almost entirely expelled due effort exerted lowering pitch range muscles involved respiration become tensed strained along speech syndrome considered secondary muscle tension dysphonia disorder meaning abnormality voice box causes overuse muscles help produce voice abnormality caused underlying medical reason physical exertion lowering vocal pitch larynx compresses vocal folds regulate air flow production sounds used speech cause damage muscles time vocal fold lesions nodules cause changes vocal fold mucosa leads increased tension larynx ultimately causing speechlanguage pathology evaluation need conducted conscious vocal use history well examination throat larynx evaluation potentially involves imaging visualize vocal cords imaging options include laryngoscope videostroboscopy laryngeal diagnosis difficult due variance symptom presentation vocal use videostroboscopy provides magnified slowmotion view vocal cords larynx action allows professionals see abnormal movement videostroboscopy used visualize swelling vocal folds irritation polyps growth occasionally redness bumps seen vocal cords useful making correct laryngeal electromyography test measures electrical signals voice box muscles laryngeal muscles speaking breathing swallowing evaluation check vocal issues related one following partial paralysis resulting muscle weakness paralysis resulting loss muscle function functionality motor unit laryngeal muscles laryngeal electromyography plays important role determining whether nerve problem cause vocal prevention syndrome aims target two main symptoms disorder dysphonia vocal fatigue effective posture allows person shift tension muscles allowing free movement larynx without blockage leading effective voice production improvement breath

syndrome underlying condition typically expected make vocal recovery voice therapy form muscle tension dysphonia go untreated cause longterm disorders require additional forms treatment syndrome develop individuals age likely develop individuals work voice performance range singers actors teachers radio television broadcasters women likely men develop bbs due tendency lowering voices professional environment syndrome also prevalent group vocal cords thin vocal disorders prevalent roughly population range muscle tension dysphonia speech language studies need conducted examine longterm effects syndrome left untreated studies currently ongoing aim understand best course treatment may individuals muscle tension dysphonia includes individuals currently understood interdisciplinary approach target causes poor breath support overuse inappropriate intensity vocal disorders misuse currently researched depending work conditions professions study based teachers indicated voice disorders play significant role profession study found substantial number teachers needed take time work seek medical attention due voice issues seek treatment study also found women likely develop disorders male research available vocal disorders may effected additional lifestyle factors study conducted understand reflux effected vocal disorders dysphonia singers bulimia singers
