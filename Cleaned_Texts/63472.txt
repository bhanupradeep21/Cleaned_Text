east syndrome syndrome consisting epilepsy ataxia movement disorder sensorineural deafness deafness problems hearing nerve saltwasting renal tubulopathy salt loss caused kidney tubulopathy renal tubule abnormalities condition predispose hypokalemic low potassium metabolic alkalosis normal blood pressure hypomagnesemia low blood levels magnesium may also presentcitation east syndrome also called sesame syndrome seizures sensorineural deafness ataxia intellectual disability mental retardation electrolyte imbalances autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused mutations gene discovered bockenhauer gene encodes k channel allowing k flow cell rather present brain ear kidney many mutations found within east syndrome lead change ph sensitivity modification value alkaline range higher ph reading specific mutation affected shift activity greatly decreased exposed intracellular ph causes h sensitivity within humans means ph level shifted basic range still many mutations also cause changes ph sensitivity mutations also decreased sensitivity exposed physiological intracellular epilepsy caused mutation within east syndrome glial cells express establishes neuronal cells resting membrane potential therefore repolarization neuron constantly takes sodium causes membrane potential decrease potassium longer taken intracellularly seizures occur mutation increases sodium uptake decreases potassium uptake means protective barrier potassium longer signs epilepsy temporary confusion staring spell uncontrollable movements arms legs person may also experience loss consciousness psychic symptoms someone epilepsy typically type seizure time one occurs symptoms also similar treatments epilepsy vary depending case treatments include medications surgery therapies ketogenic dietcitation needed ataxia develop abruptly develop time signs symptoms ataxia loss balance loss muscle coordination arm hand leg difficulty walking slur speech difficulty ataxia nonspecific condition characterized lack voluntary movements degree rather involving damage cerebellum ataxia east syndrome due mutation brain expressed glial cells surrounding synapses blood vessels k ion buffer k necessary maintain neuronal cells membrane potential glial cells responsible transferring k ions sites excess k sites deficient k major potassium channel glial cells gene mutated glial cells properly clear k extracellular space deliver k ions places need excess k areas synapse disturbs physiological excitability resulting symptoms treatment ataxia depends cause current research east syndrome specific treatment however general ways improve disability ataxia movement disorders associated ataxia managed pharmacological treatments physical therapy occupational therapy reduce physical therapy treatment highly dependent individual varies recent review states physical therapy effective however moderate evidence support person shows signs sensorineural deafness usually muffling speech difficulty understanding words especially background noise crowd people person might also frequently ask others speak slowly clearly loudly might also withdraw conversations avoid social settings everything sounds muffled even loud sensorineural deafness indicates patient difficulty hearing due environmental factors genetic mutation gene gene affects potassium channel count productivity several parts bodycitation needed since main mutation east syndrome gene affects potassium channels found inner ear cells includes stria vascularis region inner ear upper portion fluid filled spiral ligament cochlea cochlea main region translates sound waves neurological signals interpreted brain without properly functioning potassium channel potassium conductance reduced critical maintaining endocochlear functioning properly implies potassium ions leave rather going cell causes lack sound wave translation neurological signals brain unable understand interpret potassium also necessary hair cells mainly concentration endolymph inner ear fluid membrane without use potassium channels entry potassium appropriate regions lack signal transduction help processing even though sensorineural deafness irreversible one treatment cochlear implants includes microphone electronic devices sit externally head sound emitted microphone converts sound waves electrical impulses contrast hearing aids amplify sound cochlear implants designed stimulate auditory tubulopathy represented acronym east syndrome renal salt wasting tubulopathy involved kidneys mutation involved east syndrome causes subnormal absorption certain ions na gene associated k channel distal convoluted tubule connecting tubule two specific regions kidneys regions play role excretion absorption salts inwardly rectifying potassium channel means important recycling k believed useful building gradient nak atpases addition diminishing nak atpases inadequate functioning leads depolarization basolateral membrane reduces electrogenic transporters driving force lack na typically leads low blood pressure typical east syndrome patients salt wasting tubulopathy east syndrome closely resembles gitelman syndrome common syndrome affecting distal convoluted east syndrome autosomal recessive disorder therefore necessarily prevented presence four symptoms epilepsy ataxia sensorineural deafness saltwasting renal tubulopathy detection mutation gene would indicate presence disordercitation needed yet one method help east syndrome whole hopefully continued research could one daycitation needed
