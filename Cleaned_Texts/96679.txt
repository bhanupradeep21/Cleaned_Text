cryptic female choice form mate choice occurs pre post copulatory circumstances females certain species use physical chemical mechanisms control males success fertilizing ova ovum ie selecting whether sperm successful fertilizing eggs occurs internallyfertilizing species involves differential use sperm females sperm available reproductive tract present understanding cryptic female choice largely thanks extensive research analysis done william g eberhard term cryptic according eberhard meant describe internal thereby hidden choice female organisms able make following insemination regards sperm male species intromittent organs copulation male inserts reproductive organ females inseminate genetic material development mechanisms either prematurely inhibit copulation act following male insemination females able prevent undesirable males successfully fertilizing thus every copulatory event successful many factors combine determine whether offspring created likely cryptic female choice consequence conflict reproductive desires males males commonly increase reproductive success maximally fertilizing female mate females incur costs personal health result behavior cryptic female choice reduces costs allowing also benefit select favorable matings females exert sexual control also benefit exerting control male reproductive success observed species males continue court females following copulation illuminates fact female control compels males continue impress female counterparts following assumption made energetic cost male continue court female following insemination invest energy energetic investment must benefit way sexual selection act traits influence female mate choice males also acts male traits determine success following copulation circumstances nature males interaction female detriment personal wellbeing offspring one situation sexual coercion occurs male harasses female prior copulation circumstances females lifespan fertility compromised benefits females develop evasive addition species multiple males inseminate female female able select desirable sperm offspring rejecting desires aforementioned situations females reproductive actions affect male reproductive success following discussed female species able use cryptic choice developed various mechanisms manipulate male reproductive success species able use cryptic choice use one mechanisms regardless mechanism ability allows females respond differently conspecific males depending whether male inseminates favorable many mechanisms exist animal world allow females practice cryptic female choice manipulating reproductive events successful choices occur varying stages reproductive process precopulation female cryptic choice include physical anatomical chemical barriers promote hinder males success mating physicalanatomical precopulatory level female cryptic choice consists physical anatomical barriers females use decide whether male successful fall two subcategories result mating strategies cases without compliance female male unsuccessful mating attempt females choose specific male traits hindering complete intromission ejaculation mating precopulatory level female cryptic choice also employed chemical means allow mating males deceiving males female cryptic choice also occur male mated released sperm females also exercise cryptic female choice fertilization processes utilizing sperm storage transplant females exercise cryptic female choice storing transplanting sperm bias sperm success rates towards certain females control hormonal signals halt embryo preparation keep sperm successfully fertilizing embryo also promote hinder ovulation means exercising cryptic female choice hindering ovulation copulatory interaction may deemed unsuccessful rats golden hamsters females denied males success failing prepare uterus based male insemination male sperm relatively slow inert reproductive tracts storage areas female activated calcium ionophores vitro thus releasing withholding necessary ions activate sperm females promote faster motility sperm towards egg fertilization hinder slowing motility allowing die reach egg female ovarian fluids promote hinder sperm especially complementary uncomplimentary chemical signals females may also physically choose among spermatophores taken multiple matings females sometimes change differential ovulation responses based male stimuli affect male reproductive success lions females reduce fertility male commits infanticide resulting low offspring counts new male takes even fertilization occurred females exercise cryptic female choice even birth occurred females manipulate male offspring success wide variety species around world provides us many examples mechanism cryptic female choice section provides detailed example mechanisms cryptic female choice seen particular species cassadine plant beetle chelymorpha alternans female complexly coiled spermathecal duct frequently reverses direction reversal female able discriminate males gentalic sclerite example copulatory mechanism female actively hinders successful sand lizard lacerta agilis provides us example cryptic female choice insemination phase mating females routinely indiscriminately copulate several males females mate often greater hatching success lowering incidence deformities among offspring enhancing survival freeliving offspring aforementioned consequences result females ability differentially use sperm least related male thus males genetically similar female sire less species sperm transplant mechanism crickets one species prematurely remove spermatophore copulation terminates sperm transfer one study males randomly assigned females create halfsib families determine heritability spermatophore retention time females researchers found additive genetic variance timing spermatophore removal females results suggest timing spermatophore removal determined partly genotype independent quality females mate shows difference fitness females freely remove spermatophore fitness females forced accept complete female spider pisaura mirabilis stores sperm males give nuptial gift compared share shows biased use stored sperm hence cryptic female choice postcopulatory mechanism theropithecus gelada wild primate demonstrates cryptic female choice gestation mechanism females reported strong bruce effect bruce effect female terminates pregnancy exposed unrelated female geladas terminate pregnancies week dominant male replaced could males typically perform infanticide take new group terminating pregnancy could females way protect avoid infanticide young studies shown support hypothesis bruce effect adaptive strategy japanese pygmy squid idiosepius paradoxus yet another example species exhibits cryptic female choice males place spermatangia external location females body female able physically remove spermatangia select preferred traits males enacting postcopulatory intersexual species harpobittacus genus hanging fly scorpionfly another example females exercise postcopulatory control mating multiple males determining rate fertilization male females continue mate
