flu season annually recurring time period characterized prevalence outbreak influenza flu season occurs cold half year hemisphere takes approximately two days show symptoms influenza activity sometimes predicted even tracked geographically beginning major flu activity season varies location specific location minor epidemics usually take three weeks reach pinnacle another three weeks significantly annually million cases severe illness deaths seasonal flu occur three virus families influenza virus b c main infective agents cause influenza periods cooler temperature influenza cases increase roughly tenfold despite higher incidence manifestations flu season viruses actually transmitted throughout populations year roundcitation needed annual flu season normally associated major influenza virus sub type associated sub type changes year due development immunological resistance previous years strain exposure vaccinations mutational changes previously dormant viruses strains exact mechanism behind seasonal nature influenza outbreaks unknown proposed explanations research guinea pigs shown aerosol transmission virus enhanced air cold dependence aridity appears due degradation virus particles moist air dependence cold appears due infected hosts shedding virus longer period time researchers find cold impaired immune response guinea pigs viruscitation needed research done national institute child health human development nichd found influenza virus butterlike coating coating melts enters respiratory tract winter coating becomes hardened shell therefore survive cold weather similar spore summer coating melts virus reaches respiratory united states flu season considered october typically reaches apex seasonal baseline varying australia flu season considered may october usually peaks southern hemisphere countries argentina chile south africa paraguay also tend start around brazil complex seasonality component flu season due part tropical climate south latitudes flu peaks southern hemisphere flu seasons also exist tropics subtropics variability region hong kong humid subtropical climate flu season runs december march winter early flu vaccinations used diminish effects flu season lower individuals risk getting flu since northern southern hemisphere winter different times year actually two flu seasons year therefore world health organization assisted national influenza centers recommends two vaccine formulations every year one northern one southern according us department health growing number large companies provide

pandemics terms excess fact much mortality distinguishes seasonal epidemics pandemics rather extent disease though reasons behind distinction epidemic pandemic well geographic variability observed within individual flu seasons remain poorly flu seasons particularly notable terms severity others notable due unique unusual factors described according united states public health service epidemic
