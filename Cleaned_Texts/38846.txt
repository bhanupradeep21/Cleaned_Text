prolonged periods midwinter darkness midsummer areas temperate regions known prolonged periods light darkness instance like alaska concluded rhythmical melatonin secretion psychological response orientation sun early winter months delay circannual programme following autumnal generating biological rhythms internally helps organisms anticipate important changes environment occur thus providing organisms time prepare example plants strict time frame regards blooming preparing spring begin preparations early late risk pollinated competing different species factors might affect survival rate circannual cycle may keep making mistake particular geographic region experiences false spring weather becomes exceptionally warm early short period time returning winter temperatures similarly bird plumage mammal fur change approach winter triggered shortening photoperiod circannual cycle also useful animals migrate hibernate many animals reproductive organs change response changes photoperiod male gonads grow onset spring promote reproduction among species enlarged gonads would nearly impossible keep year round would inefficient species many female animals produce eggs certain times changing climate may unravel ecosystems different organisms use different internal calendars warming temperatures may lead earlier blooms flora spring instance one study performed menzel et al analyzed phenological records plant species european countries found plants studied advanced flowering leafing fruiting three percent significantly delayed determined average advance spring summer days per decade meanwhile fauna may breed migrate based length day thus might arrive late critical food supplies coevolved example parus major closely times hatching chicks emergence proteinrich winter moth caterpillar turn hatches meet budding birds singlebrood bird meaning breed year nine chicks per brood birds caterpillars buds emerge right time caterpillars eat new oak leaves population increases dramatically hopefully coincide arrival new chicks allowing eat plants insects birds respond differently advance spring phenology changes relationship may altered another example studies pied flycatcher ficedula hypoleuca shown spring migration timing triggered internal circannual clock fine tuned day particular birds overwinter dry tropical forest western africa breed temperate
