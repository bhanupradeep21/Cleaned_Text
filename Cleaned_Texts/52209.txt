biotechnology application scientific engineering principles processing materials biological agents provide goods inception biotechnology maintained close relationship society although often associated development drugs historically biotechnology principally associated food addressing issues malnutrition famine history biotechnology beginscitation needed zymotechnology commenced focus brewing techniques beer world war however zymotechnology would expand tackle larger industrial issues potential industrial fermentation gave rise biotechnology however singlecell protein gasohol projects failed progress due varying issues including public resistance changing economic scene shifts political power yet formation new field genetic engineering would soon bring biotechnology forefront science society intimate relationship scientific community public government would ensue debates gained exposure asilomar conference joshua lederberg outspoken supporter emerging field biotechnology

biotechnology grew promising real industry five proteins genetically engineered cells approved drugs united states food drug administration fda number would skyrocket end field genetic engineering remains heated topic discussion todays society advent gene therapy stem cell research cloning genetically modified food seems natural nowadays link pharmaceutical drugs solutions health societal problems relationship biotechnology serving social needs began centuries ago biotechnology arose field zymotechnology zymurgy began search better understanding industrial fermentation particularly beer beer important industrial social commodity late germany brewing contributed much gross national product steel taxes alcohol proved significant sources revenue institutes remunerative

produce steroids industrially significant particular importance improved semisynthesis cortisone simplified old step synthesis advance estimated reduce cost drug making medicine inexpensive today biotechnology still plays central role production compounds likely years even greater expectations biotechnology raised process grew singlecell protein socalled protein gap threatened world hunger
