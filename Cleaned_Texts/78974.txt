developed two different methodologies quantify group different functions attitudes method one content analysis herek set determine functions attitudes mainly served conducting content analyses undergraduate student essays describing feelings lesbian women gay men herek herek chose topic belief controversial enough issue time elicit extreme attitudes terms acceptance rejection gay people

male homosexuals herek p herek two assistants categorized essays themes defined idea complete thought somehow related respondents attitudes researchers found twentyeight recurring themes coded every essay parsing categories necessary preliminary study evaluated essays new sample students university wrote attitude essays topic gays lesbians new sample also completed questionnaires collected demographic data also used select students reported exclusively heterosexual behaviors total new sample qualified coding based presence absence themes previously found using block cluster analysis researchers identified patterns multiple themes within essays interpreted indicate presence functions block cluster analysis resulted five interpretable clusters themes refined per theoretical perspectives smith et al katz refinement resulted two patterns themes containing positive attitudes experientialschematic positive selfexpressive positive three patterns containing negative attitudes
