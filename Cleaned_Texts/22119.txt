female sperm storage biological process often type sexual selection sperm cells transferred female mating temporarily retained within specific part reproductive tract oocyte egg fertilized process takes place species animals humans site storage variable among different animal taxa ranges structures appear function solely sperm retention insect bird sperm storage tubules bird general regions reproductive tract enriched receptors sperm associate fertilization caudal portion cow oviduct containing spermassociating female sperm storage integral stage reproductive process many animals internal fertilization several documented biological functions including one important advantage female insects store sperm gain increased genetic diversity offspring many ways females alter offspring genetics increase success diversity example accomplished female scathophaga preferentially fertilize eggs survive different environments since many environments require different traits success females somehow able match sperm acquired multiple mates best genes whichever environment many different properties environment including temperature thermal properties affect females sperm studies also shown ovipositing nonrandom females lay eggs varying pgmphosphoglucomutase genotypes different environments order optimize offspring success females acutely aware environment manipulate genetic diversity offspring appropriate ways ensure success another way spermstoring females alter diversity offspring controlling relatedness males provide sperm inbreeding depression deleterious impact populations organisms due mating closely related individuals combat effect female insects appear able sort sperm relatives sperm nonrelatives choose best option fertilize eggs female crickets able preferentially store sperm multiple unrelated males siblings results offspring unrelated parentage able choose sperm coupling might advantageous females choosing mates precopulation may costly may difficult tell males apart females possess remarkable abilities select sperm store fertilize eggs make offspring diverse though shown majority female insect species store sperm specific examples studied could include field dung flies mediterranean fruit females largely benefit mechanism males often experience low fitness paternity secure sperm stored often determines male ends fertilizing eggs example seen red flour beetles sperm stored first mating another male remove previously stored sperm better chances successful mating antagonistic coevolution relationship males females sexual morphology changes time change opposites sex traits order achieve maximum reproductive one development alternative sperm storage sites seminal receptacles spermathecae pseudospermathecae complex extremely variable allow choice sperm cases sperm storage sites produce proteases break various proteins male seminal fluid resulting female selection like females males developed responses counter evolutionary adaptations opposite sex responses insects vary genitalia sperm structures along variations behavior spiny male genitalia help anchor male female copulation remove sperm previous males female storage males also developed alternative ways copulate case bed bug males traumatically inseminate females allows faster passage sperm female sperm storage sperm received mesospermalege eventually reach spermathecae also referred seminal conceptacles microscopic level drosophila males differing sperm tail lengths correspond various sizes female seminal longer male sperm tail length shown greater reproductive success larger female seminal receptacle sperm short tail lengths found successful smaller seminal receptacles ability store separate sperm multiple males enables females manipulate paternity choosing sperm fertilize eggs process known cryptic female choice evidence ability exists many different taxa including birds reptiles gastropods arachnids combining longterm sperm storage polyandrous behavior female members tortoise family testudinidae access sperm range genetically different males potentially influence clutch paternity fertilization event mating choices alone result clutches greater variation paternal genes increased sperm competition females maximize genetic quality number cryptic choice allows females preferentially choose sperm females thus able mate multiple times allocate sperm eggs according paternal phenotype according characteristics cases yellow dung fly certain male traits affect fitness eggs laid particular environmental conditions females choose sperm based male quality function interaction species fly dryomyza anilis females preferentially choose sperm one storage location another males species developed behaviors abdominal
