lymphocytes cells immune system attack destroy virusinfected cells tumor cells cells transplanted organs occurs cell endowed highly specific receptor bind antigen present surface another cell cell receptor binds complex formed surface protein named mhc major histocompatibility complex small peptide aminoacids located groove mhc molecule peptide originate protein remains within cell fig whereas cell recognizes single antigen collectively cells endowed large diversity receptors targeted wide variety antigens cells originate thymus process named central tolerance eliminates cells receptor recognizing antigen present normal cells organism enables cells eliminate cells foreign abnormal antigens without harming normal cells long debated whether cancer cells bearing tumorspecific antigens absent normal cells could principle cause elimination tumor immune system proven tumorspecific antigens exist patients mount spontaneous cell responses antigens unfortunately clear many perhaps
