skin absorption route substances enter body skin along inhalation ingestion injection dermal absorption route exposure toxic substances route administration medication absorption substances skin depends number factors important concentration duration contact solubility medication physical condition skin part body exposed skin percutaneous dermal absorption transport chemicals outer surface skin skin circulation skin absorption relates degree exposure possible effect substance may enter body skin human skin comes contact many agents intentionally unintentionally skin absorption occur occupational environmental consumer skin exposure chemicals cosmetics pharmaceutical products chemicals absorbed enough quantity cause detrimental systemic effects skin disease dermatitis considered one common occupational order assess chemical risk either causing dermatitis systemic effects risk may reduced one must know extent absorbed thus dermal exposure key aspect human health risk assessment along inhalation ingestion injection dermal absorption route exposure bioactive substances including absorption substances skin depends number factors general rate absorption chemicals skin follows following scheme fastest slowest scrotal forehead armpit scalp back abdomen palm surface absorbed skin chemical must pass epidermis glands hair follicles sweat glands hair follicles make percent total skin though small amounts chemicals may enter body rapidly glands hair follicles primarily absorbed epidermis chemicals must pass seven cell layers epidermis entering dermis enter blood stream lymph circulate areas body toxins toxicants move layers passive diffusion stratum corneum outermost layer epidermis ratelimiting barrier absorption thus quickly something passes thicker outer layer determines overall absorption stratum corneum primarily composed lipophilic cholesterol cholesterol esters ceramides thus lipidsoluble chemicals make layer circulation faster however nearly molecules penetrate minimal absorption chemicals municipal water dental products voc volatile organic compounds tthm total trihalomethanes fluoride disinfectants major exposure environmental health agents injure stratum corneum strong acids absorbed faster chemicals skin damage due burns abrasions wounds skin diseases also increase absorption thus populations skin damage may susceptible adverse effects agents absorbed skin certain solvents like dimethyl sulfoxide dmso act carriers frequently used transport medication skin dmso increases permeability stratum surfactants like sodium laurylsulfate increase skin penetration watersoluble substances possibly increasing skin permeability dermal application medication chemical allows treatment localized unlike ingestion injection medications seem effective efficient using dermal route administration ingested drugs heavily metabolized liver may inactivated using dermal application bypasses metabolic step allowing parent compounds enter peripheral circulation drug absorbed well skin may used means systemic medication dermal dosage forms include liniments braces lotions ointments creams dusting powders aerosols transdermal specially designed patches currently used deliver fentanyl nicotine compounds slower skin absorption versus oral injectable may allow patches provide medication instance nitroglycerin given transdermally may provide hours protection angina whereas duration effect sublingually may amount chemical absorbed skin measured directly studies shown species differences absorption different chemicals measurements rats rabbits pigs may may reflect human finding rate agents penetrate skin important assessing risk exposures transit chemicals skin directly measured using noninvasive optical techniques molecular specificity confocal raman spectroscopy technique able identify unique spectra molecules compare background skin spectra whilst limiting measurement regions using confocal gating achieving depthresolved concentration measurement single measurement sequence thereby establish snapshot profile chemical concentration depth inside skin repeating measurement multiple timepoints dynamic concentrationatdepth profile determined since modern raman spectrometers exhibit extremely high snr invivo absorption testing human skin possible scale minutes hours chemical may also directly applied skin followed blood urine measurements set time points application assess amount chemical entered body concentration blood urine particular time points graphed show area curve extent duration absorption distribution provide measure systemic absorption done animals humans dry chemical powder chemical rats commonly used experiments area skin shaved chemical applied often area chemical application covered prevent ingestion rubbing test material samples blood urine taken specific time intervals following application hours protocols chosen end time animal maybe necropsied tissue samples may also evaluated presence test test protocols many animals may tested necropsies may occur set intervals exposure biomonitoring taking urine samples intervals workers exposed chemicals may provide information difficult distinguish dermal inhalation exposure using method permeability properties stratum corneum part unchanged removal skin removed carefully animals may also used see extent local penetration putting chamber applying chemical one side measuring amount chemical gets fluid one example ex vivo technique isolated perfused porcine method first described humane alternative vivo animal techniques static diffusion cells franz cells flowthrough diffusion cells bronaugh cells also franz cell apparatus consists two chambers separated membrane animal human skin human skin preferred due ethical considerations always available human skin often may come autopsies plastic test product applied membrane via top chamber bottom chamber contains fluid samples taken regular intervals analysis determine amount active cells permeated membrane set time points bronaugh cells similar franz cells use flowthrough system beneath membrane layer samples liquid taken continuously rather set time bronaugh cells replaced inline cells manufacturers sometimes impossible humane reasons apply drug skin measure absorption sarin nerve gas absorbed intact skin lethal low concentrations thus one needs assess risk sarin exposure one must take skin absorption routes account one ethically test sarin human subjects thus ways modeling risk skin exposure agent found models used instances predict amount exposure absorption assess public health hazards order assess risk chemical causing health issue one must assess chemical exposure exposure modeling depends several factors assumptions skin exposure absorption deemed indicate risk various methods reduce absorption undertaken
