strength use medical research council mrc sum score handgrip cipcim often identified patient unable successfully weaned mechanical ventilator early detection condition difficult patients often sedated intubated thus unable cooperate thorough neuromuscular physical use conventional nerve conduction studies timeconsuming requires specialized personnel however simplified electrophysiologic tests used screening tools critically ill confirm exclude peroneal nerve test validated highsensitivity minimally invasive nonvolitional quick diagnostic test accurately exclude cipcim result moreover patients disuse atrophy muscle deconditioning normal electrophysiological tests even muscle strength severely hence tests important define cause muscle weakness helpful refine serum creatine phosphokinase cpk

medical research council mrc score one tool sometimes used help identify cipcim patients research studies mrc score involves assessing strength muscle groups right left sides upper lower extremities muscle tested given score giving total possible score mrc score less suggestive cipcim however tool requires patients awake cooperative often case also screening tool nonspecific identify cause
