conditions caused directly hiv however cause difficult discern central nervous system damaged number causes related hiv infectioncitation needed many researchers believe hiv damages vital brain cells neurons indirectly according one theory hiv either infects activates cells protect brain known macrophages microglia cells produce toxins set series reactions instruct neurons selfdestruct infected macrophages microglia also appear produce additional factors chemokines cytokines affect neurons well brain cells known astrocytes affected astrocytes normally nurture protect neurons also may end harming neurons astrocytes produce neurotoxic proteins tat nef rev tat secreted induces reactivity astrocytes increased gfap hiv protein inhibits stem cells brain producing new nerve neuronal cells hiv induces mitochondrialdeath proteins like caspases may influence upregulation death receptor fas leading hiv enters brain early thought hiv uses trojan horse mechanism enter brain normally barrier
