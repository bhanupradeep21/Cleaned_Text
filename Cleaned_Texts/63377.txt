palatine tonsils commonly called tonsils occasionally called faucial tonsils located left right sides back throat often seen fleshcolored pinkish lumps tonsils present white lumps inflamed infected symptoms exudates pus drainage severe swelling tonsillitis inflammation tonsils often necessarily cause sore throat chronic cases tonsillectomy may palatine tonsils located isthmus fauces
