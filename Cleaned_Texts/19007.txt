sarmientosaurus genus titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur belonging lived south america specifically argentina upper cretaceous period million years type species sarmientosaurus musacchioi paleontologist rubén df martínez estancia laguna palacios goicoechea family chubut province discovered sauropod skull proved connected first cervical type species sarmientosaurus musacchioi named described rubén

honours late eduardo musacchio educator universidad nacional de la patagonia san juan bosco life science identifiers genus holotype mdtpv found upper lower member bajo barreal formation dating cenomanian turonian ages consists almost complete skull lower jaws articulated first seven vertebrae front neck several neck parts among entire atlas fourth neck vertebra eroded salvaged specimen represents elderly individual one titanosaurs skull material uniquely side neck elongated structure discovered identified ossified bajo barreal formation another titanosaur sauropod known epachthosaurus determined whether taxa identical material holotypes overlapping however authors considered identity improbable cladistic analysis genera occupied different positions evolutionary tree also fragmentary fossils postcranial bones differ epachthosaurus skull bones dissimilar sarmientosaurus cranium show case several titanosaur species present sarmientosaurus estimated length twelve metres weight ten tonnes describing authors indicated nine unique distinguishing traits autapomorphies eye socket large equalling length skull ascending branch maxilla complex connection top process lacrimal bone wedged outer side inner side inner edge rear part ascending branch maxilla touches rim bony nostril low distinct ridge ascending branch quadratojugal lower rear tongueshaped process overlapping rear quadrate braincase three separate exits nervus trigeminus inner vein channel connecting infundibulum brains stem lacking premaxillary teeth positioned vertically maxillary teeth inclining front dentary teeth inclining rear middle neck vertebrae strutlike instead plateshaped ridges front joint processes vertebral centrum long thin ossified tendon running along low side series neck vertebrae neck skull length fortythree centimetres top view skull less tongueshaped antorbital fenestra small eye socket exceptionally large side view snout flat concave upper profile surface maxilla touches prefrontal jugal bone unusual lshape long front branch almost absent rear branch fifth cranial nerve nervus trigeminus extra exits branches towards maxilla lower jaw whereas sauropods possess single exit front lower jaw almost constant praemaxilla bears four teeth maxilla eleven right side twelve left dentary thirteen premaxillary teeth positioned vertically maxillary teeth incline front teeth lower jaw incline behind unique configuration build teeth inbetween spatulate form basal sauropods pencil shape derived species teeth moderately elongated sharplyangled wear facets high low position together strange orientation indicates special yet fully understood way cropping neck vertebrae long elongated internal structure camellated ie many small air spaces inside middle neck vertebrae oval narrow deep pleurocoels sides pneumatic excavations nearly touch midline separated narrow bone plate rear joint processes uncommonly long reaching beyond edge vertebral body front joint processes supported struts oval crosssection apparently formed perforation normally plateshaped ridges position neck ribs delicate thin parallel ribs outer side neck cableshaped structure discovered constant diameter three millimetres oval crosssection rough striated surface structure originated directly behind skull continued length several vertebrae thus metres interpreted describing authors ossified tendon alternative hypothesis might neck rib rejected ribs thicker different position tendons might continuation neck ribs position confirm instead assumed internal neck muscle ossified tendons never found fossil dinosaur extant bird groups cranes show though relatively shorter two vertebrae long possible muscles could located musculus rectus capitis anterior ventralis musculus longus colli ventralis musculi intertransversarii internal structure tendon much reworked bone tissue indicated swift ossification young martínez colleagues placed sarmientosaurus basal position within clade lithostrotia malawisaurus evolutionary however stephen poropat colleagues instead identified part new clade diamantinasauria along savannasaurus large eye sockets meaning may better vision titanosaurs based ear neck tendon sarmientosaurus likely hung head neck like enormous eeyore posture implies sarmientosaurus may eaten much lowerlying plants correlation inner ear structure
