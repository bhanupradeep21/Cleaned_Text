dual inheritance theory dit also known coevolution biocultural developed early explain human behavior product two different interacting evolutionary processes genetic evolution cultural evolution genes culture continually interact feedback changes genes lead changes culture influence genetic selection vice versa one theorys central claims culture evolves partly darwinian selection process dual inheritance theorists often describe analogy genetic culture context defined socially learned behavior social learning defined copying behaviors observed others acquiring behaviors taught others modelling done field relies first dynamic copying though extended teaching social learning simplest involves blind copying behaviors model someone observed behaving though also understood many potential biases including success bias copying perceived better status bias copying higher status homophily copying like conformist bias disproportionately picking behaviors people performing etc

milk led selection genetic traits lactose recently analysis natural selection human genome suggests civilization accelerated genetic change humans past food processing culture driven changes human digestive systems making many digestive organs teeth stomach smaller expected primates similar attributed one reasons humans large brains compared great due food processing early examples food processing include pounding marinating notably cooking pounding meat breaks muscle fibres hence taking away job mouth teeth marinating emulates action stomach high acid levels cooking partially breaks food making easily digestible food enters body effectively partly digested food processing reduces work digestive system means selection smaller digestive organs tissue energetically smaller digestive organs process food lower energetic cost larger cooking notable energy available food increases cooked also means less time spent looking humans living cooked diets spend fraction day chewing compared extant primates living raw diets american girls boys spent average percent day chewing respectively hours per day compared chimpanzees spend hours day frees time used hunting raw diet means hunting constrained since time spent hunting time spent eating chewing plant material cooking reduces time required get days energy requirements allowing subsistence digestibility cooked carbohydrates approximately average higher digestibility noncooked increased energy intake free time savings made tissue used digestive system allowed selection genes larger brain size despite benefits brain tissue requires large amount calories hence main constraint selection larger brains calorie intake greater calorie intake support greater quantities brain tissue argued explain human brains much larger apes since humans ape engage food cooking food influenced genes extent research suggests humans live without study individuals consuming longterm raw diets found percentage diet made raw food andor length diet raw food increased bmi despite access many nonthermal processing like grinding pounding heating approximately billion neurons human brain kg body mass exclusively raw diet close extant primates would viable modelled argued would require infeasible level nine hours feeding every however contested alternative modelling showing enough calories could obtained within hours per scientists anthropologists point evidence brain size homo lineage started increase well advent cooking due increased consumption basic food processing slicing accounts size reduction organs related corn√©lio et

yet still example cultural shift diet resulting genetic evolution criticism comes controversy archaeological evidence available claim lack evidence fire control brain sizes first started wrangham argues anatomical evidence around time origin homo erectus million years ago indicates control fire hence cooking time largest reductions tooth size entirety human evolution occurred indicating softer
