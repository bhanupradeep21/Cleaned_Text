demand curve perfectly inelastic curve consequently price increase result loss customers price discrimination allows monopolist increase profit charging higher prices identical goods willing able pay example economic textbooks cost united states developing countries like ethiopia case publisher using governmentgranted copyright monopoly price discriminate generally wealthier american economics students generally poorer ethiopian economics students similarly patented medications cost us countries presumed poorer customer base typically high general price listed various market segments get varying discounts example framing make process charging people higher prices socially acceptablecitation needed perfect price discrimination would allow monopolist charge customer exact maximum amount would willing pay would allow monopolist extract consumer surplus market domestic example would cost airplane flights relation takeoff time closer flight higher plane tickets cost discriminating late planners often business flyers perfect price discrimination theoretical construct advances information technology micromarketing may bring closer realm possibility partial price discrimination cause customers inappropriately pooled high price customers excluded market example poor student us might excluded purchasing economics textbook us price student may able purchase ethiopian price similarly wealthy student ethiopia may able willing buy us price though naturally would hide fact monopolist pay reduced third world price deadweight losses decrease monopolists profits deadweight loss considered detrimental society market participation monopolists substantial economic interest improving market information market important information one remember considering monopoly model diagram associated conclusions displayed result monopoly prices higher production output lesser competitive company follow requirement monopoly charge different prices different customers monopoly restricted engaging price discrimination termed first degree price discrimination customers charged amount monopoly permitted charge individualised prices termed third degree price discrimination quantity produced price charged marginal customer would identical competitive company thus eliminating deadweight loss however gains trade social welfare would accrue monopolist none consumer essence every consumer would indifferent going completely without product service able purchase monopolistcitation needed long price elasticity demand customers less one absolute value advantageous company increase

cost company engage price discrimination charge profit maximizing price p displaystyle p customers circumstances customers would willing pay higher price p displaystyle p pay p displaystyle p would buy lower price price discrimination strategy charge less price sensitive buyers higher price price sensitive buyers lower thus additional revenue generated two sources basic problem identify

monopolies market power companys ability increase prices without losing customers company market power engage price discrimination perfect competition market form price discrimination would impossible perfectly competitive company perfectly elastic demand curve market three forms price discrimination first degree price discrimination charges consumer maximum price consumer willing pay second degree price discrimination involves quantity discounts third degree price discrimination involves grouping consumers according willingness pay measured price elasticities demand charging group different price third degree price discrimination prevalent three conditions must present company engage successful price discrimination first company must market second company must able sort customers according willingness pay third firm must able prevent resell company must degree market power practice price discrimination without market power company charge market market structure characterized downward sloping demand curve market power monopoly monopolistic competition market structure market power perfect company wishing practice price discrimination must able prevent middlemen brokers acquiring consumer surplus company accomplishes preventing limiting resale many methods used prevent resale instance persons required show photographic identification boarding pass boarding airplane travelers assume practice strictly matter security however primary purpose requesting photographic identification confirm ticket purchaser person board airplane someone repurchased ticket discount buyercitation needed inability prevent resale largest obstacle successful price companies however developed numerous methods prevent resale example universities require students show identification entering sporting events governments may make illegal resell tickets products boston red sox baseball tickets resold legally team three basic forms price discrimination first second third degree price discrimination first degree price discrimination company charges maximum price customer willing pay maximum price consumer willing pay unit good reservation price thus unit seller tries set price equal consumers reservation direct information consumers willingness pay rarely available sellers tend rely secondary information person lives postal codes example catalog retailers use mail highpriced catalogs highincome postal first degree price discrimination frequently occurs regard professional services transactions involving direct buyerseller negotiations example accountant prepared consumers tax return information used charge customers based estimate ability paya second degree price discrimination quantity discrimination customers charged different prices based much buy single price schedule consumers prices vary depending quantity good theory second degree price discrimination consumer willing buy certain quantity good given price companies know consumers willingness buy decreases units task seller identify price points reduce price one reached hope reduced price trigger additional purchases consumer example sell unit blocks rather individual units third degree price discrimination multimarket price seller divides consumers different groups according willingness pay measured price elasticity demand group consumers effectively becomes separate market demand curve marginal revenue firm attempts maximize profits segment equating mr generally company charges higher price group price inelastic demand relatively lesser price group elastic examples third degree price discrimination abound airlines charge higher prices business travelers vacation travelers reasoning demand curve vacation traveler relatively elastic demand curve business traveler relatively inelastic determinant price elasticity demand used segment markets example seniors elastic demand movies young adults generally free time thus theaters offer discount tickets seniorsb assume uniform pricing system monopolist would sell five units price per unit assume marginal cost per unit total revenue would total costs would profits would monopolist practiced price discrimination would sell first unit second unit listed table total revenue would total cost would profit would several things worth noting monopolist acquires consumer surplus eliminates practically deadweight loss willing sell anyone willing pay least marginal thus price discrimination promotes efficiency secondly pricing scheme price average revenue equals marginal revenue monopolist behaving like perfectly competitive thirdly discriminating monopolist produces larger quantity monopolist operating uniform pricing successful price discrimination requires companies separate consumers according willingness buy determining customers willingness buy good difficult asking consumers directly fruitless consumers dont know extent reluctant share information marketers two main methods determining willingness buy observation personal characteristics consumer actions noted information person lives postal codes person dresses kind car drives occupation income spending patterns helpful
