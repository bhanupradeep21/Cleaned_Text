cardiac fibroma also known cardiac fibromatosis cardiac fibrous hamartoma fibroelastic hamartoma heart fibroma heart second highest type primary cardiac tumor seen infants benign tumor made connective tissue fibroblast largely observed ventricles left ventricle common location cardiac fibroma accounts approximately cardiac fibroma cases followed right ventricle symptoms disease depend size tumor location relative conduction system whether obstructs blood flow twothirds children tumor asymptomatic showing signs symptoms therefore cause cardiac fibroma unexplained associated gorlin echocardiography primarily diagnostic method used detect individual cardiac resection tumor recommended however heart transplantation done surgery possible overall prognosis resection favorable chance recurrence scarcely signs symptoms cardiac fibroma nonspecific individuals experience arrhythmias dyspnea cyanosis chestpain sudden addition majority individuals cardiac fibroma asymptomatic therefore leading signs symptoms depend size location tumors range millimeters extensive tumors range x x instance individuals larger tumors due cardiac fibroma include conduction system heart demonstrate cardiac dysrhythmias cause cardiac fibroma still unknown however tumors found associated gorlin syndrome also known nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome nbccs nbccs genetic condition affects various parts body increases possibility acquiring distinct cancerous non cancerous mechanism behind cardiac fibromas still unclear fibromas homogeneous mass fibroblasts mixed abundance collagen elastic fibers masses represent mesenchymal growth lack mesenchymal elements blood vessels cartilage bone masses often entrap cardiomyocytes muscle cells make cardiac muscle cells decrease collagen content increase growth cardiac fibromas also slow produce detrimental physical effects due infiltration replacement myocardium protrude cavity heart tumors usually occur within anterior wall left ventricle interventricular septum rarely involves right large fibromas bulge cavity chamber interfering functions heart valves blood flow heart left ventricular obstructed outflow tract may give rise failed diagnosis congenital subaortic stenosis moreover cause severe congestive heart failure cardiac fibromas may present lymphocyte monocyte aggregates well areas calcification shown chest xray ct scan dimensions masses location cause clinical symptomscitation needed early precise diagnosis cardiac fibroma lead healing avoidance surgery echocardiography preferred initial method diagnosis cardiac fibroma due exams noninvasiveness reduced cost extensive availability echocardiography depicts morphologic appearance region motion hand additional examinations computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri also conducted additional diagnostic information ct exam provides precise spatial resolution tumor meanwhile mri provides comprehensive overview tissue characterization expose patient tumor biopsy utilized cardiac fibroma gold standard confirmation patient diagnosis cardiac fibroma family medical history physical examination individual also used diagnostic method close examination heart concluded along careful detection abnormal heart cardiac fibroma commonly treated surgical excision procedures removal cardiac tumor requires open heart surgery surgery tumor tissues around removed reduce risk tumor recovery surgery days hospital weeks total echocardiogram taken every year surgery make sure tumor returned formed new hand surgery possible heart transplantation cardiac fibromas infancy unable removed surgically due size extensive myocardial infiltration poor prognosis due high ratio tumortoheart size may produce low cardiac output result lead poorer result defibrillator implantation cardiac transplantation may however tumors able surgically removed even incompletely good prognosis longterm survival surgical resection favorable chance recurrence scarcely cardiac fibromas account primary cardiac tumors children therefore leading second common benign cardiac tumor children however rarely found adults mainly found infants age literature survey epidemiology pathology cardiac fibroma study researchers searched literature databases cardiac fibroma find factors predict poor outcomes lead death researchers found patients survive significantly younger survive results suggest younger individuals diagnosed cardiac fibroma associated poorer researchers found significant difference maximum diameter tumor age groups however although younger individuals smaller hearts high ratio tumortoheart sizes may generate low cardiac output leads poor outcome addition literature revealed patients cardiac fibroma diagnosed prenatal neonatal periods resulting tumor certain size regardless childs age findings suggest cardiac fibromas may congenital successful surgical excision large cardiac fibroma asymptomatic child girl asymptomatic underwent successful surgical excision large cardiac fibroma individual frequent coughs therefore underwent several diagnostic exams diagnose cause frequent cough cardiac mass found echocardiograph later confirmed magnetic resonance imaging cardiac mass monitored hours showed sinus rhythms normal variability addition mass dimensions x mm apical area left ventricle surgical procedure recommended due risk ventricular arrhythmias sudden cardiac death surgery success physicians able remove entire tumor without complications followup evaluations sixmonths year showed patient good health signs tumor primary cardiac tumors children centers experience department cardiac surgery childrens hospital china conducted study analyze different characteristics outcomes pediatric patients primary cardiac tumors treated sixteen patients primary cardiac tumors ages years patients diagnosed echocardiography mri ct patients able get successful remove mass one patient partial resection however one patient die surgery due low cardiac output syndrome five days initial surgery remove pathological examination cardiac masses showed rhabdomyoma frequent tumor children followed myxoma fibromas morbidity
