durham tubes used microbiology detect production gas microorganisms simply smaller test tubes inserted upside another test tube freely movable culture media tested added larger tube sterilized also eliminates initial air gap produced tube inserted upside culture media typically contains single substance tested organism determine whether organism ferment particular carbohydrate inoculation incubation gas produced form visible gas bubble inside small litmus solution also added culture media give visual representation ph changes occur production method first reported british microbiologist herbert one limitation durham tube allow precise determination type gas produced within inner tube measurements quantity gas however durham argued quantitive measurements limited value culture solution absorb gas unknown variable additionally using durham tubes provide evidence fermentation may able detect slow weaklyfermenting organisms resultant carbon dioxide diffuses back solution quickly negative test using durham tubes indicate decisive physiological httpsenwikipediaorgwikidurhamtube
