carbophenothion also known stauffer r manufacturer stauffer organophosphorus chemical compound used pesticide citrus name carbophenothion used insecticide although used anymore still restricted use pesticide united chemical identified us extremely hazardous substance according emergency planning community righttoknow carbophenothion highly toxic organophosphate insecticide acaricide organophosphates acetylcholinesterase inhibitors disrupt signal transduction cholinergic classified restricted use pesticide rup environmental protection agency carbophenothion used different brands like trithion pesticide contains carbophenothion active ingredient widespread use organophosphates nineties us common cause agricultural example toxicity carbophenothion poisoning seven family members flour used food probably contaminated carbophenothion members became ill four six hours ingestion symptoms nausea vomiting besides one family member lost consciousness family members regained full strength six since carbophenothion highly toxic may used certified applicators people directly supervised twoday safety waiting interval application required prevent unnecessary skin compound synthetically produced pure compound colorless yellowbrown liquid soluble industrial miscible organic compounds like alcohols ketones carbophenothion evaluated joint meeting pesticide residues jmpr meeting temporary tolerances recommended food like several fruits nuts milk form acceptable daily intake adi tolerances reevaluated data adis based available adis withdrawn use carbophenothion time

colorless yellowbrown liquid mild mercaptanlike odor rotten eggs boiling point melting point unknown relatively stable heat carbophenothion lipophilic therefore insoluble water noncorrosive oxidized phosphorothioate carbophenothion degraded atmosphere reaction photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals half life reaction estimated two hours reaction occur often due low vapor pressure carbophenothion mm hg susceptible direct photolysis absorbs little uv light none nm important fate may carbophenothion synthesized two steps hydrogen chloride formaldehyde sodium oodiethyl dithiophosphate first react hydrogen chloride formaldehyde second step reacts sodium oodiethyl dithiophosphate carbophenothion sodium reactions occur spontaneously shown figure carbophenothions mechanism action mechanism toxicity acts inhibition cholinesterase essential enzyme production neurotransmitters containing cholinebased esters example acetylcholine inability produce neurotransmitters causes failure neuron cell signal transduction widespread effects see adverse effects effectiveness carbophenothion enhanced long residual activity easy uptake insects carbophenothions mainly lipophilic character causes linger plants applied surrounding ground extended periods time makes effective eggs laid treated plants another advantage lipophilic character readily enters insects sheer metabolism carbophenothion human beings comparable metabolism mice insects plants little data quantitative degradation carbophenothion oxidative hydrolytic compounds mammals found rat administered dose excreted urine within hours carbophenothion therefore estimated rapidly excreted humans compound toxic metabolized acute toxicity majority metabolites carbophenothion studied rats considerably less toxic thus show metabolism carbophenothion probably involve bioactivation rather detoxification two main products metabolism sulphoxide five oxidative products identified oxygen analogue carbophenothion sulphoxide oxygen analogue finally sulphones oxygen analogue depicted right first major route degradation carbophenothion rats sulfoxidation displayed right product transformed acid second major route involves formation transformed via methylation ringhydroxylation methyl sulfone converted approximately equal proportions sulphate glucuronide furthermore metabolites presumably arise cleavage ps bond methyl sulphone overview metabolites occurrence studied rats found table one study rats found hours administered carbophenothion excreted urine according experiments takes approximately six days complete excretion studies say even days detectable level oxidation product carbophenothion used insecticide acaricide main use protect citrus fruit also used protect cotton aphids plant lice spider mites furthermore used combination petroleum well function pesticide numerous pests fruits nuts vegetables sorghum maize others besides used control parasites trithion garrathion lethox three examples pesticide brands work carbophenothion trithion carbophenothion humans exposed carbophenothion show wide variety symptoms produces illness typical cholinesterase inhibitors vomiting nausea diarrhea excessive salivation common examples someone exposed via inhalation may suffer rhinorrhea tight feeling chest carbophenothion affects activity nerves brain symptoms like mental confusion profound weakness drowsiness observed well someone exposed absorption skin get muscle contractions well longterm effect
