cytokine storm also called hypercytokinemia pathological reaction humans animals innate immune system causes uncontrolled excessive release proinflammatory signaling molecules called cytokines cytokines normal part bodys immune response infection sudden release large quantities may cause multisystem organ failure cytokine storms may caused infectious noninfectious etiologies especially viral respiratory infections influenza influenza influenza b parainfluenza virus causative agents include epsteinbarr virus cytomegalovirus group streptococcus noninfectious conditions graftversushost viruses invade lung epithelial cells alveolar macrophages produce viral nucleic acid stimulates infected cells release cytokines chemokines activating macrophages dendritic cells cytokine storm syndrome diverse set conditions result cytokine storm cytokine storm syndromes include familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis epsteinbarr hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis systemic nonsystemic juvenile idiopathic macrophage activation syndrome macrophage activation syndrome cytokine release syndrome term cytokine storm often loosely used interchangeably cytokine release syndrome crs
