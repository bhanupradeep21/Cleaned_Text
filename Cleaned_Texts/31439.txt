using mazes published many experimental articles paper ritchie kalish probably influential major theoretical contributions came book purposive behavior animals men series papers psychological review determinants behavior choice point cognitive maps rats men principles performance tolmans early researches early developments called behavioral genetics tolman would selectively breed rats ability learn mazes constructed despite major research focus involved instinct purpose open idea researching innate abilities rats tolmans study first experiment examine genetic basis maze learning breeding distinct lineages rats selected maze performance tolman started continued research project coming back europe sabbatical leave interest started tolmans theoretical model described paper determiners behavior choice point three different variables influence behavior independent intervening dependent variables experimenter manipulate independent variables independent variables eg stimuli provided turn influence intervening variables eg motor skill independent variables also factors subject experimenter specifically chooses dependent variables eg speed number errors allows psychologist measure strength intervening although tolman firmly behaviorist methodology radical behaviorist like b f skinner studies learning rats tolman sought demonstrate animals could learn facts world could subsequently use flexible manner rather simply learning automatic responses triggered environmental stimuli language time tolman ss stimulusstimulus nonreinforcement theorist drew gestalt psychology argue animals could learn connections stimuli need explicit biologically significant event make learning occur known latent learning rival theory much mechanistic sr stimulusresponse reinforcementdriven view taken clark l hull key paper tolman ritchie kalish demonstrated rats learned layout maze explored freely without reinforcement trials food item placed certain point maze rats learned navigate point however hull followers able produce alternative explanations tolmans findings debate ss sr learning theories became increasingly complicated skinners iconoclastic paper entitled theories learning necessary persuaded many psychologists interested animal learning productive focus behavior rather using make hypotheses mental states influence tolmans ideas faded temporarily later needed however achievements considerable papers produced answer hulls charge left rat buried thought maze unable respond anticipated prepared ground much later work cognitive psychology psychologists began discover apply decision theory stream work recognized award nobel prize daniel kahneman paper cognitive maps rats men tolman introduced concept cognitive map found extensive application almost every field psychology frequently among scientists unaware using early ideas formulated explain behavior rats tolman assessed response learning place learning response learning rat knows response going certain way maze always lead food place learning rats learn associate food specific spot trials observed rats placelearning maze learned run correct path within eight trials none responselearning rats learned quickly even learn seventytwo furthermore psychologists began renew study animal cognition last quarter century renewed interested animal research prompted experiments cognitive psychology aside contributions tolman made learning theory purposive behaviorism latent learning also wrote article view ways learning wrote works involving psychology sociology tolman

subordinate acts persist purpose adjustment humans unique think actions ahead time tolman called thoughtsofacts thinkingofacts prevents us acting completely random something finally works thinkingofacts triggers inhibitory process prevents determining adjustment cuing subordinate acts following thinking prepotent stimulus turns thoughts acts two ways stimulus would considered prepotent
