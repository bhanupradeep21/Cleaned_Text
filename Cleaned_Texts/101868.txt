cognitive psychology intertrial priming accumulation priming effect multiple trials priming effect exposure one stimulus subsequently presented stimuli intertrial priming occurs target feature characteristic distinguishes targets nontargets repeated one trial next typically results speeded response times target target stimulus participants required search example intertrial priming occurs task respond either red green target response time red target faster preceding trial also red visual attention influenced top bottom attentional processes topdown attention allocated based observers current knowledge stimuli participants experiment might instructed search respond target object presented display different colour objects presented simultaneously top knowledge dimension target ie colour speed response times target bottomup attention involuntarily automatically directed towards salient features environment bright colour among dull colours experimental settings different stimulus stimuli visual display salient bottomup attention typically guided observers goals knowledge physical properties many studies employ various methods involving intertrial priming assess contribution top versus bottom processes guiding attention visual search tasks factors visual search tasks top versus bottom dichotomy take consideration selection biases explained physical saliency bottom observer goals top studies found stimuli equally salient connected rewards draw participants attention even choice doesnt match selection goals alternative framework proposed past selection history current goals physical salience integrated model attentional intertrial priming important aspect consider designing experiment influence results consideredcontrolled intertrial priming often measured using visual search task typical visual search task involves participants searching responding target amongst group nontarget items intertrial priming performance generally measured recording participants reaction times identify target comparing times across trials different trial designs visual search tasks employed measure intertrial priming studies often compare blocked mixed visual search trials measure intertrial priming blocked trials multiple successively presented visual search trials include target mixed trials randomised series trials trial consisting different example blocked trial condition may include searching green circle trial multiple successive preceding trials whereas mixed trial condition may include searching green circle trial red circle proceeding trials blocking trials control effects variability targets target defining feature repeated across trials blocked conditions participants reaction times faster target across trials mixed repetition effect also cumulative number target repetitions increases certain point participants reaction times faster time exposed target repeated mixed blocked trials disparity intertrial priming results faster reaction times blocked reaction times may faster blocked trials participants required respond targets differ one dimension nontargets cue presentation stimulus prior trial inform participant upcoming target feature example blue circle may shown trial signify blue circle target upcoming trial target relevant cues may presented participants decrease reaction time target display cues may valid invalid valid cues correctly predict target stimulus invalid cues example target upcoming trial blue circle blue circle presented cue would valid red circle presented cue would invalid correctly predict blue circle target stimulus reaction times valid cues typically faster reaction times invalid phenomenon known cueing valid cue low probability correct target prediction still reliable cueing

faster response valid trials participants aware likelihood presented valid trial low popout search tasks include target differs one dimension group homogeneous nontarget dimension categorical feature stimulus colour ie red target among green nontargets shape square target among circle nontargets orientation vertically presented target among horizontal nontargets response times popout searches generally faster targets colour targets distractors remains throughout trials slower colours switched conjunctive search involves nontarget stimuli one dimension common target stimulus example target green circle conjunctive search nontargets distractors could red circles green target share one dimension common one set nontargets ie shape another dimension common nontarget group ie colour target distractor features consecutive trials response times faster dimensions dimensionweighting account visual selection states limit attentional weight allocated particular dimension object one time dimensions stimuli perceived important observer allocated attentional weight ie target visual search resulting faster detection times target dimension known advance increase saliency signals target hand target dimension unknown attentional weight shifted target dimension target dimensions remain across trials change attentional weight required resulting faster reaction times intertrial priming popout suggests performance visual search task involving popout target affected search history specific target features previous trials target distractor features repeated subsequent trials reaction times faster features change across hypothesis proposes repetition target used preceding trial makes popout features salient observer therefore increases likelihood observer attend episodic retrieval suggests reduced response times intertrial priming due observers retrieval episodic memories relevant hypothesis states visual search composed three successive stages processing hypothesis argues target presented previous trial presented current trial processing target accelerated target decision stage model identification target verified assess whether matches previous target stored episodic memory many theories focus repetition target features dominant explanation repetition effects seen intertrial priming target features consecutive trials distractor features changed response times fast target distractor features kept constant suggests intertrial priming may mainly due distractor feature repetition target feature repetition influences slightly distractorbased priming may due faster
