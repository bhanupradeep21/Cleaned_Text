ensembl genomes scientific project provide genomescale data nonvertebrate project run european bioinformatics institute launched using ensembl main objective ensembl genomes database complement main ensembl database introducing five additional web pages include genome data bacteria fungi invertebrate metazoa plants domains ensembl tools available manipulation analysis visualization genome data ensembl genomes data stored mysql relational databases accessed ensembl rest interface perl api biomart ensembl genomes open project code tools data available ensembl ensembl genomes software uses apache license key feature ensembl genomes graphical interface allows users scroll genome observe relative location features conceptual annotation eg genes snp loci sequence patterns eg repeats experimental data eg sequences external sequence features mapped onto graphical views available varying levels resolution entire karyotype sequence single exon information genome spread four tabs species page location tab gene tab transcript tab providing information higher resolution searching particular species using ensembl genomes redirects species page often brief description species provided well links information statistics genome graphical interface tools available karyotype available species ensembl karyotype available link gene assembly section species page alternatively users location tab also view karyotype selecting whole genome lefthand menu users click location within karyotype zoom one specific chromosome genomic open location tab location tab users browse genes variations sequence conservation types annotation along region detail highly configurable scalable users choose want see clicking configure page button bottom lefthand menu adding removing tracks users able select type data want included data following categories easily added removed location tab view sequence assembly genes transcripts mrna protein alignments dna alignments germline variation comparative genomics among users also change display options option allows users reset configuration back default specific information select gene found gene tab users get page searching desired gene search bar clicking gene id clicking one genes shown location tab view gene tab contains genespecific information gene structure number transcripts position chromosome homology information form gene information accessed via menu lefthand side transcript tab also appear user chooses view gene transcript tab contains much information gene tab however focused one ensembl genomes allows comparing visualising user data browsing karyotypes genes ensembl genomes views include add data manage data button allow user upload new tracks containing reads sequences ensembl genomes modify data previously uploaded data visualised region views whole karyotype uploaded data localised using chromosome coordinates bac clone following methods used upload data file ensembl genomes following file types supported ensembl data uploaded temporarily servers registered users log save data future reference possible share access uploaded data using assigned users also allowed delete custom tracks ensembl genomes biomart programming free search engine incorporated ensembl ensembl genomes except ensembl bacteria purpose mining extracting genomic data ensembl databases table formats like html tsv csv release ensembl genomes following data available biomarts purpose biomarts ensembl genomes allow user mine download tables containing genes single species genes specific region chromosome genes one region chromosome associated interpro biomarts also include filters refine data extracted attributes variant id chromosome name ensembl id location etc appear final table file selected user biomarts accessed online corresponding domain ensembl genomes source code installed unix environment biomart git blast interface provided allow users search dna protein sequences ensembl genomes accessed header located top ensembl genome pages titled blast blast search configured search individual species collections species maximum taxonomic browser allow selection taxonomically related ensembl genomes provides second sequence search tool uses algorithm based exonerate provided european nucleotide tool accessed header located top ensembl genome pages titled sequence search users choose whether would like exonerate search species ensembl genomes division species ensembl genomes also choose maximum evalue limit results appear evalues maximum finally users choose use alternative search mode selecting use spliced query variant effect predictor one used tools ensembl ensembl genomes allows explore analyse effect variants snps cnvs indels structural variations particular gene sequence protein transcript transcription use vep users must input location variants nucleotide variations generate following two ways users access vep first form onlinebased page user generates input selection following data upload vep supports vcf pileup hgvs notations default default format whitespaceseparated file contains data columns first five columns indicate chromosome start location end location allele pair alleles separated reference allele first strand forward sixth column variation identifier optional left blank vep assign identifier output file vep also provides additional identifier options users extra options complement output filtering options allow features like removal known variants results returning variants exons restriction results specific consequences vep users also possibility viewing manipulating jobs associated session browsing recent tickets tab tab users view status search success queued running failed save delete resubmit second option use vep downloading source code use unix features equal online script versions vep also used online instances like galaxy vep job completed output tabular file contains following common output formats vep include json vdf ensembl genomes rest interface allows access data using favourite programming language also access data using perl api biomart ensembl genomes makes attempt include possible genomes
