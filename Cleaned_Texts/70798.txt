anopheles gambiae sensu lato recognized species complex gambiae complex consists individual species complex morphologically difficult distinguish although possible larvae adult females species exhibit different behavioural traits example anopheles quadriannulatus saltwater mineralwater species melas merus saltwater species remainder freshwater anopheles quadriannulatus generally takes blood meal
