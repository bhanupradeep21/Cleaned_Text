lactobacillus bulgaricus one published species lactobacillus genome complex verified body main bacterium used production yogurt also plays crucial role ripening well processes involving naturally fermented products defined homofermentive lactic acid bacteria due lactic acid single end product carbohydrate digestion also considered grampositive rod may appear long filamentous nonmotile form spores also nonpathogenic regarded aciduric acidophilic since requires low ph around grow effectively addition grows raw dairy products creates maintains acidic environment needs thrive via production lactic acid addition grows optimally temperatures anaerobic conditions complex nutritional requirements vary according environment include carbohydrates unsaturated fatty acids amino acids vitamins first identified bulgarian doctor stamen grigorov isolating later termed lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus bulgarian yogurt bacteria found naturally gastrointestinal tract mammals living shopluk mesoregion balkan peninsulaoriginal research one strain lactobacillus bulgaricus extracted leaves galanthus nivalis snowdrop flower bacterium also grown artificially many countries lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus commonly used alongside streptococcus starter making yogurt lb bulgaricus strain used decades yogurt fermentation two species work synergy l bulgaricus producing amino acids milk proteins used relationship considered symbiotic species produce lactic gives yogurt tart flavor acts preservative resulting decrease ph also partially coagulates milk proteins casein resulting yogurts fermenting milk l bulgaricus produces acetaldehyde one main yogurt aroma strains l bulgaricus l bulgaricus also produce shown kill undesired bacteria vitro viability lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus extremely important necessary efficient fermentation effectively keep food products produces spoiling freezedrying preferred method preserving viability cells cells survive due usefulness natural fermentation processes specifically makes fermented food products cows milk great economic importance biggest importers bacterium japan united states european union also considered contaminant beer due homofermentative production lactic acid offflavor many styles beer styles beer however lactic acid bacteria contribute overall appearance aroma taste andor mouthfeel generally produce otherwise pleasing lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus first identified stamen grigorov named bacillus ilya metchnikoff professor pasteur institute paris researched relationship longevity bulgarians consumption yogurt idea aging caused putrefactive activity proteolysis microbes produce toxic substances intestine proteolytic bacteria clostridia part normal intestinal flora produce toxic substances including phenols ammonia indols digestion proteins compounds responsible metchnikoff called intestinal autointoxication according cause physical changes associated old age already known time fermentation lactic acid bacteria inhibits deterioration milk low ph metchnikoffs research also noted rural populations southeastern europe russian steppes daily consume milk fermented lactic acid bacteria live relatively longer populations based data metchnikoff proposed consumption fermented milk seeds intestine harmless lactic acid bacteria increasing intestinal acidity suppressing growth proteolytic results questioned study showed bacterium could survive human intestines idea nevertheless started research actually useful lactobacillus bulgaricus constituent declared indias national found study involving development realtime polymerase chain reaction qpcr assay quantifying lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus well streptococcus thermophilus cows milk cheese goal study create way identify quantify lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus streptococcus thermophilus two lactic acid producing species crucial fermentation ripening cheese timely manner use qpcr two essays using lacz gene targeting pcr primers resulted study deemed compatible two lactic acid bacteria lab species allowed direct quantification lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus streptococcus thermophilus cheese produced unpasteurized cows study posed question whether lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus effect antigenicity four kinds milk proteins αlactalbumin αla βlactoglobulin βlg αcasein αcn βcasein βcn proteins main proteins found cows milk known antigenic properties humans especially young children infants young children infants experience cows milk protein allergy cmpa harmful effects development may even result death allergy facilitated antigenicity milk proteins ability proteins trigger immune response body result number possible allergic reactions study performed simulating digestion unfermented milk milk fermented exposure lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus compare antigenicities order see

antigenicity αla βcn however also increased antigenicity αcn βlg efficiency lactic acid bacteria cryopreservation consistent may lead cell death lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus adapted defend cold stress way cells react cold changing fluidity cellular membrane particular bacterium acquired different tactics fight cold stress first way cope cold increase viscosity taking compounds disaccharides polysaccharides amino acids antioxidants second strategy used performed inducing active responses fermentation postfermentation processes modifying change temperature ph medium composition results specific metabolic pathways becoming active synthesis cold shock study done see effects six different substances growth freeze drying lactobacillus using lactobacillus starter cultures dairy industry depends number viable active cells currently preferred method preserve bacterial cells freezedrying however also results strains killed due various complications freezedrying including formation ice crystals loss membrane fluidity denaturation important macromolecules regardless freezedrying used decades microbiological research way store stabilize cultures six substances sodium chloride sorbitol mannitol mannose monosodium glutamate betaine tested determine effect survivability cells freezedrying three six substances added positive effect growth freezedrying
