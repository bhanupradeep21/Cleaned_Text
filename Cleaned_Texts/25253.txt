caliciaceae family mostly lichenforming fungi belonging class lecanoromycetes division ascomycota although family classification changed several times throughout taxonomic history use modern molecular phylogenetic methods helped establish current placement order caliciales caliciaceae contains genera species largest genus buellia around species dozen genera contain single species caliciaceae grow
