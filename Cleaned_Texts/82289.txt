vocal pedagogy study art science voice instruction used teaching singing assists defining singing singing works proper singing technique accomplished vocal pedagogy covers broad range aspects singing ranging physiological process vocal production artistic aspects interpretation songs different genres historical eras typical areas study different concepts part developing proper vocal technique voice teachers opinions within every topic study causes variations pedagogical approaches vocal technique within western culture study vocal pedagogy began ancient greece scholars alypius pythagoras studied made observations art singing unclear however whether greeks ever developed systematic approach teaching singing little writing subject survives first surviving record systematized approach teaching singing developed medieval monasteries roman catholic church sometime near beginning century fields study monasteries center musical intellectual life medieval period many men within monasteries devoted time study music art singing highly influential development vocal pedagogical system monks johannes de garlandia jerome moravia first develop concept vocal registers men identified three registers chest voice throat voice head voice pectoris guttoris capitis concept head voice however much similar modern pedagogists understanding falsetto register concepts discussed monastic system included vocal resonance voice classification breath support diction tone quality name ideas developed within monastic system highly influenced development vocal pedagogy next several centuries including bel canto style onset renaissance century study singing began move outside church courts rich patrons dukes burgundy supported burgundian school francoflemish school became secular centers study singing areas musical study vocal pedagogical methods taught schools however based concepts developed within monastic system many teachers within schools initial musical training singing church choirs children church also remained forefront musical composition time remained highly influential shaping musical tastes practices outside church catholic church first popularized use castrato singers century ultimately led popularity castrato voices baroque classical development opera century vocal pedagogy began break away established thinking monastic writers develop deeper understandings physical process singing relation key concepts like vocal registration vocal resonation also time noted voice teachers began emerge giulio caccini example important early italian voice late century bel canto method singing began develop italy style singing huge impact development opera development vocal pedagogy classical romantic periods time teachers composers first began identify singers write roles specific voice types however century clearly defined voice classification systems like german fach system emerged within systems descriptive terms used classifying voices coloratura soprano lyric voice teachers century continued train singers careers opera manuel patricio rodríguez garcía often considered one important voice teachers century credited development laryngoscope beginning modern voice pedagogy field voice pedagogy became fully developed middle century american voice teachers began study science anatomy physiology singing especially ralph appelman indiana university oren brown washington university school medicine later juilliard school william vennard university southern california shift approach study singing led rejection many assertions bel canto singing method particularly areas vocal registration vocal result currently two predominating schools thought among voice teachers today maintain historical positions bel canto method choose embrace contemporary understandings based current knowledge human anatomy physiology also teachers borrow ideas perspectives creating hybrid appelman vennard also part group voice instructors developed courses study beginning voice teachers adding scientific ideas standard exercises empirical ways improve vocal technique subject voice pedagogy beginning included many college music degree programs singers vocal music recent works authors richard miller johan sundberg increased general knowledge voice teachers scientific practical aspects voice pedagogy continue studied discussed professionals addition creation organisations national association teachers singing international organization vocal instructors enabled voice teachers establish consensus work expanded understanding singing teachers basically three major approaches vocal pedagogy theyre related mechanistic psychological controls employed singing voice instructors advocate extreme mechanistic approach believes singing largely matter getting right physical parts right places right time correcting vocal faults accomplished calling direct attention parts working well extreme school thought believes attention never directed part vocal singing matter producing right mental images desired tone correcting vocal faults achieved learning think right thoughts releasing emotions interpretation music voice teachers however believe truth lies somewhere two extremes adopt composite two four physical processes involved producing vocal sound respiration phonation resonation articulation processes occur following sequence although four processes considered separately actual practice merge one coordinated function effective singer speaker one rarely reminded process involved mind body coordinated one perceives resulting unified function many vocal problems result lack coordination within basic sense respiration process moving air exhalation sound produced larynx producing sound would possible without power source flow air lungs flow sets vocal folds motion produce breathing singing speaking controlled process ordinary breathing used sustaining life controls applied exhalation particularly important good vocal phonation process producing vocal sound vibration vocal folds turn modified resonance vocal takes place larynx vocal folds brought together breath pressure applied way vibration ensues causing audible source acoustic energy ie sound modified articulatory actions rest vocal apparatus vocal folds brought together primarily action interarytenoid muscles pull arytenoid cartilages vocal resonation process basic product phonation enhanced timbre andor intensity airfilled cavities passes way outside air various terms related resonation process include amplification enrichment enlargement improvement intensification prolongation although strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question main point drawn terms singer speaker end result resonation make better seven areas may listed possible vocal resonators sequence lowest within body highest areas chest tracheal tree larynx pharynx oral cavity nasal cavity research shown larynx pharynx oral cavity main resonators vocal sound nasal cavity coming play nasal consonants nasal vowels found french main resonating space vocal folds lips known vocal tract many voice users experience sensations sinuses may misconstrued resonance however sensations caused sympathetic vibrations result rather cause efficient vocal articulation process joint product vibrator resonators shaped recognizable speech sounds muscular adjustments movements speech organs adjustments movements articulators result verbal communication thus form essential difference human voice musical instruments singing without understandable words limits voice nonverbal relation physical process singing vocal instructors tend focus active articulation opposed passive articulation five basic active articulators lip labial consonants flexible front tongue coronal consonants middleback tongue dorsal consonants root tongue together epiglottis pharyngeal consonants glottis glottal consonants articulators act independently two may work together called coarticulation unlike active articulation passive articulation continuum without many clearcut boundaries places linguolabial interdental interdental dental dental alveolar alveolar palatal palatal velar velar uvular merge one another consonant may pronounced somewhere named places addition front tongue used may upper surface blade tongue makes contact laminal consonants tip tongue apical consonants surface subapical consonants articulations also merge one another without clear boundaries interpretation sometimes listed voice teachers fifth physical process even though strictly speaking physical process reason interpretation influence kind sound singer makes ultimately achieved physical action singer although teachers may acquaint students musical styles performance practices suggest certain interpretive effects voice teachers agree interpretation taught students lack natural creative imagination aesthetic sensibility learn someone else failure interpret well vocal fault even though may affect vocal sound vocal sounds divided two basic wide variety subclassifications voice teachers serious voice students spend great deal time studying voice forms vowels consonants studying problems certain consonants vowels may cause singing international phonetic alphabet used frequently voice teachers describing vocal sound inexact science largely human voice selfcontained instrument since vocal instrument internal singers ability monitor sound produced complicated vibrations carried ear eustachean auditory tube bony structures head neck words singers hear something different earshead person listening hears result voice teachers often focus less sounds feels vibratory sensations resulting closely related processes phonation resonation kinesthetic ones arising muscle tension movement body position weight serve guide singer correct vocal production another problem describing vocal sound lies vocal vocabulary many schools thought within vocal pedagogy different schools adopted different terms sometimes artistic disciplines led use plethora descriptive terms applied voice always understood mean thing terms sometimes used describe quality voices sound warm white dark light round reedy spread focused covered swallowed forward ringing hooty bleaty plummy mellow pearshaped singing process functions best certain physical conditions body exist ability move air body freely obtain needed quantity air seriously affected body alignment various parts breathing mechanism sunken chest position limit capacity lungs tense abdominal wall inhibit downward travel diaphragm good body alignment allows breathing mechanism fulfill basic function efficiently without undue expenditure energy good body alignment also makes easier initiate phonation tune resonators proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension body voice instructors also noted singers assume good body alignment often provides greater sense selfassurance poise performing audiences also tend respond better singers good body alignment habitual good body alignment also ultimately improves overall health body enabling better blood circulation preventing fatigue stress singing begins breath vocal sounds created vibrations larynx caused air lungs breathing everyday life subconscious bodily function occurs naturally however singer must control intake exhalation breath achieve maximum results voice natural breathing three stages breathingin period breathingout period resting recovery period stages usually consciously controlled within singing four stages breathing stages must conscious control singer become conditioned reflexes many singers abandon conscious controls reflexes fully conditioned ultimately leads chronic vocal european classical music opera voices treated like musical instruments composers write vocal music must understanding skills talents vocal properties singers voice classification process human singing voices evaluated thereby designated voice types qualities include limited vocal range vocal weight vocal tessitura vocal timbre vocal transition points breaks lifts within voice considerations physical characteristics speech level scientific testing vocal science behind voice classification developed within european classical music slow adapting modern forms singing voice classification often used within opera associate possible roles potential voices currently several different systems use within classical music including german fach system choral music system among many others system universally applied however classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories women typically divided three groups soprano mezzosoprano contralto men usually divided four groups countertenor tenor baritone bass considering childrens voices eighth term treble applied within major categories several subcategories identify specific vocal qualities like coloratura facility vocal weight differentiate within choral music singers voices divided solely basis vocal range choral music commonly divides vocal parts high low voices within sex satb result typical choral situation affords many opportunities misclassification since people medium voices must assigned part either high low mezzosoprano must sing soprano alto baritone must sing tenor bass either option present problems singer singers fewer dangers singing low singing within contemporary forms music sometimes referred contemporary commercial music singers classified style music sing jazz pop blues soul country folk rock styles currently authoritative voice classification system within nonclassical attempts made adopt classical voice type terms forms singing attempts met controversy development voice categorizations made understanding singer would using classical vocal technique within specified range using unamplified microphones vocal production since contemporary musicians use different vocal techniques microphones forced fit specific vocal role applying terms soprano tenor baritone etc misleading even many voice teachers warn dangers quick identification premature concern classification result misclassification attendant dangers vennard says never feel urgency classifying beginning student many premature diagnoses proved wrong harmful student embarrassing teacher keep striving illchosen goal best begin middle part voice work upward downward voice classifies voice teachers believe essential establish good vocal habits within limited comfortable range attempting classify voice techniques posture breathing phonation resonation articulation become established comfortable area true quality voice emerge upper lower limits range explored safely tentative classification arrived may adjusted voice continues many acclaimed voice instructors suggest teachers begin assuming voice medium classification proves otherwise reason majority individuals possess medium voices therefore approach less likely misclassify damage vocal registration refers system vocal registers within human voice register human voice particular series tones produced vibratory pattern vocal folds possessing quality registers originate laryngeal function occur vocal folds capable producing several different vibratory patterns vibratory patterns appears within particular range pitches produces certain characteristic term register somewhat confusing encompasses several aspects human voice term register used refer linguistics register language language combines tone vowel phonation single phonological system within speech pathology term vocal register three constituent elements certain vibratory pattern vocal folds certain series pitches certain type sound speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based physiology laryngeal function vocal fry register modal register falsetto register whistle register view also adopted many teachers voice teachers however organize registers differently dozen different constructs vocal registers use within field confusion exists concerning register many registers due part takes place modal register person sings lowest pitches register highest pitches frequency vibration vocal folds determined length tension mass pitch rises vocal folds lengthened tension increases thickness decreases words three factors state flux transition lowest highest singer holds factors constant interferes progressive state change laryngeal function tends become static eventually breaks occur obvious changes tone quality breaks often identified register boundaries transition areas registers distinct change break registers called passaggio vocal instructors teach study singer move effortlessly one register ease consistent tone registers even overlap singing teachers like use theory blending registers usually help students passage one register another hiding lift voice changes however many voice instructors disagree distinction boundaries blaming breaks vocal problems created static laryngeal adjustment permit necessary changes take place difference opinion effected different views vocal singing integrated coordinated act difficult discuss individual technical areas processes without relating others example phonation comes perspective connected respiration articulators affect resonance resonators affect vocal folds vocal folds affect breath control forth vocal problems often result breakdown one part coordinated process causes voice teachers frequently focus intensively one area process student issue resolved however areas art singing much result coordinated functions hard discuss traditional heading like phonation resonation articulation respiration voice student become aware physical processes make act singing processes function student begins task trying coordinate inevitably students teachers become concerned one area technique another various processes may progress different rates resulting imbalance lack coordination areas vocal technique seem depend strongly students ability coordinate various functions consider singing natural process skill requires highly developed muscle reflexes others consider ways singing considered singing require much muscle strength require high degree muscle coordination individuals develop voices careful systematic practice songs vocal exercises voice teachers instruct students exercise voices intelligent manner singers thinking constantly kind sound making kind sensations feeling several purposes vocal exercises important goal vocal development learn sing natural limits ones vocal range without undesired changes quality technique voice instructors teach singer achieve goal physical processes involved singing laryngeal action breath support resonance adjustment articulatory movement effectively working together voice teachers believe first step coordinating processes establishing good vocal habits comfortable tessitura voice first slowly expanding range beyond three factors significantly affect ability sing higher lower mckinney says three factors expressed three basic rules sing higher must use energy sing lower must use less sing higher must use space sing lower must use less sing higher must use depth sing lower must use voice teachers spend time working students general music knowledge skills particularly music theory music history musical styles practices relates vocal literature studied required may also spend time helping students become better sight readers often adopting solfège assigns certain syllables notes scale since singing performing art voice teachers spend time preparing students performance includes teaching students etiquette behavior stage bowing learning manage stage fright addressing problems like nervous tics use equipment microphones students may also preparing careers fields opera musical theater acting skills required many voice instructors spend time acting techniques audience communication
