aggression cattle usually result fear learning hormonal state however many factors contribute aggressive behaviors cattle despite fact bulls uncastrated male cattle generally significantly aggressive cows far reported cases cows attacking humans bulls majority farmrelated injuries fatalities cattle caused cows likely due fact far female cattle farm bulls statistically likelihood injury death cattle likely caused however also exacerbated fact many people unaware potential aggression cows especially immediately calving giving birth cows feel threatened seeking protect young temperament traits known traits explain behavior actions described traits responsible easily animal approached handled milked trained temperament also defined animal carries maternal behaviors subjected routine traits ability change animal ages environment animal lives changes time however proven regardless age environmental conditions individuals remain aggressive aggression cattle arise genetic environmental aggression cows worse bulls bulls horns bunt push strike horns cause damage overall humans aggressive behaviors cows include kicking crushing andor many types aggression seen animals particularly cattle including maternal feed comfort influencing pain induced stress induced aggressiveness many components maternal behavior seen cattle including behavior allows proper bonding mother baby nursing behavior attentiveness mother responds maternal behavior often seen cattle lactation prey species triggers maternal instinct protect young threat may use violent aggressive behaviors defense lactation prey species including cattle reduction fear responsiveness dam novel potentially dangerous situations facilitates expression defensive aggression protection young also proven however aggression performed protection offspring directed offspring could directly related commonly seen cattle due high stocking densities could potentially decrease amount space cow well limit ability access feed even impacting ruminal proven supplying feed water cattle housed together may heavily associated feed aggression aggressive actions towards others cows within loosehoused cattle feeding places noted highest amount aggressive aggressive behaviors associated lack comfort inadequate lying space time physical environment fails provide animal cow comfort plays important role well well maximizing production industry within many intensive production systems common see limited space resting associated negative behaviors providing appropriate space animal reduces resting lying behavior increasing irritability potential act aggressive behaviors although production systems provide limited space time lying uncomfortable stalls also known major problem comes lying behavior cattle decreasing quality resting area cows decrease resting time increase likelihood stress abnormal aggressive behaviors deprivation lyingresting behaviors proven affect responses within hypothalamic pituitary adrenal associated chronic stress lying time space act important regulators comfort induced aggression environmental factors may play role comfort animal temperature shown

spending lot time lying instead engaging aggressive head butting vocalizing pushing non aggressive behaviors licking walking due pain techniques low stress handling lsh used provides silence adequate restraint methods help minimize stress levels animals flight zones considered handling moving cattle blind spot may get spooked easily unaware individual around providing environments cows minimize
