among orders spiders found worldwide every continent except antarctica become established nearly every land habitat november spider species families recorded however debate among scientists families classified different classifications proposed since anatomically spiders arachnids differ arthropods usual body segments fused two tagmata cephalothorax prosoma opisthosoma abdomen joined small cylindrical pedicel however currently neither paleontological embryological evidence spiders ever separate thoraxlike division exists argument validity term cephalothorax means fused cephalon head thorax similarly arguments formed use term abdomen opisthosoma spiders contains heart respiratory organs organs atypical unlike insects spiders antennae except primitive group mesothelae spiders
