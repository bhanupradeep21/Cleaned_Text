tandem running pair movement coordination observed ants termites ants tandem running used social learning one ant leads another native ant nest food source found tandem running also used find choose better new nest sites colony follower ant maintains contact lead ant frequently touching leaders legs abdomen predators scavengers herbivores ants variety food sources may journey far meters nest spraying scent trail lead kin new food sources ants demonstrate one examples interactive teaching outside mammalian class social learning teaching requires naive observer change behavior acquire skills knowledge faster would independently teacher incur cost order follower ant learn landmarks leader must travel much slower make frequent stops check follower ultimately knowledge route new food source passed throughout colony one follower becomes leader making tandem running effective timesaving termites tandem running behavior used mating pair brief period alates winged adults disperse nests females males land ground shed wings run search mating partner upon encountering pair performs tandem run seeking suitable site colony tandem running termites involves communication via sex pheromones mating pairs engage process reasons tandem running termites considered form sexual behavior individual ants utilize celestial land cues well motion detection navigate scout foraging strategy finding food resources percent ants setting nest forage tandem studies found vision plays role navigation tandem runs plays role followers following leader follower dependent tactile phenomenal experiments researchers impair vision ants found blind ants likely follow lead could still occupy either role follower leader however pairs leader fully sighted tandem run usually smoother faster thus concluded sight used navigation along orientation systems mechanism ants perform tandem research shown leaders rely tactile feedback followers tandem run follower follow closely behind leader leader run rapidly tapped antennae tandem runs addition tactile signals ants may also use chemical cues pheromone trails help maintain bond ants facilitate learning assist chemical trails may allow followers stop examine landmarks rejoining leader leaders teachers likely lay trails forward tandem runs reverse tandem runs leaders deploy gaster forward tandem runs followers reverse tandem runs leaders deploy gaster middle position time ants learned route trails already laid followers less likely get follower ants necessarily naive foragers lead ants experimentally removed tandem runs percent follower ants successfully reached foraging area brief search providing evidence followers already experienced time takes leader reach food source tandem run increased however follower able find food source significantly faster tandem run compared searching alone additionally leader benefit another ant help carry food back experienced foraging ants often participate tandem runs follower familiar tree foraging site may trees sites often complex structures navigate leader may guide experienced ant new food source within also cost following ants get separated leader lost tandem run tandem running ants experimentally separated lab lost ants engaged searching behavior would often return point separated leader walking speed slowed almost benefit separated leader cases however independent exploration critical practice tandem running independent exploration ants discover new direct routes thus reduce duration subsequent tandem runs lead independent exploration basis route improvement tandem tandem running form recruitment communication involves teaching social learning experience influences tendency engage tandem running age temnothorax albipennis ages able participate tandem running experienced individuals likely older experienced ants also likely lead slowly precise young inexperienced ants capable leading following tandem runs lead faster less individual ant practices learn even ants able shorten length tandem runs transfer information faster independently explore area follower becoming independent exploration beneficial leads improved route accurate leadership tandem runs one bout independent exploration necessary improvement extra independent explorations improve tandem runs leader happens lose follower run may continue destination rather turning around find another follower chance independent exploration improve future tandem running combines social learning individual learning order maximize benefits practice exact information transferred follower leader known following ant acquires information would gotten found nest new nest site far old one tandem running allows followers find faster would used individual reticulitermes coptotermes female leads tandem releases shortrange sex pheromone guide male male touches females abdomen antennae mouthparts indicating continued presence pair accidentally separated females pause males engage intensive search partner sexually dimorphic movement facilitates encounter form tandem running behavior variable across termite species neoisopteran termites females strong sexpairing pheromones sex role strictly fixed heterosexual pairs females perform leader role males perform follower role hand sex role flexible also tandem running behavior used workers mastotermes reticulitermes speratus tandem running observed homosexual behavior males following males females following females order reduce predation participating tandem running termites increase encounter risk predators risk outweighed benefits decreasing postencounter risk predator able capture one animal time utilizing tandem running termites individual risk predation decreased dilution samesex tandem run reticulitermes speratus one individual expresses behavior sex femalefemale pairs follower female shows typical male behaviors malemale pairs leader males show typical female tandem running also used sexual selection termites often competition tandem running males termite back position male back position thus stronger larger pair tandem runners encounters female favor back
