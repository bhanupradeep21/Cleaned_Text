shingles also known herpes zoster viral disease characterized painful skin rash blisters localized typically rash occurs single wide mark either left right side body two four days rash occurs may tingling local pain common symptoms fever headache rash usually heals within two four however people develop ongoing nerve pain last months years condition called postherpetic neuralgia poor immune function rash may occur rash involves eye vision loss may shingles caused varicella zoster virus vzv also causes chickenpox case chickenpox also called varicella initial infection virus typically occurs childhood chickenpox resolved virus remain dormant inactive human nerve cells dorsal root ganglia cranial years may reactivate shingles results dormant varicella virus virus travels along nerve bodies nerve endings skin producing outbreak shingles exposure varicella virus found shingles blisters cause chickenpox someone yet chickenpox although person suffer shingles least first virus remains

presenting zoster sine herpete pain radiating along path single spinal nerve dermatomal distribution without accompanying rash condition may involve complications affect several levels nervous system cause many cranial neuropathies polyneuritis myelitis aseptic meningitis serious effects may occur cases include partial facial paralysis usually temporary ear damage although initial infections vzv pregnancy causing chickenpox may lead infection fetus complications newborn chronic infection reactivation shingles associated fetal slightly increased risk developing cancer shingles episode however mechanism unclear mortality cancer appear increase direct result presence instead increased risk may result immune suppression allows reactivation although shingles typically resolves within weeks certain complications may arise varicella zoster virus vzv high level infectivity worldwide shingles reactivation latent vzv infection zoster occur someone previously chickenpox varicella shingles relationship season occur epidemics however strong relationship increasing incidence rate shingles ranges per among younger healthy individuals increasing per among older incidence rates worldwide relationship age demonstrated many attributed fact cellular immunity declines people grow older another important risk factor risk factors include psychological according study north carolina black subjects significantly less likely develop zoster white unclear whether risk different sex potential risk factors include mechanical trauma exposure strong evidence genetic link link family history study showed people close relatives shingles twice likely develop study found adults latent vzv infection exposed intermittently children chickenpox receive immune periodic boost immune system helps prevent shingles older adults routine chickenpox vaccination introduced united states concern older adults would longer receive natural periodic boost would increase incidence shingles multiple studies surveillance data least viewed superficially demonstrate consistent trends incidence us since chickenpox vaccination program began however upon closer inspection two studies showed increase shingles incidence conducted among populations varicella vaccination yet widespread later study patel et al concluded since introduction chickenpox vaccine hospitalization costs complications shingles increased million annually age another study yih et al reported varicella vaccine coverage children increased incidence varicella decreased occurrence shingles among adults increased results study yawn et al showed increase shingles incidence likely incidence rate change future due aging population changes therapy malignant autoimmune diseases changes chickenpox vaccination rates wide adoption zoster vaccination could dramatically reduce incidence one study estimated contract shingles eventually present complications postherpetic neuralgia arises approximately people study california data
