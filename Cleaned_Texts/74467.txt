rfam database containing information noncoding rna ncrna families structured rna elements annotated open access database originally developed wellcome trust sanger institute collaboration janelia currently hosted european bioinformatics rfam designed similar pfam database annotating protein families unlike proteins ncrnas often similar secondary structure without sharing much similarity primary sequence rfam divides ncrnas families based evolution common ancestor producing multiple sequence alignments msa families provide insight structure function similar case protein families msas become useful addition secondary structure information rfam researchers also contribute wikipedias rna rfam database used variety functions ncrna family interface allows users view download multiple sequence alignments read annotation examine species distribution family members also links provided literature references rna databases rfam also provides links wikipedia entries created edited users interface rfam website allows users search ncrnas keyword family name genome well search ncrna sequence embl accession database information also available download installation use using infernal software infernal package also used rfam annotate sequences including complete genomes homologues known ncrnas database information secondary structure primary sequence represented msa combined statistical models called profile stochastic contextfree grammars scfgs also known covariance models analogous hidden markov models used protein family annotation pfam family database represented two multiple sequence alignments stockholm format scfg first msa seed alignment handcurated alignment contains representative members ncrna family annotated structural information seed alignment used create scfg used rfam software infernal identify additional family members add alignment familyspecific threshold value chosen avoid false positives release rfam used initial blast filtering step profile scfgs computationally expensive however latest versions infernal fast blast step longer second msa full alignment created result search using covariance model sequence database detected homologs aligned model giving automatically produced full alignment version rfam launched contained ncrna families annotated ncrna genes version released contained families annotating genes august version contained rna families current version released november annotates families httpsenwikipediaorgwikirfam
