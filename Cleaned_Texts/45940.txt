prostaglandin inhibitors drugs inhibit synthesis prostaglandin human various types prostaglandins responsible different physiological reactions maintaining blood flow stomach kidney regulating contraction involuntary muscles blood vessels act mediator inflammation cyclooxygenase cox phospholipase major enzymes involved prostaglandin production drug targets prostaglandin mainly classes prostaglandin inhibitors namely non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids glucocorticoids following sections medical uses side effects contraindications toxicity pharmacology prostaglandin inhibitors discussed nsaids used anti inflammatory antipyretic analgesic administered different routes namely oral rectal relieve mild moderate dosage forms available different nsaids respective medical uses discussed follows available dosage forms oral nsaids rectal nsaids topical nsaids shown following table common medical uses oral nsaids rectal nsaids topical nsaids shown following table oral nsaids commonly prescribed relieving symptoms common cold shown effective alleviate symptoms headache ear pain muscle pain however studies show nsaids effective treating cough blocked postoperative pain american society anesthesiologists task force acute pain management recommended use oral nsaids managing postoperative pain commonly used nsaids postoperative pain celecoxib trials shown drugs reduce pain least tolerable migraine therapeutic goals migraine treatment migraine prevention symptomatic majority oral nsaids ibuprofen mefenamic acid indomethacin shown effective treat prevent significant differences terms therapeutic effects almost equally potent migraine nsaids less side effects preferred migraine rectal nsaids diclofenac indomethacin administered prevention pancreatitis due endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp technique treating liver pancreatic acute pancreatitis common complication ercp therefore rectal nsaids given patients ercp measure prevent post ercp pancreatits trials showed rectal nsaids effective oral nsaids prevent post ercp pancreatitis exerts effects faster degree absorption topical nsaids mainly diclofenac prescribed patients effectively absorbed arms knees osteoarthritis disease commonly found elderly years old oral nsaids seldom used systemic side effects severe elderly therefore topical nsaids used osteoarthritis exert local analgesic effects minimize systemic side effects elderly glucocorticoids potent anti inflammatory mainly administered via oral pulmonary oral glucocorticoids mainly prescribed prevention chronic disease exacerbation inhalable glucocorticoids effective treating small airways commonly used maintenance chronic diseases relieve symptoms acute flare airway inflammations dosage forms available different glucocorticoids medical uses discussed follows available dosage forms oral glucocorticoids inhalable glucocorticoids shown following table common medical uses oral glucocorticoids inhalable glucocorticoids summarized following table rheumatoid arthritis auto immune disorder affect common symptoms warm painful swollen glucocorticoids exert anti inflammatory effects relieve symptoms inhibiting synthesis prostaglandin leukotriene release collagenase lysosomal inhalable glucocorticoids major drugs used asthma treatment suppress airway inflammation asthma inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis enhancing gene expression anti inflammatory proteins suppressing inflammatory also dilate airway reducing production leukotriene potent bronchoconstrictor short term use nsaids rather safe manifestations severe side effects commonly seen chronic use chronic use nsaids inhibit synthesis prostaglandins thromboxanes leads renal results decreased blood flow therefore patients taking nsaids long term higher risk developing chronic renal diseases nephrotoxicity due reduced renal perfusion nsaids inhibit prostaglandin synthesis reduces blood flow stomach weakens stomach mucous membrane making prone gastric acid increases risk developing gastric prevented taking drugs proton pump inhibitors receptor antagonists suppress gastric acid secretions together nsaids retain sodium water circulation turn increase blood volume blood pressure production natural vasodilator prostaglandin also inhibited hence use nsaids associated increased risk congestive heart failure hypertension especially elderly chronic use glucocorticoids suppress activity hypothalamic pituitaryadrenal hpa axis severity hpa axis suppression directly proportional dose duration hpa axis suppression results weakened immune system making patients prone infections long short term use glucocorticoids creates minor disturbance human body examples short term effects created glucocorticoids hyperglycemia oscillation blood pressure psychiatric events electrolyte effects usually reversed glucocorticoids therapy nsaids inhibit cyclooxygenase production thromboxane natural coagulator therefore risk bleeding use nsaids intensified concomitant use nsaids reduce blood flow kidney inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis leads renal ischemia decrease glomerular filtration result kidney functions patients chronic renal diseases glucocorticoids reduces number healthy neutrophils human body leading neutropenia reduces efficacy antifungal studies show neutropenia together high cumulative glucocorticoid concentration circulation reduce efficacy invasive fungal infection therefore patients fungal infections recommended use glucocorticoids raise blood glucose level via different mechanisms stimulate endogenous glucose production activating genes involved reduce glucose uptake muscle adipose tissue induce muscle adipose tissues produce substrates involved glucose production inhibit section production insulin pancreatic Î² raise blood glucose level exacerbate diabetes thus use glucocorticoids minimized avoided diabetes patients common signs nsaids overdose nausea vomiting blurred vision nsaids toxicity reversed gastric severe cases nsaids toxicity lead following clinical conditions nsaids overdose lead acute central nervous system create cns effects ranging drowsiness symptoms ataxia nystagmus headaches seizure disorientation also reported manifestations cns large dose nsaids particularly ibuprofen naproxen lead metabolic metabolic acidosis deteriorate cardiac arrhythmia electrolyte imbalance overdose glucocorticoids exacerbate side effects toxicities induced reversed discontinuing high dose glucocorticoids suppress release corticotropin pituitary leading cushings symptoms weight gain upper back area shoulders thinning arms legs moon high dose glucocorticoids increase risk patients infection bacteria virus cells involved immune system mainly phagocytes neutrophils monocytes macrophages natural killer cells b cells cells eosinophils basophils mast cells glucocorticoids significantly reduce production cells human body thereby weakening immune pharmacokinetics refers study absorption distribution metabolism elimination drugs human degree absorption ranged degree absorption ranged pharmacodynamics refers study drugs exert actions human nsaids inhibits synthesis prostaglandin inhibiting cyclooxygenase nsaids higher selectivity indomethacin zomepirac diclofenac potent anti inflammatory activity fewer side effects stomach phospholipase enzyme catalyze release arachidonic acid body arachidonic acid released converted prostaglandins glucocorticoids work inhibiting phospholipase hence indirectly inhibiting prostaglandin
