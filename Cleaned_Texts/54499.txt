determines degree curvature therefore hollowness thinness sides cross section straight razors first categorised according blade profiles head spine blade toe based point nose type following main types blade profiles called points nose second category refers type grinding method used since affects curvature blade cross section includes following two main types blade grinds combination types found two classification categories theory lead wide variety blade types round point hollow ground square point flat ground etc practice points combined specific grind example french point blade usually flat hollow grind produces thinner blade flat grind removes material blade hollows thins blade hollowground blade flexes easily provides feedback resistance blade meets cutting hair indicator blade hollowground blades preferred barbers highend razor manufacturers limit production exclusively hollow ground third final category refers blade width width blade defined distance back blade cutting edge expressed units eighth sizes vary mm mm rarely wider blade carry lather much like scoop multiple successive shaving strokes thus allows user shaving time minimises blade rinse cycles disadvantage wider blade manoeuvrable narrower blade narrow blade shave tight facial spots nose must rinsed often popular blade width size width blade also affect sharpness wider blade greater thermal deformation occur due changing temperatures fact lead loss edge weight blade inversely proportional pressure applied shaving heavier blade lighter pressure needs applied degree hollowness thus cross sectional area thickness blade vary depending grinding method used higher degree hollowness blade implies thinner cross section affects stability bending buckling properties blade thinner blade flexible length weight blade handle relation determines balance straight cutting area razor proportional length blade therefore longer blade requires less frequent honing since cutting edge deplete fast shorter hollowground blades stability augmented transverse stabiliser form one two narrow strips thicker metal running back blade end shoulder junction blade meets shank piece present simply called stabiliser single double indicates hollow ground blade since flat ground blade massive stable enough need double stabiliser implies full hollow ground stabiliser protects blade torsional bending transverse direction transverse addition transverse stabiliser longitudinal stabiliser sometimes created form ridge parallel cutting edge blade ground two areas bevels different degrees hollowness curvature area back blade ridge typically less hollow featuring larger radius curvature also called area ridge cutting edge hollow ie smaller radius curvature two beveled areas different curvatures wellmade razor transition seamlessly ridge belly cutting edge sometimes three ridge stabilizes blade torsional flexing direction perpendicular longitudinal axis acting lengthwise spine blade distance ridge back blade inversely proportional hollowness blade described fractional terms ascending steps example hollow hollow full hollow full hollow indicates stabilizing ridge close midsection blade farthest cutting edge compared grades considered expensive highest end hollow ground hollow even grade socalled singing razor named blade produces specific resonant tone plucked similar guitar string however use recommended distort cutting manufacturing process demanding full blades get rejected meeting tradeoff stability long term blade sharpness full hollow ground blade keep sharp edge even great number honing cycles high degree hollowness susceptible torsional bending partially hollow blade example sustain degree sharpness long cutting edge erodes eventually reach stabilising ridge faster material thus cuttingedge bevel maintained without excessive honing stabilising ridge remove additional material could also destabilise rest blade however partially hollow blade stable additional material makes stiffer thus resistant addition flat ground blade since definition hollow curved stable blades cross sectional area largest also feels heavier hollow ground affect feel balance razor well balanced opened balances pivot pin indicating torques pivot point caused corresponding weight distributions blade handle pivot pin counterbalance wellbalanced razor safer handle open easier shave characteristics blade type determine type recommended uses blade well performance maintenance routines type strengths weaknesses depending requirements use extra hollow blades singing blades thinnest therefore provide best possible shave however also flexible therefore suitable tasks requiring increased pressure blade heavy beard growth etc care also taken stropping thin blade overly stressed since withstand abuse well lower flat ground razors stable handle tough shaving jobs since easily deform pressure take rough handling heavy stropping although wider blade manoeuvreable narrower one especially tight spots better purchase wider blade since honing eventually reduces width blade use fact shorten life straight razor narrow hand width blade proportional blade distortion occur due
