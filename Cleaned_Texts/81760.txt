taxon basis naming priority numerous closely related forms placed george gaylord simpson expressed general taxonomy mammals paramylodon could clearly separated glossotherium glossotherium would preferable due priority subsequent full inclusion paramylodon genus accomplished robert hoffstetter glossotherium among sloth forms occurred south north america also possessed high variability result numerous researchers century favored view synonymy two sloth however h gregory mcdonald separated north american paramylodon south american glossotherium noted studies date demonstrated two genera

chewing surfaces similar modern however lack enamel teeth sloths makes comparisons difficult graminivorous diet inferred based special tooth analyses masticatory apparatus paramylodon showed food predominantly crushed forward backward lateral chewing movements also indicated corresponding grinding marks contradicted caniniform front teeth formed rather small mandibular joint broadly developed paramylodon unspecialized surface associated glenoid fossa skull appears shallow typical herbivores rotary chewing movements however additional nearly vertical articular facet occurs inner side anchored depression outer wall wing bone tended limit overly strong lateral masticatory movements arrangement musculus masseter caused paramylodon open mouth considerably less twotoed sloths however comparatively longer caniniform teeth structure masticatory apparatus rather suggests preference mixed plant construction snout quite broad lestodon indicating grassbased diet analogous living white rhinoceros significantly broader eremotherium megatherium browsers meaning ate leaves trees bushes comparable black rhinoceros also elongated symphysis mandible projects well beyond nasal region since ossification nasal septum mylodon vigorous cartilage development must assumed addition tongue may also supporting function feeding due position hyoid bone displaced far back skull robust construction strong muscle attachments geniohyoideus muscle example particularly strong long could accommodate mobile since coprolites known paramylodon contrast mylodon food remains determined directly addition due lack enamel detailed isotopic examinations rarely possible therefore performing methods requires excellent fossil preservation case paramylodon accomplished dentary several teeth upper pleistocene site ingleside texas results obtained using carbon isotopes fall ranges presentday herbivores specializing hard grazing soft browsing plant diet thus advocating mixed diet possibly stronger bias towards grasses thus results obtained far good agreement open landscape paramylodon lived however also hypothesized sloth representative may digging roots supported example strong forelegs robust humerus widely projecting lower joint end short ulna long extended olecranon massive forearm musculature somewhat flattened claws making well suited digging addition differences dentition early late members genus apparent example lower pleistocene forms possessed even less high dental crowns correspondingly lower mandible upper pleistocene significantly higher teeth massive mandible possible reflects increasingly strong adaptation paramylodon majority finds paramylodon composed single individuals mass assemblages example rancho la brea represent accumulations several millennia therefore assumed paramylodon like presentday arboreal representatives lived solitary formed motheryoung groups digestive system probably similarly structured living sloths also paramylodon rather slow metabolism prevailed long passage time food highly digested suggested slow locomotion suggest engage larger seasonal migrations contrast numerous grasseaters inhabiting open landscapes according animals relatively sedentary striking feature numerous sites paramylodon frequent cooccurrence columbian mammoth bison representatives large herbivorous mammals however showed different way life herd formations long migrations well deviating digestive systems therefore paramylodon probably used different ecological niche avoid direct competition megaherbivores north american steppe
