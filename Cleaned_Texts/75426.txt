plastid ancient greek πλαστός plastós formed molded pl plastids membranebound found cells plants algae eukaryotic organisms considered intracellular endosymbiotic cyanobacteria examples include chloroplasts used photosynthesis chromoplasts used pigment synthesis storage leucoplasts nonpigmented plastids sometimes differentiate event led permanent endosymbiosis archaeplastida clade land plants red algae green algae probably occurred cyanobiont symbiotic cyanobacteria related genus gloeomargarita around billion years later primary endosymbiosis event occurred photosynthetic paulinella amoeboids million years ago plastid belongs psclade cyanobacteria genera prochlorococcus secondary tertiary endosymbiosis also occurred wide variety organisms additionally organisms sequester ingested plastids process known kleptoplasty f w schimper first name provide clear definition often contain pigments used photosynthesis types pigments plastid determine cells color also site manufacture storage important chemical compounds used cells autotrophic eukaryotes possess doublestranded dna molecule circular like circular chromosome prokaryotic cells even organisms plastids lost photosynthetic properties plastid kept essential role production molecules like land plants plastids contain chlorophyll carry photosynthesis called chloroplasts plastids also store products like starch synthesize fatty acids terpenes used producing energy raw material synthesis molecules example components plant cuticle epicuticular wax synthesized epidermal cells palmitic acid synthesized chloroplasts mesophyll plastids derived proplastids present meristematic regions plant proplastids young chloroplasts commonly divide binary fission mature chloroplasts also capacity plant proplastids undifferentiated plastids may differentiate several forms depending upon function perform cell may develop following depending morphology function plastids ability differentiate redifferentiate forms plastid creates multiple copies circular kilobase number genome copies per plastid variable ranging rapidly dividing cells general contain plastids fewer mature cells plastid divisions given rise

form extend main plastid body cytosol interconnect several plastids proteins presumably smaller molecules move within stromules cultured cells relatively large compared plant cells long abundant stromules extend cell periphery evidence possible plastid genome loss found rafflesia lagascae nonphotosynthetic parasitic flowering plant polytomella genus nonphotosynthetic green algae extensive searches plastid genes rafflesia polytomella yielded results however conclusion plastomes entirely missing still scientists argue plastid genome loss unlikely since even nonphotosynthetic plastids contain genes necessary complete various biosynthetic pathways heme spite loss plastid genome rafflesiaceae plastids still occur shells without dna looks suggestively reminiscent hydrogenosomes

plastids one parent general angiosperms inherit plastids female gamete whereas many gymnosperms inherit plastids male pollen algae also inherit plastids one parent plastid dna parent thus completely lost normal intraspecific crossings resulting normal hybrids one species inheritance plastid dna appears quite strictly uniparental interspecific hybridisations however inheritance plastids appears erratic although plastids inherit mainly maternally interspecific hybridisations many reports hybrids flowering plants contain plastids father approximately angiosperms including alfalfa medicago
