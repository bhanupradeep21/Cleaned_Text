early detection children developmentalbehavioral delays disabilities essential ensure benefits early intervention maximized early intervention proven help prevent school failure reduce need expensive special education services associated graduating high school avoiding teen pregnancy violent crime becoming employed adult etc recent research head start showed every spent early intervention society whole saves us early intervention guaranteed individuals disabilities education act idea beginning birth almost children receive health care primary care providers eg nurses family medicine physicians pediatricians charged various professional societies centers medicare medicaid services centers disease control idea search difficulties make needed referrals methods used detect children difficulties effective screening tools brief measures designed sort probably problems screens meant used asymptomatic necessary problems obvious screens lead diagnosis rather probability problem kind problem may exist generally defined screening test screens used primary care generally broadband nature meaning tap range developmental domains typically expressive receptive language fine gross motor skills selfhelp socialemotional older children preacademic academic skills contrast narrowband screens focus single condition mental health problems may parse via factor scores probability example depression anxiety versus attention deficits versus disorders conduct typically broadband screens used first may type measure used make referrals primary care referrals followed diagnostic testing often narrowband screens used alongside themcitation needed screening measures require careful construction research high level proof high quality screens ones standardized meaning administered exactly way every time large current meaning last decade nationally representative sample screens must shown reliable meaning two different examiners get virtually results measuring child short period time eg two weeks returns nearly result screens must proven validity meaning given alongside lengthier measures found strong relationship usually via correlations validity studies also view problems detected eg movement disorders language impairment autism spectrum disorder learning disabilities acid test quality screen sets apart psychometry screens type test proof accuracy means test developers must show proof sensitivity ie percentage children problems detected specificity meaning percentage children without problems identified usually passing negative test results standards sensitivity specificity single administration may seem low development moving target repeated screening needed identify need also means even quality screens make errors one study four different screens showed overreferrals meaning children fail screens found eligible services upon indepth testing children psychosocial risk factors average performance helpful information marshalling nonspecial education services head start afterschool tutoring boys girls clubs parent training description quality measures links publishers screens expensive produce translate support etc developmental screens copyrighted products much purchased publishers however inexpensive deliver time material costs per visit surveillance longitudinal process getting big picture childrens lives intervening potential problems preferably develop surveillance includes eliciting addressing parents concerns monitoring addressing psychosocial risk factors may deter development eg limited parental education children home single parenting poverty parental depression mental health problems problematic parenting style talking much children reading etc surveillance involves periodic use broadband developmentalbehavioral screens typically kinds measures also deployed preferably quality tools enjoying psychometric support surveillance measures include tools eliciting addressing parents concerns measures psychosocial risk parenting style autism spectrum disorder mental health etc available measures offer surveillance screening via longitudinal tracking forms monitoring issues progress combination surveillance screening recommended american academy pediatrics july policy statement studies effectiveness early detection show quality screening tests used routinely early detection early intervention enrollment rates rise meet prevalence figures identified centers disease control eg see national library medicine supporting studies example effective initiative conducted center health care strategies absence quality measurement eligible children ages years age detected enrolled early intervention detection rates typically low major reasons children difficulties identified primary care challenges early detection primary care surmountable health care providers need better engaged early childhood community trained use tools accurate effective primary care reimbursed appropriately time number model initiatives demonstrate challenges early detection insurmountable early detection initiatives encouraged greater contact early childhood programs primary care providers greatly increased likelihood referral see
