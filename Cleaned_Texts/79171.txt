multiple universes introducing survivorship bias anthropic premise finetuned universe assertion small change several physical constants would make universe radically different stephen hawking noted laws science know present contain many fundamental numbers like size electric charge electron ratio masses proton electron remarkable fact values numbers seem finely adjusted make possible development example strong nuclear force stronger ie coupling constant representing strength larger constants left unchanged diprotons would stable according davies hydrogen would fuse instead deuterium would drastically alter physics stars presumably preclude existence life similar observe earth diprotons existence would shortcircuit slow fusion hydrogen deuterium hydrogen would fuse easily likely universes hydrogen would consumed first minutes big diproton argument disputed physicists calculate long increase strength less stellar fusion could occur despite existence stable precise formulation
