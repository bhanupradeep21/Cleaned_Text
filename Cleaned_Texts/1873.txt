senile osteoporosis recently recognized geriatric syndrome particular pathophysiology different classification osteoporosis primary bone loss result aging secondary bone loss occurs various clinical lifestyle primary involuntary osteoporosis classified type type type refers postmenopausal osteoporosis caused deficiency senile osteoporosis categorized involuntary type ii primary osteoporosis affects men women age years accompanied vitamin deficiency bodys failure absorb calcium increased parathyroid research years shown senile osteoporosis product skeleton advanced stage life caused deficiency caused calcium however physicians also coming conclusion multiple mechanisms development stages disease interact together resulting osteoporotic bone regardless still elderly people make fastest growing population world bone mass declines age risk fractures increases annual incidence osteoporotic fractures million us notably people die first year hip costs us health system around billion annually cost projecting billion costs represent higher burden compared disease states breast cancer stroke diabetes chronic lung although cost effective welltolerated treatments diagnosed women received either bone mineral density bmd tests prescription treatment clinical economic burdens indicate effort assessment risk prevention early intervention comes senile osteoporosis caused loss bone mass due aging bones fragile thus prone fractures fracturerelated complications complications include doubled risk increase future fractures lower quality life resulting chronic pain disability sometimes needing longterm nursing depending site pathologic fractures also increase relative mortality risk hip fractures alone particularly debilitating nearly higher mortality rate within one year fractures subtle go undetected time example vertebral compression fractures spine often noticeable loss vertical height occur even routine motions like twisting coughing addition decreased bone mineral density factors contribute fracture risk advanced age lower body mass index fracture history smoking steroid use high alcohol intake fall studies linking alcohol fracture risk define high intake three drinks per high caffeine intake may also play role fracture many healthcare organizations also utilize fracture risk assessment tool frax estimate probability osteoporotic fracture based individuals health information criteria listed bone remodeling absorption resorption bone natural mechanism occurs repair strengthen bones body however imbalance resorption formation bone occurs people age contributing development senile osteoporosis aging cortical trabecular bones particular cause decrease bone density elderly although etiologic considerations regarding senile osteoporosis clear physicians yet risk factors osteoporosis identified factors include gender age hormone imbalances reduced bone quality compromised integrity bone based current evidence attached clinical experimentation evidence pathogenesis disease related deficiency deficiency known lead increment endogenous heparin likely caused mast cell degranulation increase bone resorption calcium discharge bones reaction prostaglandin constrain formation bone mass making bones fragile cofactors shown play important role pathogenetic process attached senile osteoporosis enhance action parathyroid intake calcium elder people quite low problem worsened reduced capability ingest attached decrease absorption vitamin concerning metabolism also factors contributes diagnosis osteoporosis type ii senile osteoporosis type ii mainly attributed age risks include medical pharmacological genetic environmental factors peak bone mass major determinant bone density starts utero typically complete age though secondary osteoporosis separate category comes osteoporosis diagnosis still contributing factor primary osteoporosis secondary osteoporosis present pre postmenopausal women men found factors contributing osteoporosis sexes men postmenopausal therefore treating people important exclude secondary causes osteoporosis include endocrine disorders eg hyperthyroidism diabetes mellitus gastrointestinal hepatic nutritional disorders eg celiac disease inflammatory bowel disease hematological disorders eg systemic mastocytosis renal disorders eg chronic kidney disease autoimmune disorders eg rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus medications contribute bone loss include aluminum found antacids aromatase inhibitors cyclosporine depomedroxyprogesterone premenopausal glucocorticoids lithium proton pump inhibitors serotonin reuptake inhibitors tacrolimus tamoxifen premenopausal medications contribute bone loss increase risk osteoporotic maternal body build lifestyle vitamin status genetic epigenetic effects found affect bmd specifically developmental additionally studies found race eg black women lowest risk age ie older age body mass ie lower weight gender female play role contributing risk osteoporosis although incidence developing osteoporosis hip fractures vary population groups older age consistently associated higher incidence fractures due several environmental social factors contribute risk developing osteoporosis smoking tobacco increase risk decreasing ability intestine absorb calcium caffeine intake heavy alcohol also correlated decrease bone density elderly without proper intake vitamin calcium increase risk osteoporosis elderly vitamin deficiencies pose risk factor decrease bone mass decrease calcium absorption increase bone turnover also various medications interfere absorption calcium anticonvulsants diuretics corticosteroids immunosuppressive medications antibiotics diagnosis osteoporosis made pathologic fracture occurred best take serial bone density also known bone mineral density bmd measurement scans high risk individuals world health organization established diagnostic criteria osteoporosis using bmd tscores describes individuals bmd terms number sds differs mean peak value young healthy persons sds mean criterion osteopenia low bone mass range sd less sds mean however tscores initially used estimation prevalence osteoporosis across populations assess osteoporosis prevalence specific individuals lead national osteoporosis foundation international society clinical densitometry consider using dualenergy xray absorptiometry dxa hip andor spine preferred measurement diagnosis risks listed falls contribute significantly incidence osteoporotic fractures regular exercise strongest correlation decreasing fall back posture exercises tai chi well weightbearing exercises walking slow bone loss improve balance strengthen also precautions taken home reduce risk falling include anchoring rugs floor minimizing clutter improving overall lighting visibility installing handrails stairways calcium vitamin intake diet supplementation crucial ethiopathogenesis disease therefore effective treatments consist non pharmacological methods modified diet calcium mgday vitamin intake iuday exercising smoking cessation alcohol restriction fall prevention individually chosen pharmacological intervention antiresorptive agent like bisphosphonate estrogen replacement therapy given bone fracture hip vertebrae colles devastating complication osteoporosis vitamin combined calcium used primary prevention along alendronate residronate strontium zoledronic acid proven efficacy primary secondary hip fracture institute medicine recommends daily allowance iu vitamin people get level serum least ngml nmolliter addition daily allowance mg one systematic review pharmacological agents postmenopausal woman age found bisphosphonates efficacious improvement bone marrow density reduction vertebral fractures compared placebo systematic review also found parathyroid hormone estrogenprogesterone therapy significant improvements bone marrow density compared addition bisphosphonates pharmacological treatments osteoporosis include calcitonin parathyroid hormone hormone replacement therapy monoclonal antibody another systematic review published journal american geriatrics society showed among men risk osteoporotic fracture bisphosphonates significant reduction fracture compared placebo calcitonin monoclonal antibody therapy show efficacy compared postmenopausal older women estrogen therapy lowdose conjugated estrogens ultralowdose estradiol may reduce incidence new vertebral nonvertebral hip selective estrogenreceptor modulators raloxifene fda approved treat osteoporosis inhibits bone resorption slightly increases spine bmd proved efficacious antifracture even though studies necessary efficient evaluation role played zinc senile
