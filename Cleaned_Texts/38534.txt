various light rays mystery color sensation positive negative afterimages work science optics instrumental towards helmholtzs invention ophthalmoscope investigation related subject found brücke examining color changes chameleons cephalopods studying pigment cells observing muscular contraction influenced duration stimulus brücke also made contributions completely different discipline phonetics wrote one early works directed teachers deaf grundzüge der physiologie und systematik der sprachlaute für linguisten und taubstummenlehre addition optics cellular investigations phonetics

industrial world laid principles color combinations guidance workers fabrics took short step color artistic form declaration underlying principles makes art beautiful brücke positivist time organized school thought general attitude toward man nature methods investigation others shared beliefs wanted bring approach natural sciences investigation human thought brücke delved deeply position positivism lectures physiology course published medical student berlin along colleague emil du boisreymond brücke condemned ideas pantheism nature mysticism talk occult divine forces manifesting real world superstitions contrasted directly principles positivism materialistic views world later two researchers along hermann von helmholtz turned sights popular philosophic theory time vitalism vitalism idea living things different inanimate objects contain vital spark believed soul three partners contested theory stating common physicalchemical functions involved life organism alternate theory researchers adhere one became popular coming years naturalism theory fit perfectly beliefs brücke colleagues stated everything comes natural properties sources josef hyrtl head institute anatomy university vienna strong believer vitalist theory brücke initially got along well hyrtls influence allowed brücke professor university however longer worked close quarters less civil became feud started would last throughout academic careers hyrtl older traditionalist regards physiology used anatomy dominant method medical teaching training brücke challenged newer version physiology animal experimentation brücke built wooden hut house dogs experiments location near hyrtls apartments hyrtl made complaints barking dogs preventing sleeping may true however real reason complaining fact disliked brückes methods investigation physiology feud expanded disagreement function semicircular canals inner ear hyrtl believed based shape canals used directional hearing brücke previous experimental knowledge animals concluded semicircular canals inner ear instead sensory organs equilibrium feud part deeper disagreement two different philosophical vitalism hyrtl brücke followed nineteenth century debate inaccuracy way artists represented movement spurred invention chronophotography assumption new technology would able change habits human animal locomotion aesthetic conventional incorrect locomotion natural one debate expanded idea artists make representations paintings sculptures way accurately reflects mechanics organism imitating example artists painting horse paint horse frozen moment movement accurately reflects real horse moves instead aesthetic incorrect position brücke disagreed idea believed artists forced contain aesthetic art within parameters reality mechanics invention chronophotography ineffective stimulus changing locomotion humans animals would prompt automatic correction apparent impractical postures movements end brücke believed decline art ever since artist endeavored mimic perfect reality instead seeking beauty multitude appearances regarding personal names ritter title translated approximately sir denoting knight first
