pleometrosis behavior observed social insects colony formation initiated multiple queens primarily species insect type behavior mainly studied ants also occurs wasps bees termites behavior significant interest scientists particularly ants termites nest formation often happens queens unrelated ruling argument inclusive fitness driving force whereas species wasps bees cofounding queens often majority species engage pleometrosis initial stages colony formation reduce colonies number queens one dominant queen either kill push supernumerary however cases pleometrosisformed colonies keep multiple queens longer early stages colony multiple queens help speed colony early stages colony growth producing larger worker ant population faster helps outcompete colonies colonydense however forming colonies multiple queens also cause intracolony competition queens possibly lowering likelihood survival queen pleometrotic driving selection pressure causes ant species form colonies pleometrosis appears intercolony competition areas high colony density queen enters area wants form colony may finite amount resources fuel colony thus necessitating intense competition territoriality resources ant queen forms colony low probability surviving colonies may able produce workers faster may already past early stages colony forming colony could also cause forage food outcompete colonies number offspring foraging behavior puts risk however multiple queens form colony pleometrosis produce larger worker force ants faster get mature reproductive stage colony growth faster thus decreasing chances death due intercolony observed ants form pleometrotic colonies engage less foraging behavior thus lowering chance multiple queens cuts foraging behavior queen uses stored energy reserves feed founding colony pleometrotically ants form new colonies high colony density areas take control resources surrounding area faster genera ants azteca use additional worker ants early colonies formation monopolize take control resources close proximity colony thus stopping conspecific colonies acquiring strategy allows pleometrotic colonies monopolize area starve competing additional worker force pleometrotic colonies also allows bigger effective brood raids conspecific colonies additionally helps outcompete key aspect founding colony high density colony area able produce worker force quickly efficiently starved robbed brood colonies causing engaging pleometrosis queens increase chance survival past early stages colony formation due increased worker force produced multiple reproductive individuals colony better control surrounding resources effectively compete pleometrosis necessary survive intercolony competition high density resourcelimited areas majority pleometrotic colonies cut back one queen reproductive stages colony growth suggests queen better chance surviving reproducing offspring forms colony queens even though eventually may pushed killed intracolony risk outcompeted conspecific queen within ones colony must less risk dying due insect high density colony areas resourcelimited areas intercolony competition high selection pleometrosis higher chance survival pleometrotic colony number queens pleometrotic colony increases chances queen becoming dominant queen colony lowers still selection pressures choose pleometrosis depending species ant selection pressures colony multiple ways queen become one dominant queen colony gain full benefit pleometrotic colony queens normally come dominant pleometrotic colonies lay eggs well developed ovaries engage foraging worker ants even play role deciding whether queen become dominant individual species feeding queen fertile queens queens also engage dominance actions assert dominance nest brood cannibalism queens fertile queen nest decides directly challenge another queen usually initiating queen wins takes control colony turning one queen benefits pleometrosis certain situations outweigh costs queens regardless intracolony competition causes thus evolved occur high density areas intercolony azteca ants form colonies internodes cecropia trees native mexico south america tree provides ants food shelter ants protect tree insects thus engaging mutualistic relationship queens form colonies burrowing inter node tree sealing entrance hole parenchyma cells begin lay eggs produce first queens decide engage pleometrosis easily see filled hole chew quickly join fellow queen inter colonies formed trees try outcompete colonies monopolizing resources tree first forming pleometrotic colony cecropia tree queens produce workers faster take control resources tree first thus outcompeting colonies however social interactions queens pleometrotic colony differ depending species azteca xanthochroa aggressive pleometrotic colonies work together produce greater number workers start colony formation colony breaks inter node tree interactions queens change step occurs queens try kill become dominant queen colony switch colony single queen however species constructor less aggressive worker ants leave inter node take control trees resources multiple queens remain cooperative hypothesizes constructor colonies engage cooperative breeding multiple queens could due similarities constructor queens fighting abilities inclusive fitness benefits colonies contrast pleometrotic colonies xanthochroa form change one queen colonies early stages colony also examples pleometrotic colonies forming multiple species azteca however form aggressive species outcompete kill queens colony early stages formation passed mixed species pleometrosis rare helps support fact majority social insects form pleometrotic colonies kin selectionrelated benefits able outcompete colonies early
