principle univariance one discriminate wavelengths comparison multiple principle states one visual receptor cell excited different combinations wavelength intensity brain know color certain point retinal image one individual photoreceptor type therefore differentiate change wavelength change intensity thus wavelength information extracted comparing responses across different types receptors principle univariance first described w h rushton p cone monochromats cone type rod monochromats cones suffer principle univariance principle univariance seen situations stimulus vary two dimensions cells response vary one example colored light may vary wavelength luminance however brains cells vary rate action potentials fired therefore cell tuned red light may respond dim red light bright yellow light avoid response multiple cells compared httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprincipleofunivariance
