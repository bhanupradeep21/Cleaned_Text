savannasaurus diamantinasaurus would lived floodplain clayrich soil high rainfall see palaeoecology would imply ground would occasionally become muddy hazardous large sauropods considered possible environmental pressures would selected individuals capable navigating muddy ground savannasaurus might spent time near water sauropods flexible vertebrae escape bogs barrellike bodies similar hippopotami widegauge stance robust forelimbs distribute body weight would helpful niche postulated saltasaurines might subject similar selective pressures typical titanosaur bodyplan may acquired convergently multiple times environment could also selected longer necks provide easier access water poropat colleagues noted savannasaurus diamantinasaurus likely relatively short necks though
