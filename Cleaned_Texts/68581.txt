interaction models constitute origin developments form constitutive models models communication representations process communication try provide simple explanation process highlighting basic characteristics communication defined transmission ideas general models communication try describe forms including verbal nonverbal communication well visual auditory olfactory widest sense communication restricted humans happens also among animals species however models communication normally focus human communication paradigmatic usually involve type interaction two parties messages process whole complex models communication present salient features showing main components operate usually form simplified visualization ignore aspects sake theorists like paul cobley peter j schulz distinguish models communication theories communication based idea theories communication try provide abstract conceptual framework strong enough accurately represent underlying reality despite according frank dance one fully comprehensive model communication since one highlights certain aspects distorts others reason suggests family different models models communication serve various functions simplified presentation helps students researchers identify main steps communication apply communicationrelated concepts realworld unified picture provide makes easier describe explain observed phenomena models communication guide formulation hypotheses predictions communicative processes unfold show processes one goals show improve communication example avoiding distortions noise discovering societal economic factors affect quality many basic concepts reappear different models like sender receiver message channel signal encoding decoding noise feedback context exact meanings vary slightly model model sometimes different terms used ideas simple models rely concepts complex models include many sender responsible creating message sending receiver theorists use terms source destination instead message verbal nonverbal contains form process encoding translates message signal conveyed using channel channel sensory route signal travels example expressing ones thoughts speech encodes sounds transmitted using air channel decoding reverse process encoding happens signal translated back noise influence interferes message reaching destination theorists distinguish environmental noise semantic noise environmental noise distorts signal way receiver semantic noise occurs encoding decoding example ambiguous word message interpreted receiver meant feedback means receiver responds message conveying information back original context consists circumstances communication wide term apply physical environment mental state communicators well general social models communication classified many ways proposed classifications often overlap models general sense aim describe forms communication others specialized apply specific fields areas example models mass communication specialized models aim give universal account another contrast linear nonlinear models early models communication linear models present communication unidirectional process messages flow communicator audience nonlinear models hand multidirectional messages sent back forth participants according uma narula linear models describe single acts communication nonlinear models describe whole linear transmission models describe communication oneway process sender intentionally conveys message receiver reception message endpoint process since feedback loop sender may know whether message reached intended destination early models transmission models due linear nature often simple capture dynamic aspects various forms communication regular facetoface focusing sender leave audiences perspective example listening usually happen active process involving listening skills however forms communication accurately described many types computermediated communication applies example text messaging sending email posting blog sharing something social theorists like uma narula talk action models instead linear transmission models stress focus actions linear transmission models include aristotles lasswells shannonweavers berlos interaction models participants communication alternate positions sender receiver upon receiving message new message generated returned original sender form feedback regard communication twoway process adds complexity model since participants senders receivers alternate two interaction models steps happen one first one message sent received later another message returned feedback etc feedback loops make possible sender assess whether message received intended effect whether distorted example interaction models used describe conversation instant messaging sender sends message wait receiver react another example questionanswer session one person asks question waits another person answer interaction models usually put emphasis interactive process less technical problem message conveyed step reason prominence given context shapes exchange messages includes physical context like distance speakers psychological context includes mental emotional factors like stress schramms model one earliest interaction transaction models depart interaction models two ways one hand understand sending responding simultaneous processes used describe listeners use nonverbal communication like body posture facial expressions give form feedback way signal whether agree message speaker talking feedback may turn influence speakers message produced hand transactional models stress meaning created process communication exist prior often combined claim communication creates social realities like relationships personal identities also affects communicators various levels thoughts feelings well social transaction models usually put emphasis contexts shape exchange information sometimes divided social relational cultural contexts social contexts include explicit implicit rules form message feedback acceptable example one interrupt people greetings returned relational contexts specific concern previous relationship shared history communicators includes factors like whether participants friends neighbors coworkers rivals cultural context encompasses social identities communicators race gender nationality sexual orientation social barnlunds model influential early transaction constitutive models hold meaning reflexively constructed maintained negotiated act means communication exchange preestablished bundles information creative process unlike outlook found many transmission according robert craig implies communication basic social phenomenon explained psychological cultural economic factors instead communication seen cause social processes constitutive models closely related constructionist models see communication basic process responsible people understand represent experience reality according social constructionists like george herbert mead reality something wholly external depends conceptualized happens interpersonal communication communication two distinct persons like greeting someone street making phone intrapersonal communication contrast communication example person thinking themself bring laundry outside models communication focus interpersonal communication assuming sender receiver distinct persons often explore sender encodes message message transmitted possibly distorted receiver decodes interprets however models specifically formulated intrapersonal communication many focus idea intrapersonal communication starts perception internal external stimuli carrying information stimuli processed interpreted various ways example classifying ascribing symbolic meaning later steps include thinking organizing information encoding ideas conceived way behavioral response response produce new stimuli act form feedback loop continued intrapersonal models communication try provide perspective includes interpersonal intrapersonal communication order show two phenomena influence discipline communication studies models communication proposed restricted human communication include discussions communication among species like nonhuman animals plants models nonhuman communication usually stress practical aspects communication ie effects behavior example communication provides evolutionary advantage models animal communication similar models human communication understand process exchange information exchange helps communicators reduce uncertainty act way beneficial approach discussed manipulative model animal communication argues central aspect communication consist exchange information causing changes behavior organisms influence provides primarily benefit sender need involve transmission messages way sender exploits another animals muscle slightly different approach focuses cooperative aspect communication holds sender receiver benefit models plant communication usually understand communication terms biochemical changes responses according richard karban process starts cue emitted sender perceived receiver receiver processes information translate kind additional classifications communication models suggested term encodingdecoding model used model includes phases encoding decoding description communication models stress send information code necessary code sign system used express ideas interpret messages encodingdecoding models sometimes contrasted inferential models latter receiver interested information sent tries infer senders intention behind formulating hypodermic models also referred magic bullet theories hold communication reduced transfer ideas information feelings sender receiver message like magic bullet shot active senders passive defenseless receivers closely related linear transmission models contrast reception models ascribe active role receiver process communication relational models stress importance relationship communicators example wilbur schramm holds relationship informs expectations participants bring exchange roles play roles influence communicators try contribute communicative goal context instruction example teachers role includes sharing explaining information students role involves learning asking clarifying relational models also describe communication affects relationship communicators example communication patient hospital staff affects whether patient feels cared relational models closely related convergence convergence models goal communication
