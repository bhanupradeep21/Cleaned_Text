field psychology greatly influenced study geneticscitation needed decades research demonstrated genetic environmental factors play role variety behaviors humans animals eg grigorenko sternberg genetic basis aggression however remains poorly understood aggression multidimensional concept generally defined behavior inflicts pain harm another geneticdevelopmental theory states individual differences continuous phenotype result action large number genes exerting effect works environmental factors produce type trait influenced multiple factors making complex difficult study simple mendelian trait one gene one phenotypecitation needed past thoughts genetic factors influencing aggression specifically regard sex chromosomes tended seek answers chromosomal four decades ago xyy genotype erroneously believed many correlated aggression researchers mrc clinical population cytogenetics research unit led dr court brown western general hospital edinburgh reported finding much higher expected nine xyy men averaging almost ft tall survey patients state hospital scotland seven nine xyy patients mentally initial reports published examining xyy patients researchers suggested might hospitalized aggressive behavior xyy patients examined researchers found assumptions aggressive behavior incorrect unfortunately many science medicine textbooks quickly uncritically incorporated initial incorrect assumptions xyy psychology textbooks xyy genotype first gained wide notoriety raised part defense two murder trials australia france united states five attempts use xyy genotype defense one case allowed go rejected results several decades longterm followup scores unselected xyy males identified eight international newborn chromosome screening studies replaced pioneering biased studies used institutionalized xyy men basis current understanding xyy genotype established xyy males characterized increased height characterized aggressive though link currently genetics aggression turned aspect genetics different chromosomal abnormalities important understand research started direction moving towards today topics behavioral genetics aggression studied three main experimental ways help identify role genetics plays behavior three main experimental types used animal studies studies testing heritability molecular genetics geneenvironment interaction studies recently important links aggression genetics studied results allowing scientists better understand heritability aggression observed many animal strains noting strains birds dogs fish mice seem aggressive strains selective breeding demonstrated possible select genes lead aggressive behavior selective breeding examples also allow researchers understand importance developmental timing genetic influences aggressive behavior study done cairns produced highly aggressive male female strains mice dependent certain developmental periods aggressive behavior expressed mice observed aggressive early later stages lives certain periods time middleage period violent aggressive attacks selective breeding quick way select specific traits see selected traits within generations breeding characteristics make selective breeding important tool study genetics aggressive behavior mice often used model human genetic behavior since mice humans homologous genes coding homologous proteins used similar functions biological mice aggression studies led interesting insight human aggression using reverse genetics dna genes receptors many neurotransmitters cloned sequenced role neurotransmitters rodent aggression investigated using pharmacological manipulations serotonin identified offensive attack male mice intruder male mice mutants made manipulating receptor serotonin deleting gene serotonin receptor mutant male mice knockout alleles exhibited normal behavior everyday activities eating exploration prompted attacked intruders twice intensity normal male mice offense aggression mice males similar genotypes likely fight males encountered males genotypes another interesting finding mice dealt mice reared alone mice showed strong tendency attack male mice upon first exposure animals mice reared alone taught aggressive simply exhibited behavior implicates natural tendency related biological aggression mice since mice reared alone lacked parent model aggressive oxidative stress arises result excess production reactive oxygen species relation defense mechanisms including action antioxidants superoxide dismutase knockout gene experimentally introduced male mice leading impaired antioxidant mice designated male mice proved aggressive heterozygous knockout males deficient wildtype males basis association oxidative stress increased aggression yet determined experiments designed study biological mechanisms utilized exploring aggression influenced genetics molecular genetics studies allow many different types behavioral traits examined manipulating genes studying effects manipulation number molecular genetics studies focused manipulating candidate aggression genes mice animals induce effects possibly applied humans studies focused polymorphisms serotonin receptors dopamine receptors neurotransmitter metabolizing results studies led linkage analysis map serotoninrelated genes impulsive aggression well dopaminrelated genes proactive aggression particular serotonin seems influence intermale aggression either directly molecules use pathway normally dampens aggression animals humans mice missing specific genes observed aggressive normal mice rapid violent studies focused neurotransmitters studies mutation neurotransmitter metabolizing enzyme monoamine oxidase maoa shown cause syndrome includes violence impulsivity studies molecular genetics pathways leading production pharmaceuticals fix pathway problems hopefully show observed change aggressive determining trait related genetic factors environmental factors twin studies adoption studies used studies examine correlations based similarity trait persons genetic environmental factors could influence trait aggression examined via twin studies adoption studies human genetics related aggression studied main genes identified genes heavily related genetics aggression gene plays role heavy relation regulation neurotransmission gene results humans finding seemingly rewarding paths drug abuse studies seems risk factor delinquency children related family trauma events twin studies studies typically conducted comparing identical fraternal twins aim reveal importance environmental genetic influences traits phenotypes disorders advancement molecular genetics twin studies almost mode investigation genetic influences personality heritability estimated twice difference correlation identical monozygotic twins fraternal dizygotic twins early studies indicated personality fifty percent genetic current thinking holds individual picks chooses range stimuli events largely basis genotype creating unique set experiences basically meaning people create determined window childhood certain trauma events trigger lifetime aggressive behavior time studies pertaining genetics aggression improved become interesting research topic looking research opportunities experiments started milgrams experiment results experiment proved certain situations people coaxed aggression violence next big experiment pertaining genetics aggression took place part stanford prison experiment conclusion drawn experiment many cases aggression unexpected certain points considered elicited also revealed aggression often triggered situations someone feels ideology hold powerful authority someone else concluded experiments social aspects prove big factor way people act aggressively also concluded every person potential
