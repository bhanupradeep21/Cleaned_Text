cheating term used behavioral ecology ethology describe behavior whereby organisms receive benefit cost organisms cheating common many mutualistic altruistic cheater individual cooperate cooperates less fair share potentially gain benefit others cheaters also selfishly use common resources maximize individual fitness expense natural selection favors cheating mechanisms regulate stress gradient hypothesis states facilitation cooperation mutualism common stressful environments cheating competition parasitism common benign environments ie nutrient excess organisms communicate cooperate perform wide range behaviors mutualism mutually beneficial interactions species common ecological interactions thought biological markets species offer partners goods relatively inexpensive produce receive goods expensive even impossible however systems provide opportunities exploitation individuals obtain resources providing nothing return exploiters take several forms individuals outside mutualistic relationship obtain commodity way confers benefit either mutualist individuals receive benefits partner lost ability give return individuals option behaving mutualistically towards partners chose cheaters cooperate benefit others cooperate gain competitive edge evolutionary context competitive edge refers greater ability survive reproduce individuals cheat able gain survivorship reproductive benefits incurring costs natural selection favor cheaters however mechanisms also exist prevent cheaters undermining mutualistic systems one main factor advantages cheating often frequencydependent frequencydependent selection occurs fitness phenotype depends frequency relative phenotypes population cheater phenotypes often display negative frequencydependent selection fitness increases phenotype becomes less common vice words cheaters best terms evolutionary benefits increased survival reproduction relatively cheaters become abundant worse example escherichia coli colonies antibioticsensitive cheaters persist low numbers antibioticlaced mediums cooperative colony cheaters enjoy benefit others producing antibioticresistant agents producing none however numbers increase persist producing antibiotic agent likely negatively impacted antibiotic substrate less antibiotic agent protect thus cheaters persist population exploitative behavior gives advantage exist low frequencies benefits diminished greater number others proposed cheating exploitive behavior stabilize cooperation mutualistic many mutualistic systems feedback benefits cooperate instance fitness partners may improved high reward many benefits individual initiated cooperative behavior mutualism selected researchers investigated coevolution cooperation choice choosy host symbiont organism lives relationship benefits parties involved model indicated although choice cooperation may initially selected would often words one cooperative partner choose another cooperative partner given choice however choice made variation removed selection longer maintained situation similar lek paradox female choice example lek paradox females consistently choose particular male trait genetic variance trait eventually eliminated removing benefits choice however choice somehow still persists one theory states cheating maintains genetic variation face selection mutualism one study shows small influx immigrants tendency cooperate less generate enough genetic variability stabilize selection suggests presence exploitive individuals otherwise known cheaters contribute enough genetic variation maintain mutualism theory negative frequencydependent theory suggest cheating exists part stable mixed evolutionary strategy mutualism words cheating stable strategy used individuals population many individuals cooperate another study supports cheating exist mixed strategy mutualism using mathematical game thus cheating arise maintained mutualistic populations studies cheating dishonest communication populations presupposes organismal system cooperates without collective population signaling interactions among individuals behaviors cheating manifest words order study cheating behavior model system engages cooperation needed models provide insight cheating include social amoeba dictyostelium eusocial insects ants bees interspecific interactions found cleaning mutualisms common examples cleaning mutualisms include cleaner fish wrasses cleaner dictyostelium discoideum widely used model cooperation development multicellularity species amoeba commonly found haploid singlecelled state feed independently undergo asexual reproduction however scarcity food sources cause individual cells starve roughly cells aggregate form mobile multicellular structure dubbed wild aggregates generally contain multiple genotypes resulting chimeric mixtures unlike clonal genetically identical aggregates typically found multicellular organisms potential competition exists chimeric example individuals aggregate contain different genomes differences fitness result conflict interest among cells aggregate different genotypes could potentially compete resources dictyostelium discoideum roughly cells aggregate become dead make stalk fruiting body remaining cells become spores sorus fruiting body germinate conditions case cells must give reproduction fruiting body forms successfully makes chimeric aggregates dictyostelium discoideum susceptible cheating individuals take advantage reproductive behavior without paying fair price words certain individuals tend become part sorus frequently gain increased benefit fruiting body system without sacrificing opportunities cheating behavior discoideum well established many studies attempted elucidate evolutionary genetic mechanisms underlying behavior genome completely sequenced well annotated makes discoideum useful model studying genetic bases molecular mechanisms cheating broader sense social eusocial insects also serve valuable tools studying cheating eusocial insects behave cooperatively members community forgo reproduction assist individuals reproduce model systems potential conflict interest arise among individuals thus also potential cheating eusocial insects order hymenoptera includes bees wasps exhibit good examples conflicts interest present insect societies systems queen bees wasps mate lay fertilized eggs hatch females hand workers species hymenoptera produce eggs produce fertilized eggs due loss mating workers lay eggs represent cost colony workers lay eggs often significantly less work thus negatively impact health colony example decreased amount collected food less attention given tending queens eggs case conflict interest arises workers colony workers lay eggs order pass genes however colony queen reproduce leads better workers sought pass genes laying eggs foraging activities would diminish leading decreased resources entire colony turn cause tragedy selfish behavior lead depletion resources longterm negative consequences group however natural bee wasp societies respectively workers lay eggs suggesting strategies exist combat cheating prevent tragedy insect systems given scientists opportunities study strategies keep cheating check strategies commonly referred policing strategies generally additional costs imposed cheaters discourage eliminate cheating behaviors example honeybees wasps may eat eggs produced workers ant species yellowjackets policing may occur via aggression towards killing egglaying individuals minimize cleaning symbiosis develop small larger marine organisms often represent models useful studying evolution stable social interactions cheating cleaning fish labroides dimidiatus bluestreak cleaner wrasse many cleaner species client fish seeks ectoparasites removed cleaners situations instead picking parasites surface client fish cleaner cheat feeding clients tissue mucus layer scales etc thereby gaining additional benefit symbiotic well documented cleaners feed mucus clients unable control cleaners behavior however natural settings client fish often jolt chase cheating cleaners terminate interactions swimming way effectively controlling cheating studies cleaning mutualisms generally suggest cheating behavior often adjusted depending species client cleaning shrimp cheating predicted occur less often shrimps bear higher cost clients use aggression control cleaners studies found cleaner species strategically adjust cheating behavior according potential associated risk example predatory clients present significantly high cost cheating experience less cheating behavior hand nonpredatory clients present lower cost cheating thus experience cheating behaviors evidence suggest physiological processes mediate cleaners decision switch cooperating cheating mutualistic interactions example bluestreak cleaner wrasse changes cortisol levels associated behavior smaller clients increase cortisol levels water lead cooperative behavior larger clients treatment lead dishonest behavior suggested good behavior toward smaller clients often allow wrasses attract larger clients often models cheating include european tree frog hyla arborea many sexually reproducing species males access mates exploiting resources competitive many species dynamic reproductive strategies change response changes environment instances several factors contribute decision switch mating strategies example european tree frog sexually competitive perceived attractive females male tend call attract mates often referred bourgeois hand smaller male would likely fail attract mates using bourgeois tactic tend hide near attractive males attempt access females instance males gain access females without defend territories acquiring additional resources often serve basis attractiveness referred parasitic tactic smaller male effectively cheats way accessing females reaping benefit sexual reproduction without contributing resources normally attract models provide valuable tools research aimed energetic constraints environmental cues involved cheating studies find mating strategies highly adaptable depend variety factors competitiveness energetic costs involved defending territory acquiring like many organisms bacteria rely iron intake biological processescitation needed however iron sometimes difficult access certain environments like soil bacteria evolved siderophores ironchelating particles seek bring back iron bacteria siderophores necessarily specific producer sometimes another individual could take particles pseudomonas fluorescens bacterium commonly found soil lowiron conditions p fluorescens produces siderophores specifically pyoverdine retrieve iron necessary survival however iron readily available either freely diffusing environment another bacteriums siderophores p fluorescens ceases production allowing bacterium devote energy towards growth one study showed p fluorescens grew association streptomyces ambofaciens another bacterium produces siderophore coelichelin pyoverdine detected result suggested p fluorescens ceased siderophore production favor taking ironbound coelichelin association also known siderophore studies however suggested p fluorescens cheating behavior could suppressed another study two strains p fluorescens studied soil natural environment one strain known producer produced higher level siderophores meant strain known nonproducer ceased siderophore production favor using others siderophores although one would expect nonproducer would outcompete producer like p fluorescens ambofaciens association study demonstrated nonproducer unable soil conditions suggesting two strains could coexist experiments suggested cheating prevention may due interactions microbes soil influencing relationship spatial structure soil preventing siderophore diffusion therefore limiting nonproducers ability exploit producers definition individuals cheat gain benefits noncheating counterparts receive raises question cooperative system exist face cheaters one answer cheaters actually reduced fitness compared noncheaters study dandekar et al researchers examined survival rates cheating noncheating bacteria populations pseudomonas aeruginosa varying environmental microorganisms like many species bacteria use cellcell communication system called quorum sensing detect population density prompt transcription various resources needed case resources publicly shared proteases break food source like casein privately used adenosine hydrolase breaks another food source adenosine problem arises individuals cheaters respond quorum sensing signals therefore contribute costly protease production yet enjoy benefits broken resources p aeruginosa populations placed growth conditions cooperation responding quorum signal costly number cheaters increases public resources depleted lead tragedy commons however p aeruginosa populations placed growth conditions proportion adenosine cheaters suppressed bacteria responds quorum signal produces adenosine hydrolase privately use digest adenosine food source wild populations presence adenosine common explanation individuals cooperate could higher fitness cheat thereby suppressing cheaters maintaining cooperation cheating also commonly found insects social seemingly altruistic communities found insects ants bees provide ample opportunities cheaters take advantage system accrue additional benefits expense community sometimes colony insects called superorganism ability take properties greater sum individuals colony insects different individuals specialized specific tasks means greater colony production greater moreover based kinselection theory collectively beneficial individuals community queen lay eggs rather workers lay workers lay eggs benefits egglaying worker individually rest workers twice removed workers offspring therefore though beneficial one individual offspring collectively beneficial queen lay eggs therefore system worker queen policing exists workerlaid eggs one form policing occurs oophagy workerlaid eggs found many ant bee could done either queen workers series experiments honeybees apis mellifera ratneiks visscher found workers effectively removed workerlaid eggs colonies whether eggs originated colonies example combination queen worker policing found ants genus diacamma workerlaid eggs taken workers fed general signals identify eggs queenlaid likely incorruptible since must honest signal maintained used cheating form policing occurs aggression towards egglaying workers species tree wasp dolichovespula sylvestris wenseleers et al found combination aggressive behavior destruction workerlaid eggs kept number workerlaid eggs fact workerlaid eggs policed within one day also found workers laying eggs prevented queens workers aggressive behavior workers queen would grab egglaying worker try sting push cell usually results worker removing abdomen depositing eggs aggression punishment found insects example naked mole rats punishments queen way motivates lazier lessrelated workers queen would shove lazier workers number shoves increasing fewer active workers reeve found queen removed colonies satiated significant drop weight active workers lazier workers taking advantage system punishment also method used cichlid neolamprologous pulcher cooperative breeding systems paytostay system helper fish allowed stay certain territories exchange similar naked mole rats helpers prevented helping idle helpers receive aggression control helpers study researchers theorize system developed fish usually closely related kinship benefits little impact high level predation risk fish outside group therefore strong motivator helper fish stay rhesus monkeys also use aggression punishment animals five distinct calls decide produce upon finding food whether call related sex number kin females call often females kin call often however sometimes food found individual discoverer call attract kin presumably share food lower ranked individuals find discoverer food drop area experiment recruit coalition support individual screaming formed coalition chases individual away higher ranked individuals find discoverer either chase discoverer away became physically aggressive towards results show aggression punishment way encourage members work together share food found cheating constraints cheating limited intraspecific interactions also occur mutualistic relationship two species common example mutualistic relationship cleaner fish labroides dimidiatus reef fish bshary grutter found cleaner wrasse prefers client tissue mucus creates conflict cleaner fish reef fish reef fish benefit cleaner fish eats ectoparasites studies revealed lab setting cleaner fish undergoes behavioral change face deterrents eating preferential several trials plate preferential food source immediately removed eat mimic client fleeing natural settings trials plate preferential food source chased cleaner fish eat mimicking client chasing natural setting six learning trials cleaners learned choose preference indicating punishment potentially effective countermeasure cheating mutualistic relationships finally countermeasures limited organismal relationships west et al found similar countermeasure cheating legumerhizobium relationship nitrogen fixing bacteria rhizobium fixes atmospheric inside roots leguminous plants providing essential source nitrogen plants also receiving organic acids however bacteria mutualistic others parasitic consume plants resources fixes little moreover plants tell whether bacteria less parasitic settled plant nodules prevent cheating plants seem able punish rhizobium bacteria series experiments researchers forced noncooperation bacteria plants placing various nodules nitrogenfree atmosphere saw decrease rhizobium reproductive success west et al created model legume sanctioning bacteria hypothesizes behaviors exist stabilize mutualistic another wellknown example plantorganism interaction occurs yuccas yucca moths female yucca moths deposit eggs one time yucca flower time also deposits small amount pollen yucca flowers nutrition yucca moths pollen consumed larva yucca moths therefore also active pollinators yucca plant moreover sometimes female moths successfully deposit eggs first time may try yucca plant receives scars multiple attempts also receive pollen since moths depositing pollen every try cheating sometimes happens yucca moth deposits many eggs one plant case yucca plant little benefits interaction however plant unique way constraining behavior constraint cheating often occurs directly individual case constraint occurs individuals offspring yucca plant abort moths aborting flowers pellmyr huth found selective maturation flowers low egg loads high number scars therefore high amount way selection cheaters try use yucca plant without providing benefits pollination
