advantages since modern computers process information quickly simulations run short time allowing high statistical power modeling also allows psychologists visualize hypotheses functional organization mental events could directly observed human computational neuroscience uses mathematical models simulate brain another method symbolic modeling represents many mental objects using variables rules
