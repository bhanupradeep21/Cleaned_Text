neurotoxicity form toxicity biological chemical physical agent produces adverse effect structure function central andor peripheral nervous occurs exposure substance specifically neurotoxin alters normal activity nervous system way cause permanent reversible damage nervous eventually disrupt even kill neurons cells transmit process signals brain parts nervous system neurotoxicity result organ transplants radiation treatment certain drug therapies recreational drug use exposure heavy metals bites certain species venomous snakes certain industrial cleaning certain naturally occurring substances symptoms may appear immediately exposure delayed may include limb weakness numbness loss memory vision andor intellect uncontrollable obsessive andor compulsive behaviors delusions headache cognitive behavioral problems sexual dysfunction chronic mold exposure homes lead neurotoxicity may appear months years symptoms listed consistent mold mycotoxin term neurotoxicity implies involvement neurotoxin however term neurotoxic may used loosely describe states known cause physical brain damage specific neurotoxin identifiedcitation needed presence neurocognitive deficits alone usually considered sufficient evidence neurotoxicity many substances may impair neurocognitive performance without resulting death neurons may due direct action substance impairment neurocognitive deficits temporary resolving substance eliminated body cases level exposuretime may critical substances becoming neurotoxic certain doses time periods common naturally occurring brain toxins lead neurotoxicity result long term drug use amyloid beta aβ glutamate dopamine oxygen radicals present high concentrations lead neurotoxicity death apoptosis symptoms result cell death include loss motor control cognitive deterioration autonomic nervous system dysfunction additionally neurotoxicity found major cause neurodegenerative diseases alzheimers disease adcitation needed amyloid beta aβ found cause neurotoxicity cell death brain present high concentrations aβ results mutation occurs protein chains cut wrong locations resulting chains different lengths unusable thus left brain broken enough accumulate form plaques toxic neurons aβ uses several routes central nervous system cause cell death example nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nachrs receptor commonly found along surfaces cells respond nicotine stimulation turning aβ found manipulating level nicotine brain along map kinase another signaling receptor cause cell death another chemical brain aβ regulates jnk chemical halts extracellular signalregulated kinases erk pathway normally functions memory control brain result memory favoring pathway stopped brain loses essential memory function loss memory symptom neurodegenerative disease including ad another way aβ causes cell death phosphorylation akt occurs phosphate group bound several sites protein phosphorylation allows akt interact bad protein known cause cell death thus increase aβ results increase aktbad complex turn stopping action antiapoptotic protein normally functions stop cell death causing accelerated neuron breakdown progression adcitation needed glutamate chemical found brain poses toxic threat neurons found high concentrations concentration equilibrium extremely delicate usually found millimolar amounts extracellularly disturbed accumulation glutamate occurs result mutation glutamate transporters act like pumps clear glutamate synapse causes glutamate concentration several times higher blood brain turn body must act maintain equilibrium two concentrations pumping glutamate bloodstream neurons brain event mutation glutamate transporters unable pump glutamate back cells thus higher concentration accumulates glutamate receptors opens ion channels allowing calcium enter cell causing excitotoxicity glutamate results cell death turning nmethyldaspartic acid receptors nmda receptors cause increased release calcium ions cells result increased concentration directly increases stress mitochondria resulting excessive oxidative phosphorylation production reactive oxygen species ros via activation nitric oxide synthase ultimately leading cell death aβ also found aiding route neurotoxicity enhancing neuron vulnerability glutamatecitation needed formation oxygen radicals brain achieved nitric oxide synthase nos pathway reaction occurs response increase concentration inside brain cell interaction nos results formation cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin moves plasma membrane cytoplasm final step nos dephosphorylated yielding nitric oxide accumulates brain increasing oxidative stress several ros including superoxide hydrogen peroxide hydroxyl lead neurotoxicity naturally body utilizes defensive mechanism diminish fatal effects reactive species employing certain enzymes break ros small benign molecules simple oxygen water however breakdown ros completely efficient reactive residues left brain accumulate contributing neurotoxicity cell death brain vulnerable oxidative stress organs due low oxidative capacity neurons characterized postmitotic cells meaning live accumulated damage years accumulation ros fatal thus increased levels ros age neurons leads accelerated neurodegenerative processes ultimately advancement ad endogenously produced autotoxin metabolite dopamine dopal potent inducer programmed cell death apoptosis dopaminergic dopal may play important role pathology parkinsons certain drugs famously pesticide metabolite mpp induce parkinsons disease destroying dopaminergic neurons substantia mpp interacts electron transport chain mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species cause generalized oxidative damage ultimately cell mpp produced monoamine oxidase b metabolite mptp toxicity particularly significant dopaminergic neurons active transporter cells bring neurotoxicity mpp first investigated mptp produced contaminant pethidine synthesized chemistry
