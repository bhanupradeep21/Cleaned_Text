hemoglobin c abbreviated hbc abnormal hemoglobin glutamic acid residue position βglobin chain replaced lysine residue due point mutation hbb people one copy gene hemoglobin c experience symptoms pass abnormal gene children two copies gene said hemoglobin c disease experience mild anemia possible person gene hemoglobin form associated sickle cell anemia gene hemoglobin c state called hemoglobin sc disease generally severe hemoglobin c disease milder sickle cell hbc discovered harvey itano james v neel two africanamerican families since established common among people west africa confers survival benefits individuals hbc naturally resistant malaria caused plasmodium falciparum albeit incompletely people one copy gene hemoglobin c termed heterozygous experience significant symptoms pass abnormal gene onto children condition called hemoglobin c trait two hemoglobin c genes present termed homozygous individual said hemoglobin c disease may develop mild anemia red blood cells containing hemoglobin c decreased lifespan anemia hemoglobin c disease classified hemolytic caused destruction red blood cells enlarged spleen sometimes jaundice may also persons disease may develop gallstones require continued hemolysis may produce pigmented gallstones unusual type gallstone composed darkcolored contents red blood red blood cells people hemoglobin c disease usually abnormally small microcytic high mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration mchc high mchc caused decreased concentration water inside cells target cells microspherocytes hbc crystals seen microscopic examination blood smears homozygous hbc combine abnormal hemoglobins cause serious hemoglobinopathies individuals sickle c hbsc inherited gene sickle cell disease hbs one parent gene hemoglobin c disease hbc parent since hbc polymerize readily hbs less sickling cases fewer acute vasoocclusive events therefore cases fewer sickle cell crises peripheral smear demonstrates mostly target cells occasional hemoglobin c crystals sickle cells however persons hemoglobin sc disease hbsc significant retinopathy ischemic necrosis bone priapism pure ss also cases hbc combination hbo hbd beta hemoglobin c produced point mutation hbb gene causes amino acid substitution glutamic acid lysine position βglobin chain hemoglobin mutation homozygous occurring chromosomes alleles heterozygous affecting one heterozygous condition people said hemoglobin c trait hemoglobin c carriers one gene hbc either one hba gene hbs gene red blood cells contain hemoglobin c either normal hemoglobin hemoglobin hemoglobin c mutation autosomal recessive disorder results biparental inheritance allele encodes hemoglobin parents carriers hemoglobin c chance child hemoglobin c disease assuming parents carriers chance child hemoglobin c disease chance child carrier hemoglobin c chance child neither carrier affected hemoglobin c mutated form reduces normal plasticity host erythrocytes causing hemoglobinopathy heterozygous mutation total hemoglobin hb hbc anemia develops homozygotes nearly hb hbc form resulting mild hemolytic anemia jaundice enlargement individuals hbc reduced risk p falciparum malaria hbc described advantageous hbs even homozygous individuals usually however contrast hbs prevent malaria due p less effective resistance falciparum malaria heterozygous homozygous hbc resistant heterozygous condition hbc mutation prevent infection p falciparum survive red blood cells homozygous hemoglobins survive presence heterozygous hbc reduced binding force cytoadherence p falciparum reducing activity evidences indicate hbc reduced level required effective binding invasion rbc malarial predicted trend hbc mutation falciparum prevalence hbc would replace hbs central west africa physical examination may show enlarged spleen tests may done include complete blood count cbc hemoglobin electrophoresis peripheral blood genetic counseling may appropriate highrisk couples wish usually treatment needed folic acid supplementation may help produce normal red blood cells improve symptoms anemia overall hemoglobin c disease one benign mildtomoderate reduction rbc lifespan may accompany mild hemolytic anemia individuals hemoglobin c disease sporadic episodes musculoskeletal joint people hemoglobin c disease expect lead normal hemoglobin c found abundantly areas west africa nigeria yorubas hemoglobin c gene found africanamericans hemoglobin sickle gene thus hemoglobin sc disease significantly common hemoglobin cc disease trait also affects people whose ancestors came italy greece latin america caribbean however possible person race nationality hemoglobin c trait terms geographic distribution hemoglobin c allele found highest frequencies west africa associated protection hemoglobin c disease present birth though cases may diagnosed adulthood males females affected studying molecular basis sickle cell disease linus pauling harvey itano california institute technology discovered disease due abnormal hemoglobin called itano james v neel discovered two africanamerican families different blood condition similar sickle cell five ten individuals indicated sickled rbcs condition harmless individuals anaemia thus clear whether involved sickle cell disease genetically abnormal hemoglobin heterozygous next year neel colleagues established hemoglobin associated sickle cell hemoglobin named hemoglobin hemoglobin c eventually found mutant hemoglobin highly prevalent west vernon ingram j hunt university cambridge discovered mutation single amino acid
