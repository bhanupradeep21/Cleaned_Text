degos disease also known köhlmeierdegos disease malignant atrophic papulosis extremely rare condition caused blockage arteries veins individuals condition develop papules diagnosed disease may also develop complications due impairment internal organs exact underlying mechanism still unknown effective treatment still fewer living patients presently known worldwide fewer reported medical literature however many individuals may go undiagnosed due rarity individuals develop symptoms ages however cases outside age range reported characteristic symptom degos disease development papules initially individuals may skin lesions rashes proceed develop distinct bumps papules circular shape porcelainwhite center red border papules age white centers sink border remain raised typically papules range cm width papules appear trunk upper extremities found individuals palms soles scalp symptoms vary depending whether individual benign variant malignant variant disease benign malignant forms development characteristic papules individuals benign form typical papules persisting anywhere years throughout whole lives benign form inner organs affected individual develops malignant form means papules present inner organs involved malignant cases involve problems gastrointestinal tract leading small intestine lesions abdominal pain diarrhea bowel perforation central nervous system involved symptoms include headaches dizziness seizures paralysis cranial nerves weakness stroke damage small areas brain due artery blockage cerebral infarcts cerebral hemorrhage additional organs commonly impacted include heart lungs kidneys symptoms may develop damage organs include double vision diplopia clouding lenses eyes swelling optic disc papilledema partial loss vision shortness breath chest pain epilepsy thickening someone benign form may suddenly develop symptoms malignant symptoms last anywhere weeks several years onset symptoms typically begins manifest ages cases condition newborns also papules characteristic disease develop due infarctions blockages smallmedium arteries veins underlying cause unknown though confirmed cases shown signs inheritance firstdegree relatives suggested disease familial inheritance pattern thought autosomal dominant disorder cases familial inheritance benign variant disease due lack knowledge pathomechanism condition prevention strategies known however order prevent worsening symptoms consistent evaluations conducted although disease known around years pathomechanism underlying still several hypotheses developed regarding underlying mechanism degos disease one theory suggests inflammation blood vessels may trigger condition another theory degos disease coagulopathy development thrombus resulting reduction blood flow common condition reduction blood flow throughout body lead damaged endothelial cells may perhaps lead formation characteristic papules another hypothesis suggests abnormal swelling proliferation vascular endothelium lead intestinal central nervous system thrombosis ultimately lead development symptoms associated degos disease overall individuals degos disease abnormal blockages arteries veins however cause blockages clinical evaluation identification characteristics papules may allow dermatologist diagnose degos papules white center bordered red ring lesions begin appear diagnosis degos disease supported histological findings cases show wedgeshaped connective tissue necrosis deep corium shape due blockageocclusion small individuals may diagnosed benign form papules present however individual may diagnosed malignant form involvement organs like lungs intestine andor central nervous system occurs malignant systematic form condition may suddenly develop even papules present several years order quickly diagnose shift malignant variant disease important individuals consistent followup evaluations evaluations depending organs suspected involved following procedures tests may conducted skin inspection brain magnetic resonance tomography colonoscopy chest xray andor abdominal due lack knowledge around underlying mechanism malignant atrophic papulosis effective treatment method treatment condition however several treatment methods tested still developed information regarding condition found fibrinolytic immunosuppressive therapeutic regimens tested found mostly unsuccessful treatment treating conditions comorbid degos disease physicians recently found improvement symptoms use eculizumab discovered dermatopathologist cynthia magro response eculizumab often immediate dramatic limited duration expensive needing infused every treprostinil use reported result clearing gastrointestinal central nervous system findings well clearing cutaneous lesions reports limited treprostinil may effective vasodilators may also increase population circulating endothelial cells allowing patient diagnosed malignant systemic form disease severely ill found complexes
