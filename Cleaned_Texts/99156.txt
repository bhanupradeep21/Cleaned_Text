acrylamide acrylic amide organic compound chemical formula white odorless solid soluble water several organic solvents chemistry perspective acrylamide vinylsubstituted primary amide produced industrially mainly precursor polyacrylamides find many uses watersoluble thickeners flocculation acrylamide forms burnt areas food particularly starchy foods like potatoes cooked high heat despite health scares following discovery dietary acrylamide thought unlikely carcinogenic humans cancer research uk categorized idea burnt food causes cancer acrylamide prepared hydration acrylonitrile catalyzed reaction also catalyzed sulfuric acid well various metal salts treatment acrylonitrile sulfuric acid gives acrylamide sulfate salt converted acrylamidewith base methyl acrylate methanol majority acrylamide used manufacture various polymers especially polyacrylamide watersoluble polymer low toxicity widely used thickener flocculating agent functions valuable purification drinking water corrosion inhibition mineral extraction paper making polyacrylamide gels routinely used medicine biochemistry purification acrylamide arise cooked foods via series steps reaction amino acid asparagine glucose condensation one maillard reactions followed dehydrogenation produces upon pyrolysis generates acrylamide discovery cooked foods contain acrylamide attracted significant attention possible biological iarc ntp epa classified probable carcinogen although epidemiological studies suggest dietary acrylamide consumption significantly increase peoples risk developing according efsa main toxicity risks acrylamide neurotoxicity adverse effects male reproduction developmental toxicity however according research concern nonneoplastic effects furthermore relation consumption acrylamide cancer rats mice shown still unclear whether acrylamide consumption effect risk developing cancer humans existing epidemiological studies humans limited show relation acrylamide cancer food industry workers exposed twice average level acrylamide exhibit higher cancer heatgenerated food toxicants heatox project european commissionfunded multidisciplinary research project running late early objectives estimate health risks may associated hazardous compounds heattreated food find cookingprocessing methods minimize amounts compounds thereby providing safe nutritious highquality found evidence acrylamide posing cancer risk humans compared many regulated food carcinogens exposure acrylamide poses higher estimated risk european heatox sought also provide consumers advice lower intake acrylamide specifically pointing homecooked food tends contribute far less overall acrylamide levels food industrially prepared avoiding overcooking one best ways minimize exposure acrylamide

however found likely acrylamides burnt wellcooked food cause cancer humans cancer research uk categorizes idea burnt food causes cancer american cancer society says laboratory studies shown acrylamide
