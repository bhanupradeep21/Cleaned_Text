berkeley called project genie system development corporation timesharing technology later developed become today known servers licklider played similar role conceiving funding early networking research formulated earliest ideas global computer network august bbn series memos discussing intergalactic computer network concept ideas contained almost everything internet today including cloud ipto convinced ivan sutherland bob taylor lawrence g roberts allencompassing computer network important concept met donald davies inspired interest data licklider submitted paper televistas looking
