beginning take form far back question seems continually arise connection mind body debate formally referred mindbody problem two major schools thought attempt resolve problem monism plato aristotle

toward attempting understand connection mind body another debate arose localization function functional specialization versus equipotentiality played significant role development behavioral

experiments however great deal experimental literature behavioral neuroscience comes study nonhuman species frequently rats mice monkeys result critical assumption behavioral neuroscience organisms share biological behavioral similarities enough permit extrapolations across species allies behavioral neuroscience closely comparative psychology ethology evolutionary biology neurobiology behavioral

behavioral neuroscience include biopsychology biological psychology physiological psychology subfield behavioral neuroscience appropriately narrower definition distinguishing characteristic behavioral neuroscience experiment either independent variable experiment biological dependent variable biological words nervous system organism study permanently temporarily altered aspect nervous system measured usually related behavioral variable computational models using computer formulate realworld problems develop although method often focused computer science begun move towards areas study

systems theoretical computational methods wide variety roles including clarifying experiments hypothesis testing generating new insights techniques play increasing role advancement biological different manipulations advantages limitations neural tissue destroyed primary consequence surgery electric shock neurotoxin confound results physical trauma masks changes fundamental neurophysiological processes interest example using electrolytic probe create purposeful lesion distinct region rat brain surrounding tissue affected change behavior exhibited experimental group postsurgery degree result damage surrounding neural tissue rather lesion distinct brain genetic manipulation techniques also considered temporary lesions achieved advanced genetic manipulations example certain genes switched pharmacological manipulations also allow blocking certain neurotransmitters temporarily function returns previous state drug general behavioral neuroscientists study similar themes issues academic psychologists though limited need use nonhuman animals result bulk literature behavioral neuroscience deals mental processes behaviors shared across different animal models however increasing technical sophistication development precise noninvasive methods applied human subjects behavioral neuroscientists beginning contribute classical topic areas psychology
