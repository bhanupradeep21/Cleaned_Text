unit surrounded soviet troops largely wiped late august early september attempted rejoin reported reached somewhere east dnieper west kharkiv likely poltava killed action september career teichmüller wrote papers space around years early algebraic investigations dealt valuation theory fields structure algebras valuation theory introduced multiplicative systems representatives residue field valuation rings led characterisation structure whole field terms residue field theory algebras started generalise emmy noethers concept crossed products fields certain kind algebras gaining new insights structure palgebras although main interests shifted geometric function theory teichmüller give algebra paper published explored steps toward galois theory algebras resulting introduction group later recognised third galois cohomology group habilitation teichmüller turned questions variation conformal structures surfaces raised earlier bernhard riemann henri poincaré felix klein robert fricke important innovation introduction quasiconformal mappings field using ideas first developed herbert grötzsch lars ahlfors different contexts teichmüllers main conjecture stated variation conformal structure realised uniquely extremal quasiconformal mappings teichmüller also established connection extremal quasiconformal mappings regular quadratic differentials using class related reciprocal beltrami differentials led another conjecture proclaiming existence bicontinuous bijective correspondence φ space real parts certain reciprocal beltrami differentials mg n moduli space conformal structures considered fact proved existence injectivity φ teichmüller also showed existence extremal quasiconformal mappings special case certain simply connected plane regions gave existence proof surface type g continuity argument uniformisation theorem finsler metrics also intended first step toward deeper investigation moduli spaces one last papers sketched idea endow moduli spaces analytic structure construct analytic fiber space riemann surfaces due early death teichmüller could fully work ideas however became seminal later work swiss mathematician kurt strebel gave overview lars ahlfors frederick gehrings work oswald teichmüller gesammelte abhandlungen teichmüller published five papers various algebraic topics three already year two papers function theory appeared one value distribution type problem using quasiconformal mappings already expert nevanlinna theory evidently greatly influenced ahlfors contributions teichmüllers habilitation thesis untersuchungen über konforme und quasikonforme abbildungen studies conformal quasiconformal mappings appeared next paper ungleichungen zwischen den koeffizienten schlichter funktionen inequalities coefficients simple functions considered beginning great contributions function theory culminated masterpiece extremale quasikonforme abbildungen und quadratische differentiale extremal quasiconformal mappings quadratic differentials monograph complement bestimmung der extremalen quasikonformen abbildungen bei geschlossenen orientierten riemannschen flächen determination extremal quasiconformal mappings closed oriented riemann surfaces teichmüller laid basis known theory teichmüller spaces developed theme one last papers veränderliche riemannsche flächen variable riemann surfaces things like extremal mappings pentagon verschiebungssatz displacement law shows great mastery deal special problems papers pure function theory like eine verschärfung des dreikreisesatzes tightening three circles
