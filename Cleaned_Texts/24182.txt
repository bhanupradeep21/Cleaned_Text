expression leading oogenesis starts process developing primary oocytes occurs via transformation oogonia primary oocytes process called one single oogonium one mature oocyte rise cells called polar bodies oocytogenesis complete either shortly birth commonly believed oocytogenesis complete additional primary oocytes created contrast male process spermatogenesis gametocytes continuously created words primary oocytes reach maximum development weeks gestational age approximately seven million primary oocytes created however birth number already reduced approximately million per ovary puberty number oocytes decreases even reach per ovary mature oocytes produced womans life others undergo atresiadegeneration two publications challenged belief finite number oocytes set around time renewal ovarian follicles germline stem cells originating bone marrow peripheral blood reported postnatal mouse ovary contrast dna clock measurements indicate ongoing oogenesis human females thus experiments required determine true dynamics small follicle formation succeeding phase ootidogenesis occurs primary oocyte develops ootid achieved process meiosis fact primary oocyte biological definition cell whose primary function divide process however although process begins prenatal age stops prophase late fetal life oocytes still primary oocytes halted stage development called dictyate menarche cells continue develop although every menstrual cycle meiosis ootidogenesis begins embryonic development halts diplotene stage prophase puberty mouse oocyte dictyate prolonged diplotene stage actively repairs dna damage whereas dna repair detectable predictyate leptotene zygotene pachytene stages primary oocytes continue develop menstrual cycle however synapsis occurs tetrads form enabling chromosomal crossover occur result meiosis primary oocyte developed secondary oocyte immediately meiosis haploid secondary oocyte initiates meiosis ii however process also halted metaphase ii stage fertilization ever occur egg fertilized disintegrated released menstruation secondary oocyte complete meiosis ii become ovum meiosis ii completed ootid another polar body created polar body small size
