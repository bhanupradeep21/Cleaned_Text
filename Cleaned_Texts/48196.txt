analysis dental remains valuable tool archaeologists teeth hard highly mineralised chemically stable therefore preserve well one commonly found animals analysis remains also yields wealth information used determine sex age individual whose mandibular dental remains found also shed light diet even geographic origins isotope result dental analysis applied recent longdead crucial part forensic anthropology terms identifying applied archaeological remains learn individual burial track larger changes diet population data methods estimate age based dentition divided two groups methods based development growth teeth applied infants children juveniles methods based changes dentition formation used estimate age easier estimate age individual using dental remains infancy childhood adulthood since emergence teeth development young people provide good relatively reliable indicators since teeth eruption follows pattern eruption deciduous teeth occurring birth end infancy age two permanent teeth erupting ages five observing teeth erupted developing mandible whether tooth deciduous permanent isolated remains reveal age individual evaluation tooth eruption done viewing images dental remains via radiographs mris ct among adults fully developed dentition numerous techniques developed age estimation looking various characteristics including periodontosis cementum apposition toothroot root resorption secondary dentine deposition attrition occlusal toothroot translucency method pioneered involves taking two measurements tooth viewing light placing values formula gain age another common method involves counting number alternating light dark bands methods based postformation changes rely microscopic holistic approach taken assess overall wear teeth example using brothwell chart assessing teeth wear like common since reliable indicator age signs wear simplest methods estimating sex individual based common differences size teeth male female individuals dimensions measured mesiodistal buccolingual dimensions commonly applied mandibular canines show greatest sexual dimorphism premolars molars maxillary incisors also show size differences males morphological differences used support sex estimation example comparing frequencies discrete traits deflecting wrinkle lower first molars distal accessory ridge one potential problem forms morphological identification aside fact variation teeth continuous possibility mistakes increases cases morphology teeth altered taphonomic advanced methods sex determination involve dna analysis dna extracted dental pulp amplified using polymerase chain reaction analysed however destructive process tends destroy sample either via cryogenic grinding opening root canals extract protein enamel analysis another molecular technique different signatures amelogenin males female individuals provides basis sex since dental apparatus comes direct contact foods consumed teeth provide direct best evidence diet individual ate analysis features teeth jaws cavities hypoplasias striations reveal sorts foods starting cavities usually result highsugar highcarbohydrate diets prevalence cavities dental remains suggests existence foods diet example dental analysis skeletal remains huntergatherers morocco years bp revealed diet high starchy foods may caused high rates tooth decay seen inferring highcarbohydrate sugar diet prevalence cavities necessary consider factors may increase severity dental diseases immune system individual already impaired infections cavities signs dental diseases prevalent thus features automatically attributed sugar enamel hypoplasia result disturbances enamel take form thinner missing areas enamel lines furrows enamel hypoplasias result external negative environmental conditions like poor nutrition diseases result tell us lifestyle metabolic disorders resulting poor diet disease particularly significant effect enamel range nonspecific diseases cause feature measles diphtheria deficiency vitamin identification enamel hypoplasias best done microscopic analysis tooth thin position hypoplasia tooth also tell childhood stress caused disruption tooth enamel occurred measuring distance hypoplasia cementoenamel junction since enamel remodel large sample size tracking changes dentition many generations show diets lifestyles changing line inquiry successful many cases example one looked enamel hypoplasia conducted starling stock looked hypoplasias five populations nile valley different time periods population fewer hypoplasias protoagriculturalist population bce demonstrates period early agriculture emerged one high levels similar vein dental remains population roman cibalae analysed revealed significantly higher frequency enamel hypoplasias females males interpreted showing women area worse terms diet hypoplasias related inherited conditions stress sole cause additionally hypoplasias occur severity hypopplasia directly correlate severity stress characteristics tooth morphology enamel structure developmental timing speed factors result necessary use multiple teeth types infer stress individual may experienced tooth wear another key feature dental remains analysed infer past diets wear result natural contact upper lower teeth called attrition wear result external objects like food coming contact teeth called wear subdivided studied seen naked eye macrowear studied seen microscope microwear constitutes pits scratches seen enamel surface different patterns microwear occur result different conspicuous macrowear constitutes chips teeth seen irregular surfaces contrast crown wear gradual chipping usually occurs enamel withstand force exerted jaws result fracture arise teeth particularly foreign element teeth causes therefore include inclusions within food bit grit bone commonly today actions like biting nails chewing pen injuries force also cause dental trauma like relation inferring diet chipping suggest inclusions within meal potentially bits loose grindstone making way finished cereal studies also shown huntergatherers chipping molars whilst agricultural communities highest frequencies chippings moving microwear pits microscopic cracks structure enamel result hard particles driven tooth surface cause tiny bits enamel fracture harder foods require force chewing grind foods result result pits whilst consumption softer foods creates scratches tough soft foods also create scratches opposing surfaces slide past analysing microwear common technique used involve use electron microscope days white light confocal microscopes used observe enamel tooth site abu hureyra syria scanning electron microscope photos taken teeth mesolithic neolithic layers patterns microwear analysed revealed food eaten neolithic harder coarser reflecting switch small grained seeds eaten mesolithic large grained cereals dominant neolithic well switch roots wild grains domesticated also change neolithic layers abu hureyra teeth later layers showing less attrition potentially due change food preparation potentially due shift consumption domesticated stable isotope analysis final category dental analysis diet considered usual techniques isotope analysis applied bones infer diet also applied teeth carbon nitrogen oxygen strontium commonly common technique distinguish diet diet based ratio carbon isotopes found within consumption plants use pathway photosynthesis like temperate zone vegetation incorporate less tissues plants use pathways including many tropical savanna use stable isotopes shown increasing importance millet rice neolithic site shandong nitrogen isotopes also commonly studied suggest agricultural marinebased diet since ratio increases higher food strontium oxygen isotope ratios hydroxyapatite used study geographical origins movements ancient people strontium isotope ratios vary different types rock soil differences isotopic ratios plants animals living regions different geology possibilities using dental calculus analysis increasingly recognised used stable isotope dna analysis one main benefits secondary material inherent part skeletal remains result people may less hesitant use analysis since techniques destroy damage additionally get macrofossils microfossils trapped calculus fragments cereals fibres even phytoliths found calculus making useful
