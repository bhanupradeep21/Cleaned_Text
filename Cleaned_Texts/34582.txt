rebecca calisi rodriguez american neuroendocrinologist wildlife biologist national geographic explorer associate professor neurobiology physiology behavior college biological sciences university california davis calisi leads research team studies brain controls sexual behavior reproduction parental care changes stress director science communications uc davis calisi also studies science communication advocates inclusivity equity diversity stem calisi born dallas texas september mexicanamerican mother dolores rebecca née rodríguez italianamerican father anthony paul calisi school spent lot time maternal grandparents cattle ranch near texasmexico constantly surrounded animals developed passion animal behavior young age also talent fine calisi attended skidmore college saratoga springs new york studied studio art theater theater classmates included lake bell jon bernthal calisi later moved massachusetts attended boston college majoring cultural psychology minoring studio completing bachelors arts calisi returned texas hired dallas independent school district elementary school teacher english second language instructor kindergarten calisi stayed role one year recruited dallas zoo aquarium teach develop curricula grades dallas zoo calisi commissioned paint mural dallas zoos education time calisi spent many hours volunteering various animal conservation projects biologists worked noted talent research encouraged pursue graduate degree science earned masters biology university texas research project involved studying mating habits coloration species spiny lizard called sceloporus pyrocephalus females brightly colored calisi uncovered hormones driving changes female coloration calisi completed masters work seen progressive studies aggression coloration animal focused males masters calisi published several firstauthor papers exploring physiology female mexican boulder spiny lizard sceloporus pyrocephalus striking observation female lizards much brighter intense coloration calisi sought understand endocrine mechanisms regulating coloration found higher cortisol levels associated less outstanding coloration higher testosterone estradiol associated conspicuous calisi reported findings masters thesis titled proximate ultimate mechanisms associated female secondary coloration mexican boulder spiny lizard sceloporus pyrocephalus proposed color honesty signal reproductive status females findings modify concept sexual selection inclusive female coloration still unsure type career looking calisi decided pursue graduate studies university california berkeley within department integrative calisi still driven understand biological underpinning parental care behavior felt best possible organism study birds calisi joined lab dr george bentlys mentorship calisi first explored stress modulates reproductive axis via interactions hypothalamic gonadotropininhibitory hormone gnih since gnih known downregulate sexual behavior birds important aspect reproductive system probe due regulatory found stress specifically spring leads increased activity paraventricular nucleus pvn well increased expression gnih cells suggesting impact stress pvn gnih system dependent phase reproductive thesis work calisi showed effects stress social environment gnih found stress hormone receptors expressed gnih cells highlights direct mechanism stress regulate reproductive behavior finishing graduate studies calisi conducted postdoctoral studies mentorship dr john wingfield uc davis dr timothy q gentner uc san calisi studied hormonal fluctuations adulthood affect calisi colleagues found circulating estradiol levels combination changes photoperiod affect learning different birds given high doses exhibited better accuracy auditory tasks photostimulated worse accuracy funded national science foundation well university california presidents postdoctoral fellowship calisi continued explore neuroendocrine molecular factors influence reproductive sexual behaviors birds postdoctoral researcher mentorship dr erica bree rosenblum dr lance kriegsfeld calisi recruited barnard college columbia university first faculty position assistant professor biology lab focused exploring physical chemical social environments affect health reproduction organisms neurobiological calisi quickly recruited back west coast university california davis took multiple faculty calisi became associate professor neurobiology physiology behavior college biological sciences well faculty center advancement multicultural perspectives science faculty environmental health sciences calisis lab still focuses understanding biological mechanisms underlying reproductive parental care behavior lens lab explores genetic changes occur brain underlie parental behaviors look insults stress system affect genomic activity brain regions implicated shortly setting lab calisi published innovative findings work conducted since lab focuses birds model organism specifically pigeons calisi colleagues found feral pigeons could provide honest indicator lead nyc blood lead levels highest summer pigeon blood lead levels mirrored children since pigeons could provide potent indicator environmental pollutants calisi supported uc davis extend research look evidence environmental toxins pigeons mirror neighbourhood level toxin calisis group also focuses exploring sexually dimorphic gene expression throughout tissues hypothalamicpituitarygonadal hpg thorough analysis showed sexdifferences evident along axis differences androgen receptor prolactin arginine vasopressin receptor highlight critical need sex parity research reproductive function work provided critical baseline calisis next question regarding effectcs stress hpg axis calisi group looked transcriptomic differences across male female rock doves response restraint found female rock doves exhibited increased responses stress levels hpg axis compared males many changes genes uniquely responsive calisis focus understanding exposure environmental pollutants affects endocrine function taken new realm model organism western mosquito study calisi explored pesticides impact gene expression reproductive behavior found despite observable behavioral changes detected increased estrogen receptor glucocorticoid receptor brain tissue suggesting nonlethal concentrations pollutants long lasting effects nervous calisi fervent advocate equity stem works affect tangible change scientific community specifically improve lives mothers first child calisi became aware lack support mothers science terms lack spaces lactation work conference settings lack childcare conferences lack open culture supports mothers stem early calisi written multiple articles given many seminars lectures topic supporting women mothers underrepresented minorities one particular conference calisi noticed lack suitable lactation rooms organized working group mothers science speak issue request basic needs support mothers conferences necessary components career trajectory along working group wrote article published proceedings national academy sciences discussing issues mothers face conferences solve simple cheap writing featured scientific american well discusses publish perish culture academia compatible supporting family majority burden placed mothers making even harder women stay competitive academia beside male calisis work center advancement multicultural perspectives science campos focusing making sure culture inclusivity extends typically underrepresented background using creativity background art finished video series highlighting latina women scientists one show young latina students successful scientists alongside efforts calisi focusing component lab science communication order insure everyone access reputable understandable information scientific making science accessible first step towards making scientific community inclusive equity calisi noted
