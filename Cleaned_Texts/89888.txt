biochemists scientists trained biochemistry study chemical processes chemical transformations living organisms biochemists study dna proteins cell parts word biochemist portmanteau biological chemist biochemists also research certain chemical reactions happen cells tissues observe record effects products food additives medicines biochemist researchers focus playing constructing research experiments mainly developing new products updating existing products analyzing said products also responsibility biochemist present research findings create grant proposals obtain funds future biochemists study aspects immune system expressions genes isolating analyzing synthesizing different products mutations lead cancers manage laboratory teams monitor laboratory work biochemists also capabilities designing building laboratory equipment devise new methods producing correct results common industry role development biochemical products processes identifying substances chemical physical properties biological systems great importance carried various types analysis biochemists must also prepare technical reports collecting analyzing summarizing information trends found biochemistry researchers often break complicated biological systems component parts study effects foods drugs allergens substances living tissues research molecular biology study life molecular level

laboratories understand treat diseases industrial biochemists involved analytical research work checking purity food beverages biochemists field agriculture research interactions herbicides plants examine relationships compounds determining ability inhibit growth evaluate toxicological effects surrounding life biochemists also prepare pharmaceutical compounds commercial distribution modern biochemistry considered subdiscipline biological sciences due increased reliance training accord modern molecular biology historically even term biochemist formally recognized initial studies performed trained basic chemistry also trained physicians job skills abilities one needs attain successful field work include science mathematics reading comprehension writing critical thinking skills critical nature experimental techniques occupation one also need convey trends found research written oral forms degree biochemistry related science chemistry minimum requirement work field sufficient position technical assistant industry academic settings phd equivalent generally required pursue direct independent research advance commercial environments one may need acquire skills management biochemists must pass qualifying exam preliminary exam continue studies receiving phd biochemistry biochemistry requires understanding organic inorganic chemistry types chemistry required emphasis
