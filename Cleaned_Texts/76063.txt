physiological psychologists uncover many truths human needed unlike subdivisions within biological psychology main focus psychological research development theories describe brainbehavior relationships physiological psychology studies many topics relating bodys response behavior activity organism concerns brain cells structures components chemical interactions involved order produce psychologists field usually focus attention topics sleep emotion ingestion senses reproductive behavior learningmemory communication psychopharmacology neurological disorders basis studies surround around notion nervous system intertwines systems body create specific nervous system described control system interconnects body systems consists brain spinal cord nerve tissues throughout systems primary function react internal external stimuli human body uses electrical chemical signals send responses different parts body made nerve cells called neurons system messages transmitted body

whether taking sensory stimuli sending brain sending messages brain order muscles contract relax emotion constitutes major influence determining human behaviors thought emotions predictable rooted different areas brains depending emotion emotional response divided three major categories including behavioral autonomic hormonal emotion activates several areas brain inside limbic system varies per several hormones secreted response emotions vary general emotional tuning specific hormones released certain emotions alone sleep behavior provoked body initiating feeling sleepiness order people rest usually several hours sleep reduction awareness responsiveness movement average adult human sleeps seven eight hours per night minute percentage sleeps less five six hours also symptom sleep deprivation even smaller percentage people sleep ten hours day oversleeping shown correlation higher mortality benefits oversleeping result sleep inertia feeling drowsiness period time waking two phases sleep rapid eye movement rem nonrem sleep rem sleep less restful stage dream experience muscle movements twitches also stage sleep persons heart rate breathing typically irregular nonrem sleep also sometimes referred slowwave sleep associated deep sleep bodys blood pressure heart rate breathing generally significantly decreased compared alert state dreaming occur state however person able remember due deep sleep inability consolidation occur memory rem cycles typically occur minute intervals increase length amount sleep one session progresses typical nights rest person four six cycles rem nonrem sleep important body order restore depletion energy wakefulness allows recovery since cell division occurs fastest nonrem cycle sleep also important maintaining functioning immune system well helping consolidation information previously learned experienced memory sleep deprived recall information typically decreased dreams occur sleep shown increase mental creativity problem solving period time since last nonrem cycle occurred increases bodys drive towards sleep also increases physical environmental factors great influence bodys drive towards sleep mental stimulation pain discomfort higherlower normal environmental temperatures exercise light exposure noise hunger overeating result increase wakefulness contrary sexual activity foods carbohydrates dairy products promote
