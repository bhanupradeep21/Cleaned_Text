neurological symptoms hypertensive precise mechanism pres fully understood considered related problem blood vessels brain several theories blood vessels may become inappropriately permeable allow surrounding brain tissue become swollen vasogenic theory posits elevated blood pressure overcomes normal capability blood vessels brain maintain normal cerebral blood flow excessive pressure damages endothelial layer barrier leading swelling edema predilection toward posterior brain may explained reduced density sympathetic innervation posterior circulation compared anterior circulation thus reduced adaptive capacity fluctuations elevations blood vasogenic theory seems explain almost cases pres severely elevated blood also called breakthrough hyperperfusion theory explain edema many cases blood pressure normal even low fact edema tends severe without abnormally elevated blood pres secondary causes blood vessel damage attributed mechanisms cytotoxic theory suggests direct cell damage toxins usually medications precipitates edema immunogenic theory suggests role immune system specifically consider cytotoxic immunogenic theories together single toxic appears role cytokines causing endothelial finally according neuropeptidecerebral vasoconstriction theory specific substances endothelin thromboxane trigger spasm blood vessels resultant vessel wall damage edema latter hypothesis supported frequent finding diffuse blood vessel spasms vasoconstriction many people evidence decreased although spasm may also consequence blood vessel damage rather therefore include vasospasm toxic
