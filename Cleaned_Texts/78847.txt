higher classification fourth trochanter almost suspended femur like basal iguanodonts neck vertebrae series long like hadrosaurs unable satisfactorily explain evolution unusual body british paleontologist david b norman placed outside iguanodontidae still within clade styracosterna defined containing iguanodonts hatchetlike sternum flattened hand claws agreed lurdusaurus derived chinese paleontologist hailu colleagues suggested newly discovered massively built lanzhousaurus china closely related lurdusaurus former basal latter classified basal american freelance researcher gregory paul argued lanzhousaurus much deeper prepubic process two genera probably closely allied though hypotheses wholly unverifiable without complete remains paul agreed lurdusaurus basal iguanodontidae based short broad hands massive thumb spike noted contemporary derived hadrosauriform ouranosaurus similar hand morphology therefore lurdusaurus could basal hadrosauriform paul could resolve matter complete remains american paleontologist peter galton placed lurdusaurus base styracosterna closely allied chinese equijubus classified derived iguanodonts new clade taquet agreed paul falls outside iguanodontidae also unsure exactly lurdusaurus relates phylogeny iguanodontia according galton colleagues muttaburrasaurus dryosauridae camptosauridae owenodon lurdusaurus equijubus iguanodon

protohadros telmatosaurus bactrosaurus saurolophus edmontosaurus brachylophosaurus corythosaurus parasaurolophus paleontologist thomas r holtz jr speculated lurdusaurus may dinosaur equivalent hippo share heavy stocky body plan suggested lurdusaurus like hippo generally slowmoving animal land water could reach high speeds generally iguanodonts thought predominantly bipedal facultatively bipedal lurdusaurus judging marked robustness limbs likely capable quadrupedal locomotion extended period overall unusual massive body plan including small skull circular chest powerful clawed forearms
