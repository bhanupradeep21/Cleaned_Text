psychology first impression event one person first encounters another person forms mental image person impression accuracy varies depending observer target person object scene etc medical source first impressions based wide range characteristics age race culture language gender physical appearance accent posture voice number people present economic status time allowed medical source first impressions individuals give others could greatly influence treated viewed many contexts everyday takes onetenth second people judge someone make first research finds time participants afforded form impression confidence impressions people quick form first impressions also fairly accurate target presents themself genuinely people generally good perceiving feigned emotions detecting lies upon first research participants reported forming accurate impressions specific targets tend accurate perceptions specific targets aligned others reports individuals also fairly reliable understanding first impression project however people good understanding well people like people tend underestimate much people like phenomenon called liking rate different qualities detected first impressions may linked important survival evolutionary example trustworthiness attractiveness two traits quickly detected evaluated study human people fairly good assessing personality traits others general appears difference first impression judgments older younger adults older adults judged young adult target photos healthier trustworthy less hostile aggressive younger adults older adults could lower response negative cues due slower processing speed causing see facial features young adults positive younger adults ones first impressions affected whether theyre alone number joint experiences globally processed see global precedence processing collectivist cultures global processing emphasizes first impressions collective first impression tends remain stable time solo experiences tend facilitate local processing causing viewer take critical look target thus individuals likely negative first impressions groups two viewers target time individuals likely experience upward trend course series impressions eg individual viewers like final episode tv season first even really viewing pieces art experiment participants solo context rated art improving sequence significantly higher targets presented declining viewing art joint context participants evaluated first last pieces similarly kinds sequence simply priming viewers feel like solo joint contexts process analytically holistically enough produce viewing similar number viewers present collectivism versus individualism influence impression collectivists ease long impressions largely alignment larger groups impressions collectivist wants change impression may compelled change views group however could challenging collectivists tend less confrontational individualists individualists willing change views generally comfortable uncertainty makes naturally willing change research regarding national culture mediates relationship media richness bias impression formation studies manipulated media richness found information presented text form yields similar impressions measured reported appraisal scores among studies found richer forms information videos reduce crosscultural bias latter findings support media richness accents unique speech patterns influence people perceived speaking example hypothetically interviewing applicant midwestern us accent colombian accent french accent midwestern us participants evaluated us accent significantly positive applicant french accent due perceived similarity evaluation applicant colombian accent however differ significantly two first impressions heavily influenced similarityattraction hypothesis others immediately put similar dissimilar categories viewer judged although populations different cultures quick view others dissimilar several first impression characteristics universal across comparing trait impressions faces among us culturally isolated tsimane people bolivia betweenculture agreement ascribing certain physical features descriptive traits attractiveness intelligence health cultures also show strong attractiveness halo forming impressions meaning seen attractive also rated competent sociable intelligent physical appearance gives clear clues persons personality without ever speak women tend better men judging nonverbal viewing pictures people neutral position selfchosen posed position observers accurate judging targets levels extraversion emotional stability openness selfesteem combined impression physical characteristics body posture facial expression clothing choices lets observers form accurate images targets personality long person observed presenting however conflicting data field evidence suggests people sometimes rely much appearance cues actual provided descriptive information target participants still rely physical appearance cues making judgments others personalities capabilities participants struggle look past physical appearance cues even know information contrary initial physical cues also used make judgments political candidates based extremely brief exposures perceived competence level candidate measured first impressions facial features directly predict voting beautiful good effect present phenomenon dealing first impressions targets attractive rated positively possessing unique characteristics beauty also found somewhat subjective even targets universally attractive receive benefit effect observer attracted study group university york reported peoples impressions traits approachability youthfulnessattractiveness dominance correlated facial measurements mouth shape eye cosmetic use also important cue forming impressions particularly women wearing heavy makeup seen significantly feminine wearing moderate makeup makeup wearing heavy moderate makeup

dichotomy categorization sexual time participants allowed make judgment person weigh information beyond physical appearance specific manipulations include identifying men gay versus people trustworthy study interaction ratings people speed dating form media used present impression accuracy speed dating task significantly different potential date presented person versus video however impressions

evaluation viewing someone online nonverbal behaviors particularly important forming first impressions meeting business specifically components social expressivity smiling eyebrow position emotional
