biology dennys paradox refers apparent impossibility surfacedwelling animals water strider generating enough propulsive force move named biologist mark denny relates animal locomotion surface layer water capillary waves assumed generate momentum transfer water animals legs must move faster phase speed c displaystyle cm waves given g displaystyle g acceleration due gravity σ displaystyle sigma strength surface tension ρ displaystyle rho density water standard conditions works ms fact water striders legs move speeds much less according physical picture writing journal fluid mechanics david hu john bush state dennys paradox rested two flawed assumptions first water striders motion assumed rely generation capillary waves since propulsive force thought associated wave drag driving leg second order generate capillary waves assumed strider leg speed must exceed minimum wave speed c g σ ρ displaystyle rho ms note second assumption strictly true steady
