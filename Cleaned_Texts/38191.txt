consequences behavior operant conditioning originated work edward thorndike whose law effect theorised behaviors arise result whether consequences satisfying discomforting century operant conditioning studied behaviorist psychologists believed much mind behaviour explained result environmental conditioning reinforcements environmental stimuli increase behaviors whereas punishments stimuli decrease behaviors kinds stimuli categorised positive negative stimuli respectively involve addition removal environmental stimuli operant conditioning differs classical conditioning process stimuli paired biologically significant events produce involuntary reflexive behaviors contrast operant conditioning voluntary depends consequences behavior study animal learning century dominated analysis two sorts still core behavior analysis also applied study social psychology helping clarify certain phenomena false consensus operant conditioning sometimes called instrumental learning first extensively studied edward l thorndike observed behavior cats trying escape homemade puzzle cat could escape box simple response pulling cord pushing pole first constrained cats took long time get repeated trials ineffective responses occurred less frequently successful responses occurred frequently cats escaped thorndike generalized finding law effect states behaviors followed satisfying consequences tend repeated produce unpleasant consequences less likely repeated short consequences strengthen behavior consequences weaken behavior plotting escape time trial number thorndike produced first known animal learning curves humans appear learn many simple behaviors sort process studied thorndike called operant conditioning responses retained lead successful outcome discarded produce aversive

audience operant behavior said emitted initially elicited particular stimulus thus one may ask happens first place answer question like darwins answer question origin new bodily structure namely variation selection similarly behavior individual varies moment moment aspects specific motions involved amount force applied timing response variations lead reinforcement strengthened reinforcement consistent behavior tends remain stable however behavioral variability altered manipulation certain reinforcement punishment core tools operant behavior modified terms defined effect behavior either may positive negative another procedure called extinction total five consequences important note actors eg rat spoken reinforced punished extinguished actions reinforced punished extinguished

operant variability reinforcement described trainer starts identifying desired final target behavior next trainer chooses behavior animal person already emits probability form behavior gradually changed across successive trials reinforcing behaviors approximate target behavior closely target behavior finally emitted may strengthened maintained use schedule reinforcement noncontingent reinforcement delivery reinforcing stimuli regardless organisms behavior noncontingent reinforcement may used attempt reduce undesired target behavior reinforcing multiple alternative responses extinguishing target measured behavior identified strengthened controversy surrounding use term noncontingent though initially operant behavior emitted without identified reference particular stimulus operant conditioning operants come control stimuli present behavior reinforced stimuli called discriminative stimuli socalled threeterm contingency result discriminative stimuli set occasion responses produce reward punishment example rat may trained press lever light comes dog rushes kitchen hears rattle hisher food bag child reaches candy sees table behavior stimulus control several aspects may distinguished behavior easily described terms individual responses reinforced one one scope operant analysis expanded idea behavioral chains sequences responses bound together threeterm contingencies defined chaining based fact experimentally demonstrated discriminative stimulus sets occasion subsequent behavior also reinforce behavior precedes discriminative stimulus also conditioned reinforcer example light sets occasion lever pressing may used reinforce turning around presence noise results sequence noise turnaround light press lever food much longer chains built adding stimuli responses escape learning behavior terminates aversive stimulus example shielding ones eyes sunlight terminates aversive stimulation bright light ones eyes example negative reinforcement defined behavior maintained preventing stimulus called avoidance example putting sun glasses going outdoors avoidance behavior raises socalled avoidance paradox may asked nonoccurrence stimulus serve reinforcer question addressed several theories avoidance see two kinds experimental settings commonly used discriminated freeoperant avoidance learning discriminated avoidance experiment involves series trials neutral stimulus light followed aversive stimulus shock neutral stimulus appears operant response lever press prevents terminate aversive stimulus early trials subject make response aversive stimulus come early trials called escape trials learning progresses subject begins respond neutral stimulus thus prevents aversive stimulus occurring trials called avoidance trials experiment said involve classical conditioning neutral cs conditioned stimulus paired aversive us unconditioned stimulus idea underlies twofactor theory avoidance learning described freeoperant avoidance subject periodically receives aversive stimulus often electric shock unless operant response made response delays onset shock situation unlike discriminated avoidance prior stimulus signals shock two crucial time intervals determine rate avoidance learning first ss shockshock interval time successive shocks absence response second interval rs responseshock interval specifies time operant response delays onset next shock note time subject performs operant response rs interval without shock begins anew theory originally proposed order explain discriminated avoidance learning organism learns avoid aversive stimulus escaping signal stimulus two processes involved classical conditioning signal followed operant conditioning escape response classical conditioning fear initially organism experiences pairing cs aversive us theory assumes pairing creates association cs us classical conditioning aversive nature us cs comes elicit conditioned emotional reaction cer fear b reinforcement operant response fearreduction result first process cs signals fear unpleasant emotional reaction serves motivate operant responses responses terminate cs reinforced fear termination note theory say organism avoids us sense anticipating rather organism escapes aversive internal state caused cs several experimental findings seem run counter twofactor theory example avoidance behavior often extinguishes slowly even initial csus pairing never occurs fear response might expected extinguish see classical conditioning animals learned avoid often show little evidence fear suggesting escape fear necessary maintain avoidance theorists suggest avoidance behavior may simply special case operant behavior maintained consequences view idea consequences expanded include sensitivity pattern events thus avoidance consequence response reduction rate aversive stimulation indeed experimental evidence suggests missed shock detected stimulus act reinforcer cognitive theories avoidance take idea step farther example rat comes expect shock fails press lever expect shock presses avoidance behavior strengthened expectancies operant hoarding refers observation rats reinforced certain way may allow food pellets accumulate food tray instead retrieving pellets procedure retrieval pellets always instituted oneminute period extinction additional food pellets available accumulated earlier could consumed finding appears contradict usual finding rats behave impulsively situations choice smaller food object right away larger food object delay see schedules first scientific studies identifying neurons responded ways suggested encode conditioned stimuli came work mahlon rt showed nucleus basalis neurons release acetylcholine broadly throughout cerebral cortex activated shortly conditioned stimulus primary reward conditioned stimulus exists neurons equally active positive negative reinforcers shown related neuroplasticity many cortical evidence also exists dopamine activated similar times considerable evidence dopamine participates reinforcement aversive dopamine pathways project much densely onto frontal cortex regions cholinergic projections contrast dense even posterior cortical regions like primary visual cortex study patients parkinsons disease condition attributed insufficient action dopamine illustrates role dopamine positive showed medication patients learned readily aversive consequences positive reinforcement patients medication showed opposite case positive reinforcement proving effective form learning dopamine activity high neurochemical process involving dopamine suggested underlie reinforcement organism experiences reinforcing stimulus dopamine pathways brain activated network pathways releases short pulse dopamine onto many dendrites thus broadcasting global reinforcement signal postsynaptic allows recently activated synapses increase sensitivity efferent conducting outward signals thus increasing probability occurrence recent responses preceded reinforcement responses statistically likely behavior responsible successfully achieving reinforcement application reinforcement either less immediate less contingent less consistent ability dopamine act upon appropriate synapses reduced number observations seem show operant behavior established without reinforcement sense defined cited phenomenon autoshaping sometimes called sign tracking stimulus repeatedly followed reinforcement consequence animal begins respond stimulus example response key lighted food presented repeated times pigeon subject begins peck key even though food comes whether bird pecks similarly rats begin handle small objects lever food presented strikingly pigeons rats persist behavior even pecking key pressing lever leads less food omission another apparent operant behavior appears without reinforcement contrafreeloading observations others appear contradict law effect prompted researchers propose new conceptualizations operant reinforcement general view
