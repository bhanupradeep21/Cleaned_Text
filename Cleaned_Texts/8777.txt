coronary ischemia myocardial cardiac medical term reduced blood flow coronary circulation coronary coronary ischemia linked heart disease heart coronary arteries deliver oxygenrich blood heart reduced blood flow heart associated coronary ischemia result inadequate oxygen supply heart oxygen supply heart unable keep oxygen demand muscle result characteristic symptoms coronary ischemia common chest chest pain due coronary ischemia commonly radiates arm certain individuals women diabetics elderly may present varied blood flow coronary arteries stopped completely cardiac muscle cells may die known myocardial infarction heart coronary artery disease cad common cause coronary coronary ischemia coronary artery disease contributors development heart failure diagnosis coronary ischemia achieved attaining medical history physical examination addition tests electrocardiography ecg stress testing coronary treatment aimed toward preventing future adverse events relieving beneficial lifestyle modifications include smoking cessation heart healthy diet regular medications nitrates betablockers may useful reducing symptoms coronary refractory cases invasive procedures percutaneous coronary intervention pci coronary artery bypass graft cabg may performed relieve coronary key symptom coronary ischemia chest pain pressure known angina angina may present typically classic symptoms atypically symptoms less often associated heart atypical presentations common women diabetics elderly angina typically located individuals experiencing angina characterize pain different ways pain usually described crushing squeezing symptoms may worsen course several typical angina aggravated physical activity emotional stress relieved rest pain may radiate parts body commonly left arm individuals pain may less severe present pressure less commonly pain may radiate arms jaw women diabetic individuals elderly individuals likely present atypical symptoms chest women may present back pain shortness breath heartburn nausea heart disease women goes undetected prior major cardiac event among women experience heart attack many prior chest due alterations sensory pathways diabetic elderly individuals also may present without chest pain may atypical symptoms similar seen type ischemia also known silent coronary artery disease cad occurs fatty substances known plaques adhere walls coronary arteries supplying heart narrowing constricting blood flow process known atherosclerosis common cause coronary angina may start occur vessel lack oxygen may also result myocardial infarction heart cad contracted time risk factors include family history cad smoking high blood pressure diabetes obesity inactive lifestyle mental stress high angina also occur due spasm coronary arteries even individuals without coronary artery spasm vessel constricts limit blood flow artery causing decrease oxygen supply heart although mechanisms phenomenon fully coronary ischemia serious consequences treated plaques walls coronary arteries rupture resulting occlusion artery deprivation blood flow oxygen heart muscle resulting cardiac cell known myocardial heart attack cause arrhythmias well permanent damage heart coronary ischemia resulting coronary artery disease also increases risk developing heart cases heart failure result underlying coronary artery myocardial infarction carries greater fivefold increase relative risk developing heart coronary ischemia suspected series tests undertaken confirmation common tests used electrocardiogram exercise stress test coronary medical history taken including queries past incidencesspelling chest pain shortness breath duration frequency symptoms noted measures taken relieve resting electrocardiogram ekg early step diagnostic electrocardiogram ekg involves use electrodes placed arms chest sensors detect abnormal rhythms heart may producing test painless helps detect insufficient blood flow ekg also detect damage done past test also detect thickening walls left ventricles well defects electrical impulses quick provides physician ppr heart rate qrs qtqtcf pqrst axis cardiac stress test puts stress heart exercise series exercises measure tolerance stress heart carried test uses ekg detect electrical impulses heart physical treadmill exercise bike used incline resistance bike steadily increased target heart rate persons age weight however exercise stress test always accurate determining presence blockage women young may show abnormalities test even though signs coronary ischemia cad harmless

motion ischemia detected visualizing abnormalities movement heart thickness heart wall people may unable exercise order achieve sufficient heart rate useful test cases highdose dobutamine may used chemically increase heart dobutamine insufficient purpose atropine added reach goal heart dipyridamole alternative dobutamine less effective detecting exercise echocardiograms effective detecting coronary artery disease forms stress echocardiograms effective exercise ekg detecting coronary ischemia secondary coronary artery stress echocardiography normal risk future adverse cardiac events low enough invasive coronary angiography coronary angiography performed stress test ekg shows abnormal test important finding blockages test helps determine angioplasty bypass surgery coronary angiography performed patient willing undergo coronary revascularization test doctor makes small incision patients groin arm inserts catheter small video camera end doctor find found arteries inject dye detect blockages dye able seen special xray coronary ischemia treated changing lifestyle blockages change lifestyle mixed prescribed medication improve cases coronary revascularization procedures may tobacco smoking clear risk factor development coronary artery exposure second hand smoke also clear cardiovascular tobacco smokers higher levels cholesterol triglycerides risk factors development coronary artery smoking shown numerous studies accelerate atherosclerosis several study showed quit smoking reduced risk hospitalized next two benefits smoking cessation greater longer individual abstinent two years smoking cessation risk heart attack cut smoking cessation significant mortality benefit regardless nicotine replacement therapy bupropion varenicline safe therapies improve likelihood smoking healthy diet important factor preventing coronary ischemia coronary artery hearthealthy diet low saturated fat cholesterol high fruits vegetables whole recent studies shown inverse correlation increased fruit vegetable intake risk mortality benefit seen individuals higher intake whole food choices reduce risk heart attack congestive heart failure foods may also slow growth plaques coronary arteries reduce increasing physical activity possible manage body weight reduce blood pressure relieve moderate intensity exercise minutes per day days per week moderate intensity exercise defined exercise increases heart rate maximum heart high intensity exercise increasing heart rate maximum heart rate shorter intervals least effective type exercise may increase oxygen uptake heart compared moderate intensity per center disease control estimate maximum heart rate individual calculated subtracting age exercising way reduce risk getting heart disease coronary medicationbased therapy coronary ischemia focused reducing likelihood future adverse cardiac events treating symptoms coronary ischemia key medications strong evidence benefit include aspirin alternatively medications help prevent clots coronary artery occlusion lead heart angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors indicated individuals diabetes kidney disease statin medications help reduce cholesterol plaque formation may even contribute plaque medications may used reduce symptoms coronary ischemia particularly angina long short acting nitrates one option reducing anginal nitrates reduce symptoms angina dilating blood vessels around heart increases oxygenrich blood supply muscle cells veins also dilated reduces return blood heart easing strain heart shortacting nitrates taken upon onset symptoms provide relief within nitroglycerin common shortacting nitrate applied long acting nitrates taken times per day used prevent betablockers may also used reduce incidence chronic betablockers prevent episodes angina reducing heart rate reducing strength contraction heart lowers oxygen demand individuals symptoms well controlled medical lifestyle therapy invasive options available including percutaneous coronary
