female copulatory vocalizations also called female copulation calls coital vocalizations produced female primates including human females female nonprimates copulatory vocalizations usually occur copulation hence related sexual vocalizations occur intercourse purpose attracting mates known mating calls primates copulation calling typically observed end vast variations species regarding occurrence frequency form agreed coital vocalizations fulfill evolutionary serve adaptive solutions problems females face infanticide well obtaining high quality nonprimates copulatory calling predominantly occurs copulation order attract mates mating call calls vary frequency function one main purposes females vocalizing induction mate guarding behavior conversely calls may also used order attract high ranking mates prevent intercourse initial done incite male mate competition humans coital vocalizations linked sexual pleasure sexual gratification hence occurring copulation serving expression sexual pleasure vocalizations used intentionally women order boost selfesteem partner cause quicker addition emitting copulatory vocalizations copulation mostly seen primates nonprimate species also vocalize engaging mating vocalizations made prior copulation named mating calls serve means advertise sexual receptivity predominantly used males attract female general nonprimates emit calls copulating exemplified croaks male melodic tweeting song regard calling properties frequency analysis typically used research look complexity vocalization distinguish calls important determining large frequency variations noted species ranging hz hz mice instance use hz calls continuously prior copulation lower frequency hz copulatory act therefore two qualitatively different calls used attracting mates compared actual act calling mice done males use ultrasonic calls hz hence discernible human ear attract females quantity calls related males mating success making vocalizations sexually selected end spectrum female african elephants use low frequency calls hz prior well due low frequency calls heard several kilometers therefore effective signalling receptivity vocalizations female elephants also used order incite mate guarding behavior manifests form fighting newly arriving mates females make use male columbian ground squirrels observed use copulatory vocalizations order announce postcopulatory mate guarding addition used retain mate via mate guarding induction female copulatory vocalizations also employed achieve departure red junglefowls instance utilize calls order prevent end unwanted copulations attracting another highranking male effects female calling males behavior illustrated spiders shown stridulate copulation inform males sexual well intercourse order influence male genitalic moreover attracting new mates calling copulation entail many benefits female female crickets mate multiple partners receive greater number nuptial causing lay larger quantity eggs hence increasing reproductive success nonhuman primates copulatory vocalizations begin towards end copulatory act even percentage vocalizations copulation varies dependent nonhuman primate species studied longtail macaques instance copulations followed copulation calls contrast percentage chimpanzees tonkean macaques found little consensus causes interspecific differences given lack consistent findings within typical quantity specimen tested experimental settings often low order allow general conclusions species another aspect coital vocalization varies according species form call macaques baboons manifest grunts whereas species talapoins chimpanzees typically emit screaming quality structure copulatory calls analyzed comparing respective spectrograms terms frequency accordingly species produce calls structurally complex others linked amount promiscuity exhibited way promiscuous species emit faceted calls order convey information hence render selfadvertisement copulatory calls primates serve adaptive function sexually calling signals sexual receptivity female therefore affects mate choice many different hypotheses exact adaptive function female copulatory calls primates research subject still early general agreement copulatory calls adaptive solution problems reproductive success words copulatory vocalizations address issues stand way successfully producing offspring guaranteeing survival occurrence prevent killing offspring female baboons employ copulatory calls order attract males allowing multiple mating acts creating parental confusion among males involved resulting uncertainty father hence reduces occurrence attacks given newly incited risk potentially harming additionally mating rapid successions also entails sperm competition therefore fulfills additional function obtaining high quality especially important species openly advertise good genes via honest attracting males postcopulatory calls female might provoke mate guarding behavior initial mate parental two outcomes firstly male might high quality allowing fend attracted call case female gained someone protect prevents infanticide males also means inseminated specimen potentially good genes secondly male fails successfully guard mate newly arrived males hence inciting sperm competition paternity confusion preventing attacks offspring well increasing likelihood obtaining high quality sperm calls produced female also carry information status male copulating thus allowing influence likelihood males accordingly copulatory calls serve single adaptive function mutual exclusivity comes addressing two problems described namely infanticide receiving high quality sperm however taking females cycle stage account sperm competition ruled primary underlying cause copulatory precisely females produce coital vocalizations also mate nonfertile periods therefore primarily aimed attracting many males possible create parental confusion rather obtaining high quality females interest advertising periods fertility given males would pick patterns reducing paternal confusion causing increase aggressive behavior towards offspring hidden fertility coined concealed ovulation part extended female sexuality addition incitement parental confusion order avoid infanticide female primates exhibit promiscuous behavior also reap nongenetic material benefits female uses vocalizations copulating mate attracts males also likely engage multiple acts consequence male mates provide nongenetic benefits food female mated vocalizationfacilitated promiscuity heightens females reproductive success strategy mate multiple partners order obtain material benefits equally observed theories diverse regard womens sexual vocalizing one hand researchers noted apparently communicative patterns women copulatory vocalizations suggest parallels primates including invitation sperm competition given female sexual vocalizations like primates serve copulation calls noticeable men exciting one study instance noted female sexual vocalizations tend become intense approaches orgasm orgasm vocalizations usually discrete random appearing related observed contractions superficial perivaginal striated muscles turn probably correlate wave erotic vocalization tends become rapid regular rhythm includes equal note lengths intervals notes male vocalization typically especially frequent orgasm occurs penilevaginal exciting partner vocalizations bringing orgasm point helps ensure seminal pool available cervix dip vagina relaxes copulatory vocalizations may also type mate retention behaviour one study found women perceived high risk infidelity relationship likely utilize copulatory vocalizations order fake orgasm along mate retention hand recent studies indicated copulatory vocalizations women accompany orgasm rather partners ejaculation study showed man typically finds womans vocalization arousing highly exciting woman aware women study furthermore indicated vocalized intercourse make man ejaculate quickly boost enjoyment selfesteem correlation found frequency vocalizations sexual satisfaction men reasons women gave wanting force quick ejaculation include alleviation females pain fatigue even boredom simply stay within imposed time restriction sexual activity reasons wanting boost male selfesteem included reinforcing pair bond intercourse helps strengthen thus reducing emotional sexual infidelity researchers note goals apparently congruent female copulatory vocalizations nonhuman primates notes
