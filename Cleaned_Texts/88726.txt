brown psychologists jerome bruner jacqueline goodnow george brown building ideas roger says human beings learn name transform experience symbols language tutors parents peers educators media argues human beings create names abstracting experience classifying abstractions different symbolic categorizations brown urges names abstractions simultaneously direct attention certain parts experience away parts brown suggests names create expectancies argues enables human beings use names rhetorically clarify ambiguous experience suggest approach avoidance behavior toward experience unite divide example naming persons actions terrorism clarifies experience suggests avoidance behavior divides experience ones named guerilla warfare brown closes chapter outlining calls rhetorical reasoning process human beings advocate particular ways naming experience process involves proposing name explaining name fits experience suggesting expected response experience based proposed brown notes discussions negotiations agreements disagreements symbolic classification experience human beings create symbolic article ideology communication process published quarterly journal speech brown merges research ideology symbolic categorization propose model describe rhetorical process human beings create maintain change ideology extension social two later articles brown refers model rhetoric social ideology article brown argues communication creation ideology occur simultaneously although specific ideology might fade communication process constituting maintaining changing ideology rsi model directs attention continuous communication process underlies social change brown defines ideology symbolic construction world whose superordinate name human beings comprehensively order experience subsume specific essence views ideology ultimate symbolic categorization experience creates shaped social system ideology overarching name influences social system participants make sense world social hierarchy needs time ideology emerges participants symbolically constitute worldview power example according rsi model american dream ideology influences us americans interpret needs roles society eg need freedom actions take toward achieving freedom also create american dream extending roger brown rsi model holds human beings learn ideology language learn specific names experience also learn attributes expectancies associated social systems symbolically constructed example us social system often identifies attributes individualism freedom equality success progress american dream ideology american dream ideology creates expectancy perfect life achieved pursuing brown theorizes human beings construct ideology meet inherent human need ultimate sense order meaning explanation thus identifies ultimacy primary attribute ideology distinguish names given everyday experience writes ideology category experience one willing bet meaning ones rsi model ideology arises naming human beings create ideology abstracting naming sensed nonsensed experience model focuses symbolic abstraction process associated naming worldview relationships needs model refers three symbolic subsystems attention power need brown proposes subsystems holistically interconnected change one brings simultaneous change hence rsi model provides systemic brown later calls holographic approach understanding social system according rsi model ideology like names experience abstractive ideologies brown theorizes human beings adhere ideology long seems make comprehensive sense experience model predicts ideology always incomplete adherents encounter violate fit ideological expectancies human beings inherent need avoid sense chaos uncertainty must find way account make sense anomalies maintain sense order meaning thus brown argues symbolic process human beings create maintain ideology paradoxically process enables account rhetorically anomalies concludes rhetorical interventions address anomalies drive social system rsi model directs attention rhetorical process human beings deal anomalies focusing communication patterns associated symbolic construction attention power need brown views symbolic subsystems starting point analyzing initiating communication interventions promote impede ideological extension social system ideology article refers attention subsystem two later articles call subsystem rsi model human beings symbolically construct ideology create complex naming patterns make sense interpret experience symbolically constitute templates worldviews give meaning daily create complex naming patterns eg good education lead better life abstracting paying attention aspects experience foregrounding directing attention away aspects attention interventions occur human beings attempt account anomalies complex naming patterns communicatively shifting attention brown concludes rhetorical shifts attention drive social system attention rhetoric social intervention article brown describes detail attention intervention aspect rsi rsi model holds complex naming patterns create expectancies experience eg getting good education make life better lived experience fails match symbolically created expectancy eg person good education find job model suggests human beings may become attentive anomalies naming pattern furthermore widely human beings apply naming patterns likely encounter anomalies naming patterns abstractions human beings assumed inherent need order make sense experience model predicts human beings attempt compensate symbolically anomalies model human beings communicatively promote impede attention switches compensate anomalies maintain meaning order attention switching involves symbolic recategorizing experience renaming expectancies associated symbolic attention switching occurs human beings rhetorically shift attend example instead foregrounding education means making better life might shift foregrounding spiritual development means achieve better life alternatively human beings could redefine good education meaning private education instead education cases rsi model would say human beings shifted attention make sense anomaly good education template according rsi model conditions attention switch exist two complex naming patterns make sense experience systemic shift occurs one template attention interventions involve cycles increased decreased communication related anomalies cycle human beings communicatively increase attention deviance symbolically created expectancies lived experience anomalies increasingly advocate alternative ways knowing valuing account anomalies openness alternative complex names regain sense order meaning attention article brown demonstrates rsi model concepts examining symbolic creation scientific worldview also applies rsi model identify attention switch cycles generated social system shifts us blackwhite relationships rsi model suggests promote attention switch interveners persons attempting bring prevent social change communicatively feature attention anomalies currently held complex names advocate alternative template foregrounds aspects experience backgrounded currently held complex name symbols mask attention anomalies proposed naming pattern interveners attempting prevent social system change communicatively feature attention anomalies proposed template mask attention anomalies currently held naming pattern attention switch experience assumed change changes human beings symbolically categorize although experience change rsi model suggests appears different concurrent shifts interpretations power shift new worldview brings corresponding shifts symbolic categorizations needs power relationships well alternative social system rsi model predicts human beings shift attention new naming pattern eventually also encounter anomalies pattern naming patterns incomplete cycle attention switching begin thus although content naming pattern may change communication process creating maintaining changing naming patterns rsi model attention subsystem one starting point rhetorical analysis intervention social system change alternatively social change also examined starting point symbolic construction ideology article refers power subsystem interpersonal two later articles call subsystem rsi model human beings interdependent others symbolic construction sharing needs model holds social systems arise naming relationships human beings interpersonally categorize create reify roles social hierarchy relationship rules creating social order human beings also create ideology time ideology influences social system participants assumptions social power interventions occur human beings attempt account anomalies symbolically created hierarchy rhetorical interventions drive social system change continuity power rhetoric social intervention article brown describes detail power intervention aspect rsi brown defines power degree human beings feel interdependent others fulfilling needs choosing rsi model human beings form powersharing social systems share responsibility meeting needs making choices shape social systems rsi model treats power communication medium provides rules power codes taking actions andor making decisions without brown posits relational names communicate sociologist niklas luhmann calls power codes shape relationship participants choices example relational name teacherstudent students typically choose follow teachers direction homework social system expectancies associated relationship time teachers usually follow social systems expected rules behavior treating students fairly according model human beings create power communication symbolically constituting create relationships naming people different acting similarities differences real meaning human beings learn relational names language tutors learn expectancies social system associates thus model relational names nonsensed symbolic abstractions human beings make real behave toward others objects created represent relational example stripes persons shirt social expectation person salute officers make real symbolic category rsi model holds social hierarchy arises naming relationships different model relational names emphasize similarities self called complementary eg friends coworkers names convey expectancy relational names emphasize differences called reciprocal eg winnerloser coachplayer names convey expectancy social hierarchy composed complementary reciprocal relationships social hierarchy becomes symbolic reality human beings act relationships real expectancies according model expectancies associated relational names violated conditions power intervention example teacher treat students fairly students might attempt power intervention complaining teachers superior dropping class specifically power interventions involve cycles attention shifts cooperation maintain current social hierarchy competition offering alternative hierarchy vice cycle human beings communicatively increase attention anomalies social hierarchy increasingly advocate alternative ways social organizing based exchange threat integry become open alternative social hierarchies regain social order human beings attribute motives choice cooperate challenge social brown draws upon economist kenneth bouldings ideas social organizers suggest motives human beings attribute threat example human beings cooperate expect something return exchange cooperate expect negative outcome cooperate threat cooperate interpretation shared human identity like attention interventions power interventions occur communication interactions rsi model suggests encourage power shift interveners communicatively create social disorder foregrounding anomalies current social hierarchy template advocate alternative ways social organizing means regain social prevent power shift maintain current social hierarchy interveners communicatively foreground anomalies proposed template advocate ways account anomalies current template attempt dissuade openness alternative ways social cases brown concludes communication drives social system change social hierarchy symbolic abstraction always incomplete human beings shift one social hierarchy another newly adopted hierarchy one day appear nonneeds meeting thus model continuous cycle power shifts occur cooperation competition vice versa symbolic creation power article brown traces social hierarchy shifts blackwhite relationships lens rsi model also examines power intervention strategies tactics maneuvers new york urban planner robert moses demonstrate rsi model rsi model predicts shifts symbolic categorization power also result need attention shifts attention shifts occur human beings pay attention different aspects experience promote prevent power need interventions occur shifts power result changes interpretations needs attention subsystem model views power subsystem one entry point analyzing intervening social system alternatively social system change examined perspective need subsystem ideology article refers need subsystem intrapersonal two later articles call subsystem rsi model human beings innate need sense order know role society around important social systems construct ideology satisfy need constructed ideology shapes social system participants interpret need interventions occur human beings attempt account anomalies symbolically constructed interpretations needs specifically rsi model holds human beings two types needs biosocial biosocial needs innate needs necessary growth survival expressed communication eg person says need water fulfill biological need water symbolic needs constituted communication eg person says need brand x water advertisers persuaded person interpret brand x better meeting need health tap cases human beings create interdependencies others fulfill biosocial symbolic needs learn language tutors social systems assumptions needs important needs communicated brown draws upon social anthropologist edmund leachs idea codeswitching explain human beings create needs leach writes human beings talk act nonsensed abstract concepts exist physical world eg marriage prosperity recession forgotten symbolically constructed concepts code switch act nonsensed need interventions involve cycles increased decreased communication anomalies symbolic constructions brown theorizes need interventions involve cycles alternate attributing denying individual grouporiented cycle human beings communicatively increase awareness attention unmet attributeddenied needs increase advocacy behavior toward perceived able meet need become open respond attributed denied model predicts particular need fulfilled attention particular need decreases advocacy behavior decreases openness others time attention new needs addition need goes unmet human beings advocating need continually encounter nonneeds meeting responses might begin advocating need ways social system names inappropriate eg shifting protests setting buildings alternatively needs advocates might rename need way diminishes urgency shift attention according model promote shift needs intervener communicatively increases attention current needs met needs expectancies unfulfilled intervener advocates alternative interpretation needs shows makes better sense experience attempt increase others openness needs prevent shift needs intervener foregrounds anomalies proposed interpretation needs intervener advocates way account anomalies currently existing interpretation needs attempt maintain current interpretation cases communication drives social system change rsi model systemic need subsystem assumed interconnected power attention thus interpretations needs change interpretations power relationships within social system addition attention shifts occur social system emphasizes different types needs individual although brown presents rsi model three subsystems theorizes social system intervention holistic process involves three subsystems explains human beings linear language limits ability talk three subsystems concurrently thus analyzing enacting interventions human beings tend emphasize one subsystem background rsi model treats shifts backgrounded subsystems side effects primary subsystem addition rsi model social system interventions involve multiple brown notes though linear nature language often results human beings acting one person group primary rsi model suggests social system change attempts influenced simultaneously interveners communicating promote change interveners communicating impede brown names model social intervention emphasize conclusion attempt encourage discourage social system change intervention control argues interconnected nature subsystems communication actions multiple interveners mean outcome attempted system change evidences multicausation thus brown views social intervention communication act attempts nudge social system toward away particular way naming worldview power overall rsi model conceived
