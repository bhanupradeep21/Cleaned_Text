mouse tracking also known cursor tracking use software collect users mouse cursor positions goal automatically gather richer information people typically improve design interface often done web supplement eye tracking situations mouse tracking takes place without users consent example website may privacy implications computer mouse first invented douglas term mouse tracking originally referred movements captured transmitted computer example original tracker ball mouse used metal bearing pressed two rollers track much research technology gone type tracker provides accurate depiction users movement advent world wide web mouse tracking expanded include click data researchers developers would track record time user used mouse click something website well location event web developers use mouse clicks assess information users interested interact page additionally advertisers interested click data terms banner advertisements place ads pages get clickthroughs recently term mouse tracking expanded even develop much broader area research helping understand humancomputer interaction hci development began eye tracking eye tracking around since used hci primarily help answer questions users search commands computer menus develop systems help disabled recently eye tracking used usability testing web pages understand users point focus well test usability different features site dropdown information influence web design meets researchers goals yet user friendly problem using eye tracking usability testing required hardware expense additionally eye tracking limited small sample sizes abnormal browsing environments mouse tracking hand inexpensive data collected computer capacity mouse tracking reinvented hci research eye tracking researchers late noticed patterns eye mouse based findings researchers tracking click data realized might learn mouse monchu chen john anderson myeongho sohn carnegie mellon university began explicitly investigating whether tracking mouse movements could used proxy tracking eye movements research continued general findings research correlation one one relationship eye mouse movements turn suggests mouse movements fact used determine users focus attention recent research shown correlation depends strongly user behavior time whether user reading mouse moving perform click leaving furthermore mouse position actually correlates better past eyegaze positions meaning people typically look somewhere moving mouse generally tracking mouse positions lead vast improvement understanding user compared relying mouse clicks words click data informed researchers users primary focus attention end choice however looking mouse movements inform researcher options interest user selected clicking lead better overall understanding users thought process recent research area using knowledge improve websites applications specifically researchers trying parse different individual movements mean well beginning use mouse tracking usability testing improve products javascript scripting language supports multiple programming styles typically clientside require constant downloads website javascript implemented part web browser supported major web browsers including internet explorer firefox safari therefore using language web developers track users mouse movements simply entering lines code page require additional software installed users computer javascript enabled researcher collect data webpage mouse tracking using javascript deployed hightraffic websites search engines collect mouse movement data without affecting users computer performance current mouse tracking tools provide variety data including location mouse terms pixels time stamps time mouse hovers link interest mouse clicks time spent areas interest duration hovers additionally tracking tools provide high level analyses heat maps playbacks retrace mouses example output log mouse movements used infer users intent focus browsing website using mouse movements usability testing researchers determine users confused expectations met attention focused much additional information tool especially beneficial conjunction techniques used usability testing think aloud procedures information lead better mouse movement model tracking mouse movements used adapt interfaces real time based respondents interests researchers use information respondents hold mouse extended period time trajectory mouse assess level interest knowledge gained used resort search criteria based individual relevancy suggest objects products information might interest user mouse tracking allows web developers view behaviors actual users natural browsing environment instead laboratory tracking mouse located designers evaluate ease use websites specifically see difficult users find use certain features scroll bars dropdown menus locate important links additionally developers see parts pages users interested influence page layout focused designer wants computer user unique way using mouse used biometric example mouse movements used online security follows people rarely engage mouse need complete action others active mouse use read along text page users active mouse researchers successfully able learn user typical behavior supervised learning behavior learned linked individual account behavior user deviates significantly users learned typical behavior locked system identity verified another way ensuring user claim mouse tracking used education help understand impact reading computer opposed paper propose ways reading computer could adapted understanding
