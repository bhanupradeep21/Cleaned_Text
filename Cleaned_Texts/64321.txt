repetitive strain injury rsi injury part musculoskeletal nervous system caused repetitive use vibrations compression long periods fixed common names include repetitive stress injury repetitive stress disorders cumulative trauma disorders ctds overuse examples symptoms experienced patients rsi aching pulsing pain tingling extremity weakness initially presenting intermittent discomfort higher degree repetitive strain injury rsi associative trauma orders umbrella terms used refer several discrete conditions associated repetitive tasks forceful exertions vibrations mechanical compression sustained awkward positions repetitive eccentric exact terminology controversial terms used united states department labor national institute occupational safety health niosh musculoskeletal disorders msds workrelated muscular skeletal disorders examples conditions may sometimes attributed causes include tendinosis less often tendinitis carpal tunnel syndrome cubital tunnel syndrome de quervain syndrome thoracic outlet syndrome intersection syndrome golfers elbow medial epicondylitis tennis elbow lateral epicondylitis trigger finger socalled stenosing tenosynovitis radial tunnel syndrome ulnar tunnel syndrome focal general worldwide increase since rsis arms hands neck shoulder attributed widespread use workplace keyboard entry devices typewriters computers require long periods repetitive motions fixed extreme temperatures also reported risk factor workers certain fields risk repetitive strains occupational injuries musculoskeletal disorders many caused cumulative trauma rather single miners poultry workers example must make repeated motions cause tendon muscular skeletal jobs involve repeated motion patterns prolonged posture within work cycle may repetitive young athletes predisposed rsis due underdeveloped musculoskeletal factors personality differences workplace organization problems certain workers may negatively perceive work organization due excessive work rate long work hours limited job control low social support previous studies shown elevated urinary catecholamines stressrelated chemicals workers rsi pain related rsi may evolve chronic pain syndrome particularly workers supports coworkers age gender important risk factors rsis risk rsi increases women likely affected men smaller frame lower muscle mass strength due endocrine influences addition lifestyle choices smoking alcohol consumption recognizable risk factors rsi recent scientific findings indicate obesity diabetes may predispose individual rsis creating chronic low grade inflammatory response prevents body effectively healing damaged rsis assessed using number objective clinical measures include effortbased tests grip pinch strength diagnostic tests finkelsteins test de quervains

repetitive strain injuries early diagnosis critical limiting damage upper limb rsis occupational therapists create interventions include teaching correct approaches functional task movements order minimize risk rice rest ice compression elevation treatment used first treatment many muscle strains ligament sprains bruises injuries rice used immediately injury happens first hours injury modalities help reduce swelling commonly prescribed treatments earlystage rsis include analgesics myofeedback biofeedback physical therapy relaxation ultrasound lowgrade rsis sometimes resolve treatments begin shortly onset symptoms however rsis may require aggressive intervention including surgery persist yearscitation needed although quick fixes rsi effective approaches treatment one ergonomics changing ones environment especially workplace equipment minimize repetitive strain canadian study found exercise leisure time strongly associated decreased risk developing doctors sometimes recommend rsi engage specific strengthening exercises example improve sitting posture reduce excessive kyphosis potentially thoracic outlet modifications posture arm use often although
