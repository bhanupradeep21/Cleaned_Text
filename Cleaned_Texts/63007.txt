urine test strip dipstick basic diagnostic tool used determine pathological changes patients urine standard standard urine test strip may comprise different chemical pads reagents react change color immersed removed urine sample test often read little seconds dipping although certain tests require longer routine testing urine multiparameter strips first step diagnosis wide range diseases analysis
