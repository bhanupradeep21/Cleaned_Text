biological tests necessity sufficiency refer experimental methods techniques seek test provide evidence specific kinds causal relationships biological systems necessary cause one without would impossible effect occur sufficient cause one whose presence guarantees occurrence effect concepts largely based distinct ideas necessity sufficiency logic tests necessity among methods lesioning gene knockout tests sufficiency among methods isolation discrete stimulation factors become important currentday experimental designs application tests led number notable discoveries findings biological sciences biological research experiments tests often used study predicted causal relationships two causal relationships may described terms logical concepts necessity sufficiency consider statement phenomenon x causes phenomenon x would necessary cause occurrence implies x needed occurred however occurrence necessary condition x may always result also words factor necessary cause effect impossible effect without x would instead sufficient cause occurrence x implies must words factor sufficient cause effect presence cause guarantees occurrence however different cause z may also cause meaning may occur without x concrete example consider conditional statement object square four sides necessary condition object four sides true square conversely object square sufficient condition true object four four distinct combinations necessity sufficiency possible relationship two conditions first condition may second condition laypersons novice scientists may prefer think concepts necessity sufficiency certain ways study undergraduate psychology students students viewed necessity negative terms x rather logically equivalent x sufficiency understood sufficiency x rather logically equivalent x result also suggested students likely prefer thinking causes forward x direction rather backward x misunderstandings may occur regarding kinds evidence support causal relationships study applying causal concepts necessity sufficiency found college students biochemistry class likely erroneously misinterpret correlations signifying sufficiency cause study undergraduate psychology students also indicated potential discrepancy understanding sufficiency found students understood cause sufficient effect even effect always follow reverse direction effect may alternative causes cause sufficient always results effect occurring necessity proven demonstrating system work piece question active meaning required functioning biological research uses variety techniques inhibit structure genetic player lesions knockoutdeletion techniques fall category loss functioncitation needed lesioning test necessity involves physically damaging structure loses function lesioning structure causes change system structure lesioning look different across scientific disciplines psychology information necessity may gleaned observing changes behavior brain region destroyed either accident illness human purposefully lab disciplines may target specific cell types tag degradation system reports subset genes interest although independent effect combined apoptotic gene reaper rpr cells express genes interest along initiate cell death creating legion specific cell classic example lesioning chronobiology exploration circadian navigation monarch butterflies landmark experiment dr christine merlin dr steven reppert removed lesioned antennae monarch butterflies tested ability found monarchs could navigate without investigators use lesioning allowed come conclusion monarchs antennae necessary navigation absence prevented system knockout refers inactivation gene done several ways altering dna sequence longer performs function altering promoter region transcribed deleting gene aside helping scientists understand function gene observing behavior variable deletion create argument necessity behavior system ceases function allada et al performed

occur words sufficient conditions met targeted event able take place however mean absence sufficient biological element inhibits biological event occurring tests sufficiency include gain function discrete stimulation isolation biological element observe change targeted event types methods imperative several subfields biology particularly tests sufficiency common field chronobiology performing discrete stimulation researchers aim provide stimuli solely biological element interest returning dr reppert dr merlins work monarch butterflies inquiring role antennas monarch butterflys sun compass orientation researchers provided light antennas found stimulating antennas alone enough butterflies entrain comparably nonstimulated butterflies entrained condition result flight behavior stimulated group similar butterflies traditionally entrained result evidence antennas sufficient sun compass orientation discrete stimulation also used investigate location quantity circadian pacemakers plants namely arabidopsis tobacco investigating coupling circadian systems intact plants thain et al placed foil covering one cotyledon entrained uncovered cotyledon lightdark cycle hours light hours dark ld hours ahead covered cotyledon researchers covered opposite cotyledon entrained newly exposed cotyledon lightdark cycle delayed hours creating difference cotyledons using transgenic bioluminescence thain et al discovered two leaves phase displaying peaks luminescence opposite times provided evidence notion cotyledon sufficient maintaining independent circadian rhythm autonomous circadian method isolation determine sufficiency involves single biological element undergoing experimentation secluded interactions relevant biological elements method includes removal element question placing secluded testing conditions reppert merlin used method isolation research examining influence circadian clock outputs antennas suncompass orientation monarch butterflies researchers separated antennas butterfly placed separate conditions researchers proceeded patch clamp onto cell antenna puff odorant onto isolated cell determine rhythmicity firing concluded show rhythmicity response odorant firing rate high night low isolation antenna proves sufficiency relevant biological element sustaining rhythm system additionally utilizes approach research examining influence temporal relationship antennas monarch butterfly suncompass orientation researchers analyzed importance presence antennas suncompass orientation tested removing single antenna butterfly assessing flight behavior result found one antenna sufficient correct sun compass orientation regardless method isolation limited isolating single cells organs experimentation used analyze proteins role organism well namely nakajima et al
