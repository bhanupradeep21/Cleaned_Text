water caused osmotic laxatives work alleviate constipation drawing water bowels healthy individuals much magnesium vitamin c undigested lactose produce osmotic diarrhea distention bowel person lactose intolerance difficulty absorbing lactose extraordinarily high intake dairy products persons fructose malabsorption excess fructose intake also cause diarrhea highfructose foods also high glucose content absorbable less likely cause diarrhea sugar alcohols sorbitol often found sugarfree foods difficult body absorb large amounts may lead osmotic cases osmotic diarrhea stops offending agent eg milk sorbitol stopped exudative diarrhea occurs presence blood pus stool occurs inflammatory bowel diseases crohns disease ulcerative colitis severe infections e coli forms food inflammatory diarrhea
