methyl fluoroacetate mfa extremely toxic methyl ester fluoroacetic acid colorless odorless liquid room temperature used laboratory chemical rodenticide extreme toxicity mfa studied potential use chemical general population likely exposed methyl fluoroacetate people use mfa work however breathe direct skin contact mfa first synthesized belgian chemist swart reacting methyl iodoacetate silver fluoride also synthesized reacting methyl chloroacetate potassium toxicity mfa studied potential use chemical weapon world war ii considered good water poison since colorless odorless therefore toxify water supply kill big part population end war several countries began make methyl fluoroacetate debilitate kill synthesis methyl fluoroacetate consists twostep methyl fluoroacetate methyl ester structure consists carboxylic acid functional group fluorine atom mfa liquid odorless faint fruity smell boiling point mfa melting point soluble water mgl slightly soluble petroleum mfa resistant displacement fluorine nucleophiles higher stability cf bond compared halogens cl br haloacetates powerful alkylating agents react sh group proteins however happen mfa gives unique toxic moreover mfa derivative fluoroacetate fa compound toxic similar biotransformation mfa generally fluoroacetates toxic converted fluorocitrate fluoroacetyl coenzyme fluorocitrate inhibit aconitate hydratase needed conversion citrate competitive interrupts citric acid cycle tca cycle also causes citrate accumulate tissues eventually plasma mfa mainly biotransformed glutathione transferase enzyme phase biotransformation process gshdependent enzyme couples glutathione mfa thereby defluorinating mfa result fluoride anion scarboxymethyl glutathione produced decoupling fluoride mediated fluoroacetatespecific defluorinase defluorinating activity mainly present liver also kidneys lungs heart testicles show activity brain signs defluorination eventually fluorocitrate fc formed main toxic compound binds aconitase enzyme high affinity therefore intervenes tca cycle citrate normal circumstances converted succinate process inhibited cycle stops oxidative phosphorylation prevented since nadh succinate required tca cycle respiration stops shortly poison acts quickly antidote mammals intolerant mfa however australian species eg brushtailed possum show level tolerance fluoroacetate metabolizing using fluoride removed fluoroacetate fluorocitrate involved detoxifying aryl alkyl groups converting glutathione conjugates cf bond cleaved nucleophilic attack carbon resulting formation scarboxymethyl glutathione afterward excreted form elimination halflife biotransformed mfa days administered mfa mainly resides blood plasma also traced liver kidney muscle mfa convulsant poison causes severe convulsions poisoned death results respiratory variety animals toxicity methyl fluoroacetate determined orally subcutaneous injection dosage ranges mgkg dogs mgkg monkeys indicating considerable variation order decreasing susceptibility determined within animals dog guineapig cat rabbit goat likely horse rat mouse monkey rat mouse toxicity inhalation investigated fully animals rat mouse mgcum mgcum minutes respectively dogs guineapigs cats rabbits goats horses rats mice monkeys pharmacological effects substance investigated mouth injection methyl fluoroacetate causes progressive depression respiration convulsant poison animals applied skin toxic yet inhalation injection mouth rat cat rhesus monkey effects methyl fluoroacetate determined similar nicotine strychnine leptazol picrotoxin electrically induced convulsions convulsive pattern considered similar leptazol little besides signs asphyxia found postmortem animals estimations made blood sugar hemoglobin plasma proteins nonprotein nitrogen serum potassium calcium chloride inorganic phosphate small number rabbits dogs goats blood changes include rise hemoglobin rise blood sugar rise inorganic phosphate less significant rise serum potassium terminal rise nonprotein nitrogen potassium whole central nervous system affected methyl fluoroacetate like leptazol higher centers sensitive lower ones small doses methyl fluoroacetate little effect blood pressure yet large doses action similar nicotine stimulates rate volume respiration causes failure respiration probably central origin seen graphic records knee jerk reaction appears accentuated methyl fluoroacetate convulsions occur due irradiation stimuli facilitated nervous conduction increased threshold stimulus lessened reflex arc spinal cat methyl fluoroacetate reduces electric convulsive threshold times rats difficulties treatments stressed methyl fluoroacetate powerful convulsant respiratory depressant yet suggestions treatment man made methyl fluoroacetate presents serious hazard food water contaminant case used poison rodents vermin easily detected destroyed equally toxic mouth methyl fluoroacetate produced used chemical reagent released environment several waste streams used rodenticide released directly environment would broken air released air estimated vapor pressure mmhg indicates methyl fluoroacetate exist solely vapor vaporphase methyl fluoroacetate degraded atmosphere reaction photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals halflife reaction air estimated days mfa contain chromophores absorb wavelengths nm therefore expected susceptible direct photolysis effects animals occur rapidly strongly resulting death exposure high concentration mfa vapor show symptoms animals violent reactions death took place hours according studies intravenous injection mice rats guinea pigs show symptoms min hours animals become quiet limp rabbits show similar latent time period muscle dogs show symptoms hyperactivity sensitive higher rates metabolism eventually also fail respirate fish resistant slow therefore expected substance build fish also australian herbivores eg possum seedeating birds live habitat consisting plants traces fluoroacetate tolerance happen detoxifying fluoroacetate resistivity aconitase fluorocitrate presence gsh insects store toxin vacuoles use highly hazardous mfa used poisoning animals without risking human life known antidote mfa suggestions regarding treatment mfa poisoning advised use intravenous injection fastacting anesthetics directly poisoning anesthetic pentothal sodium evipan sodium followed intramuscular injection longacting cortical depressants like sodium phenobarbitone rectal avertin afterward careful supervision oxygen supply necessary together blb mask use artificial respiration possibly use hypertonic glucose intravenously required status epilepticus last careful use tubocurarine chloride applied control vomiting occurs lean patient forward maintain open airway alternatively therapy aimed prevention fluorocitrate synthesis blocking aconitase within mitochondria provide citrate outflow mitochondria keep tca cycle going ethanol proven effective fc formation ethanol oxidized increases blood acetate levels inhibits fc production humans oral dose ml ethanol advised followed gkg ethanol intravenously first hour gkg following hours therapy meant fluoroacetate fa poisoning highly related mfa therapy aimed mfa may result treatment monoacetin glycerol monoacetate helped fa poisoning aids increasing
