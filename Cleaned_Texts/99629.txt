elements elaborated intestinal mucosa central component intestinal epithelial layer provides physical separation lumen body secretion various molecules lumen reinforces barrier function extraepithelial side variety immune cells provide additional protection epithelial mucus forms layer layers case colon separates bulk luminal contents intestinal epithelium mucus consists highly glycosylated hydrated gel formed mucin molecules secreted goblet cells mucus prevents large particles contacting epithelial cell layer allowing small molecules pass mucus also facilitates passage
