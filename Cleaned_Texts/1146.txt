scaphoid fracture break scaphoid bone symptoms generally includes pain base thumb worse use anatomic snuffbox generally tender swelling may complications may include nonunion fracture avascular necrosis proximal part bone scaphoid fractures commonly caused fall outstretched diagnosis generally based combination clinical examination medical fractures may visible plain cases affected area may immobilised splint cast reviewed repeat xrays two weeks alternatively mri bone scan may fracture may preventable using wrist guards certain fracture remains well aligned cast generally fracture displaced surgery generally healing may take six commonly fractured carpal males affected often people scaphoid fractures generally snuffbox tenderness focal tenderness usually present one three places volar prominence distal wrist distal pole fractures anatomic snuff box waist midbody fractures distal listers tubercle proximal pole avascular necrosis avn one complication scaphoid fracture since scaphoid receives arterial supply retrograde fashion ie distal proximal pole part proximal fracture usually risk avn depends location fracture non union also occur undiagnosed undertreated scaphoid fractures arterial flow scaphoid enters via distal pole travels proximal pole blood supply tenuous increasing risk nonunion particularly fractures wrist proximal treated correctly nonunion scaphoid fracture lead wrist osteoarthritiscitation needed symptoms may include aching wrist decreased range motion wrist pain activities lifting gripping xray results show arthritis due old break

fractures fractures proximal pole waist middle remainder occur distal scaphoid fractures often diagnosed using plain radiographs multiple views obtained however fractures apparent cases clinical examination suggests fracture xray show even though indeed therefore people tenderness scaphoid exhibit pain pressure anatomic snuff box often splinted thumb spica days point second set xrays minimally displaced fracture present initially healing apparent even fracture may apparent ct scan used evaluate scaphoid greater resolution use mri available preferred ct give one immediate bone

scaphoid receives blood supply primarily lateral distal branches radial artery blood flows topdistal end bone retrograde fashion proximal pole blood flow disrupted fracture bone may heal surgery necessary point mechanically mend bone togethercitation needed percutaneous screw fixation recommended open surgical approach possible achieve acceptable bone alignment closed minimal incisions preserves palmar ligament complex local vasculature help avoid soft tissue complications surgery includes screwing scaphoid bone back together perpendicular angle possible promote quicker stronger healing bone internal fixation done dorsally percutaneous incision arthroscopic assistance via minimal open dorsal via volar approach case slight excavation edge trapezium bone may necessary reach
