including asserting class possessed unusual valuable herbicidal activity patent office rejected application unpatentable prior art monsanto applied time claiming representing unusual valuable herbicidal activity activity surprising related compounds possess little herbicidal efficiency patent office initially rejected application ground product obvious prior art time monsanto overcame major issue patent office whether patent application denied obvious previously known products significant chemical similar properties similar physical structure useful making pigments herbicidal
