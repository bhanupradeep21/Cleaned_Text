diet known human ancestors varies dramatically time strictly speaking according evolutionary anthropologists archaeologists single hominin paleolithic diet paleolithic covers roughly million years concurrent pleistocene includes multiple human ancestors evolutionary technological adaptations living wide variety environments fact difficulty finding conclusive evidence often makes broad
