placebo analgesia occurs administration placebos leads pain relief placebos definition lack active ingredients effect placebo analgesia considered result patients belief receiving analgesic drug medical intervention shown cases endogenous opioid system critical mediating placebo analgesia evidenced ability analgesia reduced opioid antagonist however also possible placebo analgesia mediated nonopioid mechanisms case would affected research indicated human spinal prefrontal rostral anterior cingulate also play role placebo analgesia classical conditioning identified means induce placebo analgesia drugs recent research demonstrates neutral experienced unconditioned stimulus generate conditioned response ie inducing analgesic effects short conditioning period study experimental group given cyclosporine drink drink acts neutral stimulus cyclosporine unconditioned stimulus two ingested concurrently association learnt generating conditioned stimulus drink results conditioned response painrelief particular study analgesia observed evocation stage participants exposed drink placebo displayed decreased lymphocyte activity classical conditioning identified means induce analgesia without drugs common tobe conditioned stimuli studies investigating analgesia various coloured lights eg blue orange common unconditioned stimulus electric shocks conditioning phases experiments one light displayed time shock administered shock comes electrodes secured hands intensity alternates two extremes generally high nonpainful participants identify difference therefore bridge association lights shocks given eg blue painful orange painful shocks act unconditioned stimuli producing unconditioned responses ie pain neutral stimuli different coloured lights experimental phase participants exposed lights time shocks uncoordinated orange longer signifies painful shock instead weaker nonpainful shock blue signifies pain analgesic effect occurs participants witnessing lights randomised sequence state shock administered blue light less painful one orange happens association bridged lights shock intensity gives participants idea shocks feel like certain light shown owing high intensity shocks intend cause pain generate intense pain pain level associated specific light low applicability pharmacotherapy extensive one hand theory classical conditioning suggests medication dosage could reduced associating another substance like nice tasting drink therefore allowing people slowly reduce stop taking medication whilst maintaining symptomrelieving effects theoretically work however practice may feasible effects conditioning last short period time approximately would mean constant classical conditioning using medication would need conducted likely reservations ethical viewpoint durability affected person previous experience therapy given person undergone therapy whether negative positive experience staggered reduction stimuli affectivity induce analgesic effect create effect larger prior trial smaller clinical application would inutile therapy lose efficacy extended period time hand research role expectancy alongside conditioning play inducing analgesic effect prompted ideas better practice pharmacotherapy expectancy analgesic effect comes conditioning prior analgesic associated physiological pain relief knowledge inform specialists explain medicative therapy patients specialists could exercise emphasis symptomrelieving effect tablets opposed side effects would create expectation patient mind feel upon taking medication well provide confidence going beneficial could especially useful treating chronic pain classical conditioning inform pharmacotherapy encouraging clinicians help patients create associations analgesic medication pain relieving developing techniques even medication dosage reduced act singleblind placebo patients would still able experience pain relief supports idea using behavioural conditioning relieve patients pain need continue medication time despite durability constraints social learning theory part behaviourism considered way analgesic effects demonstrator sits participants responds different coloured shocks administered different lights appear like participants observing report answers reported demonstrator separately whilst associations constructed around shock intensity social observation true based statistical tests perception experience differ demonstrator alongside classical conditioning social observational learning verbal suggestions tested ways engender analgesic effects three classical conditioning social observational learning effective regarding strength analgesic effects additional contributor analgesic effect measured using interpersonal reactivity index containing subscales empathetic concern aspect positively correlated social observational learning suggestive idea prosocial behaviour may linked placebo effects empathy scores tend higher social learning gains greater obtaining empathy whilst learning respond pain stimuli stark contrast firsthand experience pain empathy affected metaanalytical research demonstrates shared regions experience pain empathy dynamics relatability investigated show functions active instead negatively correlated placebo analgesia experienced ability empathise oneself others decreases greatly implications
