prize chemistry paul drawing research alfred c redfield g evelyn hutchinson lovelock first formulated gaia hypothesis resulting work nasa concerned detecting life work royal dutch hypothesis proposes living nonliving parts earth form complex interacting system thought single named greek goddess gaia suggestion novelist william hypothesis postulates biosphere regulatory effect earths environment acts sustain life hypothesis readily accepted many environmentalist community widely accepted within scientific community whole among prominent critics evolutionary biologists richard dawkins ford doolittle stephen jay gould convergence opinion among trio whose views scientific matters often diverged critics questioned natural selection operating individual organisms lead evolution planetaryscale needed response lovelock together andrew watson published computer model daisyworld postulated hypothetical planet orbiting star whose radiant energy slowly increasing decreasing nonbiological case temperature planet simply tracks energy received star however biological case ecological competition daisy species different albedo values produces homeostatic effect global temperature energy received star low black daisies proliferate since absorb greater fraction heat energy input high white daisies predominate since reflect excess heat white black daisies contrary effects planets overall albedo temperature changes relative populations stabilise planets climate keep temperature within optimal range despite fluctuations energy star lovelock argued daisyworld although parable illustrates conventional natural selection operating individual organisms still produce planetaryscale lovelocks book revenge gaia argued lack respect humans gaia damage done rainforests reduction planetary biodiversity testing gaias capacity minimise effects addition greenhouse gases atmosphere eliminates planets negative feedbacks increases likelihood homeostatic positive feedback potential associated runaway global warming similarly warming oceans extending oceanic thermocline layer tropical oceans arctic antarctic waters preventing rise oceanic nutrients surface waters eliminating algal blooms phytoplankton oceanic food chains depend phytoplankton forests main ways gaia draws greenhouse gases particularly carbon dioxide taking atmosphere elimination environmental buffering see according lovelock earth becoming uninhabitable humans lifeforms middle century massive extension tropical deserts lovelock distanced conclusions saying gone far describing consequences climate change next century book vanishing face gaia rejected scientific models disagree findings sea levels rising arctic ice melting faster models predict suggested may already passed tipping point terrestrial climate resilience permanently hot state given conditions lovelock expected human civilisation would hardpressed survive expected change similar thermal maximum temperature arctic ocean lovelock became concerned threat global warming greenhouse effect broke many fellow environmentalists stating nuclear power halt global view nuclear energy realistic alternative fossil fuels fulfil large scale energy needs humankind also reducing greenhouse open member environmentalists nuclear backdrop renewed uk government interest nuclear power lovelock publicly announced support nuclear energy stating green entreat friends movement drop wrongheaded objection nuclear although interventions public debate nuclear power century views longstanding book ages gaia stated never regarded nuclear radiation nuclear power anything normal inevitable part environment prokaryotic forebears evolved planetsized lump fallout starsized nuclear explosion supernova synthesised elements go make planet revenge gaia put forward concept sustainable retreat lovelock wrote television interviewer asked nuclear waste poison whole biosphere persist millions years knew nightmare fantasy wholly without substance real world one striking things places heavily contaminated radioactive nuclides richness wildlife true land around chernobyl bomb test sites pacific areas near united states savannah river nuclear weapons plant second world war wild plants animals perceive radiation dangerous slight reduction may cause lifespans far less hazard presence people pets find sad human vast bureaucracies concerned nuclear waste huge organisations devoted decommissioning power stations nothing comparable deal truly malign waste carbon lovelock said thought difficulties getting nuclear power going due propaganda coal oil business fight like mad tell bad stories nuclear greens played along theres bound corruption im sure various green movements paid sums side help writing british newspaper independent lovelock argued result global warming billions us die breeding pairs people survive arctic climate remains tolerable end year suggested keep mind awesome pace change realise little time left act community nation must find best use resources sustain civilisation long predicted temperature increase would leave much worlds land uninhabitable unsuitable farming northerly migrations new cities created arctic furthermore much europe turned desert britain become europes liferaft due stable temperature caused surrounded quoted guardian humans perish climate change last interview guardian newspaper said democracy might put hold prevent climate continued even best democracies agree major war approaches democracy must put hold time feeling climate change may issue severe war may necessary put democracy hold statements portrayed lovelock continuing concern global warming time criticising extremism suggesting alternatives oil coal green solutions interview aired msnbc lovelock stated alarmist using words right made mistake timing climate change noted documentary inconvenient truth book weather makers examples kind alarmism lovelock still believed climate warming although rate change thought admitted extrapolating far believed climate change still happening felt claims science settled global warming one thing scientist taught never certain anything never know truth approach hope get bit nearer time iterate towards truth dont know criticised environmentalists treating global warming like happens green religion taking christian religion dont think people noticed got sort terms religions use greens use guilt shows religious greens cant win people round saying guilty putting carbon dioxide msnbc article lovelock quoted problem dont know climate thought knew years ago led alarmist books mine included looked clearcut hasnt happened climate usual tricks theres nothing much really happening yet supposed halfway toward frying world world warmed much since millennium twelve years reasonable time temperature stayed almost constant whereas rising carbon dioxide rising question followup interview also lovelock stated support natural gas favoured fracking lowpolluting alternative opposed concept sustainable development modern economies might powered wind turbines calling meaningless kept poster wind turbine remind much detested novacene lovelock proposed benevolent superintelligence may take save ecosystem stated machines would need keep organic life around keep planets temperature habitable electronic hand instead life becomes entirely electronic played part newer younger actors already appearing needed lovelock chris rapley proposed construction ocean pumps pump water thermocline fertilize algae surface waters encourage basic idea accelerate transfer carbon dioxide atmosphere ocean increasing primary production enhancing export organic carbon marine snow deep ocean scheme similar proposed lovelock rapley later developed independently commercial proposal attracted widespread media commenting proposal corinne le quéré university east anglia researcher said doesnt make sense absolutely evidence climate engineering options work even go right direction im astonished published geoengineering put work massive amount research needed research take researchers claimed scheme would bring water high natural levels associated nutrients back surface potentially causing exhalation lovelock subsequently said proposal intended stimulate interest research would next several research studies published wake original however estimated scheme would require huge number main effect pipes may land rather sustainable retreat concept developed lovelock define necessary changes human settlement dwelling global scale adapt global warming prevent expected negative consequences needed lovelock thought time past sustainable development come time development longer sustainable therefore needed retreat lovelock stated following explain retreat view means time start talking changing live get food making plans migration millions people lowlying regions like bangladesh europe admitting new orleans goner moving people cities better positioned future says everybody absolutely utmost sustain civilization doesnt degenerate dark ages warlords running things real danger could lose everything way concept sustainable retreat emphasises pattern resource use aims meet human needs lower levels less environmentally harmful types lovelock elected fellow royal society nomination reads lovelock made
