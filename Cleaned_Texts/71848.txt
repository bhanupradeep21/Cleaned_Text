functions thus passing traits organisms reversal lamarcks previous view published memoirs physics natural history briefly refers immutability lamarck stressed two main themes biological work neither soft inheritance first environment gives rise changes animals cited examples blindness moles presence teeth mammals absence teeth birds evidence principle second principle life structured orderly manner many different parts bodies make possible organic movements although first thinker advocate organic evolution first develop truly coherent evolutionary outlined theories regarding evolution first floreal lecture three later published works lamarck employed several mechanisms drivers evolution drawn common knowledge day belief chemistry lavoisier used mechanisms explain two forces saw constituting evolution force driving animals simple complex forms force adapting animals local environments differentiating believed forces must explained necessary consequence basic physical principles favoring materialistic attitude toward biology lamarck referred tendency organisms become complex moving ladder progress referred phenomenon le pouvoir de la vie la force qui tend sans

chemistry promoted lavoisier whose ideas regarded disdain preferring embrace traditional alchemical view elements influenced primarily earth air fire water asserted living organisms form movements fluids living organisms naturally drove evolve toward ever greater levels rapid motion fluids etch canals delicate tissues soon flow begin vary leading emergence distinct organs fluids elaborate become complex engendering greater variety secretions substances composing organs argued organisms thus moved simple complex steady predictable way based fundamental physical principles alchemy view simple organisms never disappeared constantly created spontaneous generation described steadystate biology lamarck saw spontaneous generation ongoing simple organisms thus created transmuted time becoming complex sometimes regarded believing teleological goaloriented process organisms became perfect evolved though materialist emphasized forces must originate necessarily underlying physical principles according paleontologist henry fairfield osborn lamarck denied absolutely existence perfecting tendency nature regarded evolution final necessary effect surrounding conditions charles coulston gillispie historian science written life purely physical phenomenon lamarck argued lamarcks views confused vitalist school second component lamarcks theory evolution adaptation organisms environment could move organisms upward ladder progress new distinct forms local adaptations could also drive organisms evolutionary blind alleys organism became finely adapted change could occur
