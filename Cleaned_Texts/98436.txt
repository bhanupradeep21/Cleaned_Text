visual extinction neurological disorder occurs following damage parietal lobe brain similar distinct hemispatial neglect visual extinction characteristic symptom difficulty perceive contralesional stimuli presented simultaneously ipsilesional stimulus ability correctly identify presented simultaneously simultaneous presentation contralesional stimulus apparently ignored patient extinguished deficiency may lead difficulty behalf patient processing stimulis visual extinction result unilateral cerebral always poorly understood researchers studying visual extinction great depth since since commonly associated damage right hemisphere brain studies suggested visual extinction may result sensory imbalance imbalance due weak delayed afferent inputs hemisphere affected research done pavlovskaya sagi soroker ring show visual extinction dependent simple stimuli properties properties thought reflect connectivity constraints early steps visual visual extinction arises damage parietal lobe brain damage frequently arises following stroke infarction area however traumatic event sufficient cause widespread tissue damage area may cause sufficient harm although sides brain vulnerable damage unusual extinction occur left hemisphere damaged presented simultaneous stimuli patient ignore contralesional stimuli report ipsilesional ability report stimuli correctly presented singly indicates problem vision per se bias contralesional stimuli evident even patients presented two signals within ipsilesional visual field whose processing remains intact following damage since done opposite brain hemisphere implies extinction somewhat controlled biasing point visual fixation contralesionally relevant stimuli contained within functioning side visual field findings supported fatigue habituation effects previously connected visual extinction experiments done vuilleumier rafal eliminate connection effects visual historically believed parietal damage weakened afferent neuron input visual cortex extinction event caused signals originating contralesional field lost transmission however account ability extinction patients able correctly identify contralesional stimuli isolation current theory called race theory race theory holds stimuli competing processing power within brain following parietal damage contralesional messages lowered priority brains processing way potentially signal transmission delay presented alternative stimuli contralesional stimulus doesnt arrive decision center simultaneously ipsilesional stimulus thus denied conscious processing race theory sees support findings marzi et patients show extinction also display aggravated delays reaction time stimuli compared patients forms rightbrain damage undamaged patients study patients shown able focus attention improve reaction time still subnormal performance theory given support gorea sagis inducing extinctionlike events undamaged patients presented simultaneous stimuli different intensities lower intensity stimulus extinguished mere presence high intensity extinction frequency may also affected reporting method due visual processing interacts rest reported extinctions drop patient told relay extinction news method speaking particularly use eyes feedback loop looking side single stimuli two may work eliminating need hemispheric transfer information routing response motor cortex instead visual cortex shortening path response time conclusion supported increased detection isolated contralesional stimuli circumstances although extinction compared hemispatial neglect two different disorders possible exhibit one without neural basis appears different hemispatial neglect arising tempoparietal junction damage although patients may exhibit disorders simultaneously occurs less half affected diagnosis achieved several related methods one approach involves patients sit front computer screen either stars triangles projected simultaneously different areas screen patients asked identify locations identities another similar approach project colored letters screen asking patients identify letter color different parts information diagnosis visual extinction attained positive diagnosis results patients inability correctly identify shapes letters projected simultaneously different areas screen however common test visual extinction finger confrontation model test doctor asks patient note hands moving fingers used immediately following stroke doctors quick diagnosis without sort treatment visual extinction usually worsens severity symptoms remains completely stagnant simple exercises reading copying tasks useful treating symptoms increasing brain activity though damaged area never completely healed since dead brain cells regenerate individual keep exercises designed maintain improve function order create best chance improvement andor maintenance current treatment methods patients visual extinction generally involve use training individuals vision doctor may instruct patient scan rows lights different ways attempt regenerate function light boards exist used specifically aid task methods exist designed force patient focus multiple stimuli cueing scanning methods yield results consistent across patients successful cases generally forty hours retraining patients vision necessary well additional work done home similar computer scanning methods treatment shown effective specialized equipment designed specifically scanning cueing exercises force patients focus multiple stimuli results methods consistent laboratory settings rehabilitation successful individuals recovered function maintained function recovered losing five another singlestimulus rehabilitatory approach patient shown computer screen box corner fixation cross center stimulus appears boxes patient instructed indicate seeing quickly possible task eased somewhat indicating icon stimulus either arrow points box stimulus likely guaranteed cross indicate stimulus could appear box following thirty hourlong sessions patients demonstrated significant decrease extinction hemispatial patients whose brain damage right hemisphere left limb activation lla another treatment proved theory behind method treatment use damaged side brain enhance functions related damaged hemisphere use opposite healthy side cause impairment lla therefore merely concentrated use left side body patients whose damage right hemisphere since right hemisphere controls left side body forces patient exercise spatial awareness using damaged side brain increasing activity around lesion generally treatment used visual neglect different related neurological disorder lla still increases brain activity around damaged area patients visual extinction generates improvement patients reason treatment work cases visual extinction damage either side brain opposed visual neglect damage always condition inhibit patients social interaction fact people would able distinguish visual extinction patient nonvisual extinction patient passing patients selective spatial interactions typically within range six degrees angle vision two visual stimuli presented patient processed single object due corresponding neuronal functions linked longrange lateral interactions visual extinction often mistaken attentional deficit researchers believe visual extinction may connected restriction attention attention allows person identify react pertinent objects space ignoring irrelevant objects patients visual extinction especially unilateral damage right parietal lobe may unable attend orient objects collateral space therefore presenting neglect visual delay reaction time observed many patients unknown whether primary result stroke resulting visual extinction detrimental social aspects may repercussions stroke caused visual extinction visual extinction condition alone visual extinction involved several studies regarding preprocessing images brain study performed dr vuilleumier examined effect using faces stimulus studying extinction event subjects presented two simultaneous stimuli combination schematic face shape word scrambled face faces contralesional field less likely extinguished stimuli faces ipsilesional field appeared induce extinction events appearance face prioritized attention despite handicap presented extinction visual extinction also used demonstrate brain bias towards gestalt processing presented figure containing illusory contours patients able correctly report presence stimuli contralesional ipsilesional hemispheres due unconscious processing whole field produce experiment implied attention center prioritizes visualization surfaces stimuli therefore although race model ipsilesional stimuli extinguish contralesional creation gestalt takes priority detection study using gabor signals alternating blurred noisy black white bars commonly used opticians diagnostic tests investigated orientation signals affected extinction bilateral stimuli least extinguished stimuli oriented horizontally although stimuli oriented vertically also showed reduction extinguishing rate compared one stimulus vertical one horizontal could assumed brain represent two different surfaces combining brain bias towards facial processing surface discovery followup study dr vuilleumier exposed subjects paired visual stimuli three phases initial phase stimuli simply bilateral pairs extinction frequency measured next stage stimuli surrounded oval appeared represent eyes face extinction rate appearance greatly reduced finally patients shown stimuli minus contextual oval however reduced extinction rate persisted though patients learned group stimuli effect occur stimuli surrounded nonoval shape pointing towards facial processing key visual feedback also studied relation visual extinction patients asked touch known target darkened room light attached patients hand sometimes briefly illuminated provide information hand relation
