expedition led elmer riggs field museum natural history also discovered petrified forests numerous specimens riggs collected identified araucaria later described american paleontologist paleobotanist george reber wieland proaraucaria elongata proaraucaria mirabilis proaraucaria patagonica wieland gothan interpreted absence separate petrified seeds evidence cones shed scales final growth year originally stated wieland justification classification new genus amended description published scottish paleobotanist mary gordon calder calder questioned conclusions wieland gothan also discarded earlier classification spegazzini araucarites latter form genus usually used incomplete plant fossil specimens resemble araucaria lack enough preserved details accurate classifications citing striking
