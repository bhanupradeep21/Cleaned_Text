cervical half ring head cervical armor may separated body specimen ziapelta sanjuanensis showed three unique derived traits autapomorphies caputegulum middle bone plate snout large prominent roughly triangular shape ziapelta deep anteriorly curved squamosal horns measuring centimetres base tip rear base skull featured three deep grooves possible distinguishing trait mixture concave flat convex caputegulae skull kirtland formation second ankylosaur known limited remains nodocephalosaurus ziapelta differs nodocephalosaurus several traits edge squamosal horns sharper points horns curved front instead osteoderm peaks eye sockets sharper caputegulae irregular form best lightly convex instead coneshaped rectangular outline instead rounded one separated deeper skull constriction front eye sockets widest point formed squamosal horns top rear corners skull rather flat small degree caused compression fossil antorbital portion skull lightly convex premaxillae broad square covered rather flat cranial ornamentation nasal vestibules oriented towards front shaped like flat ovals central caputegulae snout exceptionally large covering half snout width whereas species possessing structure also triangular instead hexagonal usual shape behind central plate rows smaller caputegulae run backwards diameter three centimetres rectangular pentagonal hexagonal maxillae upper jaws centimetres long contained eighteen small teeth outside maxilla covered large loreal osteoderm overlapping snout edge large lacrimal plate present behind rim eye socket two osteoderms forming separate peak asian

sit inside skin apart osteoderms part skull two cervical halfrings present protect upper side neck rows oval scutes probably ran along back sides torso latter known detached specimens osteoderms found surface densely pitted lacks cervical halfrings ankylosaurids typically consisted six fused segments paired per side one top second segment upper side third one lower side segments fused underlying continuous bone ring ziapelta segments consisted osteoderms inbetween oval rectangular shape osteoderms keeled featuring high cutting edge osteoderms millimetres long millimetres wide keels varied centimetres centimetres tall middle segments touched midline irregular punctuated row small trapeziumshaped interstitial osteoderms present within suture front suture first cervical halfring small coneshaped interstitial osteoderm protruded interstitial elements absent side specimen nmmnh first cervical halfring shared several traits counterpart holotype high narrow keels interstitial osteoderms middle lower side osteoderm wrap around lower edge therefore referred z several unconnected osteoderms discovered one might originally part halfring second one seen originating pectoral upper breast region third measuring millimetres narrow keel shark fin shape typical ankylosaurian side spikes thus identified lateral rump osteoderm small ossicles discovered also round scutes two

evolutionary trees rendered cladistic analysis part describing paper thus part clade also containing american ankylosaurids however closely related nodocephalosaurus lived time area latter recovered relative eastasian ankylosaurids however authors indicated alternative tree ziapelta nodocephalosaurus forced sister species one evolutionary step longer ie requiring presence single additional shared trait thus slightly less following cladogram based phylogenetic analysis ankylosaurinae conducted arbour crichtonpelta tsagantegia zhejiangosaurus pinacosaurus saichania tarchia zaraapelta
