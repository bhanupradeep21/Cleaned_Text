vitro muscle testing method used characterize properties living muscle tissue removing organism allows extensive precise quantification properties vivo testing vitro muscle testing provided bulk scientific knowledge muscle structure physiology relate organismal performance stem cell research relies vitro muscle testing establish sole muscle cell function individual behavior apart muscle cells

soleus edl mammals plantaris iliotibialis amphibians muscles examined vitro include diaphragm papillary muscle successful isolation skeletal muscles specific conditions required tissue isolated frequently changed chilled ringers solution krebshenseleit solution ensure metabolic conditions slowed hence need chilled dissecting medium prevent tissue dying due lack substrates within medium hence requirement solutions changed frequently dissecting solution continually oxygenated appropriate concentration oxygen carbon dioxide tissue prepared typically nonmammalian tissues prepared gaseous solution bubbled oxygen carbon dioxide whilst mammalian tissues solution bubbled oxygen carbon dioxide microscope appropriate magnification level required due dexterity required isolation muscles external fibre optic light source also beneficial provide sufficient light without emission heat correct approach preparation muscles testing long muscle damaged preparation muscletendon unit intact something used anchor muscle within testing rig pieces bone left proximal andor distal end skeletal muscles allow anchoring addition silk sutures aluminium tfoil clips used wrap around tendon muscle provide support tendon used anchoring mechanics rig vitro muscle testing typically requires dualmode servomotor control detect changes force length dualmode system unavailable independent force transducer motor arm used one end sample tissue anchored place via needle sutured crocodile clip prepared aluminium tfoil clips end attached servomotor entire muscle bathed ringers solution krebshenseleit solution oxygen bubbling order keep tissue alive metabolically active solution heated usually via external heatercooler water bath appropriate test temperature muscle tested muscles stimulated contract applying electric current either nerve innervates muscle via platinum electrodes placed circulating solution evoke response entire muscle servomotor detects changes force andor
