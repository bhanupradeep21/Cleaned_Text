autotomy greek auto self tome severing αὐτοτομία selfamputation behaviour whereby animal sheds discards one usually selfdefense mechanism elude predators grasp distract predator thereby allow escape animals ability regenerate lost body part later autotomy multiple evolutionary origins thought evolved least nine times independently term coined leon caught tail shed part attempting escape many species detached tail continue creating deceptive sense continued struggle distracting predators attention fleeing prey animal addition many species lizards plestiodon fasciatus cordylosaurus subtessellatus holaspis guentheri phelsuma barbouri ameiva wetmorei elaborately colored blue tails shown divert predatory attacks toward tail away body depending upon species animal may able partially regenerate tail typically period weeks months though functional new tail section often shorter contain cartilage rather regenerated vertebrae color texture skin regenerated organ generally differs distinctly original appearance however salamanders regenerate morphologically complete identical reptiles crested gecko regenerate tail autotomy technical term ability drop tail caudal autotomy lizards sacrifice tail manner breakage occurs tail grasped sufficient force animals species geckos perform true autotomy throwing tail sufficiently stressed attacked caudal autotomy lizards takes two forms first form called intervertebral autotomy tail breaks vertebrae second form caudal autotomy intravertebral autotomy zones weakness fracture planes across vertebra midpart tail second type autotomy lizard contracts muscle fracture vertebra rather break tail two sphincter muscles tail contract around caudal artery minimize another adaptation associated intravertebral autotomy skin flaps fold wound site autotomy readily seal wound minimize infection autotomy caudal autotomy prevalent among lizards recorded approximately caudal autotomy present antipredator tactic also present species high rates intraspecific competition aggression agama agama lizard fights using tail whip conspecifics autotomize tail met social cost tail loss decreases social standing mating ability example uta stansburiana suffers reduced social status following caudal autotomy iberolacerta monticola experiences reduced mating success among coleonyx brevis smaller eggs eggs produced tail however regenerated tail agama agama takes new clublike shape providing male better fighting weapon autotomy regeneration work together increase lizards ability survive also examples salamanders attack tails conspecifics order establish social dominance decrease fitness despite mechanism effectiveness also costly employed defenses one cost immune system tail loss results weakened immune system allows mites harmful organisms larger negative impact individuals reduce health since tail plays significant role locomotion energy storage fat valuable dropped haphazardly many species evolved specific behaviors autotomy decreased activity order compensate negative consequences depleted energy lizards tail major storage organ accumulating reserves return dropped tail threat passed eat recover part sacrificed conversely species observed attack rivals grab tails eat opponents also adaptations help mitigate cost autotomy seen highly toxic salamander bolitoglossa rostrata individual delay autotomy predator moves jaws tail holds long time allowing salamander retain tail toxicity alone ward regeneration one highest priorities autotomy order optimize locomotor performance recoup reproductive fitness
