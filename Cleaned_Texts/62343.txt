genetic rescue seen mitigation strategy designed restore genetic diversity reduce extinction risks small isolated frequently inbred largely implemented translocation type demographic rescue technical migration adds individuals population prevent potential extinction demographic rescue may similar genetic rescue increase population size andor fitness overlap meaning led researchers consider

factors moving genes one population another increase overall genetic diversity minimize conservation technique intended increase fitness small imperiled introduction beneficial alleles often used populations species high risk extinction successful genetic rescue occurs addition new genes effectively introduces genetic diversity leads increased population size growth rate well greater population unsuccessful genetic rescue may occur addition new genes causes outbreeding depression decreases population much gene flow may lead genetic swamping extensive genetic rescue occur multiple
