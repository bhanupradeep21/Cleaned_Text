placenta pl placentas placentae also known birth temporary embryonic later fetal organ begins developing blastocyst shortly implantation plays critical roles facilitating nutrient gas waste exchange physically separate maternal fetal circulations important endocrine organ producing hormones regulate maternal fetal physiology placenta connects fetus via umbilical cord opposite aspect maternal uterus speciesdependent manner humans thin layer maternal decidual endometrial tissue comes away placenta expelled uterus following birth sometimes incorrectly referred maternal part placenta placentas defining characteristic placental mammals also found marsupials nonmammals varying levels mammalian placentas probably first evolved million million years ago protein syncytin found outer barrier placenta syncytiotrophoblast mother fetus certain rna signature genome led hypothesis originated ancient retrovirus essentially virus helped pave transition egglaying word placenta comes latin word type cake greek πλακόενταπλακοῦντα plakóentaplakoúnta accusative πλακόειςπλακούς plakóeisplakoús flat reference round flat appearance humans classical plural placentae form placentas common modern english placenta evolved independently multiple times probably starting fish originated multiple times including genus placentation also evolved mammalian placenta evolved million years ago critical factor explosive diversification placental although mammalian placentas functions important differences structure function different groups mammals example human bovine equine canine placentas different gross microscopic levels placentas species also differ ability provide maternal immunoglobulins placental mammals including humans chorioallantoic placenta forms chorion allantois humans placenta averages cm inch length cm inch thickness center thickest edges thinnest typically weighs approximately grams lb dark reddishblue crimson color connects fetus umbilical cord approximately cm inch length contains two umbilical arteries one umbilical umbilical cord inserts chorionic plate eccentric attachment vessels branch surface placenta divide form network covered thin layer cells results formation villous tree structures maternal side villous tree structures grouped lobules called cotyledons humans placenta usually disc shape size varies vastly different mammalian placenta occasionally takes form comprises several distinct parts connected blood parts called lobes may number two three four placentas described bilobedbilobularbipartite trilobedtrilobulartripartite clearly discernible main lobe auxiliary lobe latter called succenturiate placenta sometimes blood vessels connecting lobes get way fetal presentation labor called vasa previacitation needed protein coding genes expressed human cells genes expressed normal mature genes specifically expressed placenta fewer genes highly placenta specific corresponding specific proteins mainly expressed trophoblasts functions related pregnancy examples proteins elevated expression placenta compared organs tissues cancer testis antigen expressed cytotrophoblasts expressed syncytiotrophoblasts expressed extravillous trophoblasts placenta begins develop upon implantation blastocyst maternal endometrium early pregnancy week outer layer late blastocyst formed trophoblasts cells form outer layer placenta outer layer divided two layers underlying cytotrophoblast layer overlying syncytiotrophoblast layer syncytiotrophoblast multinucleated continuous cell layer covers surface placenta forms result differentiation fusion underlying cytotrophoblasts process continues throughout placental development syncytiotrophoblast contributes barrier function placenta grows throughout pregnancy development maternal blood supply placenta complete end first trimester pregnancy week preparation implantation blastocyst endometrium undergoes decidualization spiral arteries decidua remodeled become less convoluted diameter increased increased diameter straighter flow path act increase maternal blood flow placenta relatively high pressure maternal blood fills intervillous space spiral arteries bathe fetal villi blood allowing exchange gases take place humans hemochorial placentals maternal blood comes direct contact fetal chorion though fluid exchanged pressure decreases pulses deoxygenated blood flows back endometrial veinscitation needed maternal blood flow begins days approximately mlmin term deoxygenated fetal blood passes umbilical arteries placenta junction umbilical cord placenta umbilical arteries branch radially form chorionic arteries chorionic arteries turn branch cotyledon arteries villi vessels eventually branch form extensive arteriocapillaryvenous system bringing fetal blood extremely close maternal blood intermingling fetal maternal blood occurs placental endothelin prostanoids cause vasoconstriction placental arteries nitric oxide causes hand neural vascular regulation catecholamines little fetoplacental circulation vulnerable persistent hypoxia intermittent hypoxia reoxygenation lead generation excessive free radicals may contribute preeclampsia pregnancy proposed melatonin plays role antioxidant begins day placental expulsion begins physiological separation wall uterus period child born placenta expelled called third stage labor placenta usually expelled within minutes birthcitation needed placental expulsion managed actively example giving oxytocin via intramuscular injection followed cord traction assist delivering placenta alternatively managed expectantly allowing placenta expelled without medical assistance blood loss risk postpartum bleeding may reduced women offered active management third stage labour however may adverse effects research habit cut cord immediately birth theorised medical reason contrary theorised cutting cord helps baby adaptation extrauterine life especially preterm placenta traditionally thought sterile recent research suggests resident nonpathogenic diverse population microorganisms may present healthy tissue however whether microbes exist clinically important highly controversial subject active placenta intermediates transfer nutrients mother fetus perfusion intervillous spaces placenta maternal blood allows transfer nutrients oxygen mother fetus transfer waste products carbon dioxide back fetus maternal blood nutrient transfer fetus occur via active passive placental nutrient metabolism found play key role limiting transfer adverse pregnancy situations involving maternal diabetes obesity increase decrease levels nutrient transporters placenta potentially resulting overgrowth restricted growth waste products excreted fetus urea uric acid creatinine transferred maternal blood diffusion across placentacitation needed placenta functions selective barrier maternal fetal cells preventing maternal blood proteins microbes including bacteria viruses crossing maternalfetal deterioration placental functioning referred placental insufficiency may related mothertochild transmission infectious small number viruses including rubella virus zika virus cytomegalovirus cmv travel across placental barrier generally taking advantage conditions certain gestational periods placenta develops cmv zika travel maternal bloodstream via placental cells fetal beginning early weeks gestation increasing linearly largest transfer occurring third trimester igg antibodies pass human placenta providing protection fetus passive immunity lingers several months birth providing newborn carbon copy mothers longterm humoral immunity see infant crucial first months extrauterine life igm antibodies larger size cross one reason infections acquired pregnancy particularly hazardous placenta fetus may regarded foreign body inside mother must protected normal immune response mother would cause rejected placenta fetus thus treated sites immune privilege immune tolerance purpose placenta uses several mechanisms however placental barrier sole means evading immune system foreign fetal cells also persist maternal circulation side placental placenta also provides reservoir blood fetus delivering blood case hypotension vice versa comparable numerous pathologies affect placentacitation needed placenta often plays important role various cultures many
