opsonins extracellular proteins bound substances cells induce phagocytes phagocytose substances cells opsonins thus opsonins act tags label things body phagocytosed ie eaten phagocytes cells specialise phagocytosis ie cellular different types things targets tagged opsonins phagocytosis including pathogens bacteria cancer cells aged cells dead dying cells apoptotic cells excess synapses protein aggregates amyloid plaques opsonins help clear pathogens well dead dying diseased opsonins discovered named opsonins wright douglas found incubating bacteria blood plasma enabled phagocytes phagocytose thereby destroy bacteria concluded conclusive proof blood fluids modify bacteria manner renders ready prey phagocytes may speak opsonic effect opsono cater prepare victuals may employ term opsonins designate elements blood fluids produce effect subsequent research found two main types opsonin blood opsonised bacteria complement however known least proteins act opsonins pathogens opsonins induce phagocytosis targets binding targets eg bacteria also binding phagocytic receptors phagocytes thus opsonins act bridging molecules target phagocyte bringing contact usually activating phagocytic receptor induce engulfment target cell membranes negative charges zeta potential makes difficult two cells come close together opsonins bind targets boost kinetics phagocytosis favoring interaction opsonin cell surface receptors immune overrides negative charges cell membranes important opsonins tag healthy nonpathogenic cells phagocytosis phagocytosis results digestion thus destruction targets therefore opsonins including complement proteins evolved bind pathogenassociated molecular patterns molecules found surface pathogens enabling phagocytosis pathogens thus innate immunity antibodies bind antigens pathogen surface enabling adaptive immunity opsonins opsonise host body cells eg opsonises apoptotic cells bind eatme signals phosphatidylserine exposed dead dying stressed opsonins related two types immune systems adaptive immune system innate immune system antibodies synthesized b cells secreted response recognition specific antigenic epitopes bind specific

alternative pathway complement activation circulating deposited directly onto antigens particular pamps lipopolysaccharides gramnegative recognized phagocytes attaches apoptotic cells bodies facilitates clearance dead cells remnants without initiating inflammatory pathways interaction mannosebinding lectins ficolins along pentraxins collectins able recognize certain types carbohydrates expressed cell membranes bacteria fungi viruses parasites act opsonin activating complement system phagocytic number opsonins play role marking apoptotic cells phagocytosis without proinflammatory members pentraxin family bind apoptotic cell membrane components like phosphatidylcholine pc phosphatidylethanolamine pe igm antibodies also bind pc collectin molecules mannosebinding lectin mbl surfactant protein spa spd interact unknown ligands apoptotic cell membranes bound appropriate ligand molecules interact phagocyte receptors enhancing phagocytosis marked capable binding directly apoptotic cells also indirectly bind apoptotic cells via intermediates like igm autoantibodies mbl pentraxins cases activates complement resulting cells marked phagocytosis important contributor clearance apoptotic cells debris process usually occurs late apoptotic opsonization apoptotic cells occurs different mechanisms tissuedependent pattern example necessary proper apoptotic cell clearance peritoneal cavity important lungs spd plays important part late stage adaptive immune response pathogens particles marked igg antibodies antibodies interact fc receptors macrophages neutrophils resulting complement complex also interact fc region igg igm immune complexes activating classical complement pathway marking antigen spontaneously bind pathogen surfaces alternative
