medications usually one three types biologics class medications narrower sense profound impact many medical fields primarily rheumatology oncology also cardiology dermatology gastroenterology neurology others disciplines biologics added major therapeutic options treating many diseases including effective therapies available others previously existing therapies inadequate however advent biologic therapeutics also raised complex regulatory issues see significant pharmacoeconomic concerns cost biologic therapies dramatically higher conventional pharmacological medications factor particularly relevant since many biological medications used treat chronic diseases rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease treatment otherwise untreatable cancer remainder life cost treatment
