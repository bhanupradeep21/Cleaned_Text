subadult adult judging degree fusion squamosal yehuecauhceratops element allows confidently distinguished stepped edge border parietal characteristic centrosaurines unlike derived centrosaurines like styracosaurus centrosaurus similarly squamosal longer wide expanded rear portion squamosal twice length rest top margin squamosal contributed outline supratemporal fenestra slit frill along outer edge squamosal three prominent undulations probably supported epiossifications although epiossifications second undulation deflected slightly upwards like derived derived centrosaurines however least four five undulations instead three ridge running across squamosal near bottom bone less prominent extend onto fanlike back bone unlike avaceratops three smooth protuberances along ridge instead one roughened protuberance near middle ridge probably supported small horn two characteristics position ridge single protuberance autapomorphies yehuecauhceratops traits allowing distinguished judging

epiossification preserved simple crescentshaped edge unlike squamosal undulations terms shape surface roughened like diabloceratops avaceratops xenoceratops nasutoceratops epiossification immediately adjacent overlapped another epiossification instead inward undulation bone right next portion premaxilla contains edge nostril ridge extending diagonally across bone like prominent interior surface bone roughened save top portion surrounding nostril also thickest part bone piece dentary likely comes rear third jaw judging presence coronoid process mandible preserves row teeth containing six tooth sockets three fully erupted teeth offset towards midline animal centre typical centrosaurines scapula forms half glenoid articulation like ceratopsids acromion prominent roughened bottom edge
