macroorchidism disorder found males specifically children subject abnormally large testes condition commonly inherited connection fragile x syndrome fxs also second common genetic cause intellectual condition also rare sign mccunealbright opposite macroorchidism called microorchidism condition abnormally small testes macroorchidism related deficiency causes increase secretion follicle stimulating hormone fsh causes macroorchidism hypothyroidism local tumors aromatase macroorchidism diagnosed measuring testicular volume using prader cure macroorchidism however medications currently tested used control disorder promote quality distinguishing physical symptom macroorchidism patients increased testicular size determine enlargement testes ie macroorchidism testes must greater percentile confidence interval males puberty percentile means childs testicular size exceeds children similar age rules males early puberty another symptom macroorchidism increase testicular volume least twice normal testicular volume macroorchidism mostly found prepubescent boys fragile x syndrome however true macroorchidism start testicular size greater cm occur later prepubertal macroorchidism associated fragile x syndrome patients signs patients fxs similar patients macroorchidism signs include protruding ears long face bulging jaw forehead macrocephaly midfacial hypoplasia high arched even though fxs affects males females prevalence males approximately cause macroorchidism still however studies show connection macroorchidism disorders related hormones reveal possible role abnormal enlargement excessive increase interstitial volume connective tissue testes lead causes macroorchidism longstanding primary hypothyroidism adrenal tissue remains congenital adrenal hyperplasia cah follicle stimulating hormone fsh secreting pituitary macroadenomas local tumors lymphomas aromatase macroorchidism result increased secretion follicle stimulating hormone follicle stimulating hormone secreted without affected increase secretion luteinizing hormone lh luteinizing hormone response gonadotropinreleasing hormone macroorchidism related genetic defect immunoglobulin superfamily gene however patients failing gene present macroorchidism gonadotropes activin gonadotropes endocrine cells anterior pituitary control regulate reproduction cells release fsh lh hormones play important role puberty activin dimeric glycoprotein member transforming growth factorβ tgfβ family activin responsible hormonal homeostasis gonadal functions muscle growth immunity inflammation bone activin binds activin receptors actrs gonadotropes stimulates pathway increase folliclestimulating hormone beta subunit fshb follicle stimulating hormone fsh stimulates folliclestimulating hormone receptor fshr sertoli cells therefore producing inhibin b brings play negative feedback pituitary fshb expression gene inhibits activin pathway decreases rate fshb expression gene deficiency leads oversecretion pituitary fsh causing early rapid increase testicular sertoli cell mass ie macroorchidism children adults fshsecreting pituitary macroorchidism usually found prepubertal boys longstanding primary boys van wyk grumbach syndrome boys fragile x syndrome macroorchidism considered testicular volume measured using prader prader orchidometer used quickly accurately measure testicular volume evaluate male growth prader orchidometer widely used orchidometer since calculated using formula correct final value calculation compared age percentile table shows much child exceeds percentage children age testicular testicular volume changes throughout males life people macroorchidism testicular volume larger ml treatment macroorchidism depends pathogenesis surgical removal tumor important advised option treating macroorchidism caused nonfunctioning pituitary nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma kind benign tumor secrete active hormones pituitary macroorchidism caused congenital adrenal hyperplasia cah treated using glucocorticoid using glucocorticoid beginning macroorchidism help reduce abnormal testicular glucocorticoid treatment dosage treatment glucocorticoids hydrocortisone prednisolone dexamethasone taken various amounts times day glucocorticoid treatment help restore male fertility prohibited however overusing glucocorticoid long periods time lead low semen metformin considered longterm treatment macroorchidism due relationship fxs metformin lowers excessive production proteins cause abnormal testicular growth people macroorchidism becomes clear testicular size starts increase normally years age boys however patients macroorchidism around time testicles become abnormally noticeably also macroorchidism usually associated intellectual disability brainpower typically declines life expectancy patients macroorchidism cure macroorchidism however medications tested clinical trails identified bring positive macroorchidism affects males prevalence macroorchidism approximately macroorchidism present postpubertal males fragile x research study done learn relationship macroorchidism intellectual disability associated decreased levels fragile x mental retardation gene protein fmrp premutation carrier state fmrp made gene mainly brain testis used analysis covariance ancova compare iqs macroorchidism patients without premutation carriers results showed relationship macroorchidism intellectual disability premutation carrier males studies need done determine correlation due higher lower levels mrna fmrp another study done researched role immunoglobulin superfamily serves hypothyroidism macroorchidism regulator pituitary hormone secretion defect gene one causes macroorchidism results showed important pituitary hormone regulation two
