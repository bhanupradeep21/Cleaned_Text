saltoposuchus extinct genus small kg longtailed crocodylomorph reptile sphenosuchia norian late triassic name translated means leaping foot crocodile proposed terrestrisuchus gracilis saltoposuchus connectens represent different ontogenetic stages saltoposuchus commonly incorrectly referred popular literature ancestor close ancestors dinosaurs however recent scientific research show case fossil evidence sphenosuchia early crocodylomorphs lead paleontologists conclude saltoposuchus terrestrial monophyletic group crocodylomorphs saltoposuchidae many key morphological traits shared crocodylomorphs much like crocodylomorphs saltoposuchus skulls reduced antorbital fenestra overhanging squamosal bone medially shifted forwards sloping quadrate saltoposuchus long pointed skull slender pointed pointed teeth saltoposuchus indicate species likely carnivorous back skull saltoposuchus share many specializations crocodylomorphs including square skull table made postorbital squamosal bones overhangs temporal region lateral mandibular fenestra cheek region overhung sphenosucians quadrate head makes contact prootic squamosal bones saltoposuchus long backward pointing spine another key feature saltoposuchus includes nonpreforated acetabulum hip joint defining characteristic saltoposuchus also considered bipedal based skeletal constitution could walk four limbs well making facultative biped saltoposuchus also double row bony scutes along back seen modern crocodilians today like sphenosuchians early crocodylomorphs saltoposuchus fully erect slender limbs slender body long paleontologists believe body structures saltoposuchus fast nimble sphenosuchians described greyhound dogs scales long early crocodylomorphs saltoposuchus long centra vertebrae short vertebral processes mediumsized zygapophyseal molnar et al concluded average mediolateral range motion early crocodylomorphs greater dorsoventral range motion dorsoventral stiffness estimated higher mediolateral wrists saltoposuchus radiale ulnare elongated rod shaped elements instead buttonshaped shared characteristic among saltoposuchus terrestrial animal whose body built running fast speeds based behavior species archosaur possible saltoposuchus hunted packs like another archosaur genus coelophysis also possible saltoposuchus could exhibit cannibalistic behavior coelophysis individuals found remains smaller members species inside larger animals though later turned crocodylomorphs looking diet related species assume saltoposuchus ate small lizards insects mammals existed triassic

formation southwest löwenstein formation dated back dates back late triassic period fossils also found trossingen formation also located germany lossiemouth sandstone fossils found germany indicate saltoposuchus existed europe appropriately laurasia mesozoic era regarded age reptiles saltoposuchus lived among many different species including earliest species pterosaurs bipedal archosaurs ancestor crocodylomorpha made first appearance middle triassic also period earliest mammals started appearing therapsids dominated early middle triassic period time went therapsids started becoming extinct archosaurs became dominant group extinction event wiped species conifer forests started recover species started occupying thriving newly found ecological pangaea started splitting laurasia air arid hot summers cold marine life wiped mass extinction event triassic waters populated families fish triassic period showed first development modern stony corals time modest reef building activity shallower waters tethys near coasts mesozoic era early mammals reptilian species insects populated land insects survived mass extinction existing time include spiders scorpions millipedes centipedes newer group sister groups saltoposuchus include gracilisuchus hesperosuchus dromicosuchus dibothrosuchus terrestrisuchus litargosuchus genus found late triassic earlier jurassic eras genus part sphenosuchia clade similar morphology stature sphenosuchia ancestors crocodyliformes constitute modern crocodilians modern crocodylia reacquired semiaquatic life style research disputed reasoning crocodyliformes reacquired semiaquatic traits forefront explanation changes osteoderm rib morphology crocodylomorph evolution affected stiffness vertebral columns would allow better movement semiaquatic group species approximately meters long classified primitive like saltoposuchus species thought able run slim hindlegs group reptiles disproportionately large head strong jaws bony plates extending back likely ate small lizards groups specimens around meters long similarly saltoposuchus terrestrisuchus known delicate frame could run fast speeds long two early crocodylamorph species
