olfactory navigation hypothesis proposes usage sense smell pigeons particular mail pigeon navigation homing two principal versions papis mosaic model proposes pigeons construct map distribution environmental odours within radius kilometres wallraffs gradient theory overcomes problem distance limitation proposing existence longrange stable atmospheric odour gradients however evidence suggest pigeons use olfactory map order home conclusive homing defined ability return set point potentially anywhere earths surface including destinations unfamiliar two criteria needed coordinate task compass sense sense direction map sense sense location ability return unfamiliar locations posed question sensory cues used determine locational information well directional information proposed compass sense derived number perspectives magnetic orientation mechanism directional sense first put forward equally sun could used compass order navigate however papi contemporaries reported anosmic pigeons columbia livia severely impaired orientation homing basis results hypothesis olfactory navigation proposed two models olfactory navigation proposed papis mosaic gradient model papis mosaic hypothesis advocates pigeons construct map distribution environmental odours within radius information possible derive home direction encountering odours release site example associated windborne scents would pine forests coastlines pollution cities argued pigeons first learn associate specific odours particular locations exercise training flights model advantage requires bird detect presence absence range odours therefore homing viable release sites within proximity provide reliable windborne although papi argues utilisation olfactory information obtained outward journey wallraffs gradient theory overcomes problem distance limitation via different means proposes existence longrange stable atmospheric odour gradients foundation navigational map spatial representation two environmental odours particular intensity odour gradient differs along dissimilar directional axes therefore pigeon compare intensity scent particular location concentration home loft mechanism principle could operate vast distances would require detection interpretation minute differences odour concentration however poignant question existence predictable odour gradients deny odour gradients required hypothesis exist nature olfactory navigation hypothesis states pigeons learn odour map associating smells perceived home loft directions carried winds therefore attempts manipulate development involved changing direction wind shielding birds winds certain direction exposing pigeons artificial odorants predication experimental pigeons learn altered map thus released fly according distorted perception experiment two groups pigeons reared separate although identical aviaries composed bamboo group one air blown south containing olive oil air north containing synthetic turpentine reversed group two pigeons released east loft half drop synthetic turpentine added bill others given drop olive oil pigeons group one exposed olive oil flew north contrary birds sentient synthetic turpentine flew south consistent reversed results found group two however important note failure replicate results countries germany italy united states even considerable effort made employ identical nevertheless applied two different methods namely placement fans near home coop order reverse wind direction usage deflector lofts shift apparent direction wind deflector lofts comprised wooden glass baffles deflected wind course therefore signature odours findings pigeons raised lofts oriented magnitude error known deflector loft effect wind reversed experiments exhibited results favoured olfactory hypothesis experimentals average flying opposing direction home controls took correct flight path released site replication deflector loft experiments similar findings though anosmic pigeons employed displayed degree error orientation previously observed therefore suggesting detection odours may associated defector loft effect indeed flight directions could simply reflect directional response wind experienced loft nonodorous factors light researchers support noting lack highly developed nasal apparatus associated brain functions seedeating birds pigeons could argued therefore pigeons dominated olfactory landmarks constructing navigatory map conflicting evidence however pigeons housed open cages exposed fan produced air current carrying scent benzaldehyde released exposure natural air transport release site experimentals controls homeward oriented contrary response simply wind direction consistent feature olfaction experiments anosmic pigeons released familiar sites essentially perhaps common fault olfactory mosaic gradient model olfactory navigation model simplistic sufficiently take account cues may importance earths magnetic field potential map cue field varies strength direction earths manipulations ambient magnetic field rather difficult although keeton ioal√© report magnets caused disorientation pigeons released total overcast first indication magnetic compass orientation homing later supported reversed field around head pigeon using battery operated coils though coils little effect clear conditions effect overcast conditions dependent direction current another observation consistent idea geomagnetic map shift initial bearings pigeons occurs field increases magnetic magnetic anomalies pigeons disoriented even sunny predictable movement per hour sun east west signifies potential celestial compass possible providing time day known achievable birds due internal biological experiments test hypothesis using migratory european starling indicated direction migration could manipulated reflecting angle effect reproduced using homing pigeons although study value demonstrating mechanisms olfaction bird navigation refer fundamental question olfaction map sense pigeons smell available evidence suggests pigeons lack highly developed nasal apparatus associated brain functions yet empirical evidence shown homing ability pigeons compromised interfering olfactory however variability effects olfactory manipulations indicates odours sole cues navigation based map sense appears rely comparison available cuescitation
