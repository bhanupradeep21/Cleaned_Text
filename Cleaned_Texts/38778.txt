lyginopteridales extinct group seed plants known paleozoic first plant fossils described pteridosperms polyphyletic group sometimes referred seed ferns thus group concept pteridosperms first stratigraphically oldestknown pteridosperms occurring first late devonian primitive features notably structure probably evolved group late devonian progymnosperms known large compound frondlike leaves lyginopteridales became abundant group pteridosperms mississippian times included smaller early middle pennsylvanian times medullosales took important larger pteridosperms lyginopteridales continued flourish climbing lianescent scrambling plants however later middle pennsylvanian times lyginopteridales went serious decline probably outcompeted callistophytales occupied similar ecological niches sophisticated reproductive strategies species continued late pennsylvanian times cathaysia east equatorial gondwana persisted late permian subsequently became evidence lyginopteridales suggests grew tropical latitudes time north america europe china lyginopteridales earliestknown gymnosperms development ovules one key innovations enabled seed plants eventually dominate land vegetation evolution lyginopteridalean ovules attracted considerable interest palaeobotanists important work early ovules british palaeobotanist albert long based mainly early mississippian anatomically preserved fossils scotland uk earliest ovules eg genomosperma consisted nucellus equivalent sporangium wall surrounded sheath slender axes known widely thought arrangement derived ancestral condition cluster sporangiumbearing axes one eventually retained megasporangium others forming surrounding preintegument progressively sheath axes became fused form continuous integument surrounded protected nucellus earliest ovules apical part nucellus exposed projection known lagenostome sometimes also called salpinx facilitated capture pollen directed pollen chamber megagametophyte later pennsylvanianage ovules nucellus became almost entirely encased fused integument leaving small distal opening integument known micropyle pollen passed nevertheless lyginopteridalean ovules retained lagenostome despite function pollen capture replaced micropyle seedplants lyginopteridalean ovules one functional seed megaspore within nucellus however three aborted megaspores still present together functional megaspore represented remains would tetrad megaspores ancestral preseed lyginopteridalean ovules borne outer protective sheath tissue known cupule lyginopteridalean ovules reported without cupule may simply shed cupule fossilised late devonian early mississippian species cupule contained several pennsylvanian times normally single ovule per number cases found cupules occurring clusters ends branching many palaeobotanists interpret clusters cupulate organs fertile fronds cupulate tissue derived laminate part frond surrounded ovule thereby provided added protection lyginopteridalean ovules notable exceptions distinctive group mississippianage lyginopteridaleans platyspermic ovules referred fossil family lyginopteridales produced small trilete prepollen superficially resemble spores

surrounded zone cortex many genera contains bands fibrous tissue fibrous tissue often results distinctive markings surface stems even preserved adpressions help generic identification lyginopteris
