kawingasaurus extinct genus dicynodont therapsid late permian usili formation tanzania member family cistecephalidae like cistecephalids thought fossorial member family cistecephalidae cistephalidae includes genera cisteceohalus cistecephaloides kawingasaurus greek saurus meaning lizard appears suffix denoting reptilian origin living million years ago late permian believed first last recorded
