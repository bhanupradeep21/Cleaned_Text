violated sixth amendment articulated apprendi line cases justice breyer wrote majority opinion answering question remedy sixth amendment violation identified court applied modern sentencing schemes sixth amendment demands fact prior conviction fact increases defendants punishment statutory maximum must submitted jury proved beyond reasonable doubt statutory maximum greatest sentence judge impose based solely jurys fact finding guidelines sentencing scheme requires judges impose sentence within guideline range jurytrial reasonabledoubt requirements apply determination fact exposes defendant punishment guideline range federal sentencing guidelines like washington sentencing guidelines discussed blakely mandatory sentencing judges required impose sentences within range dictated guidelines sense decision blakely dictated constitutional holding rule apprendi construed blakely applies federal sentencing guidelines government made three principal arguments applying blakely federal sentencing guidelines court rejected federal sentencing guidelines promulgated sentencing commission washington sentencing guidelines issue blakely contrast enacted states legislature distinction court said lacked constitutional significance regardless body set rules rules required sentencing judges increase sentences basis particular facts submitted jury proved beyond reasonable doubt regardless whether legal basis accusation defendant statute guidelines promulgated independent commission principles behind jury trial right equally applicable government identified four recent cases argued precluded court applying blakely guidelines principles stare decisis first united states v dunnigan us held guidelines provision provided enhanced sentence defendant committed perjury trial violate defendants fifth amendment privilege selfincrimination dunnigan court occasion consider whether jurytrial right applied particular provision furthermore although sentence based enhancement potential exceed statutory maximum mean judge impose sentence thus reach dunnigan may limited need overrule next witte v united states us court held conduct supported enhancement prior case prevent separate criminal prosecution conduct prevent applying blakely guidelines ultimately conduct two respective cases subject two different burdens proof court considered converse witte rule united states v watts us held conduct defendant acquitted could nevertheless support sentence enhancement guidelines neither case court considered whether sentence enhancements question subject jurytrial requirement issue confront today simply presented finally edwards v united states us court allowed sentence drug conspiracy involving powder crack cocaine rest drugs face general verdict specifying whether jury believed conspiracy involved either powder cocaine crack cocaine prevent court applying blakely guidelines edwards defendants could argued powder crack cocaine part overall conspiracy hence courts ruling case inconsistent applying blakely guidelines government argued applying jurytrial requirement sentencing enhancements promulgated commission would transform enhancements criminal code resulting unconstitutional delegation legislative power judicial branch mistretta v united states court upheld delegation legislative power body judicial branch reasoning judicial branch power exercise quasilegislative functions proposing rules evidence civil procedure use federal courts united states sentencing commission performing adjudicatory function rather exercising policymaking power appropriate judicial officers uniquely within expertise reasoning preclude applying blakely guidelines thus court ruled holding blakely applied federal sentencing guidelines court next confronted question remedy constitutional violation different majority court concluded usc provision federal sentencing statute required district courts impose sentence within guidelines range incompatible constitutional holding therefore severed excised statute likewise usc provision governed handling appeals sentences also severed excised provision inextricably linked provision made guidelines mandatory result severing excising two provisions make guidelines effectively advisory district courts could considering guidelines range tailor sentence reflected broader range concerns set forth federal sentencing statute court evaluated two possible remedies light congresss intent enacting guidelines system first option one preferred justices dissented remedial holding would engraft onto existing system todays sixth amendment jury trial requirement second one court ultimately adopted made guidelines advisory time maintaining strong connection sentence imposed offenders real conduct connection important increased uniformity sentencing congress intended guidelines system achieve although remedies would significantly alter system congress designed remedial majority observed possible maintain judicial factfinding congress thought would underpin mandatory guidelines system light jury factfinding requirement constitutional majority applied system several considerations persuaded court congress would enacted guidelines system made mandatory federal district judges apply known jury factfinding requirement would apply first text sentencing statute required court consider nature circumstances offense history characteristics defendant imposing sentence context meant judge sitting alone instead judge together jury debating guidelines congress intended judge weigh factors bearing defendants sentence second congresss basic statutory goal system diminishes sentencing disparity depends success upon judicial efforts determine base punishment upon real conduct underlies crime conviction many federal crimes defined broadly encompass vast array underlying conduct federal crimes like robbery committed variety different ways judges typically relied presentence reports set forth relevant conduct offender characteristics assist determining appropriate sentence congress anticipated guidelines practice would continue expectation supported courts holdings witte watts contrast imposing jury factfinding requirement onto guidelines would destroy system preventing judge relying presentence report factual information relevant sentencing uncovered trial facts would necessarily submitted jury course trial turn would weaken tie sentence offenders real conduct imagine smith jones violate hobbs act usc forbids obstructing delaying affecting commerce movement article commodity commerce extortion smith threatens injure coworker coworker advance dollars interstate companys till jones threatens injure coworker unless coworker advances thousand dollars companys accounts reinforces threat making certain coworkers family aware threat arranging deliveries various dead animals coworkers home show serious forth smith jones although violated statute created different harms result actions guidelines sentences would different jury factfinding requirement merely grafted onto guidelines scheme unless prosecutors decide charge elements crime judge would impose similar punishments imagine next two former felons johnson jackson threatened bank teller gun made injured innocent bystander fleeing bank suppose johnson charged illegal possession firearm usc jackson charged bank robbery usc guidelines would allowed judge impose similar sentences johnson jackson despite charged different crimes requiring sentenceenhancing facts submitted jury undermines ability guidelines achieve goal sentence uniformity meaning uniformity sentences imposed real conduct violations statute furthermore imposing juryfactfinding requirement onto guidelines would prove complex congress could intended would sentence enhancements charged indictment could defendant defend specific enhancements used gun crime simultaneously denying guilt entirely fact vast majority criminal cases resolved plea bargains would simplify things instead would complicate increasing likelihood agreedupon sentence reflects skill defense counsel prosecutors policies real conduct underlying offense system would particularly troubling consequences respect prosecutorial power prosecutor would control charge bring defendant also sentence enhancement would necessarily power decide based relevant information offense offender defendants merit heavier punishments congress also would intended craft system makes difficult ratchet sentences upward downward yet imposing juryfactfinding requirement guidelines would precisely effect reasons court concluded congress would enacted guidelines known many various sentenceenhancing factors would subject jurytrial requirement order eliminate constitutional violation court identified time tailor federal sentencing statutes closely congressional intent court struck usc provision sentencing statute made mandatory district courts impose sentences according guidelines rest sentencing statute functioned independently required district judges consider guidelines sentencing range established applicable category offense committed applicable category defendant order impose sentence reflects seriousness offense promotes respect law provides adequate deterrence protects public provides defendant needed educational vocational training medical care court struck also strike usc provision governing standard reviewing sentences appeal impose unnecessary obstacle handling appeals sentences statute explicitly set forth standard review may implicitly courts decision booker instructed appellate courts determine whether sentence unreasonable respect guidelines range booker court read remaining provisions sentencing appeal statute instruct appellate courts determine whether sentences unreasonable respect factors set forth usc statute spelling factors district courts required consider fashioning sentence first instance though justices dissented remedial holding called standard unworkable court reasoned standard reasonableness familiar areas law together sentencing commission would still collect data criminal sentencing courts appeals together able maintain uniformity criminal sentences furthermore congress unsatisfied arrangement free amend sentencing laws justice stevens pointed possible avoid sixth amendment violation bookers case without making changes guidelines solely statute conviction maximum guidelines sentence booker could received months prosecution submitted quantity drugs jury range would increased months booker ultimately received sentence months one within increased sentencing range one sentencing judge could imposed evaluating bookers criminal history whether obstructed justice guidelines written possess virtue combining mandatory determination sentencing ranges discretionary decisions within ranges allow ample latitude judicial factfinding even arguably raise sixth amendment issue stevenss principal objection court crafted new kind severability analysis started premise legislative enactments presumed valid may struck entirety law unconstitutional nearly applications invalid provision severed remainder statute neither conditions applied federal sentencing laws stevens observed need adopt third method curing constitutional violations according sentencing commission criminal sentences involve enhancements whatsoever rest would actually implicate defendants sixth amendment rights furthermore defendants may waive jurytrial rights follows may also waive blakely rights appropriate situations two observations led stevens conclusion tiny portion criminal sentences imposed mandatory guidelines scheme would actually implicate blakely rule cases prosecutors defense attorneys judges could cope indeed blakely decided department justice instructed prosecutors include drug quantity allegations indictment also many cases guidelines ranges overlap would blakely problem judge imposed sentence within overlapping range based sentence solely judicial factfinding light valid applications mandatory guidelines constrained blakely stevens saw plausible way say sentencing statute unconstitutional nearly applications stevens envisioned difficulty applying blakely guidelines word court could easily refer judge jury together could judge alone congress must presumably legislate within constitutional limitations plain language statute alternative interpretation incompatible stevens disputed applying blakely guidelines would frustrate goal achieving uniformity sentences based real conduct judges retained discretion impose sentences within prescribed ranges defendants pleaded guilty waived blakely rights range within judge could exercise discretion would necessarily increase given factbased nature certain sentence enhancements guidelines drug quantity firearm enhancements extent injury loss victim reason juries could make determinations complicated cases prosecutors defense attorneys judges together could trusted craft workable solutions extent prosecutors overstep charging authority judges retain ability reject unsatisfactory plea agreements light objections stevens disputed congress would preferred majoritys remedy solution devising justice breyer reiterated disagreement apprendi rule identified specific reasons apply blakely holding federal sentencing guidelines facts used determine defendants sentence historically solely within judges purview federal sentencing guidelines treated differently creating system frustrated goal increased sentencing uniformity hardly seemed fair defendants public large fact guidelines administrative rules rather statutes also significant breyer extent guidelines adequately take account aggravating mitigating circumstance judge free depart guidelines range thus defendant every expectation despite guidelines might receive sentence near statutory maximum rather top end guidelines range justice scalia took issue courts inferring reasonableness standard appellate review sentences remainder statute excised express statement sentences reviewed reasonableness traditionally sentencing discretion reviewable appeal guidelines enacted appellate review limited discrete cases delineated statute appellate review plenary according text
