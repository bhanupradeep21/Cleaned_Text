livestock responsible greenhouse gases alternative sources protein insects replace protein sourced livestock help decrease number greenhouse gases emitted food production insects produce less carbon

insects mainly concluded harvesting cleaning inactivation heating drying depending final product rearing insects different life stages collected sieving followed water cleaning necessary remove biomass excretion processing insects sieved stored alive one day without inactivation step needed inactive enzymes microbes insects enzymatic browning reaction mainly phenolase phenol cause brown black color insect leads discoloration offflavor sufficient heat treatment required kill enterobacteriaceae product meet safety requirements dvalue zvalue used estimate effectiveness heat treatments temperature duration heating cause insect proteins denaturation changes functional properties proteins prevent spoilage products dried lower moisture content prolong shelf life longer drying time results low evaporation rate due chitin layer prevent insect dehydrating lifetime product granule form gives advantage drying general insects moisture level range drying process decreasing moisture content level good preservation besides moisture level oxidation lipids cause high levels unsaturated fatty acids hence processing steps influencing final fat stability products necessary considered
