correct animal youngest known iguanodont extension ornithopod known southern hemisphere isasicursor herbivore describers consider likely elasmaria lived together relatively larger hadrosauroidea two groups belonging different niches though hadrosauroids found site presence nullotitan suggests niche partitioning giant sauropods isasicursor probably hunted maip possibly largest patagonian megaraptorid describers saw remains young old individuals found together evidence isasicursor lived herds httpsenwikipediaorgwikiisasicursor
