referred pain also called reflective pain perceived location site painful stimulus example case angina pectoris brought myocardial infarction heart attack pain often felt left side neck left shoulder back rather thorax chest site injury international association study pain officially defined term hence several authors defined differently referred pain described since late despite increasing amount literature subject biological mechanism referred pain unknown although several hypotheses radiating pain slightly different referred pain example pain related myocardial infarction could either referred radiating pain chest referred pain pain located away adjacent organ involved instance person pain jaw left arm chest radiating pain would origin patient perceive pain pain also spreads radiates origin point cause pain perceived wider area addition several proposed mechanisms referred currently definitive consensus regarding correct cardiac general visceral sensory pain fibers follow sympathetics back spinal cord cell bodies located thoracic dorsal root ganglia general rule thorax abdomen general visceral afferent gva pain fibers follow sympathetic fibers back spinal cord segments gave rise preganglionic sympathetic fibers central nervous system cns perceives pain heart coming somatic portion body supplied thoracic spinal cord segments classically pain associated myocardial infarction located mid left side chest heart actually located pain radiate left side jaw left arm myocardial infarction rarely present referred pain usually occurs people diabetes older age also dermatomes region body wall upper limb neuronal cell bodies dorsal root ganglia synapse second order neurons spinal cord segments general visceral sensory fibers heart cns clearly discern whether pain coming body wall viscera perceives pain coming somewhere body wall ie substernal pain left armhand pain jaw paincitation needed represents one earliest theories subject referred pain based work wa sturge j ross later tc ruch convergent projection proposes afferent nerve fibers tissues converge onto spinal neuron explains referred pain believed segmented much way spinal cord additionally experimental evidence shows local pain pain site stimulation intensified referred pain intensified wellcitation needed criticism model arises inability explain delay onset referred pain local pain stimulation experimental evidence also shows referred pain often unidirectional example stimulated local pain anterior tibial muscle causes referred pain ventral portion ankle however referred pain moving opposite direction shown experimentally lastly threshold local pain stimulation referred pain stimulation different according model convergence facilitation conceived j mackenzie based ideas sturge ross believed internal organs insensitive stimuli furthermore believed nonnociceptive afferent inputs spinal cord created termed irritable focus focus caused stimuli perceived referred pain however ideas gain widespread acceptance critics due dismissal visceral paincitation needed recently idea regained credibility new term central sensitization central sensitization occurs neurons spinal cords dorsal horn brainstem become responsive repeated stimulation peripheral neurons weaker signals trigger delay appearance referred pain shown laboratory experiments explained due time required create central axon reflex suggests afferent fiber bifurcated connecting dorsal horn bifurcated fibers exist muscle skin intervertebral discs yet particular neurons rare representative whole body axonreflex also explain time delay appearance referred pain threshold differences stimulating local referred pain somatosensory sensibility changes area referred hyperexcitability hypothesizes referred pain central mechanism however say one central characteristic predominates experiments involving noxious stimuli recordings dorsal horn animals revealed referred pain sensations began minutes muscle stimulation pain felt receptive field distance away original receptive field according hyperexcitability new receptive fields created result opening latent convergent afferent fibers dorsal horn signal could perceived referred paincitation needed several characteristics line mechanism referred pain dependency stimulus time delay appearance referred pain compared local pain however appearance new receptive fields interpreted referred pain conflicts majority experimental evidence studies including studies healthy individuals furthermore referred pain generally appears within seconds humans opposed minutes animal models scientists attribute mechanism influence downstream supraspinal pathways neuroimaging techniques pet scans fmri may visualize underlying neural processing pathways responsible future thalamic convergence suggests referred pain perceived due summation neural inputs brain opposed spinal cord injured area referred area experimental evidence thalamic convergence lacking however pain studies performed monkeys revealed convergence several pathways upon separate cortical subcortical neuronscitation needed pain studied laboratory setting due greater amount control exerted example modality intensity timing painful stimuli controlled much precision within setting two main ways referred pain studiedcitation needed recent years several different chemicals used induce referred pain including bradykinin substance p serotonin however substances became widespread use solution hypertonic saline used instead various experiments determined multiple factors correlated saline administration infusion rate saline concentration pressure amount saline used mechanism saline induces local referred pain pair unknown researchers commented could due osmotic differences however intramuscular electrical stimulation imes muscle tissue used various experimental clinical settings advantage using imes system standard hypertonic saline imes turned allows researcher exert much higher degree control precision terms stimulus measurement response method easier carry injection method require special training used frequency electrical pulse also controlled studies frequency hz needed stimulate local referred painclarification using method observed significantly higher stimulus strength needed obtain referred pain relative local pain also strong correlation stimulus intensity intensity referred local pain also believed method causes larger recruitment nociceptor units resulting spatial summation spatial summation results much larger barrage signals dorsal horn brainstem referred pain indicative nerve damage case study done man injury sustained childhood developed referred pain symptoms face back touched even light touch shooting pain arm study concluded pain possibly due neural reorganization sensitized regions face back nerve damage occurred mentioned case similar phantom limb syndrome patients experience conclusion based experimental evidence gathered v ramachandran difference arm pain still attached bodycitation needed examples one see understanding referred pain lead better diagnoses various conditions diseases physiotherapist robin mckenzie described termed centralization concluded centralization occurs referred pain moves distal proximal location observations support idea seen patients would bend backward forward examinationcitation needed studies reported majority patients experienced centralization able avoid spinal surgery isolating area local pain however patients experience centralization undergo surgery diagnose correct problems result study research elimination referred pain certain body movementscitation needed one example referred pain calf mckenzie showed referred pain would move closer spine patient bent backwards full extension times importantly referred pain would dissipate even movements myocardial ischaemia referred pain certain portion body lead diagnosis correct local center somatic mapping referred pain corresponding local centers led various topographic maps produced aid pinpointing location pain based referred areas example local pain stimulated esophagus capable producing referred pain upper abdomen oblique muscles throat local pain prostate radiate referred pain abdomen lower back calf muscles kidney stones cause visceral pain ureter stone slowly passed excretory system cause immense referred pain lower abdominal recent research found ketamine sedative capable blocking referred pain study conducted patients fibromyalgia disease characterized joint muscle pain fatigue patients looked specifically due increased sensitivity nociceptive stimuli furthermore referred pain appears different pattern fibromyalgic patients nonfibromyalgic patients often difference manifests difference terms area referred pain found distal vs proximal compared local pain area also much exaggerated owing increased httpsenwikipediaorgwikireferredpain
