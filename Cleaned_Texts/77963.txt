amikacin antibiotic medication used number bacterial includes joint infections intraabdominal infections meningitis pneumonia sepsis urinary tract also used treatment multidrugresistant used injection vein using iv amikacin like aminoglycoside antibiotics cause hearing loss balance problems kidney side effects include paralysis resulting inability used pregnancy may cause permanent deafness amikacin works blocking function bacterias ribosomal subunit making unable produce amikacin patented came commercial use world health organizations list essential derived amikacin often used treating severe infections multidrugresistant aerobic gramnegative bacteria especially pseudomonas acinetobacter enterobacter e coli proteus klebsiella grampositive bacteria amikacin strongly affects amikacin also used treat nontubercular mycobacterial infections tuberculosis caused sensitive strains firstline drugs fail control rarely used often used following amikacin may combined betalactam antibiotic

function children whose kidneys fully developed yet considered pregnancy category united states australia meaning probability harming around amikacin crosses placenta halflife amikacin mother hours

tend larger volume distribution due higher concentration extracellular fluid aminoglycosides elderly tend amikacin stay longer system average clearance amikacin lhr lhr clearance even higher people cystic people muscular disorders myasthenia gravis parkinsons disease amikacins paralytic effect neuromuscular junctions worsen muscle sideeffects amikacin similar aminoglycosides kidney damage ototoxicity lead hearing loss important effects occurring nephro ototoxicity thought due aminoglycosides tendency accumulate kidneys inner amikacin cause neurotoxicity used higher dose longer recommended resulting effects neurotoxicity include vertigo numbness tingling skin paresthesia muscle twitching toxic effect cranial nerve causes ototoxicity resulting loss balance commonly hearing damage cochlea caused forced apoptosis hair cells leads loss highfrequency hearing happens clinical hearing loss damage ear vestibules likely creating excessive oxidative free radicals timedependent rather dosedependent manner meaning risk minimized reducing duration amikacin causes nephrotoxicity damage kidneys acting proximal renal tubules easily ionizes cation binds anionic sites epithelial cells proximal tubule part receptormediated pinocytosis concentration amikacin renal cortex becomes ten times amikacin likely interferes metabolism phospholipids lysosomes causes lytic enzymes leak nephrotoxicity results increased serum creatinine blood urea nitrogen red blood cells white blood cells well albuminuria increased output albumin urine glycosuria excretion glucose urine decreased urine specific gravity oliguria decrease overall urine also cause urinary casts changes renal tubular function also change electrolyte levels acidbase balance body lead hypokalemia acidosis nephrotoxicity common preexisting hypokalemia hypocalcemia hypomagnesemia acidosis low glomerular filtration rate diabetes mellitus dehydration fever sepsis well taking toxicity usually reverts antibiotic course avoided altogether less frequent dosing every hours rather every amikacin cause neuromuscular blockade including acute muscular paralysis respiratory paralysis including rare side effects occurring fewer users include allergic reactions skin rash fever headaches tremor nausea vomiting eosinophilia arthralgia anemia hypotension hypomagnesemia intravitreous injections amikacin injected eye macular infarction cause permanent vision amikacin liposome inhalation suspension prescribing information includes boxed warning regarding increased risk respiratory conditions including hypersensitivity pneumonitis inflamed lungs bronchospasm tightening airway exacerbation underlying lung disease hemoptysis spitting blood led hospitalizations common side effects patients taking amikacin liposome inhalation suspension dysphonia difficulty speaking cough ototoxicity damaged hearing upper airway irritation musculoskeletal pain fatigue diarrhea amikacin avoided sensitive aminoglycoside crossallergenic allergy one aminoglycoside also confers hypersensitivity aminoglycosides also avoided sensitive sulfite seen among people since amikacin usually comes sodium metabisulfite cause allergic general amikacin used beforeafter another drug cause neurotoxicity ototoxicity nephrotoxicity drugs include aminoglycosides antiviral acyclovir antifungal amphotericin b antibiotics bacitracin capreomycin colistin polymyxin b vancomycin cisplatin used amikacin used neuromuscular blocking agents increase muscle weakness amikacin inactivated betalactams though extent aminoglycosides still often used penicillins type betalactam create additive effect certain bacteria carbapenems synergistic effect grampositive bacteria another group betalactams cephalosporins increase nephrotoxicity aminoglycoside well randomly elevating creatinine levels antibiotics chloramphenicol clindamycin tetracycline known inactivate aminoglycosides general pharmacological effect amikacin increased used drugs derived botulinum anesthetics neuromuscular blocking agents large doses blood contains citrate potent diuretics cause ototoxicity also increase concentration amikacin serum tissue making ototoxicity even quinidine also increases levels amikacin nsaid indomethacin increase serum aminoglycoside levels premature contrast mediums ioversol increases nephrotoxicity otoxicity caused amikacin decrease effect certain vaccines live bcg vaccine used tuberculosis cholera vaccine live typhoid vaccine acting pharmacological amikacin irreversibly binds rrna rnabinding protein subunit prokaryotic ribosome inhibits protein synthesis changing ribosomes shape read mrna codons also interferes region interacts wobble base trna works concentrationdependent manner better action alkaline normal doses amikacinsensitive bacteria respond within amikacin evades attacks antibioticinactivating enzymes responsible antibiotic resistance bacteria except aminoacetyltransferase accomplished lhydroxyaminobuteroyl amide lhaba moiety attached compare kanamycin simply hydrogen blocks access decreases affinity aminoglycosideinactivating amikacin ends one site enzymes attack gentamicin tobramycin bacteria resistant streptomycin capreomycin still susceptible amikacin bacteria resistant kanamycin varying susceptibility amikacin resistance amikacin also confers resistance kanamycin resistance amikacin kanamycin mycobacterium causative agent tuberculosis due mutation rrs gene codes rrna mutations reduce binding affinity amikacin bacterias variations aminoglycoside acetyltransferase aac aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase aad also confer resistance resistance pseudomonas aeruginosa caused also confers resistance kanamycin gentamicin tobramycin resistance staphylococcus aureus epidermidis caused also confers resistance kanamycin tobramycin strains aureus also inactivate amikacin phosphorylating amikacin absorbed orally thus must administered parenterally reaches peak serum concentrations hours administered intramuscularly less amikacin actually binds plasma proteins distributed heart gallbladder lungs bones well bile sputum interstitial
