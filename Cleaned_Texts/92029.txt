pseudobulbar affect pba emotional incontinence type neurological disorder characterized uncontrollable episodes crying laughing pba occurs secondary neurologic disorder brain injury patients may find crying uncontrollably something slightly sad unable stop several minutes episodes may also moodincongruent patient may laugh uncontrollably angry frustrated sometimes episodes may switch emotional

commonly seen mental illnesses certain personality disorders cardinal feature disorder pathologically lowered threshold exhibiting behavioral response laughter crying anger affected individual
