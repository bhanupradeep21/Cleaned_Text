micronucleus name given small nucleus forms whenever chromosome fragment chromosome incorporated one daughter nuclei cell division usually sign genotoxic events chromosomal instability micronuclei commonly seen cancerous cells may indicate genomic damage events increase risk developmental degenerative micronuclei form anaphase lagging acentric chromosome chromatid fragments caused incorrectly repaired unrepaired dna breaks nondisjunction chromosomes incorrect segregation chromosomes may result hypomethylation repeat sequences present pericentromeric dna irregularities kinetochore proteins assembly dysfunctional spindle apparatus flawed anaphase checkpoint micronuclei contribute genome instability promoting catastrophic mutational event called many micronucleus assays developed test

stem cells erythrocytes produce cell divisions ideal candidates cells experience constant rapid turnover lack true nucleus erythrocytes makes micronuclei easily visible microscope micronucleus assay systems economical require much less skill scoring conventional metaphase tests much faster conventional tests since micronucleus assays reflect chromosomal aberrations reliably rapidly extremely

explore cell death cytostasis biomarkers dna damage major drawback using micronucleus tests determine different types chromosomal aberrations influenced mitotic rate proportion cell death skewing multiple studies found micronuclei frequency women higher men number micronuclei increase around years age micronuclei levels ranged men women genderrelated differences mainly seen younger age groups
