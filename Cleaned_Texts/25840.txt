simearth living planet life simulation game second designed wright published maxis simearth player controls development planet english scientist james lovelock served advisor gaia hypothesis planet evolution incorporated game versions made macintosh atari st amiga ibm pc super nintendo entertainment system sega cd rereleased wii virtual several maxis simulation games rereleased maxis collector series greater compatibility windows differing box art including addition classics beneath title simearth rereleased classics simearth player vary planets atmosphere temperature landmasses etc place various forms life planet watch evolve random planet game setting game software toy without required goals big difficult challenge evolve sentient life advanced civilization development stages planet restored repeated planet dies ten billion years creation estimated time sun become red giant kill planets life also eight scenarios goals first three aquarium cambrian earth modernday earth involving managing evolution development earth different stages next four mars venus ice planet dune involving terraforming planets support life final scenario earth involving rescuing life civilization future earth selfreplicating robots nuclear warfare giving player option causing great flood help achieve goal addition another game mode besides random planet scenario mode called daisy world biome planet daisies change color relative temperature game models gaia hypothesis james lovelock assisted design wrote introduction manual one options available player simplified daisyworld players control planet game quite comprehensive display panels allow player regulate everything atmospheric gases percentages three decimal places rate continental drift rate reproduction mutation lifeforms addition player given options place equipment items interfere planets development oxygen generators increase amount oxygen atmosphere monolith take one found space odyssey aids increasing intelligence lifeform extraterrestrial contact list disasters ranges natural occurrences hurricanes wild fires populationdependent disasters plagues pollution effects planet may minor major depending current conditions increased volcanic eruptions example increase amount dust atmosphere lowering global temperature earthquakes body water may produce tsunamis shortage nuclear fuel nuclear powerdependent civilization may potentially trigger nuclear war nuclear winter global warming cause planets ice caps melt sea levels rise planet gets hot oceans boil away oceans left land planet without water oceans brought back hit ice meteor aka comet many things kept within certain balanced range planet able support multicellular animal life outside range singlecelled lifeforms plants robots lifeforms civilized survive excludes lifeforms game since multicellular animals civilized playertriggered actions cost specified energy units omega Ï‰ units example energy units required lay single terrain square units required lay terraforming device energy budget determined level development planet chosen difficulty level lowest difficulty level energy budget unlimited gameplay somewhat mystifying species may thrive die apparent reason mass extinctions however often followed periods renewed evolutionary diversification allowing player experiment new sets species ecosystems feature game taxa multicellular animals equal footing thus possible evolve example sapient two singlecelled lifeform taxa prokaryotes eukaryotes bacteria amoebas ingame respectively treated specially examples animal taxa include radiates cetaceans well well known taxa fish birds easter egg also machine life appear city highest technology level nanotech age destroyed nuclear explosion machine life thrive biome environmental conditions generally outcompeting lifeforms present eventually evolve intelligence build cities additionally carniferns mutated carnivorous plants occur naturally abundance insects allows lifeforms develop carniferns able develop intelligence animals addition familiar types longextinct trichordates included game states games developers felt sorry giving chance survival simearth dinosaurs another included taxa organism simearth planet becomes sentient develops civilization gradually go different stages development successive stage technologically advanced last wright introduced james lovelock stewart brand former editor coevolution quarterly lived near wright upon hearing lovelock advised development team behind simearth particularly assisted geophysical lovelock stated regards gaia model attempts model earth simple sciences biology biochemistry fail models oversensitive initial conditions prone chaotic gaia models link biology geology however lovelock claimed reason stable able resist lovelock expressed simearths simulation degree realism despite little game expressed hadnt seen involved computer simulations nature scale simearth time noting many professional climate models time didnt take clouds ocean biology computer gaming world called simearth absolutely fascinating reviewer wished game simcitylike visual feedback stated superior predecessor larger scope greater software publishers association excellence software awards best secondary education program best simulation entertainment weekly gave game wrote never early teach kids respect biosphere may true introducing complicated simulations simearth living planet fci super nes variables temperature precipitation etc polynomial equation theres something said though task simple growing option offered knowing far button push cream bad one gave msdos version simearth overall score expressed game fun regardless whether know youre said experimenting simulation hours fun one praised simearths substantial gameplay expressing game nearinfinite variations experiment one noted game tremendous educational possibilities simultaneously fun httpsenwikipediaorgwikisimearth
