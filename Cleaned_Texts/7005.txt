anatomy temporomandibular joints tmj two joints connecting jawbone skull bilateral synovial articulation temporal bone skull mandible bones name derived joint unique bilateral joint functions one unit since tmj connected mandible right left joints must function together therefore independent main components joint capsule articular disc mandibular condyles articular surface temporal bone temporomandibular ligament stylomandibular ligament sphenomandibular ligament lateral pterygoid muscle articular capsule capsular ligament thin loose envelope attached circumference mandibular fossa articular tubercle immediately front neck condyle mandible loose attachment neck mandible allows free movement unique feature temporomandibular joint articular disc disc composed dense fibrocartilagenous tissue positioned head mandibular condyle mandibular fossa temporal bone temporomandibular joints one synovial joints human body articular disc another sternoclavicular joint disc divides joint two compartments lower upper compartments two compartments synovial cavities consist upper lower synovial cavity synovial membrane lining joint capsule produces synovial fluid fills disc biconcave shape anterior portion disc serves insertion site superior head lateral pterygoid posterior portion attaches temporal bone upper lower compartments communicate unless disc central area disc avascular lacks innervation thus getting nutrients surrounding synovial fluid contrast posterior ligament surrounding capsules along blood vessels nerves cells present fibroblasts white blood cells among central area also thinner denser consistency peripheral region thicker cushioned consistency synovial fluid synovial cavities provides nutrition avascular central area disc age entire disc thins may undergo addition cartilage central part changes may lead impaired movement synovial membrane covers inner surface articular capsule tmj except surface articular disc condylar lower joint compartment formed mandible articular disc involved rotational initial movement jaw mouth opens upper joint compartment formed articular disc temporal bone involved translational secondary gliding motion jaw opened cases anterior disc displacement pain felt movement mandible due condyle compressing area articular surface temporal bonecitation needed three ligaments associated temporomandibular joints one major two minor ligaments ligaments important define border movements words farthest extents movements mandible movements mandible made past extents functionally allowed muscular attachments result painful stimuli thus movements past limited borders rarely achieved normal function ligaments called otomandibular connect middle ear malleus temporomandibular joint sensory innervation temporomandibular joint provided auriculotemporal nerve masseteric branches mandibular nerve cn turn branch trigeminal nerve cn vcitation needed free nerve endings many act nociceptors innervate bones ligaments muscles fibrocartilage overlays tmj condyleclarification needed arterial blood supply provided branches external carotid artery predominately superficial temporal branch branches external carotid artery namely deep auricular artery anterior tympanic artery ascending pharyngeal artery maxillary artery may also contribute arterial blood supply joint fibrocartilage overlays tmj condyleclarification needed avascular healthy formation temporomandibular joints occurs around weeks utero joint spaces articular disc approximately weeks component fetus future joint becomes evident mesenchyme condylar cartilage mandible developing temporal bone two slits like joint cavities intervening disk make appearance region weeks mesenchyme around joint begins form fibrous joint capsule little known significance newly forming muscles joint formation developing superior head lateral pterygoid muscle attaches anterior portion fetal disk disk also continues posteriorly petrotympanic fissure attaches malleus middle ear growth center located head mandibular condyle individual reaches maturity growth center consists hyaline cartilage underneath periosteum articulating surface condyle last growth center bone body multidirectional growth capacity unlike typical long bone area cartilage within bone grows length appositional growth individual grows maturity time cartilage replaced bone using endochondral ossification mandibular growth center condyle allows increased length mandible needed larger permanent teeth well larger brain capacity adult growth mandible also influences overall shape face thus charted referred orthodontic therapy individual reaches full maturity growth center bone within condyle temporomandibular joint classed ginglymoarthrodial joint since ginglymus hinging joint arthrodial sliding condyle mandible articulates temporal bone mandibular fossa mandibular fossa concave depression squamous portion temporal bone two bones actually separated articular disc divides joint two distinct compartments inferior compartment allows rotation condylar head around instantaneous axis corresponding first opening mouth mouth open extent mouth longer open without superior compartment temporomandibular joints becoming active point mouth continues open condylar heads rotating within lower compartment temporomandibular joints entire apparatus condylar head articular disc translates although traditionally explained forward downward sliding motion anterior concave surface mandibular fossa posterior convex surface articular eminence translation actually amounts rotation around another axis effectively produces evolute termed resultant axis mandibular rotation lies vicinity mandibular foramen allowing lowtension environment vasculature innervation necessity translation produce opening past accomplished sole rotation condyle demonstrated placing resistant fist chin trying open mouth mm resting position temporomandibular joint teeth biting together instead muscular balance proprioceptive feedback allow physiologic rest mandible interocclusal clearance freeway space mm temporomandibular joint less stable teeth clenched together normal full jaw opening millimeters measured edge lower front teeth edge upper front teeth measuring vertical range motion measurement must adjusted overbite example measurement edge lower front teeth edge upper front teeth millimeters overbite millimeters jaw opening millimeters jaw movements mandible moves normal movements mandible function mastication chewing known excursions two lateral excursions left right forward excursion known protrusion reversal protrusion retrusion mandible moved protrusion mandibular incisors front teeth mandible moved first come edge edge maxillary upper incisors surpass producing temporary underbite accomplished translation condyle articular eminence upper portion joint without slightest amount rotation taking place lower portion joint necessary allow mandibular incisors come front maxillary incisors without running assuming ideal class class ii occlusion chewing mandible moves specific manner delineated two temporomandibular joints side mandible moves laterally referred either working rotating side side referred either balancing orbiting side latter terms although bit outdated actually precise define sides movements respective condyles mandible moved lateral excursion working side condyle condyle side mandible moves outwards performs rotation horizontal plane balancing side condyle performs translation actual functional chewing teeth moved side side also biting teeth incorporated well rotation vertical plane also plays part condyles mandible moved primarily four muscles mastication masseter medial pterygoid lateral pterygoid temporalis four muscles innervated mandibular division trigeminal nerve work different groups move mandible different directions contraction lateral pterygoid acts pull disc condyle forward within glenoid fossa articular eminence thus action muscle serves protrude jaw assistance gravity digastricus muscle also opens jaw three muscles close mouth masseter medial pterygoid pulling angle mandible temporalis pulling coronoid process mandible temporomandibular joint pain generally due one four reasons pain dysfunction temporomandibular joint referred temporomandibular joint dysfunction temporomandibular joint disorder tmd term used refer group problems involving temporomandibular joints muscles tendons ligaments blood vessels tissues associated although rare pathologic conditions may also affect function temporomandibular joints causing pain swelling conditions include chondrosarcoma osteosarcoma giant cell tumor aneurysmal bone temporomandibular joints felt front within external acoustic meatus movements mandible auscultation joint also common disorder temporomandibular joint disc displacement essence articular disc attached anteriorly superior head lateral pterygoid muscle posteriorly retrodiscal tissue moves condyle fossa mandible temporal bone contact made something articular disc explained usually painful unlike adjacent tissues central portion disc contains sensory innervation instances disorder disc displaced anteriorly upon translation anterior inferior sliding motion condyle forward within fossa articular eminence opening pop click sometimes heard usually felt also indicating condyle moving back onto disk known reducing joint disc displacement reduction upon closing condyle slide back disc hence another click pop point condyle posterior disc upon clenching condyle compresses bilaminar area nerves arteries veins temporal fossa causing pain inflammation disc displacement without reduction disc stays anterior condylar head upon opening mouth
