begging animals animal solicits given resources another animal usually young animal soliciting food parents brood hosts adults however resource sometimes nonfood related may solicited adult animals begging behavior widely studied birds however mammals amphibians invertebrates perform begging displays generally food solicitation begging behavior instinctive although instances learned eg pet cats dogs ultimate causation begging increase animals individual fitness several theories proposed food begging evolved proximate causes including scramble competition honest signalling need cooperative begging siblings various types information nutritional status immunocompetence transmitted auditory visual begging signals behavior modulated several factors brood size hormones similarly several

parental investment often competing siblings food distribution parents among offspring key element parentoffspring conflict young animals potential competitors attempt skew parental food allocation

intensity reflects true condition need individual cost signal imposes third model predicts animals respond overall signal entire brood siblings cooperate gain begging behavior possibly functions sibling competition method individuals seek gain food siblings increase individual fitness parents need honest signal offspring indicating level hunger need parents distribute food accordingly offspring want get much food possible want exaggerate signals gain investment parents however conflict resolved cost excessive begging excessive begging attract predators also retards chick growth begging goes thus cost increased begging enforce offspring honesty weaker nestling might easily change intensity begs stronger nestling hungry begging push front nest parent competition among nest
