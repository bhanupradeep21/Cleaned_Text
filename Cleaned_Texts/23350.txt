mathematical cryptography usually weakest link security chain effective security requires cryptography combined term schneiers law coined cory doctorow law phrased person invent security system clever cant think break attributes bruce schneier wrote anyone clueless amateur best cryptographer create algorithm cant break even hard hard creating algorithm one else break even years similar sentiments expressed others codebreakers david kahn states false ideas firmly gripped minds many intelligent men one tried could invent cipher one could break words secret writing july edgar allan poe stated persons made believe quite easy thing invent method secret writing shall baffle investigation yet may roundly asserted human ingenuity concoct cipher human ingenuity schneier also coined term kid sister cryptography writing preface applied two kinds cryptography world cryptography stop kid sister reading files cryptography stop major governments reading files schneier critical digital rights management drm said allows vendor increase proper implementation controlbased security user via trusted computing difficult security thing schneier insists owning data different way thinking schneier proponent full disclosure ie making security issues public researchers dont go public things get fixed companies dont see security problem see pr schneier said homeland security money spent intelligence investigation emergency defending broad threat terrorism generally better focusing specific potential terrorist according schneier analysis intelligence data difficult one better ways

credited coining term security theater describe changes fellow berkman center internet society harvard university schneier exploring intersection security technology people emphasis movieplot threat term schneier coined refers specific dramatic terrorist attack scenarios reminiscent behavior terrorists movies rather terrorists actually real security measures created protect movie plot threats provide higher level real security preparation pays terrorists choose one particular avenue attack may even feasible realworld terrorists would also likely notice highly specific security measures simply attack way specificity movie plot threats gives power public imagination however even extremely unrealistic security theater countermeasures may receive strong support public legislators among many examples movie plot threats schneier described banning baby carriers subways fear may contain starting april schneier annual contest create fantastic movieplot february last one mentioned contest may run schneier criticized security approaches try prevent malicious incursion instead arguing designing systems fail well designer system underestimate capabilities attacker technology may make possible future things possible kerckhoffss principle need one parts cryptographic system remain secret increases fragility system whether details system obscured depends upon availability persons make use information beneficial uses versus potential attackers misuse secrecy security arent even though may seem way bad security relies secrecy good security works even details schneier involved
