emitted dancing bees induce passive antennal movements stationary bees according coulombs law electrically charged flagella mechanoreceptor cells moved electric fields strongly sound electric fields

communication waggle defined von frisch tanzsprache german dance language information direction distance quality resource food nesting sites contained within waggle supporting evidence waggle dance

experiment honeybee apis mellifera individuals thoroughly followed waggle dance ignored resource direction location information instead foragers returned foraging areas previous knowledge bees follow waggle dance successfully forage without decoding dance language information several use word language may lead misrepresentations waggle dance swiss linguist ferdinand de saussure proposed system language sign made two chief components signifier physical phonetic representation sign signified conceptual dance language followed saussurian dyadic model semiotics signifier would waggle dance signified would location foraging resource though dance language may may follow sort pattern considered language syntactical grammar set waggle dance may less efficient thought bees observe waggle runs without successfully foraging others forage successfully observing likewise studies found honeybees rarely make use information communicated waggle dance seem ten percent conflict private information based upon individual experiences social information transmitted dance communication essentially foragers often prefer use remembered information previously rewarding food sites visited use information even receiving dance information new food sheds light fact following social information energetically costly foraging independently always using olfactory cues memory plentiful foraging sites honeybees able successfully forage independently without expending potentially extensive energy takes process execute directions communicated fellow foragers however foragers following waggle dances eventually switch using public information food location information provided waggle dancer private information longer waggle dance beneficial environments others provides plausible explanation information provided waggle dances used depending weather competitors food source characteristics transmitted information may quickly degrade become result foragers reported attached food sites continue revisit single patch many times become example waggle dance plays significantly larger role foraging food sources temperate habitats instance honey bee colonies routinely perform waggle dance still able successfully forage location information provided dance experimentally obscured tropical habitats however honey bee foraging severely impaired waggle dancing prevented difference thought due patchiness resources tropical environment versus homogeneity resources temperate environments tropics food resources come form flowering trees rich nectar scattered sparsely bloom briefly thus tropical zones information forage location might valuable temperate ancestors modern honeybees likely performed excitatory movements encourage nestmates forage excitatory movements include shaking zigzagging buzzing crashing nestmates similar behavior observed hymenoptera including stingless bees wasps bumblebees one promising theory evolution waggle dance first proposed martin lindauer waggle dance originally aided communication information new nest site rather spatial information foraging honeybees derived traits observed perform derived waggle dances honeybees categorized three main groups dwarf honeybees species giant honeybees species build single comb open nest site remaining species cavitynesting confirmed dwarf honey bees basal giant cavitynesting honey bees monophyletic waggle dances bee species varies different extents nesting behavior playing key role waggle dance traits example open nesting honeybee variety rely celestial cues orient dance cavitynesting bees able use gravity orient dances dark nests opennesting bees reason use gravity need perform dances dark cavitynesting bees incorporated sound element dances using vibration wings bees use acoustics aid signaling provide information distance direction quality foodnesting site suspected also evolved response cavitynesting bees perform waggle dance dark dance orientation evolved
