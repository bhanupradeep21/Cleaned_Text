contralateral organization forebrain latin side sided property hemispheres cerebrum thalamus represent mainly contralateral side body consequently left side forebrain mostly represents right side body right side brain primarily represents left side body contralateral organization involves executive sensory functions eg leftsided brain lesion may cause rightsided hemiplegia contralateral organization present vertebrates according current theory forebrain twisted long axis body left right sides also dorsal ventral sides interchanged see also anatomically contralateral organization manifested major decussations based upon latin notation ten deca uppercase x chiasmas greek uppercase letter χ chi decussation denotes crossing bundles axonal fibres inside central nervous system result decussations efferent connections cerebrum basal ganglia cerebellum spine crossed afferent connections spine cerebellum pons thalamus thus motor somatosensory auditory visual primary regions forebrain predominantly represent contralateral side body two cranial nerves show chiasmas chiasm optic tract ie cranial nerve ii originates eyes inserts optic tectum midbrain trochlear nerve ie cranial nerve iv originates ventral midbrain innervates one six muscles rotate eye ie superior oblique muscle although forebrain vertebrates shows contralateral organization contralaterality means complete exceptions worth mentioning according current understanding contralateral organization due axial twist explained number explanations published popular visual map theory explained short review existing hypotheses given popularscience video explains theories visual map theory axial twist theory formulated detail regarded scientific theories explained detail hypotheses tend explain specific aspect phenomenon one proposes crossing generally provides better geometrical according another view crossing coincidence conserved third hypothesis proposes crossing results directly optical inversion retina old notion first worked jacques loeb contralateral organisation might advantage motor simulations valentino braitenberg shown ipsi contralateral connections major importance studies asked functional advantage visual map theory published famous neuroscientist pioneer santiago ramón cajal see also english summaries according theory function optic chiasm repair retinal field image visual cortex pupil vertebrates eyes inverts image retina visual periphery projects medial side retina chiasmatic crossing visual periphery outside one assumes retinal map faithfully maintained throughout optic tract theory number example visual tracts spiral way thalamic lgn visual cortex see figure path known optic radiation result retinal map shows visual periphery medial side however central objective theory obtain precise faithful visual map medial field projecting medial sides visual cortex two twist hypotheses proposed independently axial twist de marc lussanet jan somatic twist marcel propose rostral part head including forebrain fact effectively completely turned around consequence left right brain reversed also anterior frontal posterior back occipital whereas somatic twist hypothesis focuses purely morphological phenomenon inversions forebrain axial twist theory also addresses development evolution also axial twist theory present theory produced predictions tested axial twist theory designed explain pattern contralateral decussations chiasms develops pattern evolutionarily known exceptions throughout million years vertebrate evolution according theory contralateral organization develops follows early embryo turned onto left side left turned yolk right turned away yolk asymmetric orientation compensated asymmetric growth regain superficial bilateral symmetry anterior head region turns left shown schema forebrain superficial structure intimately associated superficial body structures turns along anterior head structures later form eyes nostrils mouth body behind head compensates asymmetric body orientation opposite direction turning right see schema due oppositely directed compensations anterior head rest body animal becomes twisted optic tract grows retina optic tectum dorsal ventral inverted anterior head region tracts grow first toward ventral side meet midline form chiasma since optic tectum lies dorsal midbrain tract continues dorsally contralateral optic tectum heart bowels internal organs strong integration external body structures evolutionary pressure make turn similar way rather organs retain original asymmetric orientation body axial twist hypothesis predicts small asymmetries face brain well found opposite direction trunk remain adulthood confirmed idea somatic twist inspired dorsoventral inversion proposed marcel according dorsoventral inversion hypothesis ancestral deuterostome turned back result vertebrates dorsal nervous system whereas protostomes ventral one according somatic twist hypothesis entire animal turned back part ie everything behind eyes mouth nostrils including forebrain somatic twist hypothesis proposed improvement inversion hypothesis thus much wider explanatory power predecessor also complicated explains inversion body additionally contralateral forebrain explain however twist might develop vertebrate embryo address possible evolution axial twist theory defined independently two addition providing rationale inverted body contralateral forebrain explains heart bowels asymmetric moreover one three theories supported evidence embryological growth theory tested remarkable property contralateral organization present every vertebrate even distant clades agnathans possess optic even skull impressions early vertebrates ordovician show presence optic idea worked molecular evidence inversion hypothesis almost groups known however exactly selective pressure caused inversion twisting asymmetric development well known deuterostomes hemichordata echinodermata cephalochordata tunicata turning toward side upsidedown also occurs frequently clades eg sea stars turn mouth downwards larva briefly settled mouth turned adult lancelet buries obliquely mouth turned many fish tend turn around feeding water surface holoprosencephaly hemispheres cerebrum part aligned left right side frontal occipital sides skull head usually remains small according axial twist hypothesis represents extreme case yakovlevian may occur cerebrum turn early embryology cephalopagus janiceps twins conjoined twins born two faces one either side head twins two brains two spinal cords located left right side according axial twist hypothesis two nervous systems could turn due complex configuration body therefore remained either httpsenwikipediaorgwikicontralateralbrain
