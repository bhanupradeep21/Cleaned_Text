testicular difference sex development dsd sex reversal nonsyndromic testicular dsd xx sex percent individuals syndrome caused chromosomes sry gene triggers male reproductive development atypically

condition called srypositive testicular disorder sex percent xx testicular disorder sex development sry gene form condition called srynegative testicular disorder sex development cause disorder individuals often unknown although changes affecting genes identified individuals srynegative testicular disorder sex development likely ambiguous genitalia people srypositive exact cause condition unknown proposed mutations gene may contribute syndrome since plays role testes differentiation another proposed cause mutations gene encodes nuclear hormone represses masculinizing genes therefore loss function testes develop xx mutations genes also studied connection srynegative xx male cases individual evaluated ambiguous genitalia small phallus hypospadias labioscrotal folds exploratory

hybridization genital ambiguities necessary treat medical reasons treated hormonal therapy surgery since xx male syndrome variable presentation specifics treatment varies widely well cases gonadal surgery performed remove partial whole female genitalia may followed plastic reconstructive surgery make individual appear externally conversely individual may wish become feminine feminizing genitoplasty performed make ambiguous genitalia appear hormonal therapy may also aid making individual appear male puberty affected individuals require treatment male sex hormone testosterone induce
