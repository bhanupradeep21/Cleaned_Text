epidural hematoma bleeding occurs tough outer membrane covering brain dura mater often loss consciousness following head injury brief regaining consciousness loss consciousness symptoms may include headache confusion vomiting inability move parts complications may include cause typically head injury results break temporal bone bleeding middle meningeal occasionally occur result bleeding disorder blood vessel diagnosis typically ct scan condition occurs spine known spinal epidural treatment generally urgent surgery form craniotomy burr without treatment death typically condition occurs one four percent head typically occurs young males often affected many people epidural hematomas experience lucid period immediately following injury delay symptoms become initial period lucidity called

caused accelerationdeceleration trauma transverse epidural hematoma commonly results blow side temporal bone head pterion region overlies middle meningeal artery relatively weak prone epidural hematomas occur outside region temporal brain may injured prominences inside skull scrapes past epidural hematoma usually found side brain impacted blow rare occasions due contrecoup heat hematoma epidural hematoma caused severe thermal burn causing contraction exfoliation dura mater exfoliate skull turn causing exudation blood venous hematoma seen autopsy brick red radiolucent ct scan heatinduced coagulation break temporal bone causes bleeding middle meningeal artery hence epidural bleeding often rapid arteries highpressure flow cases however comes veins progress venous hematoma may acute occurring within day injury appearing swirling mass blood without clot subacute occurring days appearing solid chronic occurring days appearing mixed adults temporal region accounts cases children however occur similar frequency occipital frontal posterior fossa epidural bleeds arteries grow reach peak size hours postinjury spilling cubic centimeters blood intracranial hematoma expands strips dura inside skull causing intense headache also increases intracranial pressure causing brain shift lose blood supply crushed skull herniate larger hematomas cause damage epidural bleeds quickly compress brainstem causing unconsciousness abnormal posturing abnormal pupil responses diagnosis typically ct scan mris greater sensitivity used high suspicion epidural hematoma negative ct differential diagnoses include transient ischemic attack intracranial mass brain epidural hematomas usually appear convex shape expansion stops skulls sutures dura mater tightly attached skull thus expand inward toward brain rather along inside skull occurs subdural hematomas people also skull epidural hematomas may occur combination subdural hematomas either may occur ct scans reveal subdural
