chaining type intervention aims create associations behaviors behavior behavior chain sequence behaviors happen particular order outcome previous step chain serves signal begin next step chain terms behavior analysis behavior chain begun discriminative stimulus sd sets occasion behavior outcome behavior serves reinforcer completing previous step another sd complete next step sequence repeats last step chain completed terminal reinforcer outcome behavior chain ie brushing ones teeth terminal reinforcer clean teeth achieved example chain brushing ones teeth starts seeing toothbrush sets occasion get toothpaste leads putting ones brush brushing sides front mouth spitting toothpaste rinsing ones mouth finally putting away ones toothbrush outline behavior chains done example task analysis used chaining used teach complex behaviors made behavior chains current learner repertoire various steps chain learner repertoire steps learner know category instead issue knowing skill issue compliance three different types chaining used forward chaining backward chaining total task chaining confused task analysis forward chaining procedure behavior chain learned completed teaching steps chronological order using prompting fading teacher teaches first step presenting distinctive stimulus complete first step chain teacher prompts remaining steps chain learner consistently completing first step without prompting teacher complete first second step prompts learner remaining steps learner able complete entire chain independently reinforcement delivered completion step although attain terminal reinforcer outcome behavior chain prompted remaining steps backward chaining process forward chaining starts last step backward chaining procedure typically used people limited abilities process uses prompting fading techniques teach last step first biggest benefit using backward chain learner receives terminal reinforcer outcome behavior chain naturally backward chaining preferred method teaching skills individuals severe delays complete last step see direct outcome chain immediately rather prompted remaining steps receive reinforcement teacher begins prompting learner entire chain starting last behavior teacher repeats learner perform last step without prompting upon distinctive stimulus presented learner complete last step consistently second last step taught continuing prompts steps teacher repeats procedure teaching next step prompting remaining ones learner perform achieve steps without httpsenwikipediaorgwikichaining
