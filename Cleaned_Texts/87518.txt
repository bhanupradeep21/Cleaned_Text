definitive triassic pterosaurs southern hemisphere along contemporaneous related pachagnathus small crested pterosaur although small size may due immaturity also one known continental triassic pterosaurs indicating absence early pterosaurs southern hemisphere terrestrial environments likely sampling bias true absence type known specimen yelaphomte pvsj collected fieldwork museo de ciencias naturales universidad nacional de san juan consists fragment rostrum preserving anterior part maxillae palatines anterior border naris well posterior portion premaxillae preserved three dimensions undistorted first reported martínez et al although time specimen fully prepared could identified anything diagnostic indeterminate pterosaur pvsj later fully described named martínez et al new genus

premaxillae similarly fused sport part prominent crest running along top snout narrow bony crest tall thin resembling related raeticodactylus austriadactylus although edges crest broken size definitively determined thickness preserved portion low degree tapering suggests much taller longer preserved crest ornamented series wellspaced radiating grooves side similar ornamentations radial striations found crests raeticodactylus austriadactylus well unlike yelaphomte possess closely packed alternating ridges grooves ornamentation pattern yelaphomte unique amongst broken snout tip ct scanning revealed extensive pneumatic spaces premaxilla separated intricate struts bony trabeculae trabeculae symmetrical two along midline four laterally breakage air spaces converge three cavities back single large deep chamber ahead narial opening pneumatic bones characteristic pterosaurs general complex array trabeculae suggests even greater degree pneumatisation yelaphomte cheek teeth poorly preserved roots left tooth sockets like eopterosaur teeth closely spaced less tooth width apart evenly distributed positioned vertically without splaying side however unusually tooth roots angled roughly jaw margin suggesting cheek teeth angled forwards procumbent differs straight upright cheek teeth eopterosaurs well procumbent splayed teeth uncertain tooth crowns procumbent roots front cheek teeth large toothless gap diastema extending front maxilla feature shares raeticodactylus yelaphomte diastema notably larger longer space occupied four spaced cheek determine relationships yelaphomte pterosaurs martínez colleagues performed phylogenetic analysis using updated version pterosaur data matrix published andres et al analysis recovered yelaphomte member raeticodactylidae couldnt resolve relationships raeticodactylus pachagnathus beyond polytomy three species due lack overlapping material simplified version results focused eopterosauria shown cladogram macronychoptera austriadactylus cristatus preondactylus buffarinii peteinosaurus zambellii caviramus schesaplanensis pachagnathus benitoi raeticodactylus filisurensis yelaphomte praderioi seazzadactylus venieri eudimorphodon cromptonellus eudimorphodon rosenfeldi eudimorphodon ranzii additional analysis using diapsid reptile data matrix ezcurra et al also used confirm inclusion yelaphomte within pterosaurs broadly analysis found yelaphomte essentially position andres et al dataset polytomy raeticodactylus carniadactylus although diagnostic traits raeticodactylidae present known material yelaphomte close relationship raeticodactylus supported evenly spaced teeth well similarities crest presence small size yelaphomte suggests specimen could belong immature individual consequently differences contemporary raeticodactylid pachagnathus could due ontogeny however martínez colleagues concluded unlikely high degree fusion snout may indicative maturity suggests small adult note rostrum mandible bones pterosaurs fuse young yelaphomte lived continental environment long distance nearest coast therefore almost certainly terrestrial animal compared various coastal triassic pterosaurs found northern hemisphere corroborates hypotheses significant parts early pterosaur evolution may taken place terrestrial quebrada del barro formation also produced remains related larger pterosaur
