benzoyl peroxide chemical compound specifically organic peroxide structural formula often abbreviated terms structure molecule described two benzoyl bz groups connected peroxide white granular solid faint odour benzaldehyde poorly soluble water soluble acetone ethanol many organic solvents benzoyl peroxide oxidizer principally used production benzoyl peroxide first prepared described liebig original synthesis liebig reacted benzoyl chloride barium reaction probably follows equation benzoyl peroxide usually prepared treating hydrogen peroxide benzoyl chloride alkaline conditions bond peroxides weak thus benzoyl peroxide readily undergoes homolysis symmetrical fission forming free radicals symbol indicates products radicals ie contain least one unpaired electron species highly reactive homolysis usually induced heating halflife benzoyl peroxide one hour halflife one j h kastle graduate student loevenhart observed compound made tincture guaiacum tincture turn blue sign oxygen around loevenhart reported successful use bpo treat various skin conditions including burns chronic varicose leg tumors tinea sycosis also reported animal experiments showed relatively low toxicity treatment benzoyl peroxide proposed wounds lyon reynolds sycosis vulgaris acne varioliformis peck chagrin however preparations often questionable officially approved treatment acne us benzoyl peroxide mainly used radical initiator induce chaingrowth polymerization polyester polymethyl methacrylate pmma resins dental cements important among various organic peroxides used purpose relatively safe alternative much hazardous methyl ethyl ketone also used rubber curing finishing agent acetate benzoyl peroxide effective treating acne lesions induce antibiotic may combined salicylic acid

combined benzoyl unlike tezarotene tretinoin combination products benzoyl peroxideclindamycin benzoyl peroxidesalicylic acid appear slightly effective benzoyl peroxide alone treatment acne combination tretinoinbenzoyl peroxide approved medical use united states benzoyl peroxide acne treatment typically applied affected areas gel cream liquid concentrations increasing strong evidence supports idea higher concentrations benzoyl peroxide effective lower classically benzoyl peroxide thought threefold activity treating acne sebostatic comedolytic inhibits growth cutibacterium acnes main bacterium associated general acne vulgaris hormonemediated inflammation sebaceous glands hair follicles hormone changes cause increase keratin sebum production leading blocked drainage c acnes many lytic enzymes break proteins lipids sebum leading inflammatory response freeradical reaction benzoyl peroxide break keratin therefore unblocking drainage sebum comedolytic cause nonspecific peroxidation c acnes making thought decrease sebum production disagreement exists within literature evidence suggests benzoyl peroxide antiinflammatory effect well micromolar concentrations prevents neutrophils releasing reactive oxygen species part inflammatory response application benzoyl peroxide skin may result redness burning irritation side effect possible side effects recommended start low concentration build appropriate skin gradually develops tolerance medication skin sensitivity typically resolves weeks continuous irritation also reduced avoiding harsh facial cleansers wearing sunscreen prior sun one people experience hypersensitivity bpo liable experience burning itching crusting possibly onethird people experience phototoxicity exposure ultraviolet uvb us typical concentration benzoyl peroxide prescription overthecounter drug preparations used treatment acne benzoyl peroxide used dentistry tooth whitening product benzoyl peroxide potentially like organic peroxides cause fires without external ignition hazard acute pure material compound generally used solution paste example cosmetics contain small percentage benzoyl peroxide pose explosion risk
