management ulcerative colitis involves first treating acute symptoms disease maintaining remission ulcerative colitis form colitis disease intestine specifically large intestine colon includes characteristic ulcers open sores colon main symptom active disease usually diarrhea mixed blood gradual onset often leads anaemia ulcerative colitis however systemic disease affects many parts body outside intestine standard treatment ulcerative colitis depends extent involvement disease severity goal induce remission initially medications followed administration maintenance medications prevent relapse disease concept induction remission maintenance remission important medications used induce maintain remission somewhat overlap treatments different physicians first direct treatment inducing remission involves relief symptoms mucosal healing lining colon longerterm treatment maintain remission anaemia caused chronic blood loss gastrointestinal tract reduced absorption due upregulation hepcidin also treated often requires use parenteral following sections sorted first drug type second type ulcerative colitis aminosalicylates main antiinflammatory drugs used treat ulcerative colitis sometimes remission achieved least maintained drugs alone usually used combination drugs listed ensuing sections antiinflammatory action drugs produced acid active ingredient mesalazine produced drugs intestine aminosalicylates used treat ulcerative colitis include following poorlyabsorbed intestines hence provides topical relief within intestine therefore nonsystemic drug related systemic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids aspirin ibuprofen free radical induction theory discussed proposes serving antiinflammatory agent also free radical trap destroying hydroxyl radicals may damage colonic epithelial may also inhibitor tnf possible side effects include nausea vomiting reduced sperm count damage red white blood cells liver kidneys pancreas nerves hearing allergic reactions sulfasalazine characterized dizziness fever skin rash reported small percentage patients cases sulfasalazine exacerbate ulcerative colitis resulting diarrhea abdominal cramps discomfort intestine

supplementation mgday µgday maintain normal cell division may however counterproductive patients also taking methotrexate folic acid inhibitor folic acid might also counterproductive patients taking related drugs inhibit cell division often necessary use corticosteroids conjunction drugs bring remission ulcerative colitis thereafter may possible maintain remission alone though many patients require stronger immunosuppressive medications corticosteroids used longterm therapy uc particularly without concomitant use immunomodulator corticosteroids reduce inflammation blocking portions leukocyte adhesion cascade results inflammation side effects corticosteroids include cushings syndrome often exhibits temporary facial puffiness called moon face cushings syndrome however involve psychosis including manic behavior drugs known trigger bipolar disorder prescribing drugs might well inquire family history bipolar disorder corticosteroids confused anabolic steroids controversial performancebuilding steroids banned certain sports following corticosteroids used immune system suppressants treatment ulcerative colitis immunosuppressive drugs inhibit immune system generally include cytostatic drugs inhibit cell division including cloning white blood cells part immune response immunosuppressive drugs used ulcerative colitis include mercaptopurine cytostatic drug antimetabolite mercaptopurine molecule mimics purine necessary synthesis dna mercaptopurine present cells able make dna cell division inhibited administering mercaptopurine necessary monitor levels mercaptopurine metabolites blood establish correct dosage patient initial concern hepatotoxicity mercaptopurine inhibits production white blood cells generally makes body susceptible infection patients need watch infections vaccinations critically important particularly yearly flu shot periodic pneumonia immunizations vaccine response best given prior initiation immunosuppressive medications patients immunosuppressives use caution receiving vaccines containing live virus frequent blood cell counts also recommended administration mercaptopurine drug may toxic bone marrow many blood components made abnormally large drop white blood cell count blood cell count administration drug halted least temporarily methotrexate another immunosuppressive drug works inhibiting folic acid necessary dna replication therefore cell division tnf protein released activated white blood cells triggering inflammation immune system response damage mucosa colon immune activation certain drugs inhibit tnf hence reducing inflammation immune system involvement infliximab approved fda treating ulcerative colitis march usually given intravenous infusions weeks every eight weeks thereafter

curedeliminated surgically removing diseased portions intestine reconnecting healthy ends ulcerative colitis generally cured surgical removal large intestine surgical removal large intestine get rid extraintestinal symptoms procedure necessary event exsanguinating hemorrhage frank perforation documented strongly suspected carcinoma surgery also indicated patients severe colitis toxic megacolon patients symptoms disabling respond drugs may wish consider whether surgery would improve quality life depending type surgery performed patient may still require periodic lower endoscopies assess pouch dysplasia ulcerative colitis disease affects many parts body outside intestinal tract rare cases extraintestinal manifestations disease may require removal cochrane review controlled trials using various probiotics found lowcertainty evidence probiotic supplements may increase probability clinical remission people receiving probiotics likely experience disease remission likely report improvement symptoms compared receiving placebo clear difference minor serious adverse effects clear evidence greater remission probiotic supplements compared acid treatment monotherapy likelihood remission higher probiotics used combination acid therapy currently unclear whether probiotics help prevent future relapse people stable disease activity either monotherapy combination therapy good evidence dietary interventions impact ulcerative free radical induction theory suggests initial cause ulcerative colitis may metabolic defect allows buildup chemicals related hydrogen peroxide beneath
