articulated atlasaxis james englehorn huskerpeton englehorni namesake spent countless hours preparing specimen well many others unsm dmnh collections upon discovery specimen unsm categorized tuditanomorpha based three characteristics postfrontal postorbital similar sizes contact large tabular parietals frontals nasals also similar compared conservative tuditanids lacks posterior flare squamosal gymnathrids lacks bulbous teeth posterior gymnarthids usnm closely resembles type specimen eurodyus bonneri based basic skull morphology dentition however carrol et al questioned viability placement genus euryodus shares couple diagnostic characteristics gymnathrids huttenlocker et al noted tentatively place specimen unsm within family gymnarthridae although research necessary time make accurate placement phylogenetic analysis huttenlocker et al shows two major groups within recumbirostra one group consists pantylids brachystelechids rhynchonkos second includes ostodolepids
