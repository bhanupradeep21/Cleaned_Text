feathers integumentary structures filaments related affinities therizinosaurs originally obscure often problematic giving rise taxonomic debate since feature similar adaptations unrelated sauropodomorphs ornithischians description beipiaosaurus helped assemble definitive placement therizinosaurs within theropoda especially maniraptorans thanks numerous theropod features irrefutable feather impressions beipiaosaurus first assigned therizinosauroidea primitive position xu et al subsequent phylogenetic analyses confirmed assignment according definition paul sereno group

beipiaosaurus specimen stm exposing skin flakes electron microscope found corneocytes cells rich keratin order make comparisons extant feathered dinosaurs analyzed several bird taxa anas lonchura taeniopygia found similar cell structures fossil dinosaur corneocytes densely packed keratin lacking lipids fat suggesting beipiaosaurus coanalyzed taxa get warm modern birds mainly grounddwelling animals able fly case primitive birds confuciusornis could fly long periods modern birds structures addition fats help regulate body temperature active addition identified corneocytes structures seem indicate nonavian dinosaurs similar way shedding skin extant birds mammals unlike many reptiles alive today lizards snakes shed skin single piece several large pieces beipiaosaurus nonavian dinosaurs shed skin dandruff like confuciusornis modern birds studies suggest paleoenvironment yixian formation involved seasonal climate fluctuations warm humid punctuated dry seasons environment became average yearly temperature time beipiaosaurus relatively cold winters generally warm mesozoic study wu et al concluded orbital forcing effect climate caused shifts tilt earths axis shape earths orbit
