synkinesis neurological symptom voluntary muscle movement causes simultaneous involuntary contraction muscles example might smiling inducing involuntary contraction eye muscles causing person squint smiling facial extraocular muscles affected often rare cases persons hands might perform mirror movements synkinesis usually caused dysfunction particular nerve potential causes include improper healing nerve trauma neurodegeneration occurs parkinsons disease congenital cases mutations genes involved nerve growth specifically axonal growth found rarely occurs part syndromes neuroendocrine problems kallman syndrome prognosis usually good normal intelligence lifespan treatment depends cause largely conservative facial retraining mime therapy needed botox surgery used last resort cases involve cranial nerves innervate many small cranial muscles facial muscles extraocular muscles contrast areas body miswiring larger muscles less evident due size muscles synkinesis also involve upper limbs especially hands quite rare case cases nerves improperly regenerate glands lacrimal glands leading condition known crocodile tears bogorads syndrome facial synkinesis common sequela idiopathic facial nerve paralysis also called bells palsy facial bells palsy thought occur due viral reactivation lead unknown mechanisms diffuse axon demyelination degeneration seventh cranial nerve results hemifacial paralysis due nonfunctionality nerve nerve attempts recover nerve miswiring results see mechanism action patients severe facial nerve paralysis facial synkinesis frequently additionally common treatment option facial palsy use electrical stimulation unfortunately shown disruptive normal reinnervation promote development common symptoms facial synkinesis six muscles around eye extraocular muscles innervated three different cranial nerves abducens nerve trochlear nerve oculomotor nerve nerve trauma around eye combination two three cranial nerves shown involved extraocular synkinesis moreover abducens trochlear nerve innervate one specific muscle oculomotor nerve many functions including eyelid retraction pupil constriction thus synkinesis one functions may involved examples include less common variations synkinesis involving cranial nerves include bimanual synkinesis occurs left right upper limbs especially hands fingers execute exactly movement even though one hand intentionally moved also called mirror hand movements persists throughout life occurs without associated signs symptoms associated normal intelligence lifespan also develop course parkinsons association abnormalities mirror hand movements hallmark kallmann syndrome genetic mutations associated congenital mirror hand movements dcc gene gene account percent dcc mutation impaired missing netrin receptor protein impairs control axon growth nervous system almost cases synkinesis develop sequel nerve trauma exception congenitally acquired duaneretraction syndrome marcus gunn phenomenon trauma nerve induced cases surgical procedures nerve inflammation physical three proposed mechanisms synkinesis aberrant nerve regeneration interneuronal ephaptic transmission nuclear hyperexcitability aberrant nerve regeneration hypothesis widely accepted mechanism hypothesis states trauma axons project facial nucleus incorrect peripheral muscle groups aberrant branches simultaneously innervate different subdivisions facial example compression facial nerve causes lesion set axons innervates orbicularis oris mouth muscle degenerate compression relieved regeneration axons lesion site begins time though set axons innervate orbicularis oris successfully reinnervate original site half aberrantly branched innervated orbicularis oculieye muscle thus patient purses lips ipsilateral eye squint hypothesis assumes disorganized regeneration occurs site lesion contrary recent research choi provided thorough understanding synkinesis aberrant axonal regeneration study shown regenerating axons become disorganized throughout length nerve site lesion previously many developed treatment strategies inevitably failed invented based original hypothesis focusing lesion site improving organization regeneration new modification hypothesis could allow better success developing treatments ephaptic transmission two nerves communicate via artificial synapse nerves healthy peripheral nerves insulated myelin sheath helps enhance electric transmission prevent crosstalk parallel nerves lesion observed regenerating nerves might myelinated effectively consequently two nerve fibers come contact provide means impulse directly conducted nerve membrane analogy two uninsulated electrical wires placed adjacent thus two nerves able crosstalk send action potentials basis hypothesis follows lesion axonal degeneration via wallerian degeneration occurs postsynaptic cell consequently becomes deprived input becomes sensitive neurotransmitters eg creating additional receptors subsequently nearby residual undamaged axons provide source neurotransmitter deprived postsynaptic cell since postsynaptic cell hypersensitive neurotransmitters reach axon another nerve successfully provide stimulation consequently creates undesired peripheral movement ie although three mechanisms argued various ways become accepted synkinesis develops combination mechanisms may clinical scale measure synkinesis study led mehta et validated use newly designed instrument evaluate facial synkinesis called synkinesis assessment questionnaire saq instrument consisting nine questions found reliable valid addition simple easy administer inexpensive analyses allow treatment options evaluated experimental research treatment mostly focused facial synkinesis due abundant prevalence compared extraocular synkinesis additionally since extraocular muscles hidden within orbits limit type practical treatments established eg massage treatments synkinesis general include facial retraining biofeedback mime therapy botox surgery last resort facial retraining therapy builds upon idea neurons constantly dynamic state words constant growth regression neuronal projections dependent stimuli produced reduce synkinesis facial retraining teaches patient techniques increasing wanted movements focusing restricting unwanted movement example mouth moves whenever eyes blink voluntarily facial retraining techniques teach patient slowly close eyes actively focusing keeping mouth muscles still facial retraining shown successful almost average decrease synkinesis reported biofeedback therapy facial synkinesis aims increase patients awareness facial muscle posture movement facial muscles contain none intrinsic muscle sensory receptors used proprioceptive feedback additionally span movable joints lack joint receptors another source proprioceptive thus biofeedback allows patient actively sense motion muscles two common forms biofeedback used electromyographic feedback mirror feedback electromyographic feedback includes visual emg signals coming facial muscle sites displayed patient computer form waveform traces auditory signals indicate strength muscle subsequent role patient control movement undesired muscle volitional movement incorporating information perceived emg mirror feedback much basic way providing patient feedback muscle movement studies shown effective options synkinesisparesis biofeedback commonly coupled facial retraining techniques achieve maximal effectiveness study nakamura et al shown biofeedback works better prevention synkinesis opposed treatment synkinesis due extreme efforts needed achieve improvements synkinesis nakamura et al observed patients often fail reach desired goal difficulty maintaining motivation training desired course action catch patient shortly facial nerve trauma teach patient biofeedback techniques course action experimentally proven significantly reduce development mime therapy introduced netherlands initially designed treat facial palsy improving symmetry face rest movement later observed people postfacial palsy synkinesis also benefited therapy wasnt beurskens heymans able experimentally conclude mime therapy indeed good treatment choice synkinesis furthermore later studies beurskens et al shown benefits obtained mime therapy stable one year current mime therapy consists combination procedures designed promote symmetry face rest movement control synkinesis components include massage stretching exercises exercises coordinate halves face overall aim mime therapy develop conscious connection use facial muscles emotional expression facial retraining therapy focused treating slight synkinetic movements mime therapy aims increase overall vigor muscles active exercises process teaching face decrease unwanted synkinetic movements botox botulinum toxin new versatile tool treatment synkinesis initially used reducing hyperkinesis facial botox later attempted patients postfacial palsy synkinesis reduce unwanted movements effects botox shown remarkable synkinetic symptoms disappearing within days common treatment targets orbicularis oculi depressor anguli oris dao mentalis platysma contralateral depressor labii inferioris due short span botox effects though patients must come back doctor reinjection approximately every months notable majority patients various synkinetic movements completely disappeared sessions trimonthly botox specific synkinesis crocodile tears syndrome hyperlacrimation upon eating shown respond exceedingly well botox injection botox injected directly lacrimal gland shown reduce hyperlacrimation within hours procedure shown simple safe little chance sideeffects although rare occasions ptosis occur due botulinum toxin furthermore reduction hyperlacrimation shown last longer expected months since botox mimic facial paralysis optimized dose determined reduces involuntary synkinesis muscle affecting muscle practical surgical procedures used treating synkinesis neurolysis selective myectomy neurolysis shown effective relieving synkinesis temporarily unfortunately symptoms return much worse selective myectomy synkinetic muscle selectively resected much effective technique provide permanent relief results low recurrence rate postoperative complications may include edema hematoma disease
