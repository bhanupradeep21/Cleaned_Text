indeterminate member therocephalia suborder within theriodont group ericiolacerta would much common cynodonts gave rise mammals theriodonts gorgonopsids evidence suggested therocephalia may represent polyphyletic group species closely related cynodonts others uniting clade called eutheriodontia modern studies however consider therocephalia monophyletic group ericiolacerta shared many traits common basal theriodonts well mammals small size similar cynodonts may imply burrowing lifestyle unlike therocephalians possessed secondary palate may aided breathing eating skull also possessed wide slender zygomatic arches postorbitals failed connect zygoma features also present derived cynodonts likely aided muscle attachment conversely unlike theriodonts ericiolacerta possess free upstanding coronoid process dentary would also aided connecting muscle also experience reduction lumbar ribs seen members cynodontia hypothesized evolved increase aerobic capacity would suggest like basal theriodonts ericiolacerta possess transverse holotype fossil described watson sternum partially exposed making determining ericiolacerta evolved segmented sternebrae seen gorgonopsians synapomorphy linked evolutionary developments locomotion respiration towards mammaliantype combined long length limbs relative size implies ericiolacerta sprawling stance reptilian gait derived little holes snout area
