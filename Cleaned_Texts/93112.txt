facial expression one motions positions muscles beneath skin face according one set controversial theories movements convey emotional state individual observers facial expressions form nonverbal communication primary means conveying social information humans also occur mammals animal species discussion controversies claims see russell fernandez humans adopt facial expression voluntarily involuntarily neural mechanisms responsible controlling expression differ case voluntary facial expressions often socially conditioned follow cortical route brain conversely involuntary facial expressions believed innate follow subcortical route brain facial recognition emotional experience brain amygdala highly involved recognition process amygdala integrative center emotions emotional behavior motivation eyes often viewed important features facial expressions aspects blinking rate possibly used indicate whether person nervous whether lying also eye contact considered important aspect interpersonal communication however cultural differences regarding social propriety maintaining eye contact beyond accessory nature facial expressions spoken communication people play significant role communication sign language many phrases sign language include facial expressions display controversy surrounding question whether facial expressions worldwide universal display among humans supporters universality hypothesis claim many facial expressions innate roots evolutionary ancestors opponents view question accuracy studies used test claim instead believe facial expressions conditioned people view understand facial expressions large part social situations around moreover facial expressions strong connection personal psychology psychologists ability discern hidden meaning persons facial expressionclarification needed study emotion residue found even study participants attempted make neutral facial expressions faces still retained emotion residue prior expressions prior expressions able detected one experiment investigated influence gaze direction facial expression face memory participants shown set unfamiliar faces either happy angry facial expressions either gazing straight ahead gaze averted one side memory faces initially shown angry expressions found poorer faces averted opposed direct gaze whereas memory individuals shown happy faces unaffected gaze direction suggested memory another individuals face partly depends evaluation behavioural intention facial expressions vital social communication humans caused movement muscles connect skin fascia face muscles move skin creating lines folds causing movement facial features mouth eyebrows muscles develop second pharyngeal arch embryo temporalis masseter internal external pterygoid muscles mainly used chewing minor effect expression well muscles develop first pharyngeal two brain pathways associated facial expression first voluntary expression voluntary expression travels primary motor cortex pyramidal tract specifically corticobulbar projections cortex associated display rules emotion social precepts influence modify expressions cortically related expressions made second type expression emotional expressions originate extrapyramidal motor system involves subcortical nuclei reason genuine emotions associated cortex often displayed unconsciously demonstrated infants age two display distress disgust interest anger contempt surprise fear infants displays emotions indicate cortically related similarly blind children also display emotions proving subconscious rather learned subcortical facial expressions include knit brow concentration raised eyebrows listening attentively short punctuation expressions add emphasis speech people unaware producing lower portions face controlled opposite cerebral hemisphere causing asymmetric facial expression right hemisphere specialised emotional expression emotions strongly expressed left side particularly negative asymmetries expression seen chimeric faces facial portraits made combining left right halves faces different also portraits often show left emotional side face amygdala plays important role facial recognition functional imaging studies found shown pictures faces large increase activity amygdala amygdala receives visual information thalamus via subcortical amygdala may also significant role recognition fear negative emotions believed emotion disgust recognized activation insula basal ganglia recognition emotion may also utilize occipitotemporal neocortex orbitofrontal cortex right frontoparietal anything though shapes childs cognitive ability detect facial expression exposed time birth infant exposed different faces expressions able recognize emotions mimic infants exposed array emotional expressions

angry male faces happy female faces recognizable compared happy male faces angry female persons face especially eyes creates obvious immediate cues lead formation impressions article discusses eyes facial expressions effect interpersonal communication persons eyes reveal much feeling thinking blink rate reveal nervous ease person may research boston college professor joe tecce suggests stress levels revealed blink rates supports data statistics relation blink rates presidential candidates success races tecce claims faster blinker presidential debates lost every election since though tecces data interesting important recognize nonverbal communication multichanneled focusing one aspect reckless nervousness also measured examining candidates perspiration eye contact within first year infants learn rapidly looking behaviors others convey significant information infants prefer look faces engage mutual gaze early age healthy babies show enhanced neural processing direct eye contact another major aspect facial communication hypothesized due infancy humans one mammals maintain regular eye contact mother eye contact serves variety purposes regulates conversations shows interest involvement establishes connection others different cultures different rules eye contact certain asian cultures perceive direct eye contact way signal competitiveness many situations may prove inappropriate others lower eyes signal respect similarly eye contact avoided however western cultures could misinterpreted lacking selfconfidence even beyond idea eye contact eyes communicate data person even consciously expresses pupil dilation significant cue level excitement pleasure attraction dilated pupils indicate greater affection attraction constricted pupils send colder signal facial expression used sign languages convey specific meanings american sign language asl instance raised eyebrows combined slightly forward head tilt indicate signed question lowered eyebrows used whword questions facial expression also used sign languages show adverbs adjectives distance size open mouth squinted eyes tilted back head indicate something far mouth pulled one side cheek held toward shoulder indicate something close puffed cheeks mean large also show manner something done carelessly expressions also called nonmanual signs used similarly different sign languages others different one language another example expression used carelessly asl means boring unpleasant british sign universality hypothesis assumption certain facial expressions facerelated acts events signals specific emotions happiness laughter smiling sadness tears anger clenched jaw fear grimace gurn surprise raised eyebrows wide eyes along slight retraction ears disgust wrinkled nose squinted frequently lack social component like shame pride jealousy envy deference etc recognized people regardless culture language time belief evolutionary basis kinds facial expressions traced back darwins expression emotions man animals reviews universality hypothesis work nelson jack et especially critical ekmans work facial expressions starting point work psychologist silvan tomkins ekman showed facial expressions emotion culturally determined universal across human cultures demonstrate universality hypothesis ekman ran test group south fore people new guinea preindustrial culture isolated west experiment participants told brief stories emotional events happiness sadness anger fear surprise disgust story asked select matching facial expression array three fore selected correct face trials difficulty distinguishing fear face surprise face children selected array two faces results similar adults subsequent crosscultural studies found similar sides debate agree face expresses emotion controversy surrounds uncertainty specific emotional information read facial expression opponents universality hypothesis believe general information pieced together contextual information order determine person one argument evidence presented support universality hypothesis method typically used demonstrate universality inflates recognition although factor may contribute small amount inflation combined produce exaggerated scores three main factors following darwin argued expression emotions evolved humans animal ancestors would used similar methods expression darwin believed expressions unlearned innate human nature therefore evolutionarily significant survival compiled supporting evidence research different cultures infants animal ekman found people different cultures recognized certain facial expressions despite vast cultural differences findings tended confirm darwins initial crosscultural studies shown similarities way emotions expressed across diverse cultures studies even shown similarities species emotions expressed research shown chimpanzees able communicate many facial expressions humans complex movements facial muscles fact facial cues similar ekmans facial action coding system could applied chimps evaluating course differences species physical facial properties white sclera everted lips chimps would mean expressions could similarly darwin observed infants method expression certain emotions instinctive able display emotional expressions yet facial morphology impacts expression recognition important ways therefore infant facial morphology may also serve specific communicative function similarities morphology movement important correct interpretation darwin particularly interested functions facial expression evolutionarily important survival looked functions facial expression terms utility expression life animal terms specific expressions within species darwin deduced animals communicated feelings different emotional states specific facial expressions concluded communication important survival animals groupdwelling species skill effectively communicate interpret another animals feelings behaviors would principal trait naturally fit however suggests solitary species orangutans would exhibit expressions httpsenwikipediaorgwikifacialexpression
