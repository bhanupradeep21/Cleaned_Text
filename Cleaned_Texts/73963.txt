selfdeception process denying rationalizing away relevance significance importance opposing evidence logical argument selfdeception involves convincing oneself truth lack truth one reveal selfknowledge deception freudian analysis conscious unconscious minds dominated field psychological scientists became curious two seemingly separate worlds could work lack mechanistic models available line research led debate unresolved later focus shifted visionrelated research social traditional paradigm selfdeception modeled interpersonal deception intentionally gets b believe proposition p knowing believing truly deception intentional requires deceiver know believe deceived believe p traditional mode selfdeceivers must hold contradictory beliefs intentionally get hold belief know believe truly process rationalization however obscure intent selfdeception brian mclaughlin illustrates rationalizations certain circumstances permit phenomenon person disbelieves p intentionally tries make believe continue believing p engaging activities result unintentionally misleads believing continuing believe p via biased thinking deceives way appropriate selfdeception deceitful intention required selfdeception calls question nature individual specifically psychological context nature self irrationality foundation argued paradoxes selfdeception stem arguedby everyone special talents capacities however rationalization influenced myriad factors including socialization personal biases fear cognitive repression rationalization manipulated positive negative fashions convincing one perceive negative situation optimistically vice versa contrast rationalization alone effectively clarify dynamics selfdeception reason one adaptive form mental processes works philosopher alfred r mele provided insight prominent paradoxes regarding selfdeception two paradoxes include selfdeceivers state mind dynamics selfdeception coined static paradox dynamicstrategic paradox respectively mele formulates example static paradox following ever person deceives person b believing something p true knows truly believes p false causing b believe p true deceives ie believing p true knows truly believes p false causing believe p true thus must simultaneously believe p false believe p true mele describes dynamicstrategy paradox general successfully employ deceptive strategy b b knows intention plan seems plausible well b person potential selfdeceivers knowledge intention strategy would seem typically render ineffective hand suggestion selfdeceivers typically successfully execute selfdeceptive strategies without knowing may seem absurd agents effective execution plans seems generally depend cognizance goals general agent deceive employing selfdeceptive models call question one simultaneously hold contradictory beliefs static paradox deceive oneself without rendering ones intentions ineffective dynamicstrategic paradox attempts resolution created two schools thought one maintains paradigmatic cases selfdeception intentional one denies nonintentionalists intentionalists tend agree selfdeception intentional divide whether requires holding contradictory school thought incorporates elements temporal partitioning extended time benefit selfdeceiver increasing chance forgetting deception altogether psychological partitioning incorporating various aspects self nonintentionalists contrast tend believe cases selfdeception necessarily accidental motivated desire anxiety emotion regarding p related notion distinguishes selfdeception misunderstanding furthermore wishful thinking distinguished selfdeception selfdeceivers recognize evidence selfdeceptive belief possess without recognizing greater counterevidence wishful numerous questions debates remain play respect paradoxes selfdeception consensual paradigm yet appear theorized humans susceptible selfdeception people emotional attachments beliefs cases may irrational evolutionary biologists robert trivers needed deception plays significant role human behavior generally speaking animal behavior one deceives oneself trust something true better convince others truth person convinces untrue thing better mask signs trivers along two colleagues daniel kriegman malcolm slavin applied theory selfdeception service deception order explain view donald trump able employ big lie great notion based following logic deception fundamental aspect communication nature within species evolved one advantage another alarm calls mimicry animals use deception survival better able perceive deception likely survive result selfdeception behavior evolved better mask deception perceive well trivers puts hiding truth hide deeply others humans awareness fact one acting deceptively often leads telltale signs deception nostrils flaring clammy skin quality tone voice eye movement excessive blinking therefore selfdeception enables individual believe distortions present signs deception therefore appear telling truth selfdeception used act greater lesser one actually example one act overconfident attract mate act underconfident avoid threat predator individual capable concealing true feelings intentions well likely successfully deceive others may also argued ability deceive selfdeceive selected trait rather byproduct primary trait called abstract thinking abstract thinking allows many evolutionary advantages flexible adaptive behaviors leading innovation since lie abstraction mental process creating occur animals enough brain complexity permit abstract moreover selfdeception lowers cognitive cost say one convinced oneself thing indeed true less complicated one behave think thing untrue mind thinking constantly true thing false thing simply convinced false thing true deceit exists strong selection recognize deception occurs result selfdeception behavior evolves better hide signs deception others presence deception explains existence innate ability commit selfdeception hide indications deceptions humans deceive order better deceive others thus advantage three decades since trivers introduced adaptive theory selfdeception ongoing debate genetic basis behavior explanation deception selfdeception innate characteristics perhaps true many explanations pattern behavior possible ability selfdeceive innate learned trait acquired experience example person could caught deceitful revealing knowledge information trying hide nostrils flared indicating lying person thus get wanted next time better achieve success person actively deceive knowledge better hide signs deception therefore people could capacity learn selfdeception however simply something learned mean innate learned innate work outlined many introductory textbooks evolutionary example preparedness occurs learning explain behaviours easily learned others evolutionary psychologists argue learning mechanisms allow learning selfdeception prominent role several medical conditions borderline personality disorder narcissistic personality disorder histrionic personality simple instances selfdeception include common occurrences alcoholic selfdeceived believing drinking control husband selfdeceived believing wife affair jealous colleague selfdeceived believing colleagues greater professional success due ruthless ambition example selfdeception provided robert trivers huey p newton form analysis role flight crew selfdeception crash air florida flight claim conscious deception would decrease body language signs lying criticized incompatible unconscious nature body language body language giving away nonconscious processes well able account evolutionary selection lying would allow body language gives away lying exist instead simply selecting lack notion nonconscious deception would less costly conscious deception subject criticism citing nonconscious lie followed process creating conscious confabulation would amount fewer brain processes simply making conscious concept selfdeception criticized able classify criticism notion selfdeception selfdeception removing falsifiability therefore making unscientific also obstacle science general able classify anything selfdeception way confirms way assumption individuals derive pleasure hurting others would selfdeceive believing victims hurt criticized contradicting premise since individual enjoy knowing victim
