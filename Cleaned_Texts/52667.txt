cell biology virus vaccine development mycoplasmology discovered contrary prevailing belief time cultured normal human animal cells limited capacity replication discovery known hayflick limit overturned longheld belief bolstered alexis carrels work early century claimed normal cells would proliferate continuously culture hayflick found cancer cells immortal normal cells mechanism remembering replication level interpreted finding normal cells mortal indication aging cellular level hayflick demonstrated first time mortal normal immortal malignant mammalian cells existed hayflick developed first normal human diploid cell strains studies human aging research use throughout world prior seminal research cultured cell lines immortal aneuploid one new cell strains developed hayflick colleague paul moorhead wistar institute philadelphia pennsylvania called become widely used highly characterized normal human cell population world hayflick found normal cell strain capable growing known human viruses hypothesized free contaminating viruses could replace widely used primary monkey kidney cells contained several dangerous contaminating viruses indeed became used worldwide human virus vaccine manufacture benefit billions hayflick produced first oral polio vaccine ever made normal human cell strain used production rubella virus vaccine used western hemisphere new diploid cell strains used today manufacture human virus vaccines produced throughout world including poliomyelitis rubella rubeola varicella mumps rabies adenoviruses hepatitis one billion vaccinees received vaccines produced foreign versions hayflicks original hayflick also known discovery cause primary atypical pneumonia walking pneumonia etiological agent first thought virus hayflick showed fact mycoplasma member smallest freeliving class microorganisms etiological agent named mycoplasma pneumoniae first grown hayflick medium developed bears name used worldwide mycoplasma isolation research
