computing using data radio telescopes meerkat november science team analysed data removed noisy signals radio frequency interference using nebula tool developed choose topscoring multiplets observed using fivehundredmeter aperture spherical telescope granted hours observation two original goals setihome second goals considered succeeded completely current boinc environment development original setihome providing support many computationally intensive projects wide range disciplines first goals date yielded conclusive results evidence eti signals shown via setihome however ongoing continuation predicated assumption observational analysis illposed remainder article deals specifically original setihome observationsanalysis vast majority sky yet surveyed point sky must surveyed many times exclude even subset possibilities setihome searches possible evidence radio transmissions extraterrestrial intelligence using observational data arecibo radio telescope green bank data taken piggyback passively telescope used scientific programs data digitized stored sent setihome facility data parsed small chunks frequency time analyzed using software search variations ascribed noise hence contain information using volunteer computing setihome sends millions chunks data analyzed offsite home computers computers report results thus appears difficult problem data analysis reduced reasonable one aid large internetbased community borrowed computer resources software searches five types signals distinguish many variations eti signal may affected interstellar medium relative motion origin compared earth potential signal thus processed many ways although testing detection methods scenarios ensure highest likelihood distinguishing scintillating noise already present directions outer space instance another planet likely moving speed acceleration respect earth shift frequency time potential signal checking processing done extent setihome software process somewhat like tuning radio various channels looking signal strength meter strength signal goes gets attention technically involves lot digital signal processing mostly discrete fourier transforms various chirp rates durations date project confirmed detection eti signals however identified several candidate targets sky positions spike intensity easily explained noise analysis significant
