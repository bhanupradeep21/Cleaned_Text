national institutes health stroke scale nih stroke scale nihss tool used healthcare providers objectively quantify impairment caused stroke aid planning postacute care disposition though intended assess differences interventions clinical trials nihss designed national institute neurological disorders stroke ninds recombinant tissue plasminogen activator rtpa acute stroke trial first published neurologist dr patrick lyden colleagues prior nihss late several strokedeficit rating scales use eg university cincinnati scale canadian neurological scale coma scale oxbury initial severity scale nihss composed items scores specific ability item score typically indicates normal function specific ability higher score indicative level individual scores item summed order calculate patients total nihss score maximum possible score minimum score administering nihss important examiner coach help assigned task examiner may demonstrate commands patients unable comprehend verbal instructions however score reflect patients ability acceptable examiner physically help patient get position begin test examiner must provide assistance patient attempting complete task item examiner score patients first effort repeated attempts affect patients score exception rule exist language assessment item patients best effort items contain default coma scores scores automatically assigned patients scored item note nihss may fluctuate depending level consciousness loc testing divided three sections first loc items test patients responsiveness second loc item based patients ability answer questions verbally presented examiner final loc subsection based patients ability follow verbal commands perform simple task although item broken three parts subsection added final score scores item assigned medical practitioner based stimuli required arouse patient examiner first assess patient fully alert surroundings patient completely alert examiner attempt verbal stimulus arouse patient failure verbal stimuli indicates attempt arouse patient via repeated physical stimuli none stimuli successful eliciting response patient considered totally notes patient verbally asked age name current notes patient instructed first open close eyes grip release notes assesses ability patient track pen finger side side using eyes designed assess motor ability gaze towards hemisphere opposite injury item tested conjugated eye deviation ced present approximately stroke cases ced common right hemispheric strokes typically lesions affecting basal ganglia temporoparietal cortex damage areas result decreased spatial attention reduced control eye notes assess patients vision visual fields eye tested individually covering one eye upper lower quadrant tested asking patient indicate many fingers investigator presenting quadrant investigator instruct patient maintain eye contact throughout test allow patient realign focus towards stimulus first eye covered place random number fingers quadrant ask patient many fingers presented repeat testing opposite notes facial palsy partial complete paralysis portions face typically paralysis pronounced lower half one facial side however depending lesion location paralysis may present facial regions inspecting symmetry facial expression examiner first instruct patient show teeth gums second patient asked squeeze eyes closed hard possible reopening eyes patient instructed raise notes palm facing downwards patient extend one arm degrees front patient sitting degrees front patient lying necessary help patient get correct position soon patients arm position investigator begin verbally counting simultaneously counting fingers full view patient observe detect downward arm drift prior end seconds downward movement occurs directly investigator places patients arm position considered downward drift repeat test opposite arm item scored right left arm individually denoted item notes patient supine position one leg placed degrees horizontal soon patients leg position investigator begin verbally counting simultaneously counting fingers full view patient observe downward leg drift prior end seconds downward movement occurs directly investigator places patients leg position considered downward drift repeat test opposite leg scores section recorded separately left right legs notes test presence unilateral cerebellar lesion distinguishes difference general weakness incoordination patient instructed first touch finger examiners finger move finger back nose repeat movement times hand next patient instructed move heel shin opposite leg test repeated leg notes sensory testing performed via pinpricks proximal portion four limbs applying pinpricks investigator ask whether patient feels pricks feels pricks differently one side compared notes item measures patients language skills completing items likely investigator gained approximation patients language skills however important confirm measurement time stroke scale includes picture scenario list simple sentences figure assorted random objects list words patient asked explain scenario depicted first figure next patient read list sentences name objects depicted next figure scoring item based results test performed item addition language skills demonstrated point stroke notes dysarthria lack motor skills required produce understandable speech dysarthria strictly motor problem related patients ability comprehend speech strokes cause dysarthria typically affect areas anterior opercular medial prefrontal premotor anterior cingulate regions brain regions vital coordinating motor control tongue throat lips perform item patient asked read list words provided stroke scale examiner observes patients articulation clarity notes sufficient information regarding item may obtained examiner items properly score patient however ambiguity exist examiner test item via technique referred double simultaneous stimulation double simultaneous stimulation performed patient close eyes asking identify side touched examiner time examiner alternating touching patient right left side next examiner touches patient sides time repeated patients face arms legs test extinction vision examiner hold one finger front patients eyes ask patient determine finger wiggling wiggling examiner alternate wiggling finger wiggling fingers notes nihss designed standardized repeatable assessment stroke patients utilized large multicenter clinical clinical researchers widely accepted scale due high scoring consistency demonstrated interexaminer testretest clinical research use nihss typically involves obtaining baseline nihss score soon possible onset stroke nihss repeated regular intervals significant changes patient condition history scores utilized monitor effectiveness treatment methods quantify patients improvement nihss also used prospective observational study predict month outcomes patients undernutrition hospital
