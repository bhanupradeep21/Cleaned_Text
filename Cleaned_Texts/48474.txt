intraspecific competition interaction population ecology whereby members species compete limited resources leads reduction fitness individuals fit individual survives able contrast interspecific competition occurs members different species compete shared resource members species rather similar requirements resources whereas different species smaller contested resource overlap resulting intraspecific competition generally stronger force interspecific individuals compete food water space light mates resource required survival reproduction resource must limited competition occur every member species obtain sufficient amount every resource individuals compete population grows prolonged exponential growth rare nature resources finite every individual population survive leading intraspecific competition scarce resources resources limited increase population size reduces quantity resources available individual reducing per capita fitness population result growth rate population slows intraspecific competition becomes intense making negatively density dependent process falling population growth rate population increases modelled effectively logistic growth rate change population density eventually falls zero point ecologists termed carrying capacity k however population grow limited number within carrying capacity defined variable k environment maximum number individuals species environment sustain support longer period resources within environment limited environment support certain number individuals resources completely numbers larger suffer negative population growth eventually reaching carrying capacity whereas populations smaller carrying capacity grow reach intraspecific competition involve direct interactions members species male deer locking horns competing mates also include indirect interactions individual depletes shared resource grizzly bear catching salmon longer eaten bears different points along river way resources partitioned organisms also varies split scramble contest competition scramble competition involves relatively even distribution resources among population individuals exploit common resource pool contrast contest competition uneven distribution resources occurs hierarchies population influence amount resource individual receives organisms prized territories top hierarchies obtain sufficient quantity resources whereas individuals without territory obtain interference competition process individuals directly compete one another pursuit resource involve fighting stealing ritualised combat direct intraspecific competition also includes animals claiming territory excludes animals entering area may actual conflict two competitors animal excluded territory suffers fitness loss due reduced foraging area unable enter area risks confrontation dominant member population organisms encountering interference competition able evolve behavioural strategies morphologies outcompete rivals example different populations northern slimy salamander plethodon glutinosus evolved varying levels aggression depending intensity intraspecific competition populations resources scarcer aggressive behaviours likely evolve effective strategy fight rivals within species harder instead searching options due lack available aggressive salamanders likely obtain resources require reproduce whereas timid salamanders may starve reproducing aggression spread population addition study chilean flamingos phoenicopterus chilensis found birds bond much aggressive single birds paired birds significantly likely start agonistic encounter defense mate young whereas single birds typically nonbreeding less likely flamingos mate population unsuitable sex ratio dominant flamingos mating multiple partners mates fiercely contested resource many species production offspring essential individual propagate genes organisms compete indirectly either via exploitative apparent competition exploitative competition involves individuals depleting shared resource suffering loss fitness result organisms may actually come contact interact via shared resource indirectly instance exploitative competition shown experimentally juvenile wolf spiders schizocosa ocreata increasing density young spiders reducing available food supply lowered growth individual spiders food clearly limiting resource wolf spiders direct competition juveniles food reduction fitness due increased population negative density dependence young wolf spiders evident population density increases growth rates continues fall could potentially reach zero predicted logistic growth model also seen viviparous lizard lacerta vivipara existence color morphs within population depends density intraspecific competition stationary organisms plants exploitative competition plays much larger role interference competition individuals rooted specific area utilise resources immediate surroundings saplings compete light blocked utilised taller saplings easily outcompeted larger members species one reasons seed dispersal distances large seeds germinate close proximity parents likely outcompeted die apparent competition occurs populations predated upon increase population prey species bring predators area increases risk individual eaten hence lowers survivorship like exploitative competition individuals interacting directly rather suffer reduction fitness consequence increasing population size apparent competition generally associated inter rather intraspecific competition whereby two different species share common predator adaptation makes one species less likely eaten results reduction fitness prey species predator species hunts intensely food become difficult obtain example native skinks oligosoma new zealand suffered large decline population introduction rabbits oryctolagus species eaten ferrets mustela furo introduction rabbits resulted immigration ferrets area depleted skink numbers contest competition takes place resource associated territory hierarchical structure within population instance whitefaced capuchin monkeys cebus capucinus different energy intakes based ranking within males females compete territories best access food successful monkeys able obtain disproportionately large quantity food therefore higher fitness comparison subordinate members group case ctenophorus pictus lizards males compete territory among polymorphic variants red lizards aggressive defending territory compared yellow aggressive encounters potentially costly individuals get injured less able reproduce result many species evolved forms ritualised combat determine wins access resource without undertake dangerous fight male adders vipera berus undertake complex ritualised confrontations courting females generally larger male win fights rarely escalate injury either however sometimes resource may prized potentially fatal confrontations occur acquire male elephant seals mirounga augustirostris engage fierce competitive displays attempt control large harem females mate distribution females subsequent reproductive success uneven males reproductive success males zero die breeding age prevented mating higher ranked males addition dominant males account majority potential reproductive success males great many killed breeding age attempt move hierarchy population contest competition produces relatively stable population dynamics uneven distribution resources results individuals dying helps ensure members population hold territory reproduce number territories area stays time breeding population remains constant produces similar number new individuals every breeding season scramble competition involves equal distribution resources contest competition occurs common resource pool individual excluded instance grazing animals compete strongly grass population grows food becomes limiting resource herbivore receives less food individuals compete quantity scramble completion lead unstable population dynamics equal division resources result organisms obtaining enough survive reproduce cause population crashes phenomenon called overcompensation instance caterpillars cinnabar moths feed via scramble competition many caterpillars competing able pupate large population subsequently cinnabar moths competing intraspecifically next generation population grows rapidly crashing
