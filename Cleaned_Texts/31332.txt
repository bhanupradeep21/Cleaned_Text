alkenopterus genus prehistoric eurypterid classified part family onychopterellidae genus contains two species brevitelson burglahrensis devonian germany like onychopterellids alkenopterus small eurypterid largest species brevitelson centimetres inches species burglahrensis represents fact smallest species eurypterid known far measuring cm prosoma head large subquadrate almost square semielliptic nearly elliptic horseshoelike outline anteriorly surrounded broad flat marginal rim reached posterior corners carapace exoskeleton part covering prosoma rounded front surface somewhat inflated distinguished several narrow grooves ridges wrinklelike prominent lateral eyes placed center carapace reniform beanshaped strongly arcuate visual surface half moon eye eyes located tubercle node carrying ocelli simple eyelike sensory brevitelson also eyes behind tubercle certain grooves resembling reversed vshaped structure found appendages limbs alkenopterus known much detail pair poorly preserved appendages brevitelson representing sixth last pair podomeres leg segments less rectangular constant width end spine long podomeres slightly curved long longitudinal third fifth appendages also known exceptionally preserved nevertheless distal spine identified regarding burglahrensis appendage belonging sixth pair five distal podomeres podomeres underneath prosoma known seventh eighth podomeres perhaps somewhat prolonged flattened featured spinelike immovable spurs anterior margins posterior margin seventh podomere movable spinelike podomere characteristic podomeres similar proportions except distal spine slightly curved probably pointed opisthosoma abdomen suffered strong moderate first order differentiation divided preabdomen body segments postabdomen segments preabdomen lateral convex margins quite short broad first tergite dorsal half segment less wide subsequent ones postabdomen narrow constant width epimera lateral extensions segment like preabdomen segments whole body hardly distinguishable integument body lacked main difference brevitelson burglahrensis length telson posteriormost division one brevitelson short measuring cm cm long specimen ratio total body length telson specimen around slightly subtriangular almost triangular median keel ridge expanded anterior base articulated pretelson segment preceded hand telson burglahrensis long measuring cm specimen cm total ratio significantly small expanded anterior portion well telson species however styliform paleontologist leif størmer described two specimens new eurypterid smf viii holotype relatively complete well preserved fossil almost appendages missing smf viii paratype smaller little preserved strongly telescoped segments overlapping defect product fossilization organism specimen collected nellenköpfchen formation near municipality alken rhinelandpalatinate germany west germany currently located naturmuseum senckenberg new eurypterid named alkenopterus brevitelson generic name composed ancient greek suffix πτερόν pteron wing commonly used hand specific name brevitelson derives latin word brevis short ancient greek word τέλσον literally terminal referring telson størmer also compared alkenopterus drepanopterus moselopterus placing stylonuroid family drepanopteridae doubtfully alongside paleontologists markus poschmann odd erik tetlie described series new fossils found nellenköpfchen formation center rhenish massif germany among two new specimens brevitelson alken wellpreserved prosoma remains appendages fragmentary specimen prosoma appendages preabdomen last two postabdominal segments telson also redescribed holotype brevitelson specimen new species alkenopterus found another locality nellenköpfchen formation near burglahr state alken pwl ls almost complete wellpreserved somewhat distorted known find species named burglahrensis specific name coming burglahr due proximity type locality municipality burglahrensis similar brevitelson former longer broader telson strongly expanded distal podomeres appendage vi poschmann tetlie claimed find evidence podomere sixth appendage alkenopterus determining could longer classified part drepanopteridae thus erecting new family alkenopteridae family assigned superfamily due poor knowledge second fourth appendages genus alkenopterus alkenopteridae distinguished drepanopterustype b podomere fifth appendage alkenopterustype sixth appendage one podomeres almost equal length except distal spine moderately flattened pairs appendages lacked spines alkenopterustype leg introduced new standard type nonspiniferous eurypterid alkenopterus well drepanopteridae monotypic would subsequently included stylonurina possessing podomere however poschmann reexamined holotype burglahrensis carefully removing matrix fossil using light microscopy higher magnification resulted detection movable podomere instead simple projection previously thought therefore poschmann assigned family onychopterellidae shared several characteristics assumed fossils brevitelson podomere preserved case brevitelson reassigned stylonurina burglahrensis new onychopterellid
