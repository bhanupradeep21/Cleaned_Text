humans primates knee joins thigh leg consists two joints one femur tibia tibiofemoral joint one femur patella patellofemoral largest joint human knee modified hinge joint permits flexion extension well slight internal external rotation knee vulnerable injury development osteoarthritis often termed compound joint tibiofemoral patellofemoral fibular collateral ligament often considered tibiofemoral knee modified hinge joint type synovial joint composed three functional compartments patellofemoral articulation consisting patella kneecap patellar groove front femur slides medial lateral tibiofemoral articulations linking femur thigh bone tibia main bone lower joint bathed synovial fluid contained inside synovial membrane called joint capsule posterolateral corner knee area recently subject renewed scrutiny knee largest joint one important joints body plays essential role movement related carrying body weight horizontal running walking vertical jumping birth kneecap formed cartilage ossify change bone ages three five years largest sesamoid bone human body ossification process takes significantly main articular bodies femur lateral medial condyles diverge slightly distally posteriorly lateral condyle wider front back medial condyle constant width radius condyles curvature sagittal plane becomes smaller toward back diminishing radius produces series involute midpoints ie located spiral resulting series transverse axes permit sliding rolling motion flexing knee ensuring collateral ligaments sufficiently lax permit rotation associated curvature medial condyle vertical pair tibial condyles separated intercondylar composed lateral medial patella also serves articular body posterior surface referred trochlea inserted thin anterior wall joint posterior surface lateral medial articular communicate patellar surface unites two femoral condyles anterior side bones distal articular capsule synovial fibrous membrane separated fatty deposits anteriorly synovial membrane attached margin cartilage femur tibia femur communicates suprapatellar bursa recess extends joint space suprapatellar bursa prevented pinched extension articularis genus behind synovial membrane attached margins two femoral condyles produces two extensions semimembranosus bursa medial head gastrocnemius popliteal bursa lateral head similar suprapatellar bursa two extensions synovial membrane passes front two cruciate ligaments center joint thus forming pocket direct synovium lining capsule bursae synovium also lines infrapatellar fat pad fat pad lies ligamentum patellae synovium projecting fat pad two numerous bursae surround knee joint largest communicative bursa suprapatellar bursa described four considerably smaller bursae located back knee two noncommunicative bursae located front patella patellar tendon others sometimes present cartilage thin elastic tissue protects bone makes certain joint surfaces slide easily cartilage ensures supple knee movement two types joint cartilage knees fibrous cartilage meniscus hyaline cartilage fibrous cartilage tensile strength resist pressure hyaline cartilage covers surface along joints move collagen fibres within articular cartilage described benninghoff arising subchondral bone radial manner building called gothic arches surface cartilage fibres appear tangential orientation increase abrasion resistance blood vessels inside hyaline cartilage alimentation performed per diffusion synovial fluid subchondral bone marrow serve nutrition sources hyaline cartilage lack least one source induces degeneration cartilage wear years cartilage limited capacity selfrestoration newly formed tissue generally consist large part fibrous cartilage lesser quality original hyaline cartilage result new cracks tears form cartilage articular disks kneejoint called menisci partly divide joint two disks medial meniscus lateral meniscus consist connective tissue extensive collagen fibers containing cartilagelike cells strong fibers run along menisci one attachment weaker radial fibers interlaced former menisci flattened center knee joint fused synovial membrane laterally move tibial surface upper lower

knee joint belong either anterior medial posterior compartment thigh extensors generally belong anterior compartment flexors posterior two exceptions gracilis flexor belongs medial compartment sartorius flexor anterior compartment additionally muscles lower leg provide weak knee flexion namely gastrocnemius addition primary function moving foot posterior compartment medial compartment femoral artery popliteal artery help form arterial network plexus surrounding knee joint six main branches two superior genicular arteries two inferior genicular arteries descending genicular artery recurrent branch anterior tibial medial genicular arteries penetrate knee joint knee permits flexion extension virtual transverse axis well slight medial lateral rotation axis lower leg flexed position knee joint called mobile femur lateral meniscus tibia rotation femur rolls glides menisci center transverse axis extensionflexion movements located collateral ligaments cruciate ligaments intersect center moves upward backward flexion distance center articular surfaces femur changes dynamically decreasing curvature femoral condyles total range motion dependent several parameters softtissue restraints active insufficiency hamstring knee extended lateral medial collateral ligaments well anterior part anterior cruciate ligament taut extension femoral condyles glide roll position causes complete unfolding tibial collateral ligament last extension obligatory terminal rotation triggered knee rotated medially final rotation produced lateral rotation tibia nonweightbearing leg medial rotation femur weightbearing leg terminal rotation made possible shape medial femoral condyle assisted contraction popliteus muscle iliotibial tract caused stretching anterior cruciate ligament cruciate ligaments slightly unwound lateral ligaments become flexed position collateral ligaments relaxed cruciate ligaments taut rotation controlled twisted cruciate ligaments two ligaments get twisted around medial rotation reduces amount rotation become unwound lateral rotation tibia oblique position cruciate ligaments least part one always tense ligaments control joint collateral ligaments relaxed furthermore dorsal fibers tibial collateral ligament become tensed extreme medial rotation ligament also reduces lateral rotation knee pain caused trauma misalignment degeneration conditions producing common knee disorder generally known patellofemoral majority minor cases knee pain treated home rest ice serious injuries require surgical one form patellofemoral syndrome involves tissuerelated problem creates pressure irritation knee patella trochlea patellar compression syndrome causes pain second major class knee disorder involves tear slippage dislocation impairs structural ability knee balance leg patellofemoral instability syndrome patellofemoral instability syndrome may cause either pain sense poor balance prepatellar bursitis also known housemaids knee painful inflammation prepatellar bursa frontal knee bursa often brought occupational activity roofing age also contributes disorders knee particularly older people knee pain frequently arises due osteoarthritis addition weakening tissues around knee may contribute patellofemoral instability may relate hip abnormalities tightness surrounding cartilage lesions caused kind work knees undergo heavy stress may also detrimental cartilage especially case professions people frequently walk lift squat causes pain may excessive wear knees combination things muscle weakness overweight common
