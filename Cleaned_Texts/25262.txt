hemofiltration also haemofiltration renal replacement therapy used intensive care setting usually used treat acute kidney injury aki may benefit multiple organ dysfunction syndrome hemofiltration patients blood passed set tubing filtration circuit via machine semipermeable membrane filter waste products water collectively called ultrafiltrate removed convection replacement fluid added blood returned dialysis hemofiltration one achieves movement solutes across semipermeable membrane however solute movement hemofiltration governed convection rather diffusion hemofiltration dialysate used instead positive hydrostatic pressure drives water solutes across filter membrane blood compartment filtrate compartment drained solutes small large get dragged membrane similar rate flow water engendered hydrostatic pressure thus convection overcomes reduced removal rate larger solutes due slow speed diffusion seen hemodialysis hemofiltration sometimes used combination hemodialysis termed hemodiafiltration blood pumped blood compartment high flux dialyzer high rate ultrafiltration used high rate movement water solutes blood dialysate must replaced substitution fluid infused directly blood line however dialysis solution also run dialysate compartment dialyzer combination theoretically useful results good removal large small molecular weight solutescitation needed treatments given
