space flight simulation genre flight simulator video games lets players experience space flight varying degrees realism common mechanics include space exploration space trade space combat games genre aim recreate realistic portrayal space flight involving calculation orbits within complete physics simulation pseudo space flight simulators others focus gameplay rather simulating space flight facets realism latter games limited game designer deems appropriate gameplay instead focusing realism moving spacecraft space flight models use physics system based newtonian physics usually limited maneuvering craft direct environment take consideration orbital calculations would make game simulator many pseudo simulators feature faster light travel examples true simulators aim piloting space craft manner conforms laws nature include orbiter kerbal space program microsoft space simulator examples fantastical video games bend rules physics favor streamlining entertainment include wing

much new millennium considered dead however opensource enthusiast communities managed produce working modern titles eg orbiter spaceflight simulator commercially released kerbal space program notably wellreceived even aerospace recent games notably elite dangerous brought new attention space trading combat game subgenre realistic space simulators seek represent vessels behaviour influence laws physics player normally concentrates following checklists planning tasks piloting generally limited dockings landings orbital maneuvers reward player mastering real realistic spacecraft celestial

tensions galaxy games type often allow player choose among multiple roles play multiple paths victory aspect genre popular people complained titles leeway given player often superficial reality roles offered players similar openended play frequently restricted scripted example freelancer one reviewers opinion critiqued rigid narrative one case compared negatively grand theft another series praised openended space trading combat games feature core gameplay elements directly controlling flight sort space vessel generally armed navigating one area another variety reasons technology improved
