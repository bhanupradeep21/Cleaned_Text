artificial heart valve oneway valve implanted persons heart replace heart valve functioning properly valvular heart disease artificial heart valves separated three broad classes mechanical heart valves bioprosthetic tissue valves engineered tissue valves human heart contains four valves tricuspid valve pulmonary valve mitral valve aortic valve main purpose keep blood flowing proper direction heart heart major blood vessels connected pulmonary artery aorta heart valves malfunction variety reasons impede flow blood valve stenosis andor let blood flow backwards valve regurgitation processes put strain heart may lead serious problems including heart failure dysfunctional valves treated drugs repaired others need replaced artificial heart contains four valves tricuspid pulmonary mitral aortic valves open close blood passes blood enters heart right atrium passes tricuspid valve right ventricle blood pumped pulmonary valve enter lungs oxygenated blood passes left atrium pumped mitral valve left ventricle left ventricle pumps blood aorta aortic valve many potential causes heart valve damage birth defects age related changes effects disorders rheumatic fever infections causing endocarditis high blood pressure heart failure enlarge heart arteries scar tissue form heart attack three main types artificial heart valves mechanical biological bioprosthetictissue tissueengineered valves us uk european union common type artificial heart valve bioprosthetic valve mechanical valves commonly used asia latin americacitation needed companies manufacture heart valves include edwards abbott st jude lifenet mechanical valves come three main types caged ball tiltingdisc bileaflet various modifications caged ball valves longer bileaflet valves common type mechanical valve implanted patients first artificial heart valve caged ball valve type ball check valve ball housed inside cage heart contracts blood pressure chamber heart exceeds pressure outside chamber ball pushed cage allows blood flow heart finishes contracting pressure inside chamber drops ball moves back base valve forming seal charles hufnagel implanted caged ball heart valves ten patients six survived operation marking first success prosthetic heart valvescitation needed similar valve invented miles lowell edwards albert starr commonly referred starredwards silastic ball consisted silicone ball enclosed methyl metacrylate cage welded ring starredwards valve first implanted human august discontinued edwards lifesciences caged ball valves strongly associated blood clot formation people one required high degree anticoagulation usually target inr introduced first clinically available tiltingdisc valve bjorkshiley valves type swing check valve made metal ring covered eptfe fabric metal ring holds means two metal supports disc opens heart beats let blood flow closes prevent blood flowing backwards disc usually made extremely hard carbon material pyrolytic carbon enabling valve function years without wearing outcitation needed introduced bileaflet valves made two semicircular leaflets revolve around struts attached valve housing larger opening caged ball tiltingdisc valves carry lower risk blood clots however vulnerable blood backflowcitation needed major advantage mechanical valves bioprosthetic valves greater made metal andor pyrolytic last one major drawbacks mechanical heart valves associated increased risk blood clots clots formed red blood cell platelet damage block blood vessels leading stroke people mechanical valves need take anticoagulants blood thinners warfarin rest mechanical heart valves also cause mechanical hemolytic anemia condition red blood cells damaged pass valvecitation needed cavitation rapid formation microbubbles fluid blood due localized drop pressure lead mechanical heart valve cavitation testing essential part valve design verification process many complications associated mechanical heart valves explained fluid mechanics example blood clot formation side effect high shear stresses created design valves engineering perspective ideal heart valve would produce minimal pressure drops small regurgitation volumes minimize turbulence reduce prevalence high stresses create flow separations vicinity valvecitation needed implanted mechanical valves cause foreign body rejection blood may coagulate eventually result hemostasis usage anticoagulation drugs interminable prevent source needed bioprosthetic valves usually made animal tissue heterograftxenograft attached metal polymer bovine cow tissue commonly used made porcine pig source needed tissue treated prevent rejection calcificationcitation needed alternatives animal tissue valves sometimes used valves used human donors aortic homografts pulmonary autografts aortic homograft aortic valve human donor retrieved either death heart removed replaced heart pulmonary autograft also known ross procedure aortic valve removed replaced patients pulmonary valve valve right ventricle pulmonary artery pulmonary homograft pulmonary valve taken cadaver used replace patients pulmonary valve procedure first performed used primarily children allows patients pulmonary valve aortic position grow bioprosthetic valves less likely mechanical valves cause blood clots require lifelong anticoagulation result people bioprosthetic valves lower risk bleeding mechanical tissue valves less durable mechanical valves typically lasting means people bioprosthetic valves higher incidence requiring another aortic valve replacement bioprosthetic valves tend deteriorate quickly younger recent years scientists developed new tissue preservation technology aim improving durability bioprosthetic valves sheep rabbit studies tissue preserved using new technology less calcification control valve containing tissue marketed longterm durability data patients yet source needed current bioprosthetic valves lack longevity calcify valve calcifies valve cusps become stiff thick close moreover bioprosthetic valves cant grow adapt patient child bioprosthetic valves need get valves replaced several times fit physical years researchers trying grow heart valves valves involve seeding human cells two main types scaffold natural scaffolds decellularized tissue scaffolds made degradable scaffold acts extracellular matrix guiding tissue growth correct structure heart tissueengineered heart valves tested clinical none commercially available tissue engineered heart valves personspecific modeled fit individual printing used high accuracy precision dealing different cells used tissue engineered heart valves expected secrete extracellular matrix extracellular matrix provides support maintain shape valves determines cell scientists follow structure heart valves produce something looks similar since tissue engineered valves lack natural cellular basis either fail perform functions like natural heart valves function implanted gradually degrade timecitation needed ideal tissue engineered heart valve would biocompatible durable resistant calcification grow surrounding heart exhibit physiological hemodynamic achieve goals scaffold carefully three main candidates decellularized ecm xenografts homografts natural polymers synthetic mechanical tissue valves made different materials mechanical valves generally made titanium tissue valves made human animal tissue valves composed human tissue known allografts homografts donors human mechanical valves better choice younger people people risk valve deterioration due durability also preferable people already taking blood thinners people would unlikely tolerate another valve replacement operationcitation needed tissue valves better older age groups another valve replacement operation may needed lifetime due risk forming blood clots mechanical valves severe bleeding major side effect taking bloodthinning medications people risk blood bleeding willing take warfarin may also consider tissue valves patients may suitable tissue valves people planned surgeries unable take bloodthinning medications people plan become pregnant may also consider tissue valves warfarin causes risks pregnancycitation needed artificial heart valve ideally function like natural heart functioning natural heart valves characterized many advantages artificial heart valves expected last common problems artificial heart valves various forms degeneration including gross billowing leaflets ischemic mitral valve pathology minor chordal repairing process artificial heart valve regurgitation stenosis usually requires openheart surgery repair partial replacement regurgitant valves usually researchers investigating catheterbased surgery allows repair artificial heart valve
