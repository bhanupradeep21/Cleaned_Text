arterial blood gas abg test arterial blood gas analysis abga measures amounts arterial gases oxygen carbon dioxide abg test requires small volume blood drawn radial artery syringe thin sometimes femoral artery groin another site used blood also drawn arterial catheter abg test measures blood gas tension values arterial partial pressure oxygen arterial partial pressure carbon dioxide bloods ph addition arterial oxygen saturation determined information vital caring patients critical illnesses respiratory disease therefore abg test one common tests performed patients intensivecare units levels care pulse oximetry plus transcutaneous carbondioxide measurement less invasive alternative method obtaining similar informationcitation needed abg test also measure level bicarbonate blood many bloodgas analyzers also report concentrations lactate hemoglobin several electrolytes oxyhemoglobin carboxyhemoglobin methemoglobin abg testing mainly used pulmonology criticalcare medicine determine gas exchange across alveolarcapillary membrane abg testing also variety applications areas medicine combinations disorders complex difficult interpret nomograms rules commonly used abg samples originally sent clinic medical laboratory analysis newer equipment lets analysis done also pointofcare testing depending equipment available clinic arterial blood bloodgas analysis usually drawn respiratory therapist sometimes phlebotomist nurse paramedic blood commonly drawn radial artery easily accessible compressed control bleeding less risk vascular occlusion selection radial artery draw based outcome allens test brachial artery less often femoral artery also used especially emergency situations children blood also taken arterial catheter already placed one plastic glass syringes used blood gas syringes come prepackaged contain small amount heparin prevent coagulation syringes may need heparinised drawing small amount liquid heparin squirting remove air bubbles sample care taken eliminate visible gas bubbles bubbles dissolve sample cause inaccurate results sealed syringe taken blood gas plastic blood gas syringe used sample transported kept room temperature analyzed within min prolonged time delays expected ie greater min prior analysis sample drawn glass syringe immediately placed standard blood tests also performed arterial blood measuring glucose lactate hemoglobins dyshemoglobins bilirubin electrolytescitation needed derived parameters include bicarbonate concentration base excess bicarbonate concentration calculated measured ph using hendersonhasselbalch equation derived measured calculated based assumption measured hemoglobin normal oxy deoxy machine used analysis aspirates blood syringe measures ph partial pressures oxygen carbon dioxide bicarbonate concentration also calculated results usually available interpretation within five minutescitation needed two methods used medicine management blood gases patients hypothermia phstat method alphastat method recent studies suggest αstat method superiorcitation needed phstat alphastat strategies theoretical disadvantages αstat method method choice optimal myocardial function phstat method may result loss autoregulation brain coupling cerebral blood flow metabolic rate brain increasing cerebral blood flow beyond metabolic requirements phstat method may lead cerebral microembolisation intracranial typical reference ranges although various analysers laboratories may employ different ranges two calculations base excess extra cellular fluid beecf blood beb calculation used beecf ph calculation used beb hgb hgb ph contamination sample room air result abnormally low carbon dioxide possibly elevated oxygen levels concurrent elevation ph delaying analysis without chilling sample may result inaccurately low oxygen high carbon dioxide levels result ongoing cellular respiration normal range ph ph decreases implies alkalosis context arterial blood gases common occurrence respiratory acidosis carbon dioxide dissolved blood carbonic acid weak acid however large concentrations affect ph drastically whenever poor pulmonary ventilation carbon dioxide levels blood expected rise leads rise carbonic acid leading decrease ph first buffer ph plasma proteins since accept h ions try maintain acidbase homeostasis carbon dioxide concentrations continue increase mmhg condition known respiratory acidosis occurs body tries maintain homeostasis increasing respiratory rate condition known tachypnea allows much carbon dioxide escape body lungs thus increasing ph less carbonic acid person critical setting intubated one must increase number breaths mechanicallycitation needed respiratory alkalosis pa mmhg occurs little carbon dioxide blood may due hyperventilation else excessive breaths given via mechanical ventilator critical care setting action taken calm person try reduce number breaths taken normalize ph respiratory pathway tries compensate change ph matter hours enough metabolic pathway takes placecitation needed normal conditions equation give blood ph kidney liver two main organs responsible metabolic homeostasis ph bicarbonate base helps accept excess hydrogen ions whenever acidaemia however mechanism slower respiratory pathway may take hours days take effect acidaemia bicarbonate levels rise neutralize excess acid contrary happens alkalaemia thus arterial blood gas test reveals example elevated bicarbonate problem present couple days metabolic compensation took place blood acidaemia problemcitation needed general much easier correct acute ph derangement adjusting respiration metabolic compensations take place much later stage however critical setting person normal ph high high bicarbonate means although high carbon dioxide level metabolic compensation result one must careful artificially adjust breaths lower carbon dioxide case lowering carbon dioxide abruptly means bicarbonate excess cause metabolic alkalosis case carbon dioxide levels slowly diminishedcitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikiarterialbloodgastest
