ghost rockets swedish spökraketer also called scandinavian ghost rockets rocket missileshaped unidentified flying objects sighted mostly sweden nearby countries like finland first reports ghost rockets made february finnish sightings logged may december peaks august two hundred sightings verified radar returns authorities recovered physical fragments attributed ghost rockets investigations concluded many ghost rocket sightings probably caused meteors example peaks sightings august also fall within peak annual perseid meteor shower however ghost rocket sightings occur meteor shower activity furthermore displayed characteristics inconsistent meteors reported maneuverability debate continues origins unidentified ghost rockets however thought likely originated former german rocket facility peenemünde longrange tests soviets captured german missiles perhaps another early form cruise missile ways sometimes seen maneuver prompted swedish army issue directive stating newspapers report exact location ghost rocket sightings information regarding direction speed object information reasoned vital evaluation purposes nation nations assumed performing tests early soviet origins theory rejected swedish british us military investigators recognizable rocket fragments ever found according sightings objects displayed combination leaving exhaust trail moving slowly flying horizontally traveling maneuvering formation appearing silent sightings often consisted fastflying rocket missileshaped objects without wings visible mere seconds instances slower moving cigarshaped objects also known hissing rumbling sound sometimes reported crashes uncommon almost always lakes reports made objects crashing lake sometimes propelling across surface sinking swedish military performed several dives affected lakes shortly crashes found nothing occasional craters lake bottom torn aquatic plants best known crashes occurred july lake kölmjärv sv sweden witnesses reported gray rocketshaped object wings crashing lake one witness interviewed heard thunderclap possibly object exploding however military search reported nothing immediately investigation swedish air force officer led search karlgösta bartoll submitted report stated bottom lake disturbed nothing recovered many indications kölmjärv object disintegrated itselfthe object probably manufactured lightweight material possibly kind magnesium alloy would disintegrate easily give indications bartoll later interviewed swedish researcher clas svahn said investigation suggested object largely disintegrated flight insisted people saw real physical october swedish defense staff publicly stated observations vague must treated skeptically cases however clear unambiguous observations made explained natural phenomena swedish aircraft imagination part observer echo radar equipment registered readings gave clue nature objects also stated fragments alleged come missiles nothing ordinary coke december memo drafted swedish ghost rocket committee stating nearly one hundred impacts reported thirty pieces debris received examined swedish national defence research institute foa debris later said meteorite fragmentscitation needed nearly reports received swedish defense staff november considered observations real physical objects every one seen broad early august swedish lt lennart neckman defense

later flying saucers extraterrestrial origins declassified document states document also mentioned search object crashing swedish lake conducted swedish naval salvage team discovery previously unknown crater lake floor believed caused object possibly referencing lake kölmjärv search ghost rocket discussed though date unclear document ends statement inclined discredit entirely somewhat spectacular theory extraterrestrial origins meantime keeping open mind ghost rocket reports confined scandinavian countries similar objects also reported early following month british army units greece especially
