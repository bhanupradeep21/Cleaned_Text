intralocus sexual conflict type sexual conflict occurs genetic locus harbours alleles opposing effects fitness sex one allele improves fitness males expense females alternative allele improves fitness females expense sexually antagonistic polymorphisms ultimately generated two forces divergent reproductive roles sex conflicts optimal mating ii shared genome sexes generates positive betweensex genetic correlations long term intralocus sexual conflict resolved genetic mechanisms evolve decouple betweensex genetic correlations traits achieved example via evolution sexbiased sexlimited genes intralocus sexual conflict considered form results deviation sexes fitness optima sexes expressing traits suboptimal sexs fitness intralocus sexual conflict also considered form pleiotropy genetic variants opposing effects different classes individual within population ie males females rather opposing effects different components fitness eg survival vs mating success intralocus sexual conflict important implications evolution sexual evolution sex maintenance genetic sexual conflict sexes arises members one sex express traits benefit ability successfully survive reproduce expression traits negatively impacts fitness opposite sex genetics locus refers exact location gene chromosome sexual conflict different consequences depending underlying genetics interlocus sexual conflict occurs different loci sex whereas intralocus sexual conflict occurs loci example interlocus sexual conflict expression accessory gland proteins males mating negatively affect female fitness may result counter adaptation different locus reduce harm females example female may diminish detrimental consequences subjected male accessory gland proteins mating waiting longer remate may develop opposite physical adaptation reproductive alternatively sexual conflict may occur within locus case known intralocus sexual conflict intralocus sexual conflict occurs many phenotypic traits determined common set genes found expressed male female individuals example phenotypic traits body size diet development time longevity locomotory activity typically positively genetically correlated sexes traits also suggested underlie intralocus sexual may subjected antagonistic patterns selection elevated values one trait result enhanced fitness one sex decreased fitness generating negative correlation fitness male female individuals express particular bonduriansky chenowith proposed four phase model development intralocus sexual conflict first phase stabilizing selection trait sexes intralocus conflict originates second phase change physical social conditions causes intense selection trait males andor females sexes displaced optimum third phase diverging selection continues sexes attenuated fourth phase intralocus conflict fully resolved sexual dimorphism good example intralocus sexual conflict seen humans regarding selection pressures height varies sexes nature negative correlation height woman reproductive success seen selection favoring relatively shorter women hand men average height preferred higher reproductive success men shorter taller studies able produce evidence concluding higher reproductive success obtained females sibling pairs shorter height whereas reproductive success sibling pairs average height much higher males findings show intralocus sexual conflict physical trait height effect darwinian fitness intralocus sexual conflict diminishes benefits sexual examples intralocus sexual conflict seen throughout nature humans males females appear masculine physical appearance sex report brothers score higher mate value relative similarly individuals normal weight higher levels estradiol positively correlated higher mate values women higher levels testosterone positively correlated higher mate values individuals physically hormonally masculine tend brothers fairly attractive sisters feminine individuals sisters attractive brothers suggests intralocus sexual conflict mediate determine fitness individual human hips another example females need larger hips childbirth opposed smaller hips optimal walking genes affect hip size must reach compromise neither male optimum female optimum ibiza wall lizard podarcis pityusensis intralocus sexual conflict exist color species color used signal male fighting ability males brightly colored perceived better fighters lizards species age become larger colorful mating seasons males typically compete females resources fighting males select opponents based intensity color opponents coat females species also possess brightly colored coats trait detrimental females since colorful makes conspicuous malesclarification needed predators however males colorful helps males win fights increases reproductive success another example seen features soay sheep ovis aries horns length serin finchs serinus serin tail males possess larger horns longer tails species higher success male competition increased reproductive success however features require great deal energy females possess benefit females significant intralocus genetic differences males females identified variety fish species using rad sequencing including gulf deacon hypothesised loci deacon rockfish may examples intralocus sexual conflict function evolutionary significance currently several hypotheses made attempt explain possible resolutions intralocus sexual conflict one proposition suggested intralocus sexual conflict minimized sexdependent gene regulation genes negatively selected may evolve sexually dimorphic traits encourage sex specific optima sexual dimorphism thought effective resolution since made irreversible short term result sexual dimorphism could pose resolution intralocus sexual conflict another proposed hypothesis suggests intralocus sexual conflict resolved alternative splicing mechanism sex organism ultimately decide final form protein created shared coding region within set genes
