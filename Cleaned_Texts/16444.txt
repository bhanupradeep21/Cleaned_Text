favor late accidental rediscovery james modern elements resuscitation sudden cardiac arrest include cpr consisting ventilation lungs chest compressions defibrillation emergency medical services means bring techniques patient quickly earliest references cpr found ancient egyptian literature old kingdom egypt isis resurrected osiris slain brother husband breath early references iron age found bible

fresh air necessary preserve significant advances resuscitation made europe age enlightenment example scottish surgeon william tossach used mouthtomouth resuscitation resuscitate james blair coal miner alloa scotland apparently dead minutes patient recovered returned work days later case witnessed crowd nearly people considered first modern documented account successful cpr adult tossach published account case english physician john fothergill discussed tossach experience paper published following first organized effort respond sudden death group citizens amsterdam formed society recovery drowned persons srdp srdp recommended range resuscitation techniques including mouthtomouth ventilation warming victim removing water lungs positioning victims head lower position feet applying manual pressure abdomen stimulating victim means rectal fumigation tobacco smoke bloodletting within four years founding srdp claimed saved patients using similar organizations formed hamburg venice milan padua vienna hamburg ordinance passed allowed notices read churches describing use methods rescue people drowned strangled frozen overcome noxious english physician thomas cogan living practicing dutch republic time earned medical degree leiden university impressed accomplishments organizations returned london group prominent citizens including william hawes frederick bull founded society recovery persons apparently drowned later became royal humane following successes organizations similar organizations soon sprang many large cities europe united states goal successfully resuscitating victims sudden death cardiac arrest rescue societies century precursors todays emergency medical services danish physician peter christian abildgaard conducted experiments electrical shock animals found applying electric shock head hen rendered apparently lifeless could revived applying another shock chest repeated experiment several times test subject successfully resuscitating time hen even laid egg couple days english physician james curry noted important difference absolute death apparent death former vital principle completely extinguished latter lies dormant may roused action person thereby completely restored life curry performed experimental work external defibrillation small animals even described two successful cases human resuscitation used two electrodes one right clavicle lower left english physician marshall hall described new method providing artificial ventilation lungs involved rolling victim prone inspiratory lateral expiratory position rate sixteen times per henry robert silvester soon noted several important shortcomings inherent halls technique chief among resulting inspiratory expiratory volumes quite small repeatedly rolling lifeless body prone lateral likely cause significant injury cervical spine face finally risk pulmonary aspiration gastric contents unacceptably high using halls silvester proposed new method artificial ventilation victim laid supine position arms raised head aid inhalation pressed chest aid exhalation sequence repeated several times per silvesters method received great deal attention advocated many prominent physicians era including friedrich von john hill royal free hospital described use sternal compression rate twelve times minute successfully resuscitate three patients carotid pulse audible heart sounds three cases chest compressions appear served primarily means inhalation ammonia sponge held close nostrils rudolph boehm university dorpat reported use external cardiac massage resuscitate cats chloroforminduced cardiac friedrich maass surgical resident university göttingen first describe successful resuscitation patient using external cardiac maass became first proponent external chest
