phonology historical linguistics cluster reduction simplification consonant clusters certain environments time cluster reduction happen different languages dialects languages world englishes part language acquisition different varieties cluster reduction observed numerous examples english dialects around world including limited new zealand english south atlantic english african american vernacular dialects english aave certain historical consonant clusters reduce single consonants ends words common words one final consonants alveolar friend rhymes ben cold homophonous coal cases historical cluster homorganic consonants loses stop ˈfrɛn ˈkoʊl however colder consonant cluster falls vowels remains ˈkoʊldɚ similar wordfinal reduction mb ŋɡ ŋ complete standard english eg lamb long many germanic languages eg swedish lamm lång aave cluster reduction result phonological rule unambiguous situations clusters reduced without leaving listener example rule implies speaker could say eight cat referring multiple cats cat referring multiple cats latter statement would result ambiguity listeners may become confused thinking speaker talking one cat italian well known undergone cluster reduction stop clusters become geminates example victoria become vittoria words articulation length reduced similar occurrence observed portuguese well gemination absent cluster reduction also takes place catalan similar way happens english certain consonant clusters placed end word reduced cent sen instead sent although recover reduced consonant cluster falls vowels centenar səntəˈna phenomenon exist valencian though cent sent centenar senteˈnaɾ wordinitial wordfinal consonant clusters exist japanese language therefore japanese ells may find producing english words clusters common cluster simplification strategies japanese ells include cluster reduction eg string stɹɪŋ sɹɪŋ epenthesis eg stɹɪŋ stəɹɪŋ describes vowel additions within end cluster reduction common specific languages occurs world englishes well example final consonant cluster reduction common among speaking dialects singapore english may use cluster reduction strategies known metathesis glottalization clusters k usually reduced singapore english speakers nigerian english may also reduce delete final consonant clusters strategies cluster reduction common nigerian english include metathesis epenthesis vowels u example occurs word silk nigerian english speakers may say silik unlike singapore english k clusters generally reduced common simplification process chicano english wordfinal cluster simplification example ward would sound like war start would sound like spanish sequential constraint clusters occur beginning word due constraint epenthesis vowel word beginning cluster common words school scare spoon would sound like iskul iskɛr ispun first language acquisition children show similarities clusters reduce consonant clusters reduced following common wordinitial cluster reductions clusters including fricative stop typically get reduced stop pun spoon clusters stop liquid usually reduce stop bu blue clusters fricative liquid generally get reduced fricative like fai fly clusters containing stop glide reduced stop kin queen fricative glide clusters reduced fricative like sɪm swim finally nasal glide clusters reduce nasal musɪk clusters serve special case development learned separately clusters children learning first learning general englishspeaking children reduce sl clusters sling sing reduce every type cluster sp st sk sm sn sw second consonant general children may trouble production liquids l simplify clusters include liquids children may replace sounds glide w omit sounds completely two theories liquid cluster development proposed greenlee elbert mcreynolds greenlee introduced threestage process developing stop liquid consonant clusters includes liquid deletion pot plot substitution liquid glide w pwot plot correct elbert mcreynolds created fourstep process based greenlees previous proposal including stage one consonants deleted stage two one consonant kept omitted stage three consonants produced correctly stage four correct production example tree would first produced ee tee twee lastly tree cluster reduction also occurs dutch language similar english common dutchspeaking children begin reducing clusters ages strategy tends decrease ages drastically decreases time children cluster reduction may linger age development clusters could last age consonantcluster reduction common phonological process used brazilian portuguesespeaking children found used longest sometimes past age studies shown gender differences language acquisition typically developing brazilian unlike brazilian portuguesespeaking children differences language acquisition found cantonesespeaking children consonants girls tend acquire initial final consonants boys consonant clusters containing fricative l generally final clusters acquired ages typically developing children usually longer reduce children using cochlear implants tend use clusterreduction strategies children normal hearing learning words consonant liquids fricatives present stop cluster liquid fricative often consonant gets reduced example pleɪ gets reduced peɪ skaɪ reduced pronunciation training american journal speechlanguage pathology
