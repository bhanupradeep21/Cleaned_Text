calprotectin complex mammalian proteins names calprotectin include calgranulin b cystic fibrosis antigen antigen proteins exist homodimers preferentially exist heterodimers heterotetramers calprotectin antimicrobial proinflammatory prothrombotic presence calcium calprotectin capable sequestering transition metals manganese via metal sequestration affords complex antimicrobial calprotectin known antimicrobial manganese sequestration protein calprotectin comprises much soluble protein content cytosol secreted unknown mechanism faecal calprotectin used detect intestinal inflammation colitis enteritis serve biomarker inflammatory bowel bloodbased calprotectin serum plasma used diagnostics multiple inflammatory diseases including autoimmune diseases like arthritis severe infections including human homologue calprotectin kda formed protein monomers da primary structure calprotectin vary species instance mouse homologue homologue early size exclusion chromatography experiments incorrectly indicated calprotectin molecular mass occasionally value used contemporary literature calprotectin dimers noncovalently pair one another form kda tetramers calprotectin high affinity calcium zinc iron contain two efhand type binding calprotectin able bind total four calcium ions per dimer eight calcium ions per calcium binding induces conformational change complex improves affinity transition metals promotes tetramer maximum two transition metal ions may bind calprotectin calprotectin dimer bind one manganese iron ion high affinity presence zinc bind two sites within calprotectin dimer occur absence calcium however improves calprotectins affinity calprotectin metal binding occurs interface monomers independent monomers capacity zinc binding may contribute zinc homeostasis within first two calprotectin metal binding sites consists motif contributing two histidine ligands contributing histidine aspartic acid ligand second site coordinate

supporting transition metals essential survival mammals strictly limit metal availability part innate immune system helps prevent infection microbes calprotectin first described mammalian antimicrobial protein acts sequestration known calprotectin also antibacterial antifungal properties arise ability sequester manganese calprotectin known antimicrobial agent acts manganese calprotectin becomes available intestinal lumen via leukocyte active cell disturbance cell results elevated faecal calprotectin levels detected elevated faecal calprotectin levels therefore indicate migration neutrophils intestinal mucosa occurs intestinal people active inflammatory bowel diseases ibd ulcerative colitis crohn disease much increase faecal calprotectin measurement faecal calprotectin serve biochemical test diseases although relatively new test faecal calprotectin regularly used indicator ibd treatment diagnostic faecal calprotectin tests also function distinguishing patients irritable bowel syndrome calprotectin useful marker resistant enzymatic degradation easily measured although faecal calprotectin correlates significantly disease activity people confirmed elevated faecal calprotectin falsepositive indicator ibd conditions importantly intake proton pump inhibitor associated significantly elevated calprotectin furthermore positive faecal calprotectin help localizing ibd distinguishing ulcerative colitis crohns faecal calprotectin also indicate gastrointestinal conditions colorectal cancer gastroenteritis food calprotectin levels vary depending age comorbidity may vary daytoday within faecal calprotectin could used preliminary screen otherwise functional patients suspected ibd means following mucosal patients infection elevated faecal calprotectin demonstrated correlated induced thrombosis even patients without gastrointestinal potential using faecal calprotectin way debated however cutoff levels agreed
