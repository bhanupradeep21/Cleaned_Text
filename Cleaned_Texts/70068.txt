distancing concept arising work developmental psychologists heinz werner bernard kaplan distancing describes process psychologists help person establish individuality understanding separateness everything around understanding ones identity considered essential phase coming terms symbols turn forms foundation full cognition recently work done psychological distancing terms development personality behavior distancing context language development increase qualitative dissimilarity referenced object known referent way referenced vehicle example apple would referent way object communicated either sounds words would vehicle representation young children initially imitate sounds hear begin use sounds express needs designate sound need shift function imitation depicted imitation indicating shift random sound sound associated need result depicted imitation slight distance occurs sounds uttered event represent known naturalistic onomatopoeic distance referent vehicle grows children transition speaking baby language standard language transition occurs two directions distancing referent vehicle vehicle referent distance referent vehicle grows decrease concreteness referent vehicle example sound come represent particular cat would applied increased distance vehicle referent occurs four types transitional forms linguistic representations first type children use onomatopoeic expressions conventional ways example forming verb bumer fall original word bum boom second type children modify words form composite forms like using infantile word poch hammering forming word pochmaker mean workman third type children use combination words conventional words like bahsheep fourth type children asked repeat standard words respond equivalent word children transition normal speech words use become symbols instead signals example helen keller often told word water represented teacher miss sullivan placed hand spout able understand word water development dialogue allows children understand difference thoughts anothers psychological distance difference thoughts turn psychological distancing allows greater psychological complexity allowing representation motivation multiple meanings invention intention deceit werner kaplans work later expanded pioneer deafblind patient therapy dr van dijk later refined work dr susan primarily use working deafblind patients distancing gradually leads subject course physical interactions encourage patients respond first responses may simple repetitions pleasurable acts eventually events take place present tense replaced subjects mind complicated concepts desires requests expressions reflect symbolic cognition understanding past events subject progresses stages eventually able move communicating desires simply early childhood complicated treatment symbols communication communication barrier removed conventional therapies educational methodologies possible kaplan wiley also use psychological distancing describe dreaming schizophrenia states dreaming distance individual others words objects referring decreases decreasing distance words referring words begin carry object reference result polysemy riddled throughout dream speech individuals merge imagery gestures together example phrase commandored reported dream means sang commando dawn red schizophrenia extreme shrinkage psychological distance waking individual longer able discern difference others referential object symbolic vehicle decrease distance schizophrenia patient object reference causes individuals believe objects extension reflecting persons selfdistancing occurs individual views experience observer contrast selfdistancing selfimmersed individuals recall events firstperson current research shown selfimmersed individuals experience increased activity emotional autobiographical memory recall selfreflecting neural networks brain medial prefrontal cortex brodmann area additionally selfimmersed individuals increased activity subgenual anterior cingulate cortex brodmann area overactivation linked depression selfdistanced perspective adopted spontaneously shown negatively correlate emotional reactivity individuals adopting selfdistanced perspective also shown able reconstrue derive meaning negative events opposed simply recalling playbyplay details occurred far effect demonstrated among americans viewing events selfdistanced perspective potential allow people work experiences provide insight well closure traumatic events moreover shown promote wise reasoning political conflicts attenuating polarized attitudes toward outgroup fostering intellectual humility openmindedness empathy rumination person continues focus causes consequences stress studies indicated rumination delays amount time takes person recover negative events physiologically continually reliving past individuals adopt selfdistancing perspective found lower blood pressure compared selfimmersed perspective initial time reflection time recounting experience suggests selfdistancing may impact physicalhealth term distancing also applied attachment style attachment theory theory describing formation emotional bonds people effects persons attachment history emotion regulation aspects personality studies shown persons attachment style secure anxious avoidant becomes stable age attachment style assessed kind insecurity individual either attachmentrelated anxiety attachmentrelated avoidance distancing secure individuals low levels anxiety avoidance cope well stress seek support trusted attachment figures use mental depictions support past insecure individuals high levels anxiety avoidance feel confident availability responsiveness subcallosal cingulate cortex scc anterior cingulate cortex acc medial prefrontal cortex mpfc lateral prefrontal cortex lpfc areas brain associated regulation suppression thoughts emotions neurophysiological study found anxious avoidant individuals activate acc mpfc regions told think however avoidant individuals found increase levels activation scc opposed anxious participants anxiety individuals also lower levels activation scc lpfc areas line previous studies shown decrease blood flow prefrontal areas taskinduced avoidant individuals failed fully deactivate lpfc scc regions suppressing thoughts emotions comparable behavioral studies individuals failed maintain suppression cognitive load remembering seven numbers opposed nonavoidant people could maintain distance also temporal spatial social probabilistic dimensions example increased distance words refer terms time space allows mental travel past beginning development short distance words mean children able comprehend speak concrete distance widens children able comprehend location past present language allows communication abstract remote ideas additionally able look backwards forwards time allows formation basic cognition prediction evaluation dimensions distancing move together people remember events past also unified sense distance politeness implies formal social distance speaking less formally implies closeness participants read formal description event perceive event happen future implying spatial distance probabilistically people anticipate common occurrence occur close opposed rare
