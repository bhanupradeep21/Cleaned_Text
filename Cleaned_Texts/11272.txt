henry classification system longstanding method fingerprints sorted physiological characteristics onetomany searching developed hem chandra qazi azizul sir edward henry late century criminal investigations british basis modernday afis automated fingerprint identification system classification methods recent years henry classification system generally replaced ridge flow classification approaches although fingerprint characteristics studied far back use fingerprints means identification occur century roughly sir william james herschel discovered fingerprints remain stable time unique across individuals chief magistrate hooghly district jungipoor india first institute use fingerprints handprints means identification signing legal documents authenticating transactions fingerprint records collected time used onetoone verification means records would logically filed searched yet invented dr henry faulds wrote charles darwin explaining system classifying fingerprints asking assistance development darwin unable assist dr faulds agreed forward letter cousin sir francis galton dr henry faulds sir francis galton engage much correspondence following decade devised similar fingerprint classification systems unclear credit classification system however know dr henry faulds first european publish notion scientific use fingerprints identification criminals sir francis galton published highly influential book finger prints described classification system include three main fingerprint patterns loops whorls arches time alternative fingerprints bertillonage also known anthropometry developed alphonse bertillon bertillonage consists meticulous method measuring body parts use identifying criminals british indian police force adopted anthropometry two years later sir edward henry inspector general bengal police india became interested use fingerprints use criminal identification influenced galtons finger prints men corresponded regularly january henry ordered bengali police collect prisoners fingerprints addition anthropometric measurements expanding galtons classification system developed henry classification system years primarily assisted qazi azizul haque hem chandra bose qazi azizul haque developed mathematical formula supplement henrys idea sorting pigeon holes based fingerprint hem chandra bose introduced various improvements method subclassifying recommendation henry received recognition years later british government henry classification system find worldwide acceptance commission established compare anthropometry henry classification system results overwhelmingly favor fingerprints fingerprinting introduced british india governor general replaced anthropometry also henry sent natal south africa assist reorganization local police force establish fingerprint bureau efforts south africa highly successful sir edward henry returned britain appointed assistant commissioner scotland yard head criminal investigation department cid year first uk fingerprint bureau established scotland yard harling met early henry classification system allows logical categorization tenprint fingerprint records primary groupings based fingerprint pattern types system reduces effort necessary search large numbers fingerprint records classifying fingerprint records according gross physiological characteristics subsequent searches manual automated utilizing granular characteristics minutiae greatly simplified henry classification system method classify fingerprints exclude potential candidates system never used individualization henry classification system assigns finger number according order located hand beginning right thumb number ending left pinky number system also assigns numerical value fingers contain whorl pattern fingers value fingers value fingers value fingers value final two fingers value fingers nonwhorl pattern arch loop pattern value sum even finger value calculated placed numerator fraction sum odd finger values placed denominator value added sum whorls maximum obtainable either side fraction thus primary classification fraction would indicate whorl patterns would mean fingers whorl example henry classification plus key ridge count first loop major value ridge counts tracings fingers primary summation value whorl type patterns fingers numerator denominator value fingers whorls plus numerator denominator secondary pattern types fingers u ulna loop r radial loop w whorl arch subsecondary value ridge counts tracing fingers numerator denominator final ridge count loops whorls little fingers expressed numbers right little used numerator left little denominator loop appears one finger whorl enumerate ridge counts treating whorl ulnar henry classification system highly
