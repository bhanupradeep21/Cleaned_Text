puberty process physical changes childs body matures adult body capable sexual reproduction initiated hormonal signals brain gonads ovaries female testicles male response signals gonads produce hormones stimulate libido growth function transformation brain bones muscle blood skin hair breasts sex organs physical first half puberty completed adult body developed puberty external sex organs
