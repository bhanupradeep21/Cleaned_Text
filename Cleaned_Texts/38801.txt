seed bank also seed banks seeds bank stores seeds preserve genetic diversity hence type gene bank many reasons store seeds one preserve genes plant breeders need increase yield disease resistance drought tolerance nutritional quality taste etc crops another forestall loss genetic diversity rare imperiled plant species effort conserve biodiversity ex situ many plants used centuries ago humans used less frequently seed banks offer way preserve historical cultural value collections seeds stored constant low temperature low moisture guarded loss genetic resources otherwise maintained situ field collections alternative living collections damaged natural disasters outbreaks disease war seed banks considered seed libraries containing valuable information evolved strategies combat plant stress used create genetically modified versions existing seeds work seed banks often span decades even centuries seed banks publicly funded seeds usually available research benefits public seeds living plants keeping viable long term requires adjusting storage moisture temperature appropriately mature mother plant many seeds attain innate ability survive drying survival socalled orthodox
