standard convention teaching archery hold bow depending upon eye one exception modern kyūdō archers trained hold bow left therefore one righteye dominant would hold bow left hand draw string right hand however everyone agrees line thought smoother fluid release string produce consistently repeatable shots therefore may provide greater accuracy arrow flight believe hand greatest dexterity therefore hand draws releases string either eye used aiming less dominant eye trained time become effective use assist eye patch temporarily worn dominant eye hand holds bow referred bow hand arm bow arm opposite hand called drawing hand string hand terms bow shoulder string elbow follow convention shooting according eye dominance righteyedominant archers shooting conventionally hold bow left hand shooting according hand dexterity archer draws string hand possesses greatest dexterity regardless eye dominance shoot arrow archer first assumes correct stance body nearly perpendicular target

bowstring arrow held three fingers mechanical arrow release commonly finger shooters index finger placed arrow next two fingers although several techniques adherents around world involving three fingers arrow arrow pinching technique instinctive shooting technique eschewing sights often preferred traditional archers shooters longbows recurves either split finger three finger case string usually placed first second joint else pads fingers using mechanical release aid release hooked onto another type string hold used traditional bows type favoured mongol warriors known thumb release style involves using thumb draw string fingers curling around thumb add support release string fingers opened thumb relaxes allow string slide thumb using type release arrow rest side bow drawing hand

using back muscles opposed using arm motions archer also pay attention recoil follow body may indicate problems form technique affect accuracy two main forms aiming archery using mechanical fixed sight barebow mechanical sights affixed bow aid aiming simple pin may use optics magnification modern compound bows usually also peep sight rear sight built string aids consistent anchor point allowed bow types world archery modern bows automatically limit draw length give consistent arrow velocity traditional bows allow great variation draw length bows use mechanical methods make draw length consistent barebow archers often use sight picture includes target bow hand arrow shaft arrow tip seen time archer fixed anchor point string brought close face fully extended bow arm successive shots taken sight picture position fall point lets archer adjust aim successive shots achieve accuracy modern archery equipment usually includes sights instinctive aiming used many archers use traditional bows two common forms nonmechanical release splitfinger threeunder splitfinger aiming requires archer place index finger nocked arrow middle ring fingers placed threeunder aiming places index middle ring fingers nocked arrow technique allows archer better look arrow since back arrow closer dominant eye commonly called gun barreling referring common aiming techniques used firearms using short bows shooting horseback difficult use sight picture archer may look target without including weapon field accurate view aiming involves handeye includes proprioception motormuscle memory similar used throwing ball sufficient practice archers normally achieve good practical accuracy hunting aiming without sight picture may allow rapid shooting however increasing accuracy instinctive shooting style shooting includes barebow aiming method relies heavily upon subconscious mind proprioception motormuscle memory make aiming adjustments term used refer general category archers use mechanical fixed words shooting gap shooting aiming method used instinctive involves consciously focusing tip arrow maintaining awareness target archer must adjust arrows trajectory gauging distance arrow tip target ensuring accurate projectile thrown hand speed projectile determined kinetic energy imparted throwers muscles performing work however energy must imparted limited distance determined arm length therefore projectile accelerating limited time limiting factor work rather power determines much energy added limited time available power generated muscles however limited relationship even optimal contraction speed power production total work muscle less half would muscle contracted distance slow speeds resulting less projectile launch velocity possible without limitations relationship bow used muscles able perform work much slowly resulting greater force greater work done work stored bow elastic potential energy bowstring released stored energy imparted arrow much quickly delivered muscles resulting much higher velocity hence greater distance process employed frogs use elastic tendons increase jumping distance archery energy dissipates elastic hysteresis reducing overall amount released bow shot remaining energy dampened limbs bow bowstring depending arrows elasticity energy also absorbed compressing arrow primarily release bowstring rarely line arrow shaft causing flex one side bowstring accelerates faster archers fingers open consequently sideways motion imparted string hence arrow nock power speed bow pulls string opening fingers even release aid mechanism effect usually experienced since string always accelerates faster retaining part mechanism makes arrow oscillate center flexing one side repeatedly gradually reducing arrows flight proceeds clearly visible highspeed
