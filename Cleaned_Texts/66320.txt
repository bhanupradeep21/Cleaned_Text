species early speakman made many contributions development dlw method culminating book doubly labelled water theory published remains standard reference work applications methodology humans animals since chairman international atomic energy agency doublylabelled water database management committee manages database measurements human subjects made using dlw method paper pontzer yamada colleagues utilising database speakman cocorresponding author summarised metabolic rates humans days years old published science august speakman well known work obesity particular criticising longestablished theory obesity known thrifty gene hypothesis alternative hypothesis proposes modern distribution obese phenotypes arose via release predation random genetic drift drifty gene idea controversial criticised others support original thrifty gene test ideas involved searching signatures selection loci linked body mass index showed consistent drifty thrifty gene ideas evidence strong selection loci since published series studies responses mice different diets disputing popular carbohydrate insulin model obesity work culminated perspective article science coauthor kevin hall highlighting inadequacies carbohydrate insulin model led paper using data dlw database showed total energy expenditure declined last years surprisingly traced reduction basal metabolic rate rather decline physical activity expenditure actually increased speakmans group first link genetic variation differences food consumption humans examining polymorphic variation fat mass obesity associated fto aberdeen colleague ela krol among others published series papers journal experimental biology culminated novel hypothesis animal energy expenditure limited capacity dissipate body heat idea heat dissipation limit hypothesis hdl published speakman krol journal animal ecology idea claimed wide implications understanding many aspects ecophysiology ecology limits range distributions maximum possible sizes endothermic animals eg dinosaurs bergmann rule effects climate change idea revolutionary shifts fundamental locus control energy expenditure extrinsic factors outside animal eg food supply fractal supply system uptake capacity intrinsic factors inside animal heat dissipation capacity independent review studies energy expenditure concluded hdl hypothesis provided better explanation patterns
