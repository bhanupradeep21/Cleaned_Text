subtypes sarcoma classified based specific tissue type cell tumor sarcomas primary connective tissue tumors meaning arise connective contrast secondary metastatic connective tissue tumors occur cancer elsewhere body lungs breast tissue prostate spreads connective sarcomas one five different types cancer classified cell type word sarcoma derived greek σάρκωμα sarkōma fleshy excrescence substance σάρξ sarx meaning sarcomas typically divided two major groups bone sarcomas softtissue multiple subtypes united states american joint committee cancer ajcc publishes guidelines classify subtypes subtypes follows symptoms bone sarcomas typically include bone pain especially night swelling around site symptoms softtissue sarcomas vary often present firm often times painless lumps gastrointestinal stromal tumors gist subtype softtissue sarcoma often asymptomatic associated vague complaints abdominal pain bleeding intestines feeling fullness signs intestinal cause bone sarcomas several factors associated increased risk developing bone sarcoma previous exposure ionizing radiation prior radiation therapy one risk therapeutic radiation associated sarcoma exposure alkylating agents found certain cancer chemotherapeutic medicines also increases risk bone certain inherited genetic syndromes including lifraumeni syndrome inherited gene mutations pagets disease bone associated increased risk developing bone softtissue sarcomas arise doctors call sporadic random genetic mutations within affected persons nevertheless certain risk factors associated increased risk developing softtissue sarcoma previous exposure ionizing radiation one risk exposure vinyl chloride eg fumes encountered production polyvinyl chloride pvc arsenic thorotrast associated increased risk

including lifraumeni syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis neurofibromatosis type heritable gene kaposi sarcoma caused kaposi sarcomaassociated herpesvirus mechanisms healthy cells transform cancer cells described detail elsewhere see cancer main page carcinogenesis main page precise molecular changes result sarcoma always known certain types sarcomas associated particular genetic examples include diagnosis bone sarcomas begins thorough history physical examination may reveal characteristic signs symptoms see signs symptoms laboratory studies particularly useful diagnosis although bone sarcomas osteosarcoma may associated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels others ewing sarcoma associated elevated erythrocyte sedimentation importantly however none laboratory findings specific bone sarcomas meaning elevations lab values associated many conditions well sarcoma thus relied upon conclusively diagnose imaging studies critically important diagnosis clinicians order plain radiograph xray imaging studies commonly used diagnosis include magnetic resonance imaging mri studies radioisotope bone ct scan typically used diagnosis types bone sarcoma although important tool staging see definitive diagnosis requires biopsy tumor careful review biopsy specimen experienced diagnosis softtissue sarcomas also begins thorough history physical imaging studies include either ct mri although ct tends preferred softtissue sarcomas located thorax abdomen positron emission tomography pet also may useful diagnosis although common use staging see bone sarcomas definitive diagnosis requires biopsy tumor evaluation histology trained general cancer staging refers advanced cancer usually based upon factors tumor size whether spread parts staging important stage affects prognosis likely outcome well types treatments likely effective sarcomas staging requires determination whether tumor grown surrounding tissues local invasion well imaging determine whether spread process known metastasis lymph nodes forming nodal metastases tissues organs body forming distant common imaging tools used staging bone sarcomas mri ct evaluate primary tumor contrastenhanced ct chest evaluate whether cancer spread ie metastasized lungs radioisotope bone scan evaluate whether cancer spread staging softtissue sarcomas typically includes imaging primary tumor mri ct determine tumor size well contrastenhanced ct chest evaluate metastatic tumors like cancers sarcomas assigned grade low intermediate high based appearance tumor cells general grade refers aggressive cancer likely spread parts body lowgrade sarcomas better prognosis highergrade sarcomas usually treated surgically although sometimes radiation therapy chemotherapy intermediate highgrade sarcomas frequently treated combination surgery chemotherapy radiation since highgrade tumors likely undergo metastasis invasion spread locoregional distant sites treated aggressively recognition many sarcomas sensitive chemotherapy dramatically improved survival patients example era chemotherapy longterm survival pediatric patients localized osteosarcoma risen us us preventive services task force uspstf publishes guidelines recommending preventive screening certain types common cancers march uspstf recommend screening possibly rare type cancer see epidemiology american cancer society acs also publishes guidelines recommending preventive screening certain types common like uspstf march acs recommend preventive screening however patients inherited conditions neurofibromatosis may benefit screening development cancers preexisting benign tumors called neurofibromas surgery common form treatment sarcomas spread parts body sarcomas surgery curative limbsparing surgery opposed amputation used save limbs patients least extremity arm leg sarcoma additional treatments including chemotherapy radiation therapy also called radiotherapy includes proton therapy may administered surgery called neoadjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy surgery called adjuvant chemotherapy use neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy significantly improves prognosis many sarcoma treatment long arduous process lasting year many believed higher doses chemotherapy might improve survival however high doses chemotherapy stop production blood cells bone marrow harmful stem cells collected people chemotherapy transplanted back person blood cell count gets low called autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation high dose therapy stem cell rescue research investigate using chemotherapy followed autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation favourable chemotherapy found one rct favour either two treatment arms respect overall survival result high dose chemotherapy stem cell rescue generally considered appropriate research setting ajcc identified several factors affect prognosis bone softtissue sarcomas gists factors affect prognosis gists key factor affects prognosis according

species australopithecus sediba making earliestknown case human treatment sarcoma especially sarcoma spread metastasized often requires chemotherapy existing chemotherapeutic medicines associated significant toxicities highly effective killing cancer therefore research identify new medications treat sarcoma conducted one new type therapy still investigation use cancer immunotherapy eg immune checkpoint inhibitors like agents treat drugs yet fda regulatorapproved treatment except inhibitor atezolizumab ultrarate diagnosis alveolar soft part strategies smallmolecule targeted therapy biologic agents eg small interfering rna molecules nanoparticledirected therapy also active research understand specific genetic molecular factors cause sarcoma develop could allow design new targeted
