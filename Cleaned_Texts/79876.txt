modularity mind notion mind may least part composed innate neural structures mental modules distinct established evolutionarily developed functions however different definitions module proposed different authors according jerry fodor author modularity mind system considered modular functions made multiple dimensions units one example modularity mind binding one perceives object take features

processes perceive one thing historically questions regarding functional architecture mind divided two different theories nature faculties first characterized horizontal view refers mental processes

mentioning however jerry fodor revived idea modularity mind although without notion precise physical localizability drawing noam chomskys idea language acquisition device work linguistics well philosophy mind implications optical illusions became major proponent idea publication modularity according fodor module falls somewhere behaviorist cognitivist views lowerlevel processes behaviorists tried replace mind reflexes according fodor encapsulated cognitively impenetrable unaffected cognitive domains noninferential straight pathways information added lowlevel processes unlike reflexes inferential demonstrated poverty stimulus argument posits children learn language environment innately programmed lowlevel processes help seek learn language proximate stimulus initially received brain image received retina account resulting output example perception world thus necessitating form contrast cognitivists saw lowerlevel processes continuous higherlevel processes inferential cognitively penetrable influenced cognitive domains beliefs latter shown untrue cases müllerlyer illusion persist despite persons awareness taken indicate domains including ones beliefs influence
