mdp syndrome also known mandibular dysplasia deafness progeroid features extremely rare metabolic disorder prevents fatty tissue stored underneath skin known affect small number people worldwide less cases diagnosed december recent research suggested may caused abnormality gene chromosome causes enzyme crucial dna replication defective initially people identified syndrome identical genetic change inframe single codon deletion resulting loss serine position gene expressed cells particular change seen patients results loss dna polymerase activity mildly impairs proof reading exonuclease activity second genetic change reported italian patient novel heterozygous mutation exon cases identified datewhen caused spontaneous genetic change parents individual unaffectedcitation needed diagnosis mdp syndrome suggested clinical confirmed finding mutation gene service offered molecular genetics team royal devon exeter nhs foundation trust exeter university originally discovered genetic causecitation needed appearance birth early years normal features become prominent later childhood prior puberty main issues appear lipodystrophy see slow growth cartilage ligaments slow growth cartilage ligaments results small nose small mandible jaw small ears tightening ligaments limbs small larynx due reduced growth cartilage mean voice likely remain high pitched even boys pubertycitation needed major feature lipodystrophy reduction fat skin characteristic changes facial appearance occur loss fat cheeks around eyes dry eyes failure close eyes sleep feature due loss fat around eyes rather excessive prominence eyeballs limbs appear thin due lack fat storage also reduced muscle mass large amount fat within abdominal cavity particularly marked liver always surrounds organs major result lipodystrophy people severe insulin resistance insulin work well leading diabetes high triglyceride levels blood effect insulin resistance variable may relate progression lipodystrophy may reflect variation individualscitation needed skin lack fat fibrosis turn result tight skin face limbs one direct feature lipodystrophy skin fragile protection normally provided fat skincitation needed fat stored skin important healthy diet without excess fat often due failure thrive lack subcutaneous fat may encouragement add supplements fat diet however result increase fat skin easily result going tissues liver kidney desired people moderate severe lipodystrophy low fat diet would recommended lipodystrophy progressed example younger children healthy relatively low fat diet may sufficient fat muscle reduction result dietary insufficiency treated dietary measures apart diet thing important exercise encouraged make insulin work effectivelycitation needed developed diabetes recommended fasting insulin triglycerides glucose measured annually monitor insulin resistance blood glucosecitation needed diabetes suggested using metformin doses least decreases insulin resistance improves insulin sensitivity following appropriate clinical consultationcitation needed thin skin means trauma rapid attention wounds avoid infection help primary healing problems skin ulcerscitation needed males undescended testes cases whether corrected hypogonadism reduced function testes many may infertile due inadequate testicular development females normal periods observed low testosterone require testosterone replacement peripubertal males adequate testosterone replacement required anabolic affects growth also induction puberty high doses needs coordinated growth hormone replacement given avoid early closure epitheses ends bones would reduce heightcitation needed although original clinical description short stature included characteristics mdp syndrome looking data closely showed many patients well within normal range growth concern growth hormone therapy could considered coordinated testosterone replacement appropriatecitation needed deafness feature mdp syndrome result nerves working well people often difficulty getting hearing aids small size ears digital hearing aids helpful audiometry follow neededcitation needed may different problems associated mdp syndrome feet lack subcutaneous fat means direct pressure skin resulting callus hard skin heels also weightbearing parts forefoot best managed trying find insoles support foot difficult avoid completely approach increase subcutaneous fat second feature clawed toes result contraction long extender tendons contractured constrictions get worse time worth considering physiotherapy referral aim establish exercises try keep tendons stretched possiblecitation needed failure growth mandible lower jaw rapidly result dental overcrowding case best remove teeth early rather hoping mandibular lower jaw growth overcrowding result teeth severely displaced best act early later correction orthodontically extremely difficultcitation needed many people mdp syndrome high achievers intellectually following careers law medicine computing crucial point progeria evidence accelerated intellectual decline age patients equally life expectancy shown reduced patients described literature none patients known malignancy therefore many crucial differences progeria name progeroid title confusing really refers lack fat face taut skin intellectual age associated featurescitation needed helpful coordinate clinical care
