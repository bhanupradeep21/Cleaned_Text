megalonyx greek greatclaw extinct genus ground sloths family megalonychidae native north america evolved pliocene epoch became extinct quaternary extinction event end late pleistoceneearly holocene living million years type species jeffersonii also called jeffersons ground sloth youngest largest known species measured meters ft length weighed kilograms megalonyx descended pliometanastes genus ground sloth arrived north america late miocene around million years ago prior main phase great american interchange megalonyx widest distribution north american ground sloth range encompassing contiguous united states extending far north alaska warm periods colonel john stuart sent thomas jefferson shortly took office vice president united states fossil bones femur fragment ulna radius foot bones including three large claws discoveries made cave greenbrier county virginia presently west virginia jefferson examined bones presented observations paper memoir discovery certain bones quadruped clawed kind western parts virginia american philosophical society philadelphia march paper published volume accompanying paper colleague caspar wistar provided detailed anatomical information bones illustrated together two papers considered first north american publications devoted paleontology paper jefferson named thenunknown animal megalonyx greatclaw compared recovered bone corresponding bone original draft paper jefferson thought animal carnivore one large cats writing let us say may safely say three times large lion postscript composed learning baron georges cuviers description illustration giant ground sloth megatherium discovered argentina mistakenly referred paraguay jefferson revised interpretation compared megalonyx megatherium contrary baron cuviers view extinction played important role natural history idea would reach scientific consensus decades later jefferson wrote completeness nature whose inherent balance allow species go extinct naturally asked lewis clark planned famous expedition keep eye living specimens megalonyx would support case idea made headway later shown however jeffersons notion humans megalonyx coexisted north america shown correct bones megalonyx show marks made flint presentation american philosophical society often credited beginning vertebrate paleontology north america caspar wistar correctly identified remains giant ground sloth desmarest named species megalonyx jeffersonii honor former statesman scientist richard harlan provided additional taxonomic description megalonyx sometimes incorrectly cited one formally named genus recent research confirms sloth bones discovered haynes cave monroe county west virginia many decades twentieth century reported origin jeffersons certain bones organ cave greenbrier county west virginia story popularized local man andrew price story came scrutiny two fragments megalonyx scapula found haynes cave neighboring monroe county smithsonian paleontologist frederick grady presented evidence haynes cave original source jeffersons fossil jefferson reported bones found saltpeter workers gave cave owners name frederic crower correspondence jefferson colonel stuart sent bones indicates cave located five miles stuarts home contained saltpeter vats investigation property ownership records revealed frederic crower apparent misspelling name frederic organ cave never owned gromer haynes cave two letters written tristram patton subsequent owner haynes cave indicate cave located monroe county near second creek monroe county originally part greenbrier county became separate county shortly discovery bones letters patton described cave indicated fossil bones remained jeffersonii still commonly identified species megalonyx designated state fossil west
