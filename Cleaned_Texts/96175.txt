thought intracellular protein facilitating fatty acid transport storage showed obesity increases secretion adipose tissue furthermore demonstrated elevated circulating directly binds cancer cells promoting expression aldehyde dehydrogenase hallmark breast cancer stem cells thus circulating mediates cancer risk progression enhancing cancer subsequently research intracellular investigated besides expressed adipocytes highly expressed certain subsets macrophages heterogeneous tumor stroma antitumor activity others exhibit opposite effect demonstrated highly expressed subset tumor associated macrophages tams phenotype showed tam subset accumulates stroma mammary tumors promote tumor growth enhancing oncogenic addition highlighted also promotes cancer risk mechanisms including providing energy rapid tumor growth exergonic free fatty acid transport enhancing new blood vessel formation inhibiting tumor suppressor genes collectively seminar studies uncovered strengthens interactions among tumor stromal macrophages adipocytes tumor cells connects obesityassociated adipokines tumorpromoting signaling thus representing mechanism obesity increases risk development breast
