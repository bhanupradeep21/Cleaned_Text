funnel traps narrow entrance birds may lured driven entrance typically leads larger holding pen corral also gives name corral trap funnel traps large particularly wellknown large scale form devised german bird observatory heligoland termed heligoland flocking birds sometimes trapped using large net thrown using series synchronized cannons rockets shoot weight drags net behind entire flock nets also called rocket nets boom nets capturing entire flocks important tool studies large numbers birds need examined monitoring viruses birds gregarious social techniques used especially open habitats particularly suited waders waterbirds examination ringing operations captured birds usually released together rather individually mist nets fine nets suitable capturing birds woodlands fine net strung across trees lie flight path bird bird flies nearly invisible net falls fold bottom net usually gets entangled nets used especially bird ringing typically never left unsupervised bird falls quickly removed avoid injury bird prevent falling prey predators birds walk ground captured using array monofilament nooses usually placed along favoured feeding roosting nest raptors trapped using livebait nooses cage holding bait trap also known balchatri also adapted capture birds noose carpet another variant consists number tiny nooses muscles perching birds allow toes pull inwards force strong
