subliminal stimuli sʌbˈlɪmɪnəl sub literally less sensory stimuli individuals threshold conscious perception contrast supraliminal stimuli american cinematographer james vicary claimed increased sales cocacola inserting cinemas movies frames drink cocacola written five years later however admitted inflated results somewhat including certain data labeled scientifically however vicarys claim increased scientific interest subliminal messages indeed subliminal stimulation accepted legitimate research field scientific literature review functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri studies showed subliminal stimuli activate specific regions brain despite participants result corroborated metaanalysis concerning subliminal stimulation posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd visual stimuli may quickly flashed individual process flashed masked interrupt processing audio stimuli may played audible volumes masked stimuli applications subliminal stimuli often based persuasiveness message research action priming shown subliminal stimuli trigger actions receiver message plans perform anyway however consensus subliminal messaging remains unsubstantiated research actions triggered subliminally person already prepared perform specific context stimulus presented affects example target thirsty subliminal stimulus drink likely influence target purchase drink readily stimuli also influence target choose primed option habitually chosen subliminal stimuli product quickly accessible need within specific context stimuli little subliminal priming direct peoples actions even believe making free primed push button offhand people use hand even given free choice using offhand dominant however meta analysis many strong articles displaying effectiveness subliminal messaging revealed effects actual consumer purchasing choices two alternatives statistically subliminal messaging effective behaviour specific present intentions contexts means visible results mischievous results suggested however subliminal stimuli bias acting decisions including internally freely generated ones since effect remains along aforementioned intentions contexts impact choice action mischievous rather appropriate subliminal stimuli research threshold level participant aware stimulus researchers determine threshold stimulus used subliminal stimulus stimulus presented study point measures taken determine effects stimulus way studies operationally define thresholds depends methods particular article methodology research also varies type subliminal stimulus auditory visual dependent variables measure objective threshold found using forcedchoice procedure participants must choose stimulus saw options given example participants flashed stimulus like word orange given choices asked one saw participants must choose answer objective threshold obtained participants results task reach level ie better predicted length presentation causes chance performance forcedchoice task used later study subliminal stimuli subjective threshold determined participant reports performance forcedchoice procedure approximates chance subjective threshold ms slower objective threshold demonstrating participants ability detect stimuli earlier perceived accuracy ratings would indicate stimuli presented subjective threshold longer presentation time presented objective threshold using objective threshold priming stimuli neither facilitated inhibited recognition color however longer duration priming stimulus greater effect subsequent responding findings indicate results studies may due definition stimuli supposed elicit specific emotional reaction eg spider pictures shown spiderfearful person could fail elicit even consciously sounds apparently obvious even one arachnophobic spider picture could brief elicit fear reaction however obvious perspective phobic person typically afraid even mere thought phobic stimulus lack emotional response induced brief phobic pictures nonetheless emerged awareness brought definition emotionallysubliminal stimuli stimuli induce expected emotional reaction even consciously perception without awareness demonstrated comparison direct indirect measures direct measures use responses task definitions accordance explicit instructions given subjects indirect measures use responses part task definition given direct indirect measures displayed comparable conditions except direct indirect instruction example typical stroop test subjects asked name color patch ink direct measure instructions given participants popular indirect measure used task response told measured response times similarly direct effect effect task stimulus instructed response usually measured accuracy indirect effect uninstructed effect task stimulus behavior sometimes measured including irrelevant distracting component task stimulus measuring effect effects compared relative sensitivity indirect effect greater direct effect indicates unconscious cognition however debate raised scientific literature heterogeneity paradigms make stimuli subliminal assess effectiveness best solution proposed trialbytrial assessment stimulus conscious despite rigorousness assessment problematic studies comparing brain responses detected versus undetected stimuli resulting differences could attributed act answering eg pressing button rather unconscious processing cases noreport paradigm could order study effects subliminal stimuli researchers often prime participants specific visual stimuli determine stimuli elicit different subliminal stimuli mostly studied context emotion particular researchers focused lot attention face perception subliminal presentation different facial expression affects visual subliminal stimuli also used study emotion eliciting stimuli simple geometric significant amount research produced throughout years demonstrate effects subliminal visual attitudes develop without aware antecedentsdefinition individuals viewed slides people performing familiar daily activities exposed either emotionally positive scene romantic couple kittens emotionally negative scene werewolf dead body slide next exposure something individuals consciously perceived flash light participants exhibited positive personality traits people whose slides associated emotionally positive scene vice versa despite statistical difference subliminal messages less impact judgment slides inherent level physical individuals show right amygdala activity response subliminal fear greater left amygdala response supraliminal study participants exposed subliminal image flashed milliseconds could signal potential threat supraliminal image flashed half second furthermore supraliminal fear showed sustained cortical activity suggesting subliminal fear may entail conscious surveillance supraliminal fear entails higherorder seminal article published found subliminal phobic pictures elicited specific electrodermal reactions even consciously study paved way prolific research field investigating psychophysiological behavioral correlates emotionallyrelevant stimuli made subliminal sexual stimulus different effect men compared women study omri gilliath et al men women subliminally exposed either sexual neutral picture sexual arousal recorded researchers examined accessibility sexrelated thoughts following procedure either pictorial judgment task lexical decision task results revealed subliminal sexual stimuli effect men women lower levels sexual arousal reported however conditions related accessibility sexrelated thoughts subliminal sexual stimuli led higher accessibility men subliminal stimuli elicit significant emotional changes changes valuable therapeutic proposed caused little influence subliminal stimuli cognitive circuits together survival ones contribute conscious experience spiderfearful nonfearful undergraduates experienced either positive negative neutral subliminal priming stimulus followed immediately picture spider snake using visual analogue scales participants rated affective quality picture evidence found support unpleasantness pictures modulated subliminal nonfearful participants rated spiders frightening primed negative stimulus event found fearful however systematic review found majority negative results concerning subliminal phobic stimulations could explained methodological issue ie latency duration subliminal stimulus rather real inefficacy pictures indeed two metaanalyses scientific literature found significant even weak results behavioral brain imaging correlates subliminal stimulation panic posttraumatic stress respectively laboratory research unconscious perception often employs simple stimuli eg geometric shapes colors visibility controlled visual masked stimuli used prime processing subsequently presented target stimuli instance response priming paradigm participants respond target stimulus eg identifying whether diamond square immediately preceded masked priming stimulus also diamond square prime large effects responses target speeds responses consistent target slows responses inconsistent response priming effects dissociated visual awareness prime prime identification performance chance priming effects increase despite decreases prime presentation geometric figures subliminal stimuli result threshold geometric figures presented slides tachistoscope followed supraliminal shock given slide every time appeared shock administered fivesecond interval electrical skin changes participants occurred reinforcement shock nonreinforcement recorded findings indicate proportion electrical skin changes occurred following subliminal visual stimuli significantly greater expected proportion electrical skin changes occurred response stimuli reinforced significantly less whole participants able make threshold another form visual stimuli words nonwords set experiments words nonwords used subliminal primes priming stimuli work best subliminal stimuli words classified several times used prime word primes also made parts practiced words create new words case actual word used prime opposite meaning words came parents still prime meaning parent words nonwords created previously practiced stimuli similar effect even unpronounceable eg made consonants primes generally increase response times later stimuli short period time visual stimuli often masked forward backward masks displayed longer periods time without subject able recognize priming stimuli forward mask briefly displayed priming stimulus backward mask usually follows prevent subject recognizing one method creating subliminal auditory stimuli masking involves hiding target auditory stimulus way auditory subliminal stimuli shown effect participant large example one study used speechlike sounds cover target words found evidence priming absence awareness stimuli effects subliminal stimuli seen one outcome measures priming effects conscious stimuli seen multiple outcome however empirical evidence assumption impact auditory subliminal stimuli human behavior remains weak experimental study influence subliminal target words embedded music track choice behavior authors found evidence manipulative effect study investigated effects selfconcept rational emotive behavior therapy auditory subliminal stimulation separately combination undergraduate students selfconcept problems randomly assigned one four groups receiving either rationalemotive therapy subliminal stimulation placebo treatment rationalemotive therapy
