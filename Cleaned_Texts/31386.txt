metabolic myopathies myopathies result defects biochemical metabolism primarily affect muscle generally genetic defects interfere muscles ability create energy causing low atp reservoir within muscle cell cellular level metabolic myopathies lack kind enzyme transport protein prevents chemical reactions necessary create adenosine triphosphate atp often referred molecular unit currency intracellular energy transfer lack atp prevents muscle cells able function properly people metabolic myopathy never develop symptoms due bodys ability produce enough atp alternative pathways eg majority ampdeaminase deficiency atp h adp pi energy muscle atp needed muscle contraction two processes atp consumed high rate contracting muscles need atp muscle cells illustrated phenomenon rigor mortis muscle rigidity occurs dead bodies short time death muscles atp converted adp absence atp generated calcium transport proteins stop pumping calcium ions sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ions gradually leak causes myosin proteins grab actin pull without supply atp release pull muscles therefore remain rigid position death binding myosin actin begins break become loose event atp needed affected pathway lack becomes issue symptoms develop people metabolic myopathy often experience symptoms degree symptoms varies greatly person person dependent severity enzymatic transport protein defect extreme cases lead symptoms experienced also depend metabolic pathway impaired different metabolic pathways produce atp different time periods activity rest well type activity anerobic aerobic intensity level atp consumption majority patients metabolic myopathies dynamic rather static findings typically experiencing exercise intolerance muscle pain cramps exercise rather fixed muscle however minority metabolic myopathies fixed muscular weakness rather exercise intolerance imitating inflammatory myopathy limb girdle muscular dystrophy uncommon static dynamic signs metabolic myopathies generally caused inherited genetic mutation inborn error metabolism livestock acquired environmental gsd caused intoxication alkaloid metabolic myopathies cause underproduction adenosine triphosphate atp within muscle genetic mutation typically autosomal recessive inheritance pattern making fairly rare inherit even rarely caused random de novo genetic mutation autosomal dominant metabolic myopathies categorized metabolic pathway deficient enzyme transport protein belongs main categories metabolic myopathies listed symptoms metabolic myopathy easily confused symptoms another disease genetic sequencing research progresses noninvasive neuromuscular panel dna test help make diagnosis dna test inconclusive negative vus muscle biopsy necessary accurate diagnosis blood test creatine kinase ck done normal circumstances test signs tissue breakdown added cardio portion indicate muscle breakdown occurring metabolic myopathies baseline ck either normal electromyography emg

sinus tachycardia response exercise seen gsdv glycogenoses mitochondrial minutes walk test also used determine second wind also seen mcardle disease cardiopulmonary exercise test measure heart rate

leisurely pace level ground incline loose gravel sand long grass snow mud walking headwind added resistance requiring effort makes activity reliant muscle glycogen surfaces ice make tense muscles anearobic requiring muscle glycogen protect slipping muscle glycogenoses maintain healthy life exercise learning activity adaptations utilizing bioenergetic systems available depending type activity whether second wind slow pace rest briefly need make sure empty atp signs symptoms lowintensity aerobic activity within seconds minutes highintensity aerobic activity anaerobic activity metabolic myopathies varying levels symptoms severe developed infancy develop form metabolic myopathy young adult adult life tend treatable symptoms helped change diet might accurate say metabolic myopathies described adultonset isnt necessarily didnt develop infancy metabolism didnt display severe enough symptoms warrant attention medical professionals adult years severe symptoms rhabdomyolysis fixed muscle weakness due years repetitive injury deconditioning muscles sedentary adult lifestyle exacerbated symptoms due rare nature diseases common misdiagnosed even misdiagnosed multiple correct diagnosis made adult years looking back symptoms present since childhood either brushedoff growing pains laziness told needed exercise especially difficult get diagnosis symptoms dynamic exerciseinduced muscle sitting doctors office rest movements last seconds within time limit phosphagen system patient wouldnt display noticeable abnormalities muscle fatigue cramping breathlessness brief mildly elevated heart rate heart rate taken sitting recently walking across room getting examination table might assumed due anxiety illness rather exerciseinduced inappropriate rapid heart rate due atp shortage muscle cells absence severe symptoms hepatomegaly cardiomyopathy hypoglycemia lactic acidosis myoglobinuria rhabdomyolysis acute compartment syndrome renal failure understandable disease would noticed medical professionals years rest patient appears completely normal depending enzyme affected highprotein lowfat diet may recommended along mild exercise important people metabolic myopathies consult doctors treatment plan order prevent acute muscle breakdowns exercising lead release muscle proteins bloodstream cause kidney ketogenic diet remarkable effect cnssymptoms pdhdeficiency also tried complex ketogenic diet demonstrated beneficial mcardle disease gsdv ketones readily convert acetyl coa oxidative phosphorylation whereas free fatty acids take minutes convert acetyl another study ketogenic diet mcardle disease gsdv mcardle disease gsdv regular aerobic exercise utilizing second wind enable muscles become aerobically conditioned well anaerobic exercise follows activity adaptations cause muscle injury helps improve exercise intolerance symptoms maintain overall studies shown regular lowmoderate aerobic exercise increases peak power output increases
