potential reason phenomenon due enhanced predation avoidance superior bathymodiolus thermophilus feeds extracting suspended food particles surrounding water gills mostly consists bacteria live around vent often forming dense mat result b thermophilus possesses chemosymbiotic relationship gammaproteobacteria oxidizes hydrogen sulfide mussels mussel absorbs nutrients synthesized bacteria reliant photosynthetically produced organic matter bacteria lacks enzymes used synthesize succinate tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates able synthesize nutrients using sulfur compounds genome bacteria reveals possesses pathways sulfide energy source encodes cycles mussels contain high concentrations bacteria demonstrated ability perform bacteria also contain genes cell surface adhesion bacteriotoxicity phage immunity genetic characteristics may help chemosynthetic bacteria defend b thermophilus immune system allows bacteria live mussels gills without chemosymbiotic relationship b thermophilus bacteria benefit mussel speculation living inside gills mussel also benefits bacteria possible living within another host helps bacteria withstand harsh environment hydrothermal larvae
