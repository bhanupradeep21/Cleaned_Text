commercial animal cloning cloning animals commercial purposes currently including livestock competition camels horses pets medical uses endangered extinct first demonstrated dolly sheep moving copying nearly genes one animal form second genetically nearly identical animal usually done one three methods roslin technique honolulu technique artificial first two involve process known somatic cell nuclear process oocyte taken surrogate mother put enucleation process removes nucleus inside oocyte somatic cells taken animal cloned transferred blank oocyte order provide genetic material fused oocyte using electrical current oocyte activated reinserted surrogate mother end result formation animal almost genetically identical animal somatic cells taken somatic cell nuclear transfer previously believed work using genetic material somatic cells unfrozen frozen cryoprotectant avoid cell damage caused freezing successful dog cloning various breeds shown using somatic cells unprotected specimens frozen four another method cloning includes embryo splitting process taking blastomeres early animal embryo separating become differentiated order create two separate organisms using embryo splitting cloning must occur birth animal clones grow time similar fashion monozygotic us food drug administration concluded food cattle swine goat clones safe eat food cattle swine also noted main use agricultural clones produce breeding stock food clones allow farmers upgrade overall quality herds providing copies best animals herd animals used conventional breeding sexually reproduced offspring become food producing animals regardless large million cloned cattle per year tianjin animal cloning center proposed put use first half opening reported goals cloning listed fda

good cloning super sniffer dogs airports reported four years afterwards dogs started cloning successful rescue dog reported police dog extinct animal cloned pyrenean ibex born july spain died minutes later due physical defects endangered animals add genetic diversity inbred species also cloned certain centers notably viagen aided san diego frozen zoo revive also referred conservation two examples blackfooted ferret przewalski world first cloned arctic wolf maya born beijing sinogene although arctic wolves longer listed international union conservation nature red list endangered species technique could used help animals risk extinction mexican gray wolves red wolves team sinogene confident technique could used restore lost species boost numbers endangered animal populations recent study using sturgeons species fish acipenseridae family scientists making improvements technique called somatic nuclear cell transfer ultimate goal save endangered species sturgeons endangered due high levels poaching increased destruction habitats water pollution overfishing makes species perfect candidate improving type cloning method hopes preserving natural populations becoming endangered somatic nuclear cell transfer technique wellknown cloning method used years focuses species thriving rather endangered extinct animals technique usually uses single somatic donor cell single manipulation inserts recipient egg species interest recently found position somatic cell located inside recipient important order successfully clone species making adjustments original method using single somatic cell instead use multiple somatic donor cells insert recipient egg likeliness somatic donor cells crucial position egg increase tremendously increase result higher success rates cloning still ongoing research using improved method happening data collected thus far seems reasonable method continue soon able help stop species like sturgeons becoming endangered possibly stop extinction comes cloning extinct animals things become quite difficult death occurs animals dna starts decay makes impossible fully preserve entire genome known cloning methods new studies using genome editing made possible bring back traits extinct species currently lab harvard universitys wyss institute working way bring back famously known extinct species referred mammoth least incorporate traits closely related species goal genetically modify mammoths closely related living species elephant hopes expanding available habitats elephants connecting lost ecological interactions order make goal possible team must first sequence assemble mammoth genome preserved remains identifying genome sequencing comparison extinct species closest living relatives genome made using advanced genome editing technology studies shown cloning extinct animals impossible unlike currently living animals closely related alternative genome engineering seems next best thing making longgone species somewhat present todays time methods like allow scientists edit genome closely related relatives allowing least traits extinct animals become present essentially like bringing extinct species back viagen began
