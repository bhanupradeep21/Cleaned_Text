linguistics coconstruction single syntactic entity conversation discourse uttered two names concept include collaboratively built joint utterance used specific linguistic context coconstruction confused broader social interactional sense name coconstruction studied across several linguistic subdisciplines including applied linguistics conversation analysis linguistic anthropology language acquisition coconstruction may broadly divided two main forms namely completions expansions key difference two completions performed utterances syntactically incomplete whereas expansions added onto constructions otherwise grammatically whole completion refers process interlocutor continuing finishing syntactic unit left incomplete first example completion grammatically coherent first speakers utterance brings colloquially notion also known finishing another persons thought expansion refers process speech participant augmenting already syntactically complete utterance made another speaker occur number ways including limited addition prepositional phrase dependent speakers rely certain processes determine coconstruct utterance initiated another speaker subtle cues allow projection possible end utterance syntax plays key role coconstruction speech participants may use grammatical structure another speakers utterance predict may continued andor finished based syntactic organization ongoing utterance listener able identify class permissible sentence english subordinating conjunctions occurring clause clue listener sequential possibility anticipatory japanese coconstruction made possible projection end utterance via modal verbs conjunctions modal verbs どうも dōmo somehow どうやら dōyara somehow 何となく nan naku somehow associated sentence endings thereby allowing listener project possible completion ongoing utterance similarly conjunctions ので de から kara ものですから mono desu kara conventionally followed clause varies depending used usage one particular conjunctive expression allows interlocutors project possible ending first speakers ongoing sentence semantic pragmatic content ongoing utterance may also allow listeners project possible trajectory thereby aiding understanding coconstruction may attempted lexical constructions play vital role process beginning fragment information needs finished english cues may manifest likes example prompts elaboration shes called projects proper connecting conjunctions however also project certain lexical contrasts suggests listeners sort semantic content might acknowledged projected syntax utterance insufficient coconstruction take place class possible completers may located syntax alone specify particular completer employed indicate would appropriate given interactional instead participants rely much larger
