bradyphrenia slowness thought common many disorders disorders characterized bradyphrenia include parkinsons disease forms schizophrenia consequently causing delayed response patients bradyphrenia may describe may manifest slowed thought processes evidenced increased latency response also involve severe memory impairment poor motor word bradyphrenia originates ancient greek meaning slow first sightings bradyphrenia documented french neurologist naville early century time epidemic encephalitis lethargica appears investigating epidemic involved inflammation brain encephalitis affected people tended experience mental delays remain motionless extended periods time due unknown naville dealing patients experiencing several symptoms could describe gradual brain impairment several symptoms listed included decreased attention span memory lack motivation perform naville also observed facial expressions patients symptoms become stagnant disinterested since navilles publications researchers often referred condition psychic torpor translated mental swiss neurologist steck completed study investigating case bradyphrenia post epidemic mental institutions within research found half patients hospitalised following stecks discovery period active research causes stecks work stimulated interest neurologists including aubrun investigated bradyphrenia creating new direction linking parkinsons gradually neurologists began exploring bradyphrenia presence disorders including alzheimers disease loss motor control psychiatric disorderscitation needed research steck found almost half patients parkinsons disease psychiatric ward postencephalitic period neurologists often saw condition additional trait parkinsons disease found patients parkinsons disease often impaired traits would defined study conducted wilson et al found bradyphrenia found patients parkinsons disease increased reaction time retaining studies exploring theory confirmed bradyphrenia commonly seen studies patients parkinsons addition researchers found condition impact patients parkinsons disease neurologists also suggested bradyphrenia could exist without presence cases found bradyphrenia mistaken inability strategically complete tasks therefore may often categorised condition collectively concluded bradyphrenia commonly appear parkinsonism rather single entity occurs conditions single presence parkinsons despite collective agreement bradyphrenia classified nosological entity neurological condition still often described case studies subjects analysed parkinsons diseasecitation needed several symptoms parkinsons disease influenced presence bradyphrenia researcher norberg discovered gradual cognitive slowing impacted eating behaviour found patients parkinsons disease would often experience extended periods time attempting process food eating causing increase time took consume another study examining presence bradyphrenia parkinsons disease researchers discovered bradyphrenia one reasons slow auditory feedback measured daf delayed auditory dobbs et al completed experiment whereby experimenter would communicate patient via microphone would ask participant complete series tasks participant without parkinsons disease would receive information headphones respond via microphone experimenters asked participants complete following tasks counting repeat several simple sentences read series words researchers concluded bradyphrenia present parkinsons disease however also older patients also delayed feedback completing researchers rogers et al found bradyphrenia light parkinsons disease considerably similar referred psychomotor psychomotor retardation proposed researchers condition particularly seen major depressive disorders researchers conducted study examine ways two conditions share similarities analysing diagnosed parkinson disease patients patients diagnosed depression participants given two tasks complete one tasks known digit symbol substitution test consisted participants filling row numbers specific connection symbol another task referred simpler task match number screen seen pressing number measurements required fast reaction time response based quickly seconds would respond tasks researchers found significant decrease response time test participants parkinsons disease reaction time however participants major depressive disorder overall improvement reaction time rogers lees smith eventually concluded bradyphrenia explored presence parkinsons disease similar psychomotor retardation major depressive disorder differences found notable impairments dopaminergic areas seen groups disorders could call similarities two bradyphrenia also present within neurological conditions alzheimers disease another neurological condition involving cognition researchers found presence cognitive slowing patients pate margolin found caused damage cortical cortical central outer region cerebellum major component brain controls motor particularly older population evidence bradyphrenia seen patients alzheimers evidence bradyphrenia patients depression present previous neurological study elderly patients found patients depression shown significant delay thought processing patients depression additional neurological damage part yet rogers et al examined bradyphrenia whether indicated mental rotation melancholic nonmelancholic depressed patients researchers would ask participants participate numerous tasks whereby performance would measured reaction time accuracy tasks participants asked perform included able determine direction stimulus screen pointing towards also told determine stimulus shown normal positioning whether study researchers concluded melancholic participants major depression slowing reaction time higher contrast control group indicated presence bradyphrenia researchers drawn conclusion lesser slowness nonmelancholic depressed groups tasks intense enough draw bradyphrenia also observed huntingtons disease examine role bradyphrenia within conditions researchers used tower london test task requires cognitive study shown significant increase time took patients huntingtons solve participants schizophrenia however performed tasks smaller amount time faster control group within hanes suggested bradyphrenia schizophrenia common seen huntingtons experts including martin et al discovered bradyphrenia seen one first stages ramifications overdosing opioid like heroin bradyphrenia however considered presence bradyphrenia minor martin et al found stage three symptoms overdose entailed high risk around reach described stage three case report done man hospitalised ten days released notable impairments patient hospitalised several days later showing abnormal behaviours specialists could describe patients abnormal behaviour included diminished attention span well unable remember minor details researchers justified worsening behaviour abnormal neurological activity within prefrontal patients cognitive abilities improved use antioxidant therapy yet acts abnormal behaviours still currently pharmaceutical medications directly increase rate thoughts patients bradyphrenia treatments parkinsons disease imposed model treatment bradyphrenia cases researchers able treat condition patients time encephalitis lethargica period rise bradyphrenia seen many cases one case russia believed condition could treated steroid therapy patients condition improved three months using another recent case woman diagnosed cerebral amyloid angiopathy caa described symptoms bradyphrenia showing abnormalities within prefrontal cortex brain magnetic resonance imaging system mri shown significant increase patient put steroid therapy researchers mchugh et al found significant improvement cognitive abilities effectiveness steroid therapy observed within mri improvement number lesions decreased well shift behaviours one trial found bradyphrenia well bradykinesia could treated using combination ldopa carbidopa regimen combination believed alter effects parkinsons short term combination brought positive results behaviours patients yet researchers found longterm combination provided reverse effect accelerating cognitive slowing brain bradyphrenia motor movement antagonists class drugs found provide positive outcomes throughout treatment parkinsons studies shown oral admission antagonist target specific receptors brain crossing barrier alter rate cognitive thought psychiatrist kaminski found improvement condition parkinsons disease positive correlation
