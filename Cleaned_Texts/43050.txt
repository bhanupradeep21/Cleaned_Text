roughly textured indicating presence cartilaginous covering lateral condyle tibia wild noted several small elements mm size identified cartilage given grainy irregular surfaces unlike bone cartilage rarely preserved fossils case might preserved thanks absorption calcium salts elements located close attachment site achilles tendon area ankle experienced highest stresses life wild argued may represent sesamoids small structures embedded within tendons alternatively could calcified pieces cartilage saurischian reptile hipped dinosaurs subdivided two major groups herbivorous sauropodomorphs mostly carnivorous theropods sauropodomorpha consists quadrupedal sauropods characterized straight columnar limbs well several early basal earlydiverging forms mostly bipedal limb bones angled wild description argued early jurassic ohmdenosaurus must sauropod limb clearly columnar tibia massive seen basal sauropodomorphs upper joint surface perpendicular long axis bone demonstrating limb straight standing furthermore astragalus lacks ascending process upwards directed bony projection typical bipedal forms strongly reduced absent sauropods due differences weight distribution consequence columnar limbs hand wild noted several basal features typical basal sauropodomorphs absent sauropods including sandal shape astragalus stepped configuration lower articular surface tibia oval shape upper end tibia intermediate circular shape seen basal sauropodomorph plateosaurus strongly elliptical shape seen later sauropods cetiosaurus wild concluded ohmdenosaurus shows mosaic primitive derived features probably needs placed new family basal sauropods described since relationships forms remain vague given incompleteness ohmdenosaurus specimen john stanton mcintosh tentatively included ohmdenosaurus vulcanodontidae noting tibia similar namegiving genus family later vulcanodontidae demonstrated polyphyletic form natural group therefore fell jay nair colleagues compared ohmdenosaurus australian genus rhoetosaurus noting tibiae genera relatively slender seen later sauropods unlike robust tibiae early genera rhoetosaurus geologically younger ohmdenosaurus latter would earliest known sauropod slender tibia astragalus rhoetosaurus found similar ohmdenosaurus sebastian stumpf colleagues reported fragmentary sauropod remains toarcian grimmen northeastern germany including four elements pelvic girdle part vertebra although roughly contemporaneous ohmdenosaurus directly compared latter include elements hind limbs grimmen remains however resemble early sauropod tazoudasaurus morocco ohmdenosaurus appears closer rhoetosaurus stumpf colleagues therefore suggested ohmdenosaurus grimmen sauropod closely related oliver rauhut colleagues included ohmdenosaurus phylogenetic analysis found unstable placed different positions tree different variants analysis within outside michael simms colleagues suggested ohmdenosaurus might considered nomen dubium dubious name due incompleteness omar regalado fernández ingmar werneburg included ohmdenosaurus phylogenetic analysis placed within eusauropoda group comprises sauropods except basal forms
