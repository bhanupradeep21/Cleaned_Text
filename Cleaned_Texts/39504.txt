camptocormia also known bent spine syndrome bss symptom multitude diseases commonly seen elderly identified abnormal thoracolumbar spinal flexion forward bending lower joints spine occurring standing position order classified bss anterior flexion lower back bending must degrees anteriorly classification differentiates similar syndrome known although camptocormia symptom many diseases two common origins neurological muscular camptocormia treated alleviating underlying condition causing therapeutic measures lifestyle changes camptocormia comes two greek words meaning bend κάμπτω kamptō trunk κόρμος kormos coined alexandreachille souques b rosanoffsaloff two men also created definition disease widely accepted disorder first clinically studied around time first world war believed psychogenic conversion disorder resulted severe trauma war souques others treated patients psychological therapy early versions electrotherapy samuel sandler used similar approach treat soldiers second world view bss conversion disorder led lack awareness conditions diagnoses physicians time progressed advances made knowledge neuroscience physiology biological mechanisms behind irregular bending identified current medically preferred term condition bent spine syndrome psychological origin associated bss limited elderly average age onset common amongst men late age onset largely due increased preponderance conditions causing symptom older individuals muscular weakness neurological disorders like parkinsons disease bss negative stigma affected may perceived differently due condition example elderly individual condition may viewed physically weak severe bending back caused conditioncitation needed primary symptom camptocormia abnormal forward bending torso bending becomes worse walking appear affected individual lying horizontal position alleviation condition indicates manifestation another disease ailment due spine actually somewhat ironic since medically accepted name condition bent spine syndrome affected individual abnormal bending consists anterior flexion greater bending physical limitations caused conditions associated disease usually impossible affected person achieve fully erect position addition patients camptocormia often experience low back pain result condition bss often appears individuals parkinsons disease muscular dystrophies endocrine disorders inflammatory conditions myositis mitochondrial previously mentioned disease common older individuals initially identified camptocormia classified psychogenic disease although condition sometimes psychogenic manifestation camptocormia typically originates either muscular neurological diseases however due wide variety pathologies resulting camptocormia singular cause influential condition myopathic origin bss secondary various muscular disorders occur primary etiologies termed secondary primary bss respectively idiopathic primary bss lateonset myopathy progressive muscular weakness detected spinal extensor muscles elderly patients predominant pathogenesis primary bss typically related fibrosis fatty infiltration muscular tissues mitochondrial changes due aging specifically weakening occurs paravertebral muscles patients paravertebral muscles great influence walking stance gait patient fatty infiltration degradation muscle lead characteristics easily define bss anterior flexion back combined ability keep upright kind support eg holding onto secondary bss multitude causes making hard pinpoint specific muscular disorder examples diseases secondary bss symptom myopathies caused muscular dystrophies neuromuscular disorders inflammatory muscle diseases metabolic endocrine disorders mitochondrial muscle biopsy clearly demonstrate whether primary bss secondary bss affecting patient primary bss much identifiablecitation needed multitude neurological disorders cause bss including motor neuron disease cns disorders early amyotrophic lateral usually bent spine caused dysfunctioning extensor spinal muscles neurological cause neurological origin bss may also result damage basal ganglia nuclei part cerebral cortex play major role bodily positioning damage part brain inhibit proper flexion extension muscles necessary maintaining upright position additionally neurotransmitter dopamine plays key role operation basal ganglia abnormally low dopamine concentration associated parkinsons disease causes dysfunction basal ganglia associated muscle groups leading studies estimated prevalence bss people affected parkinsons several gene mutations identified patients camptocormia include gene axial myopathy dmpk gene myotonic dystrophy genes related dysferlinopathy parkinsons disease genes could serve targets gene therapy treat condition years order qualify patients condition bss bending angle must greater degrees presence condition easy note cause condition much difficult discern conditions considered bss include vertebral fractures previously existing conditions ankylosing spondylitis lowerback ct scans mris typically used visualize cause identification cause done histochemical cellular analysis muscle biopsy camptocormia becoming progressively found patients parkinsons diagnosis parkinsonsassociated camptocormia includes use imaging brain spinal cord along electromyography muscle biopsies muscle biopsies also useful tool diagnose camptocormia muscle biopsies found variable muscle fiber sizes even endomysial fibrosis may markers bent spine syndrome addition disorganized internal architecture little necrosis regeneration marker camptocormia patients camptocormia present reduced strength stooped posture standing due weakened paraspinous muscles muscles parallel spine clinically limb muscles show fatigue repetitive paraspinous muscles undergo fat infiltration electromyography may used well diagnosis average paraspinous muscles affected individuals found myopathic limb muscles percent creatine kinase activity levels skeletal muscle diagnostic indicator identifiable blood tests due wide range causes camptocormia one treatment suits patients addition specific pharmacological treatment primary bss use analgesic drugs depends entirely intensity back pain muscularorigin bss alleviated positive lifestyle changes including physical activity walking cane nutritious diet weight loss worsening symptoms possible rare treatment underlying cause disease alleviate condition individuals secondary bss treatment options include drugs injections botulinum toxin electroconvulsive therapy deep brain stimulation surgical unfortunately many elderly individuals affected bss treated surgically due agerelated physical ailments long postoperative recovery condition lead excess pressure spine causing pain spine bent far patient may difficulties breathing pressure spine pressed lungs camptocormia may also lead muscle weakness upper back arthritis bonedegeneration loss bone strength injury spine slipped discs become increasingly significant camptocormia lead infection tumors diseases endocrine system connective tissues success treatment method largely dependent patient response therapeutic methods generally low clinical studies revealed camptocormia may hereditary however inheritance mechanism remains current areas research include molecular genetic studies aimed elucidating possible inheritance model along molecular pathological mechanisms proteins responsible bss research help facilitate improvement classification diagnosis treatment condition addition new technologies animal models postural abnormalities developed understand camptocormia design effective treatment one treatment methodogy promising treatment camptocormia deep brain stimulation previously deep brain stimulation bilateral stimulation subthalamic nucleus andor globus pallidus internus used treat patients parkinsons studies shown similar treatments could used patients severe camptocormia using
