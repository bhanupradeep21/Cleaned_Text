endoscopic carpal tunnel release ectr refers method performing carpal tunnel surgery using endoscope arthroscopic device provide visualization anatomic structures endoscopic techniques carpal tunnel release involve one two smaller incisions less half inch instrumentation introduced including synovial elevator probes knives endoscope used visualize underside transverse carpal medical source endoscopic methods divide subcutaneous tissues palmar fascia degree open method many studies done determine whether perceived benefits limited endoscopic arthroscopic release significant many surgeons embraced limited incision methods considered procedure choice many surgeons respect idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome supporting results previously mentioned series cite difference rate complications either method surgery thus broad support either surgical procedure using variety devices incisions ectr carpal tunnel release surgery many different blades techniques primary goal release transverse carpal ligament tcl overlies compresses median nerve within carpal tunnel compression median nerve leads characteristic pins needles paresthesia thumb index long ring fingers primary benefit endoscopic releases versus traditional open carpal tunnel release often perceived smaller incision size ectr incisions commonly less cm compared mm longitudinal incision traditional carpal tunnel release however incision size factor differentiates two methods principle behind endoscopic release palmar aponeurosis thick tough layer tissue lines palm divided endoscopic methods addition endoscopic methods offer less dissection interruption tissue planes open methods endoscopic methods divide subcutaneous tissues palmar fascia degree open method thus rapid recovery generally touted ectr normal skin tcl incised surgery either open endoscopic way treat carpal tunnel syndrome metaanalysis supports conclusion endoscopic carpal tunnel release favored open carpal tunnel release terms reduction scar tenderness increase grip pinch strength followup use endoscope release carpal tunnel first described okutsu et alnonprimary source flexible clear plastic tube used standard endoscope

lastly several years later distal portal single incision distal palm advocated group louisville many studies done determine whether perceived benefits limited endoscopic arthroscopic release truly significant one prospective randomized multicenter study found significant differences two groups regard secondary quantitative outcome measurements however open technique resulted tenderness scar endoscopic method prospective randomized study using microaire system conducted trumble diao et al revealed good clinical outcomes patient satisfaction achieved quickly endoscopic method carpal tunnel release used study concluded singleportal endoscopic carpal tunnel release surgery safe effective method treating carpal tunnel syndrome significant difference rate complications cost surgery two groups however open technique resulted greater scar tenderness first three months surgery well longer time patients could return shown recent literature learning curve hand surgeon begins use endoscopic technique release transverse carpal however recent study also showed significant morbidity associated endoscopic method brown et al conducted prospective randomized multicenter study found
