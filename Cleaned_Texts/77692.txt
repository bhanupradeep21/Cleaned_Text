iatrogenesis causation disease harmful complication ill effect medical activity including diagnosis intervention error first used sense term introduced sociology ivan illich alleging industrialized societies impair quality life overmedicalizing iatrogenesis may thus include mental suffering via medical beliefs practitioners iatrogenic events obvious like amputation wrong limb whereas others like drug interactions evade recognition estimate million negative effects treatment occurred estimated persons died adverse effects medical treatment estimated iatrogenic conditions need result medical errors mistakes made surgery prescription dispensing wrong therapy drug fact intrinsic sometimes adverse effects medical treatment iatrogenic example radiation therapy aggressive therapeutic effect frequently produce iatrogenic effects hair loss hemolytic anemia diabetes insipidus vomiting nausea brain damage lymphedema infertility etc loss function resulting required removal diseased organ iatrogenic case diabetes consequential removal part pancreas incidence iatrogenesis may misleading cases example ruptured aortic aneurysm fatal cases survival rate treatment ruptured aortic aneurysm patients die operation still considered iatrogenic deaths procedure remains better bet probability death left untreated situations may involve actual negligence faulty procedures pharmacotherapists produce handwritten prescriptions drugs another situation may involve negligence patients brushed given proper care due providers holding prejudice reasons sexual orientation ethnicity religion immigration status etc cause mistrust patients providers leading patients go treatment resulting deaths common iatrogenic effect caused drug interaction ie pharmacotherapists fail check medications patient taking prescribe new ones interact agonistically antagonistically thereby potentiating attenuating intended therapeutic effect situations cause significant morbidity mortality adverse reactions allergic reactions drugs even unexpected pharmacotherapists also classified iatrogenic evolution antibiotic resistance bacteria iatrogenic bacterial strains resistant antibiotics evolved response prescription antibiotic certain drugs vaccines toxic right therapeutic doses mechanism action alkylating antineoplastic agents example cause dna damage harmful cancer cells regular cells however alkylation causes severe sideeffects actually carcinogenic right potential lead development secondary tumors similar manner arsenicbased medications like melarsoprol used treat trypanosomiasis cause arsenic poisoningmedical citation needed adverse effects appear mechanically design surgical instruments may decades old hence certain adverse effects tissue trauma may never properly characterizedcitation needed psychiatry iatrogenesis occur due misdiagnosis including diagnosis false condition case example potentially iatrogenic circumstance misdiagnosis bipolar disorder another disorder especially pediatric patients considered major depressive disorder prescribed stimulants conditions somatoform disorder chronic fatigue syndrome theorized significant sociocultural iatrogenic posttraumatic stress disorder hypothesized prone iatrogenic complications based treatment certain antipsychotics shown reduce brain volumes animals humans longterm populations may risk underdiagnosis misdiagnosis psychiatric disorders including identified substance abuse end spectrum dissociative identity disorder considered minority theorists wholly iatrogenic disorder bulk diagnoses arising tiny fraction degree association particular condition iatrogenesis unclear cases controversial overdiagnosis psychiatric conditions assignment mental illness terminology may relate primarily clinician dependence subjective assignment pathological nomenclature rarely benign process easily riseclarification needed level emotional iatrogenesis especially alternatives outside diagnostic naming process considered many former patients come conclusion difficulties largely result power relationships inherent psychiatric treatment led rise antipsychiatry meessen et al used term iatrogenic poverty describe impoverishment induced medical impoverishment described households exposed catastrophic health hardship every year worldwide households fall poverty due health care expenses study reported united states illness medical debt caused half personal especially countries economic transition willingness pay health care increasing supply side stay behind develops fast regulatory protective capacity countries often lagging behind patients easily fall vicious cycle illness ineffective therapies consumption savings indebtedness sale productive assets eventually poverty social critic ivan
