humans animals adrenocortical hormones hormones produced adrenal cortex outer region adrenal gland polycyclic steroid hormones variety roles crucial body response stress example fightorflight response also regulate functions body threats homeostasis injury chemical imbalances infection psychological stress initiate stress response examples adrenocortical hormones involved stress response aldosterone cortisol hormones also function regulating conservation water kidneys glucose metabolism adrenocortical hormones divided three classes function mineralocorticoids glucocorticoids androgens adrenocortical hormones considered steroid hormones shared characteristic cholesterol backbone structures different steroids differ types locations additional atoms cholesterol cholesterol backbone consists four hydrocarbon rings three cyclohexane rings one cyclopentane contribute insolubility aqueous environments however hydrophobic nature allows readily diffuse plasma membrane important function steroid hormones rely cellular response pathways restore homeostatic imbalance initiated hormone release synthesis adrenocortical steroid hormones involves chain oxidationreduction reactions catalyzed series enzymes synthesis begins molecule cholesterol shared intermediates pathways branching shared intermediates different classes steroids synthesized steroids synthesized cholesterol

caused either adrenal tumor hypersecretion adrenocorticotropic hormone acth anterior pituitary predominantly due excess glucocorticoid cortisol secretion typically regulated hypothalamus secretes corticotropinreleasing hormone crh pituitary gland stimulating pituitary secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone acth acth travels adrenal glands induces release cortisol cushing syndrome process occurs excess symptoms individual cushing syndrome include low tissue protein levels due muscle bone atrophy high blood glucose levels sodium levels also see increase results fluid retention tissues elevated

syndrome aims reduce high levels cortisol circulating human body course action ultimately depends cause hypersecretion cushing induced repeated synthetic steroid use treat inflammatory diseases also caused tumor pituitary gland adrenal gland either case treatment may rely removal tumor adrenal without adrenal glands human body unable supply hormones produces therefore requires hormone replacement therapy addison disease autoimmune disorder affects adrenal cortex unable efficiently secrete hormones immune system specifically targets cells adrenal cortex destroys addison disease also caused severe infection tuberculosis symptoms include hypoglycemia decreased blood sodium levels increased blood potassium levels caused deficiency aldosterone electrolyte imbalances induce nerve muscle issues symptoms include fatigue salt cravings weight loss increased skin increased skin pigmentation caused deficiency adrenocortical hormone hydrocortisone normal behavior would negative feedback pituitary gland stimulating pituitary gland decrease secretion corticotropin hydrocortisone able produced addison disease pituitary gland continues secrete corticotropin binds receptor melanocytestimulating hormone causes melanocytes produce pigment thus darkening skin standard treatment addison disease hormone replacement therapy mineralocorticoids glucocorticoids longer able
