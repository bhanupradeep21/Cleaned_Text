enabling horse satisfy like animals horses sensitive sweet taste particularly soluble carbohydrates energy resource needed also sensitive salty tastes probably due vital need replenish sodium evidence horses may specifically seek salty foods case according leblanc horses avoid strong acidity order preserve teeth aversion strong bitterness enables avoid ingesting however wide range taste sensitivities among individuals ronald randa colleagues tested foals sensitivity four basic flavors without revealing general trends sensitivity preference among horses generally selective plant diet
