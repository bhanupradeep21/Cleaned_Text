erwin bünning january october german biologist famous contributions field chronobiology proposed model endogenous circadian rhythms governing plant photoperiodism contributions bünning considered cofounder chronobiology along jürgen aschoff colin bünning born january hamburg germany heinrich bünning hermine bünning born winkler teacher german english mathematics biology bünnings father primary academic influence erwins early life passing erwin passion botany bünning received primary education hamburg bünning attended university göttingen university berlin october studied biology chemistry physics philosophy bünning earned doctorate philosophy university berlin may time bünning married wife eleanore two would later three bünning took assistantship otto renner university jena one germanys largest botanical institutes rise nazi party germany early renner stood open opposition nazis publicly defending jewish scientists similarly bünning considered communist sympathizer stance likely influenced bünnings father social democrat opposed nazis bünnings political beliefs created tension students response tension bünning left jena lectureship east prussian university bünning published model plant photoperiodism wherein proposed endogenous internal circadian rhythms enable plants measure day length bünnings model photoperiodism would go largely unnoticed scientific community chaired cold spring harbor symposium biological clocks colin pittendrigh drew attention bünnings work named model plant photoperiodism bünning bünning spent year traveling java sumatra observations islands resulted book tropische regenwalder tropical rainforests upon return germany bünning conscripted german military world war ii military authorities appointed bünning associate professor university strasbourg war bünning became full professor university cologne moving university tübingen next year stayed retirement tübingen bünning entered workspace role model wilhelm pfeffer man postulated orientation plants space changes time bünning would later publish biography career bünning published papers fields plant physiology general biology well popular textbook plant physiology bünning suffered drinking alzheimers died october tübingen germany contracting following death german newspaper schwäbisches tagblatt described bünning one greatest botanists changes positioning plant leaves course day observed early century bc androsthenes alexander great historian phenomenon however researched jeanjacques dortous de mairan provided experimental data mimosa plants close leaves night movement persists rhythmically constant wilhelm pfeffer bünning role model put forward movements might controlled endogenous biological theory formed foundation bünning later prior bünning work prevailing hypothesis circadian rhythms hourglass hypothesis postulates circadian rhythmicity within organism entirely driven external lightdark cycle organisms hourglass reset bünning however proposed biological clocks endogenous synchronize daily stimuli unlike hourglass hypothesis bünnings hypothesis proposes circadian rhythmicity derives interaction light circadian pacemaker external stimuli general premise bünnings hypothesis became model circadian time keeping across species many chronobiologists even present base bünning proposed organisms rely circadian rhythm sensitivity light measure photoperiod demonstrated plants open close leaves insects eclose according circadian rhythms even continuous light crossing experiments bean plants different periods demonstrated next generation periods intermediate durations supporting suggestion circadian rhythms bünning also demonstrated artificial photoperiod induce flowering inappropriate times supporting model endogenous oscillators entrained external stimuli create artificial photoperiods bünning exposed plants lightdark cycle indicative specific season long days short nights summer entraining plants spring summer photoperiod bünning able induce flowering even actual season fall results bünning proposed biological clocks sensors light dark relationship aids photoperiodic published works provided key synthesis existing evidence biological clocks across species including plants flies fungi work physiological clock hailed milestone field chronobiology later works plant physiology helped apply work photoperiodism practical demonstrated plants different inherent periods would become desynchronized constant work provided evidence dismissal factor x hypothesis held circadian rhythms endogenous instead reliant unknown external stimulus factor bünning pioneer bünning hypothesis later known external coincidence model model proposed circadian rhythm photoperiodic photosensitivity plants day length increases spring summer seasons example light hits plants photosensitive phase triggering physiological behavioral response bünning hypothesis proposed light two functions light primary zeitgeber synchronization biological light triggers photoinductive responses certain phases circadian bünning received many honors life field chronobiology botany chaired cold spring harbor symposium biological clocks next year bünning elected corresponding member botanical society life also elected honorary member japanese botanical society german botanical society american society plant physiologists swiss botanical became elected member american philosophical society heidelberg academy sciences humanities bavarian academy sciences humanities german academy scientists leopoldina addition elected foreign associate american national academy sciences foreign member royal society london honorary fellow indian academy sciences bünning charles reid barnes life membership meritorious work plant universities glasgow freiburg erlangen conferred honorary doctorates university bünning considered many father field work measuring freerunning period plant rhythms experiments crossbreeding strains plants different periods aided development bünning invited k chandrashekaran india conduct biological oscillation workshop madurai kamaraj
