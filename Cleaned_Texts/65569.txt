ophthalmosaurus meaning eye lizard greek genus ichthyosaur known middlelate jurassic possible remains earliest cretaceous around million years ago also known relatively mediumsized ichthyosaur measuring ft long weighing kg named extremely large eyes jaw containing many small robust teeth major fossil finds genus recorded europe second species possibly found north america ophthalmosaurus mediumsized ichthyosaur measuring ft long weighing kg robust streamlined body nearly wide tall frontal view like derived ichthyosaurs ophthalmosaurus powerful tail ending pronounced bilobed caudal fluke whose lower half formed around caudal spine whereas upper lobe made entirely soft tissue limbs ophthalmosaurus short rounded forelimbs noticeably larger hind limbs combination rather inflexible trunk powerful caudal fluke reduced limbs suggests tailpropelled mode locomotion limbs helping steering differing anguilliform eellike way basal ichthyosaurs swam skull ophthalmosaurus long slender
