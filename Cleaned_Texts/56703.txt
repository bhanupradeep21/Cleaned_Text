body schema postural model keeps track limb position neurologist sir henry head originally defined postural model body actively organizes modifies impressions produced incoming sensory impulses way final sensation body position locality rises consciousness charged relation something happened postural model keeps track limb position plays important role control action involves aspects central brain processes peripheral sensory proprioceptive systems thus body schema considered collection processes registers posture ones body parts space schema updated body movement typically nonconscious process used primarily spatial organization action therefore pragmatic representation body spatial properties includes length limbs limb segments arrangement configuration segments space shape body body schema also plays important role integration use tools clear differentiation body schema body image developed gradually henry head english neurologist conducted pioneering work somatosensory system sensory nerves together british neurologist gordon morgan holmes first described concept concept first termed postural schema describe disordered spatial representation patients following damage parietal lobe brain head holmes discussed two schemas schemata one body schema registration posture movement another body schema localization stimulated locations body surface body schema became term used organized models term definition first suggested head holmes endured nearly century research clarifications become known neuroscience neuroscientists patrick haggard daniel wolpert identified seven fundamental properties body schema spatially coded modular adaptable supramodal coherent interpersonal updated body schema represents position configuration body object space combination sensory information primarily tactile visual contributes representation limbs integration allows stimuli localized external space respect example haggard wolpert shows combination tactile sensation hand information joint angles arm allow rapid movements said arm swat body schema represented wholly single region recent fmri functional magnetic resonance imaging studies confirm earlier results example schema feet hands coded different regions brain fingers represented separate part plastic changes body schema active continuous example gradual changes body schema must occur lifetime individual grows absolute relative sizes body parts change life development body schema also shown occur young children one study showed children older children handled spoons optimally comfortably grip use whereas younger children tended reach dominant hand regardless orientation spoon eventual ease shortterm plasticity shown integration tools body rubber hand illusion also shown rapid reorganization body schema timescale seconds showing high level plasticity speed body schema illusion participants view dummy hand stroked paintbrush hand stroked identically participants may feel touches hand coming dummy hand even dummy hand way hand nature body schema integrates proprioceptive sense relative position neighbouring parts ones body tactile information maintain threedimensional body representation however sensory information particularly visual representation body simultaneous participation means combined representations within body schema suggests involvement process translate primary information eg visual tactile etc single sensory modality abstract amodal body schema function properly must able maintain coherent organization must able resolve differences sensory inputs resolving intersensory inconsistencies result interesting sensations experienced rubber hand thought individuals body schema used represent ones body bodies others mirror neurons thought play role interpersonal characteristics body schema interpersonal projection ones body schema plays important role successfully imitating motions hand gestures especially maintaining handedness location gesture necessarily copying exact motion working body schema must able interactively track movements positions body parts neurons premotor cortex may contribute function class neuron premotor cortex multisensory multisensory neurons responds tactile stimuli also visual stimuli neuron tactile receptive field responsive region body surface typically face arms hands neuron also responds visual stimuli space near tactile receptive field example neurons tactile receptive field covers arm neuron respond visual stimuli space near arm shown graziano colleagues visual receptive field update arm movement translating space arm similar bodypartcentered neuronal receptive fields relate face neurons apparently monitor location body parts location nearby objects respect body parts similar neuronal properties may also important ability incorporate external objects body schema tool use idea extended body schema aside proprioceptive visual sensory components contribute making mental conception ones body processes contribute body schema also able incorporate external objects mental conception ones part philosophical part neuroscience concept builds upon ideas plasticity adaptation attempt answer question body schema ends debate whether concept truly exists one side arguing body schema extend past body side believing perspective shared agree theory extended body schema follow reasoning line supports theories tool use studies attempts understanding tool assimilation used argue existence extended body schema experiment involving use interaction wool objects subjects tested ability perceive afterimages wool objects varying contexts subjects accustomed eyes dark room shown brief millisecond flash light intending produce afterimage effect arms held front experiment moving arm afterwards would make afterimage fade disappear moved thus indicating feature arm tracked integrated persons body schema test integration meaningless wool objects subjects experienced four different contexts situations fourth subjects experienced fading effect arm alone would thus indicate wool objects integrated body schema contributes support towards idea bodys using proprioceptive visual elements create extended body schema mechanical device acted intermediate subject active object subjects failure detect afterimage context indicates concept extension limited sensitive body directly contact alternate perspective body limit sort body schema example division found study discussion personal extrapersonal attention personal relates bodys sense body schema extrapersonal relates external research supports claim two categories purely distinct intermingle contrary extended body schema theory describes evidence primarily found subjects unilateral neglect case eds middleaged man right hemisphere brain damage tested hemispatial neglect using traditional measures sentence reading cancellation tests eds showed signs upon later examination showed signs whatsoever leading doctors believe normal however constantly issues physical therapy would claim able see left leg upon examination eds known particular type hemispatial neglect affected perception body motor function left side body negatively affected though totally compromised yet attempting tasks shaving would invariably shave left side face led researchers believe distinction personal extrapersonal neglect would thus reflect similar distinction body schema direct related disorders deafferentation occurs sensory input body reduced absent without affecting motor neurons famous case disorder iw lost sensory input neck resulting temporary paralysis forced learn control movement using conscious body image visual feedback result constant visual input lost activity walking becomes impossible complete task may result falling simply stopping iw requires constant attention tasks able complete accurately demonstrating automatic subconscious process integrating touch proprioception body schema actually autotopagnosia typically occurs left parietal lesions patients disorder make errors result confusion adjacent body parts example patient may point knee asked point hip disorder involves body schema localization errors may made patient body others spatial unity body within body schema damaged incorrectly segmented relation modular phantom limbs phenomenon occurs following amputation limb individual cases amputees report feeling part limb body part still taking amputee may perceive limb full control paralyzed common side effect phantom limbs phantom limb pain neurophysiological mechanisms phantom limbs occur still common theory posits afferent neurons since deafferented due amputation typically remap adjacent cortical regions within brain cause amputees report feeling missing limb touched seemingly unrelated part body stimulated face touched amputee also feels missing arm stroked specific location another facet phantom limbs efferent copy motor feedback responsible reporting position body schema attenuate quickly thus missing body part may attributed amputee still fixed movable asomatognosia somatoparaphrenia anosognosia anosodiaphoria allochiria hemispatial neglect involve cases involve aspects impaired body schema hemispatial neglect uncommon strokes sometimes cause necessary body schema able integrate form threedimensional representation body also plays important role tool studies recording neuronal activity intraparietal cortex macaques shown training macaque body schema updates include tools used reaching body humans body schema plays important role simple complex tool use far beyond extensive training also necessary mechanisms tools integrated body schema fully understood however studies longterm training shown interesting phenomena wielding tools hands crossed posture behavioral effects reverse similar way hands crossed thus sensory stimuli delivered way hands directly indirectly via tools studies suggest mind incorporates tools similar areas adjacent recent research short term plasticity body schema used individuals without prior training tools results derived relation afterimages body schema show tools incorporated body schema within seconds regardless length training though results extend species besides historically body schema body image generally lumped together used interchangeably illdefined science elsewhere two terms still commonly misattributed confused efforts made distinguish two define clear differentiable body image consists perceptions attitudes beliefs concerning ones body
