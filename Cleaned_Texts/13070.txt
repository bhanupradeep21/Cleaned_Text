field genetic experiments thomas hunt morgan drosophila display holometabolous method development meaning three distinct stages postembryonic life cycle radically different body plan larva pupa finally adult machinery necessary function smooth transition three phases develops embryogenesis embryogenesis larval stage fly develop hatch stage life known first larval instar cells produce adult structures put aside imaginal discs pupal stage larval body breaks imaginal disks grow produce adult body process called complete metamorphosis hours fertilization egg hatches larva undergoes three molts taking days called pupa pupa metamorphoses adult fly takes days entire growth process egg adult fly takes estimated days complete mother fly produces oocytes already anteriorposterior
