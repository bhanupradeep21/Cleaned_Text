see comprehensive amount sequence data accumulated early begerow et al schoch et al proposed region primary dna barcode region genetic identification open barcoding database fungi eukaryotes conserved flanking regions serve anchor points primers used pcr amplification moreover conserved nested region allows construction internal primers ie primers attaching complementary sequences within region

advantage using region molecular marker fungal dna barcode entire ribosomal gene cluster arranged tandem repeats ie multiple allows pcr amplification sanger sequencing even small material samples given dna fragmented due age degenerative hence high pcr success rate usually observed amplifying however success rate varies greatly among fungal groups nondikarya including paraphyletic mucoromycotina chytridiomycota blastocladiomycota saccharomycotina exception low success furthermore choice primers amplification introduce biases towards certain taxonomic fungus example universal
