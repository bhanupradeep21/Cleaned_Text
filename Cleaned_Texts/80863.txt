tissue frequently within skin surface may superficial pustules known boils deep skin abscesses lungs brain teeth kidneys tonsils major complications may include spreading abscess material adjacent remote tissues extensive regional tissue death main symptoms signs skin abscess redness heat swelling pain loss function may also high temperature fever superficial abscesses may fluctuant palpated wavelike motion caused movement pus inside internal abscess difficult identify signs include pain affected area high temperature generally feeling unwell internal abscesses rarely heal prompt medical
