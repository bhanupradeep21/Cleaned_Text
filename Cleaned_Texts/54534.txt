mastodonsauridae family capitosauroid temnospondyls fossils belonging family found north america greenland europe asia australia family capitosauridae synonymous mastodonsauridae mastodonsaurids generally large amphibians length estimates ranging meters genera like specially large reaching least meters genera like parotosuchus reached meters length still pretty large compared modernday amphibians mastodonsaurids including parotosuchus covered scaly skin unlike smooth skin modernday amphibians probably moved eellike motion another peculiar mastodonsaurid sclerothorax unusual features including elongated neural spines neural spines tallest front spine sclerothorax also large pectoral girdle interclavicle bone longer skull meaning sclerothorax proportionally largest interclavicle temnospondyl body sclerothorax covered small scalelike bony ossicles would embedded dermis life skull sclerothorax short wide roughly rectangular shape snout wider cheek region bones along midline skull roof also wide relative lot known information skulls mastodonsaurids example stanocephalosaurus one wellknown mastodonsaurids lot data skull skull stanocephalosaurus key features characteristic temnospondyls apparent flattened shape skull roof dorsal well ventral surfaces skull stanocephalosaurus well ornamented honeycombed patterns throughout palatal views skulls genus show narrow interpalatal vacuities well paired palatal tusks alternately functioning vomer palatine vomerine tusks directed backwards animal shows increased expansion pterygoids palatines well narrow posterior nostrils vomer also bears two vomerine rows transversal denticle row longitudinal denticle row runs along inner margin choana palatines ectopterygoids broader temnospondyls somewhat common within mastodonsaurids stanocephalosaurus also long triangular skull much longer broad elongated preorbital region continuously narrowing anteriorly obtuse rounded snout type skull similar mastodonsaurus also triangular stanocephalosaurus least straight conical teeth premaxilla maxilla combined gradually increasing size towards lot known information stanocephalosaurus skull regions previously inaccessible poorly preserved stanocephalosaurus observed xray microct scans including otic capsule delta groove exoccipital well parts arterial nervous system air pockets around stapes stanocephalosaurus hypothesized act resonance chambers meaning spoonshaped inner ear bone could related underwater hearing trait possibly associated early tetrapod evolution probably also appears members family act link anuran tympanum narrow head elongated snout stanocephalosaurus suggests stress levels biting slightly higher temnospondyls wider shorter skull skull also elongated preorbital region compared mastodonsaurids vertebrae stanocephalosaurus rhachitomous neural arch bipartite centrum divided large unpaired wedgeshaped intercentrum smaller paired pleurocentra anterior posterior views intercentrum dorsally halfring surrounding persistent notochord ventral lateral sides lateral ventral surfaces intercentrum smooth suggesting continuation cartilage due unfinished medial surface posterodorsal margin intercentrum also shows parapophysis articulation capitulum another wellknown mastodonsaurid terms fossil knowledge mastodonsaurus notably numerous skull specimens found germany large oval eye sockets midway along skull jaws lined conical teeth two large tusks project end lower jaw fitting openings palate emerging top skull jaw closed based recent research body mastodonsaurus crocodilelike shape earlier reconstructions longer trunk section longer tail greatly reduced limb bones joints poorly paracyclotosaurus yet another wellknown mastodonsaurid like genera family various species mastodonsaurid least three species including type species p davidi along two p crookshanki p morganorum completeness skeleton animal led accurate description small distortion head overlooked complete preservation skull jaws makes shape certain length cm right corner head essentially undistorted shows skull point greatest depth almost exactly high lower jaw lower jaw also symphysis height skull therefore point greatest height head essentially oval section cm high cm wide nostril orbit tympanic membrane directed upward whether eye could projected upward head give horizontal view similar frog difficult similar features cyclotosaurus subcyclotosaurus another good example mastodonsaurid skull characterized small tabular without trace horn round lappet approaches squamosal flange lateral tympanic membrane failing meet width occiput otic notches proportionately wide reflection small size skull skull otherwise normal mastodonsaurid structure specifically similar parotosuchus genera family skull also small internasal vacuity dorsal processes premaxillae lateral lines often shown continuous grooves welldefined borders deep groove maxilla begins immediately behind lateral nostril passes straight back lachrymal bone turns outward forward ends abruptly another groove appears begin maxilla immediately lateral described passes back insertion teeth full length bone supraorbital groove begins abruptly dorsal surface premaxilla immediately passes nasal extends back bone close suture lachrymal comes prefrontal passing frontal bone enters orbital border welldefined groove surrounds hinder part orbit turns vertically jugal backward cross point jugal quadratojugal squamosal meet continuing squamosal pass back body xenotosuchus member well known fragments discovered animal genus originally species parotosuchus like many mastodontosaurids large animal large head amphibian life history meant distinct shape skull roof would change generalized tadpolelike skull distinct adult head bones covered large pits grooves indicating extensive dermal armour head upper lower jaw tusks upper jaw situated second row teeth vomer palatine bone contrary related forms like mastodonsaurus stanocephalosaurus tusks lower jaw moderate size penetrate like mentioned xenotosuchus genus wetlugasaurus also one smaller less known skull measured around centimetres reached total length least metre ft although pretty large compared modernday amphibians wetlugasaurus still small compared mastodonsaurids mastodonsaurids piscivorous mainly preying small midsized fish although also ate landliving animals small archosaurs evidences including fossils smaller temnospondyls bear tooth marks made mastodonsauridlike animals likely mastodonsaurids caught food like living giant salamander waiting prey came near quickly opening enormous mouths swallowing prey whole probable food would small fishes cm long swam shoals mastodonsaurids aquatic animals rarely left water may completely unable leave water large quantities bones found suggests many species died en masse pools dried times mostly inhabited swampy pools fed mainly fish whose remains found fossilized
