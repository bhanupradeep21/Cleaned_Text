philipp eduard anton von lenard german pronunciation ˈfɪlɪp ˈleːnaʁt hungarian lénárd fülöp eduárd antal june may hungarianborn german physicist winner nobel prize physics work cathode rays discovery many properties one important contributions experimental realization photoelectric effect discovered energy speed electrons ejected cathode depends wavelength intensity incident light lenard nationalist antisemite active proponent nazi ideology supported adolf hitler important role model deutsche physik movement nazi period notably labeled albert einsteins contributions science jewish physics philipp lenard born pressburg pozsony todays bratislava june kingdom hungary lenard family originally come tyrol century mothers family originated baden parents father philipp von lenard winemerchant pressburg mother antonie baumann among mostly germanic ancestors also magyar ones young lenard studied pozsonyi királyi katolikus főgymnasium today gamča records autobiography made big impression especially personality teacher virgil studied physics chemistry vienna lenard left budapest returned pressburg moved heidelberg tender assistants position university budapest refused heidelberg studied illustrious robert bunsen interrupted one semester berlin hermann von helmholtz obtained doctoral degree worked budapest loránd eötvös posts aachen bonn breslau heidelberg kiel returned finally university heidelberg head philipp lenard institute lenard became member royal swedish academy sciences hungarian academy early work included studies phosphorescence luminescence conductivity flames physicist lenards major contributions study cathode rays began prior work cathode rays produced primitive partially evacuated glass tubes metallic electrodes across high voltage could placed cathode rays difficult study using arrangement inside sealed glass tubes difficult access rays presence air molecules lenard overcame problems devising method making small metallic windows glass thick enough able withstand pressure differences thin enough allow passage rays made window rays could pass laboratory alternatively another chamber completely evacuated windows come known lenard windows able conveniently detect rays measure intensity means paper sheets coated phosphorescent lenard observed absorption cathode rays first order proportional density material made pass appeared contradict idea sort electromagnetic radiation also showed rays could pass inches air normal density appeared scattered implying must particles even smaller molecules air confirmed j j thomsons work eventually arrived understanding cathode rays streams negatively charged energetic particles called quanta electricity short quanta helmholtz thomson proposed name corpuscles eventually electrons became everyday conjunction earlier experiments absorption rays metals general realization electrons constituent parts atom enabled lenard claim correctly part atoms consist empty space proposed every atom consists empty space electrically neutral corpuscules called dynamids consisting electron equal positive charge result crookes tube investigations showed rays produced irradiating metals vacuum ultraviolet light similar many respects cathode rays important observation energy rays photoelectric effect independent light latter observations explained albert einstein quantum effect theory predicted plot cathode ray energy versus frequency would straight line slope equal plancks constant h shown case years later photoelectric quantum theory work cited einstein awarded nobel prize physics suspicious general adulation einstein lenard became prominent skeptic relativity einsteins theories generally however dispute einsteins explanation photoelectric effect lenard grew extremely resentful credit accorded wilhelm röntgen received first nobel prize physics discovery despite fact röntgen german nonjew lenard wrote roentgen mother xrays since invented apparatus used produce lenard likened röntgens role midwife merely assists birth lenard received nobel prize physics recognition work lenard first person study termed lenard effect separation electric charges accompanying aerodynamic breakup water drops also known spray electrification waterfall conducted studies size shape distributions raindrops constructed novel wind tunnel water droplets various sizes could held stationary seconds first recognize large raindrops tearshaped rather shaped something like hamburger lenard remembered today strong german nationalist despised english physics considered stolen ideas nazi regime outspoken proponent idea germany rely deutsche physik ignore considered fallacious deliberately misleading ideas jewish physics meant chiefly theories albert einstein including jewish fraud relativity see also criticism theory lenard became chief aryan physics lenards book great men science history scientific progress first published english claimed men aryan individual scientists selected inclusion lenard include einstein marie curie twentiethcentury scientist publisher included appears remarkable understatement page xix english edition professor lenards studies men science preceded showed profound knowledge also admirable balance came men time apt let strong views contemporary matters sway judgment lifetime would consent certain modifications proposed last study series lenard retired heidelberg university professor theoretical physics achieved emeritus status expelled post allied occupation forces helmholtzgymnasium heidelberg named philipp lenard schule part
