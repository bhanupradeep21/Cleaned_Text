masiakasaurus genus small predatory noasaurid theropod dinosaurs late cretaceous madagascar malagasy masiaka means vicious thus genus name means vicious lizard type species masiakasaurus knopfleri named musician mark knopfler whose music inspired expedition crew named scott sampson matthew carrano catherine forster unlike theropods front teeth knopfleri projected forward instead straight unique dentition suggests specialized diet perhaps including fish small prey bones skeleton indicate masiakasaurus bipedal much shorter forelimbs hindlimbs knopfleri small theropod reaching ft long weighing kg masiakasaurus lived around million years ago along animals majungasaurus rapetosaurus rahonavis masiakasaurus member group noasauridae small predatory ceratosaurs found primarily south america remains masiakasaurus found late cretaceous maevarano formation northwestern madagascar first described journal nature fragmentary bones comprising around skeleton collected near village berivotra several parts skull including distinctive teeth found humerus upper arm bone pubis hindlimbs several vertebrae also additional specimens masiakasaurus described braincase premaxilla facial bones ribcage portions hands pectoral girdle coracoid much cervical dorsal vertebral column described first time discovery new material clarified many aspects noasaurid anatomy made genus among best known new finds however allow detailed study evolutionary relationships among ceratosaurs new material around skeleton currently distinctive characteristic masiakasaurus forwardprojecting procumbent front teeth teeth heterodont meaning different shapes along first four dentary teeth lower jaw project forward first tooth angled horizontal teeth long spoonshaped hooked edges carinae sharp edges weakly serrated serrations evident along rear edge posterior teeth back jaw also recurved laterally compressed flattened side resembling less unusual teeth carnivorous dinosaurs margin dentary curves downward alveoli tooth sockets front teeth directed forward fact alveolus first tooth actually situated lower bottom edge rest lower lower part rear edge dentary long prong known ventral process differs situation abelisaurids much shorter ventral process hand upper part rear edge dentary similar abelisaurids majungasaurus carnotaurus part bone possesses array four small structures three line socket connects surangular bone back lower jaw although surangular bone preserved several bones lower jaw including triangular angular bone gently curving prearticular bone damaged yet notably concave articular bone angular prearticular formed lower edge large rounded lower jaw known mandibular fenestra articular bone formed lower part jaw joint long tapering hyoid tongue bone also front teeth upper jaw also procumbent margin premaxilla curves slightly upward direct outward unlike skulls abelisaurids deep skull masiakasaurus long low lacrimal postorbital bones around eye textured bumpy projections including highly modified jaws teeth skull masiakasaurus possesses many general ceratosaurian characteristics overall morphology intermediate abelisaurids basal neck relatively narrow comparison abelisaurids bear stout neck ribs many theropods sshaped necks ribs would make neck rather stiff masiakasaurus back neck positioned almost horizontally giving slighter curve like abelisauroids vertebrae heavily pneumaticized hollowed relatively short neural spines pneumaticity limited neck foremost back vertebrae however pneumatic cavities also present ceratosaurs shoulder blade scapula shoulder girdle fuse single bone scapulocoracoid bone large broad even compared condition ceratosaurs scapula portion glenoid arm socket tapers towards back coracoid portion glenoid expanded curved bladelike structure abelisaurids arms extremely reduced size masiakasaurus noasaurids longer forelimbs humerus slender known bones hand relatively short related genus noasaurus large curved raptorial ungual claw originally interpreted sicklelike foot claw dromaeosaurids velociraptor recently reevaluated claw hand penultimate phalanx finger bone immediately precedes raptorial ungual noasaurus also known masiakasaurus similar appearance enlarged ungual however unknown assumed members genus four fingers middle two fingers longest ceratosaurians initial description masiakasaurus classified basal abelisauroid related laevisuchus noasaurus two poorly known genera named following year carrano et al placed masiakasaurus along laevisuchus noasaurus family noasauridae conducted phylogenetic analysis abelisauroids using characteristics masiakasaurus cladogram updated version analysis showing phylogenetic placement abelisauridae laevisuchus deltadromeus limusaurus ccg elaphrosaurus velocisaurus noasaurus masiakasaurus carrano et al distinguished two forms masiakasaurus robust form gracile form robust morph includes specimens thicker bones pronounced projections attachment ligaments muscles gracile form includes specimens slender less pronounced muscle attachments also unfused tibiae unlike fused tibiae robust form two varieties may indication sexual dimorphism masiakasaurus may also represent two distinct one specimen masiakasaurus right scapulocoracoid bears holes may puncture marks predation scavenging majungasaurus large abelisaurid maevarano formation may preyed upon holes may also result procument front teeth masiakasaurus likely adaptation grasping small prey would unsuitable tearing larger food apart front jaws carinae restricted base teeth would used tear prey back teeth however share general characteristics theropods suggesting served similar function masiakasaurus cutting several feeding behaviors proposed masiakasaurus basis unusual dentition front teeth would well suited grasping masiakasaurus may consumed small vertebrates invertebrates possibly even lee oconnor observed masiakasaurus would good subject analysis theropod growth considering abundance fossil material examine broad range ontogenetic stages study showed masiakasaurus grew determinately reached full maturity small body size competing theories masiakasaurus specimens represent juvenile form largerbodied theropod supported data masiakasaurus took years grow size large dog indicates rate growth slower comparably sized nonavian theropods finding supported unusual prominence parallelfibered bone known associated relatively slow growth however individuals genus grew faster crocodylians lee oconnor noted evolution slow growth gave dinosaur advantage minimizing nutritional investment allocated toward structural growth living semiarid seasonally stressful httpsenwikipediaorgwikimasiakasaurus
