cord blood umbilical cord blood blood remains placenta attached umbilical cord childbirth cord blood collected contains stem cells used treat hematopoietic genetic disorders cancer growing interest cell therapeutics companies developing genetically modified allogenic natural killer cells umbilical cord blood alternative car cell therapies rare diseases cord blood composed elements found whole blood red blood cells white blood cells plasma compared whole blood differences blood composition exist example cord blood contains higher numbers natural killer cells lower absolute number tcells higher proportion immature however interest cord blood mostly driven observation cord blood also contains various types stem progenitor cells mostly hematopoietic stem nonhematopoietic stem cell types also present cord blood example mesenchymal stem cells however present much lower numbers found adult bone endothelial progenitor cells multipotent unrestricted adult stem cells also found cord unlike embryonic stem cells pluripotent cord blood stem cells cord blood used way hematopoietic stem cell transplantation used reconstitute bone marrow following radiation treatment various blood cancers various forms efficacy similar adverse effects similar hematopoietic stem cell transplantation namely graftversushost disease cord blood genetically different person risk severe infection immune system assure smallest amount complications occur transplantation levels engraftment must present specifically neutrophils platelets must process neutrophil platelet production transplant however takes much longer stem many cases engraftment time depends cell dose amount stem cells obtained sample dr moises article umbilical cord blood found approximately less stem cells cord blood bone therefore sufficient amount cord blood must obtained order collect adequate cell dose however amount varies infant infant irreplaceable given idea quite new still lot research needs completed example still unknown long cord blood safely frozen without losing beneficial lower incidence cord blood compared traditional hsct despite less stringent hla match umbilical cord blood blood left placenta umbilical cord birth baby several methods collecting cord blood method commonly used clinical practice closed technique similar standard blood collection method technician cannulates vein severed umbilical cord using needle connected blood bag cord blood flows needle bag average closed technique enables collection ml cord collected cord blood cryopreserved stored cord blood bank future
