originally erected solely south african anomodont galeops palaeontologist robert broom galeops formerly included group small anomodonts known dromasaurs together galechirus galepus however phylogenetic analyses anomodonts since shown dromasaurs polyphyletic natural group related however kurkin assigned parasuminia galeopidae based alternative taxonomic classification anomodonts well synapsids proposed russian palaeontologist f ivakhnenko ivakhnenkos taxonomy family galeopidae consists traditional dromasaurs well anomodonts including suminia anomocephalus classed within suborder dromasaurida order dicynodontia proper ivakhnenko proposed galeopids grouped together use palinal jaw stroke pulling lower jaw backwards chew trait share dicynodonts considered indicate shared common
