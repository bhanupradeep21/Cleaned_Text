however dna barcoding could improve traditional methods following reasons dna barcoding increase taxonomic resolution harmonize identification taxa difficult identify lack experts ii accuratelyprecisely relate environmental factors specific taxa iii increase comparability among regions iv allows inclusion early life stages fragmented specimens v allows delimitation crypticrare species vi allows development new indices eg rarecryptic species may sensitivetolerant stressors vii increases number samples processed reduces processing time resulting increased knowledge species ecology viii noninvasive way monitoring using edna dna barcoding faster traditional morphological methods way training taxonomic assignment takes less time gain expertise dna methods becoming expert taxonomy addition dna barcoding workflow ie sample result generally quicker traditional morphological workflow allows processing samples dna barcoding allows resolution taxa higher eg family lower eg species taxonomic levels otherwise difficult identify using traditional morphological methods like eg identification via microscopy example chironomidae nonbiting midge widely distributed terrestrial freshwater ecosystems richness abundance make important ecological processes networks one many invertebrate groups used biomonitoring invertebrate samples contain many species chironomids often make much sample despite usually identified family level taxonomic expertise time may result different chironomid species different ecological preferences grouped together resulting inaccurate assessment water quality dna barcoding provides opportunity resolve taxa directly relate stressor effects specific taxa individual chironomid species example beermann et al dna barcoded chironomidae investigate response multiple stressors reduced flow increased finesediment increased barcoding found chironomid sample consisted operational taxonomic units otus ie barcodes sequences often equivalent morphological species otus displayed response types rather previously reported two response types recorded chironomids grouped together multiple stressor study similar trend discovered study macher et al discovered cryptic diversity within new zealand mayfly species deleatidium sp study found different response patterns molecular distinct otus stressors may change consensus mayfly sensitive despite advantages offered dna barcoding also suggested dna barcoding best used complement traditional morphological recommendation based multiple perceived challenges completely straightforward connect dna barcodes ecological preferences barcoded taxon question needed barcoding used biomonitoring example detecting target dna aquatic systems depends concentration dna molecules site turn affected many factors presence dna molecules also depends dispersion site eg direction strength currents really known dna moves around streams lakes makes sampling difficult another factor might behavior target species eg fish seasonal changes movements crayfish mussels release dna larger amounts certain times life moulting spawning dna soil even less known distribution quantity quality major limitation barcoding method relies barcode reference libraries taxonomic identification sequences taxonomic identification accurate reliable reference available however databases still incomplete especially smaller organisms eg fungi phytoplankton nematoda etc addition current databases contain misidentifications spelling mistakes errors massive curation completion effort around databases organisms necessary involving large barcoding projects example ibol project barcode life data systems bold reference however completion curation difficult timeconsuming without vouchered specimens certainty whether sequence used reference correct dna sequence databases like genbank contain many sequences tied vouchered specimens example herbarium specimens cultured cell lines sometimes images problematic face taxonomic issues whether several species split combined whether past identifications sound reusing sequences tied vouchered specimens initially misidentified organism may support incorrect conclusions must therefore best practice dna barcoding sequence vouchered many taxa however difficult obtain reference specimens example specimens difficult catch available specimens poorly conserved adequate taxonomic expertise importantly dna barcodes also used create interim taxonomy case otus used substitutes traditional latin binomials thus significantly reducing dependency fully populated

preventing correct taxonomic assignment edna sequences taxa present reference databases found edna sequences linked wrong name lead incorrect known causes different sampling scale size traditional molecular sample possible analysis dead organisms happen different ways methods depending organism group specific selection identification either method ie varying taxonomical expertise possibility identify certain organism groups respectively primer bias leading also potential biased analysis dna barcoding result underestimate species richness diversity studies suggest artifacts identification species present community major cause inflated problematic issue taxa represented low numbers sequencing reads reads usually removed data filtering process since different studies suggest lowfrequency reads may however real rare taxa may exist among lowabundance rare sequences reflect unique lineages communities make informative valuable sequences thus strong need robust bioinformatics algorithms allow differentiation informative reads artifacts complete reference libraries would also allow better testing bioinformatics algorithms permitting better filtering artifacts ie removal sequences lacking counterpart among extant species therefore would possible obtain accurate species cryptic diversity also result inflated biodiversity one morphological species may actually split many distinct
