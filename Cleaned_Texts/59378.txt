loeffler endocarditis form heart disease characterized stiffened poorlyfunctioning heart caused infiltration heart white blood cells known restrictive cardiomyopathy disease heart muscle results impaired diastolic filling heart ventricles ie large heart chambers pump blood pulmonary systemic circulation diastole part cardiac contractionrelaxation cycle heart fills venous blood emptying done previous systole ie eosinophilbased specific type heart damage first described swiss doctor wilhelm loeffler initially described disorder manifests restrictive cardiomyopathy ie poorly expanding contracting rigid heart infiltrated eosinophils showed replacement heart cells stiff fibrotic connective loeffler endocarditis regarded manifestation eosinophilic myocarditis disorder involves infiltration hearts muscular layer eosinophils leads three progressive clinical stages first stage involves acute inflammation subsequent death heart muscle cells stage dominated signs symptoms acute coronary syndrome angina heart attack congestive heart failure second stage endocardium ie interior wall heart forms blood clots break travel block various arteries clotting stage may dominate initial presentation individuals third stage fibrotic stage ie loeffler endocarditis wherein scarring replaces damaged heart muscle tissue cause poorly contracting heart andor heart valve disease recent publications commonly refer loeffler endocarditis historical term third stage eosinophilic signs symptoms loeffler endocarditis tend reflect many underlying disorders causing eosinophil dysfunction well widely differing progression rates cardiac damage cardiac symptoms detected individuals may suffer symptoms common cold asthma rhinitis urticarial allergic disorder cardiac manifestations include lifethreatening conditions cardiogenic shock sudden death due abnormal heart rhythms commonly however presenting cardiac signs symptoms disorder seen forms cardiomyopathy heart arrhythmia ventricular fibrillation seen irregular pulse heart rate cardiac arrhythmias symptoms arrhythmias chest palpitations dizziness light headedness fainting symptoms heart failure fatigue edema ie swelling lower extremities shortness hypereosinophilia ie blood eosinophil counts per microliter less commonly eosinophilia counts per microliter found vast majority cases valuable clues pointing rather types cardiomyopathies however elevated blood eosinophil counts may occur early phase disorder less specific laboratory findings implicate cardiac disorder necessarily eosinophilic myocarditis include elevations blood markers systemic inflammation eg c reactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate cardiac injury eg creatine kinase troponins abnormal electrocardiograms mostly st segmentt wave eosinophilic states may occur underlie loeffler endocarditis well stages eosinophilic myocarditis include primary secondary eosinophilias hypereosinophilias primary eosinophilias hypereosinophilias ie disorders eosinophil appears intrinsically diseased lead loeffler endocarditis clonal hypereosinophilia chronic eosinophilic leukemia hypereosinophilic secondary causes ie disorders diseases cause eosinophil become dysfunctional include allergic autoimmune diseases infections due certain parasitic worms protozoa viruses malignant premalignant hematologic disorders commonly associated eosinophilia hypereosinophilia adverse reactions various disorder develops eosinophilic penetration cardiac tissues leads fibrotic thickening portions heart similar endomyocardial fibrosis heart valves consequence heart becomes rigid poorly contractile heart valves may become stenotic insufficient ie reduced ability open close respectively damaged heart may also develop mural thrombi ie clots lay ventricle walls tend break flow block arteries condition often precedes fibrotic stage eosinophilic myocarditis termed thrombotic diagnosis loeffler endocarditis considered individuals exhibiting signs symptoms poor heart contractility andor valve disease presence significant increases blood eosinophil counts ancillary tests may help diagnosis echocardiography typically gives nonspecific occasional findings endocardium thickening left ventricular hypertrophy left ventricle dilation involvement mitral andor tricuspid valves gadoliniumbased cardiac magnetic resonance imaging useful noninvasive procedure diagnosing eosinophilic myocarditis supports diagnosis shows least two following abnormalities increased signal images b increased global myocardial early enhancement ratio myocardial skeletal muscle enhanced images c one focal enhancements distributed nonvascular pattern late enhanced images additionally unlike forms myocarditis eosinophilic myocarditis may also show enhanced gadolinium uptake however definitive test loeffler endocarditis cardiac muscle biopsy showing presence eosinophilic infiltrates since disorder may patchy multiple tissue samples taken procedure improve chances uncovering pathology case negative results exclude small studies case reports directed efforts towards supporting cardiac function relieving heart failure suppressing lifethreatening abnormal heart rhythms b suppressing eosinophilbased cardiac inflammation c treating underlying disorder cases loeffler endocarditis specific treatment regimens underlying disorder available studies recommend treating inflammatory component disorder nonspecific immunosuppressive drugs principally highdosage followed slowlytapering lowdosage maintenance corticosteroid regimens afflicted individuals fail regimen present cardiogenic shock may benefit treatment nonspecific immunosuppressive drugs azathioprine cyclophosphamide adjuncts replacements corticosteroids however individuals underlying therapeutically accessible disease treated disease seriously symptomatic cases individuals may treated concurrently corticosteroid regimen examples diseases underlying loefflers
