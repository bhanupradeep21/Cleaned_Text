holotypes leg bones anterolateral process lateral condyle sharply curved downward condition seen neovenator numerous tyrannosaurids led authors paper suggest trait characteristics leg bones may widespread among theropods previously subsequent analysis topotype material samathi colleagues draw comparisons metatarsals phuwiangvenator numerous theropods including allosaurus concavenator

trait also observed ontogenetic stages allosaurus authors state implies absence trait vayuraptor means distinction probably result alexis aranciaga rolando colleagues published analysis inferred forelimb musculature megaraptorans reasoning pursuing analysis uniquely large forearms megaraptorans seen group large theropods late cretaceous analysis focuses mostly derived members megaraptoridae comment muscular tendinous attachment sites bones phuwiangvenator outline several key differences manual phalanges unguals phuwiangvenator younger megaraptorans like megaraptor maip australovenator differences concentrated first finger hand derived megaraptorans hosts single giant claw presumed served purpose hunting feeding first claw phuwiangvenator lacks welldeveloped furrows present proximal extension claw species thought attachment sites powerful muscles enabling greater control flexibility finger movements one metatarsals holotype phuwiangvenator found signs greenstick fracture analyzed samathi colleagues inferred fracture taphonomic texture bone smooth medial side calloused lateral side interpreted signs fracture healed implies animal survived injury bone also twisted would normal condition second metatarsal would center foot life samathi colleagues compare fracture known pathologies theropod bones including seen specimens allosaurus yangchuanosaurus comparisons conclude injury likely caused external blunt force features bone determined computer tomography led authors conclude animal yet fully grown samathi colleagues suggest several possible causes fracture first suggest blow tail club ankylosaur discard hypothesis ankylosaur remains known early cretaceous thailand possible competition combat another large theropod also suggested several large theropods known nearby localities state direct evidence impossible determine without additional evidence conclude likely explanation animal hit foot hard object rock possibly fell cause type incomplete fracture evidence severe pathologies healed used authors infer herding behavior extinct animals known associations large theropods ie albertosaurus mapusaurus authors state possible phuwiangvenator exhibited similar behaviors however also suggest animal may simply survived short time injury lived none skull phuwiangvenator preserved animal presumed carnivorous however specialized arm musculature aid feeding sao khua formation thus far yielded continental fossils evidence marine fossils marine historically reports ichthyosaur plesiosaur teeth sao khua formation identified belonging crocodyliformes mostly nonmarine sediments sao khua formation composed red clays mudstones sandstones siltstones conglomerate rocks indicate fluvial environment also possessed lakes floodplains braided mesozoic formations
