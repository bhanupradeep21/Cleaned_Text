general previous studies pointed east asian cretaceous sauropod like nemegtosaurus phuwiangosaurus sister taxon huabeisaurus since year original description huabeisaurus new sauropod species erected cretaceous east asia many authors noted similarities among cretaceous east asian sauropods often suggesting several taxa belong clade grounded genus wellknown anatomy like nemegtosauridae opisthocoelicaudinae euhelopodidae cladistic support recently presented euhelopodidae consisted exclusively cretaceousaged members contrast traditional studies early cladistic analyses placed existence euhelopodidae jurassic forms earlier later analyses suggest degree endemism east asia though temporal duration remains uncertain broader scale interesting evolutionary pattern recognized wherein precretaceous jurassic asian sauropods lie outside neosauropoda whereas cretaceous asian sauropods titanosauriforms refining explaining paleobiogeographic patterns time rests detailed comparisons comprehensive phylogenetic studies including east asian sauropods currently several authors commented affinities huabeisaurus comparative cladistic grounds buffetaut et al reviewed sauropods thailand described late jurassic early cretaceous teeth similar euhelopodids traditional sense ie euhelopus mamenchisaurus omeisaurus others reminiscent nemegtosaurus phuwiangosaurus termed
