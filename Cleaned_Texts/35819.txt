dung middens also known dung piles dung mammals periodically return build used form territorial marker range animals known use including animals attracted middens variety purposes including finding food locating species dung beetle genus dicranocara richtersveld south western africa spend whole lifecycle close association dung dung middens also used field paleobotany relies fact ecosystem characterized certain plants turn act proxy dung middens useful often contain pollen means fossilized dung middens used paleobotany learn past common hippopotamus known use dung middens social tool middens created maintained bulls mark territorial mark scent upon midden bull approach midden reverse simultaneously defecate urinate mound using tail disperse paddle action called dung showering thought assert dominance middens usually several feet across constantly maintained bulls travels night dungmidden production also observed white black rhinoceroses middens shown provide cues age sex reproductive health middens feet across dung beetles frequently found middens lay eggs within mounds presence activity middens also aid pest parasite unlike hippopotamus rhino dung middens shared individuals necessarily related white rhino middens distinguished black color primarily grass composition whereas black rhino middens tend brown contain twigs branches product distinct midden formation insects first observed black garden ants lasius niger middens created ants called kitchen middens composed food scraps ant corpses reason behavior yet determined though thought serve feeding ground larvae dry bush weasel lemur southern gentle lemur known construct middens thought act primarily communal latrines communication tools signaling dominance social cues families spread large tracts hyrax procavia small herbivorous mammals across african continent normally inhabit rock shelters typically wandering meters shelter fear predation organisms use fixed dung middens urinating defecation often overhanging rocks protected areas layers dung quickly hardened sealed hyraceum creating mainly horizontal middens created antelopes well herbivores play important role providing nutrients certain areas land described duiker steenbok antelopes defecate exposed sites generally sandy soil thus enriching nutrientdeficient areas well depositing plant seed many gazelle species use middens see also animal latrine activities related territory maintenance advertisement olfactory due investment required maintain midden likely middens would randomly placed throughout environment rather would distributed different landmarks placing middens conspicuous sites could attract attention hunters provide hunters information location activity prey group researchers examined midden selection use mountain gazelles gazella gazelle central saudi arabia hypothesized middens used territorial communication purposes would tend placed largest trees immediate area additionally mountain gazelle midden selection use predictable would corroborate poachers claims gazelles easy hunt predictable ultimately found midden size freshness newly deposited feces could inform poachers gazelles

dikdik use dung middens peripheral territory markers olfactory communication dung middens also indicate sexual availability conspecifics white rhino dung mixture volatile organic compounds present signal defecators sex age class depending whether male female also indicate male territorial status female oestrous furthermore dung middens act communication center white rhino groups since species practices communal defecation allowing signals easily reach potential dung high parasite loads significant source fecaloral transmitted parasites impose high cost individual fitness wild quantifying studies parasite loads dung midden piles free ranging dikdik found nematode concentrations elevated vicinity middens comparison single fecalpellet groups dungfree feeding experiments found dikdiks tend avoid areas around dung middens feeding implying selective defecation selective foraging fecal avoidance could play part antiparasite behavior termites usually viewed herbivores decomposers present within ecological community cases link mammalian consumers microbial decomposers perform final breaking organic matter within local cycle nutrients case relationship termites mammalian dung middens observed south africa endemic blesbok harvester blesbok observed deliberately place dung middens vicinity harvester termite mounds suggested could due fact termite mounds built ground surrounding cleared allows blesboks greater ability detect predators foraging area termite presence vicinity could indicator richer resources available recycling nutrients since decomposers termites increase quality surrounding vegetation foraging suggests positive evolutionary feedback within interaction participants interaction providing resources pollen becomes fossilized dung midden provide information climate environment time period fossilized provides researchers better understanding historical environmental changes may occurred leading biodiversity present day environment various places fossilized hyrax small herbivorous mammals resembling rodents closely associated elephants manatees dung found rock shelter brandberg mountain namibia found possess fossilized pollen radiocarbon dating places years ago modern times making first evidence pollen late pleistocene southwestern africa pollen preserved layers dung piled upon sealed urine dung found time family asteraceae family known found namibia deserts suggests climate area may tropical time also hypothesized spores spread either aromatically aquatically another location earlier brandberg mountain sample years ago stoebe pollen found dung also presence fernspores indicating moist climate time moisture would likely melting evaporating glaciers heavy sources midden old years ago also used view climate presence certain pollen attributed rainfall necessary plants present flowering however changing presence plants also due erratic conditions grazing human interference nomadic people although thought explain aridity variation area certain times presence certain flowering plants midholocene require moisture leads conclusion increased summer rainfall also accounts seasonal variability many plants found dung rely upon winter much unknown origins unique biodiversity namib desert arid climate granitic substrate favor preservation organic material would typically help provide insight history common artifacts typically used study environmental conditions lake swamp deposits caves river systems dunefields thus difficult understand history namib desert use dung middens found various parts desert researchers able reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions specifically fossilized hyrax dung shallow cave shelters contains fossilized pollen dust contains information vegetation consumed hyrax pollen data provide information vegetation different time periods using data changes moisture levels desert areas desert northwest namibia pollen dust dung provides information types vegetation previously existed also important use radiocarbon dating information era dung town south africa researchers found conflicting data time period dung midden studying initial researchers failed consider
