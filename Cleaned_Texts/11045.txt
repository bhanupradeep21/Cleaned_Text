mediobasal hypothalamus researchers found feature conserved among species including due high percentage colocalization found neurokinin b cell bodies receptor groups suggested neurokinin b along kisspeptin dynorphin play role release findings important since gnrh release plays pivotal role regulating hormonal control bodies humans preeclampsia disorder found around pregnant women usually presenting week gestation prognosis ranging mild mild forms disease significantly impact mother fetus severe cases may lead blood vessel constriction increased blood pressure reduced blood flow turn damage various organ systems including brain liver kidneys heart dangers fetus occur restricted blood flow due high pressures causes lack blood flow uterus result number problems fetus including poor growth lack amniotic fluid placental cause preeclampsia known research indicates tachykinin peptide neurokinin b may play role placental expression gene codes nkb found high levels women usually
