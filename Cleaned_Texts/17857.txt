relevance theory framework understanding interpretation utterances first proposed dan sperber deirdre wilson used within cognitive linguistics pragmatics theory originally inspired work paul grice developed ideas since become pragmatic framework right seminal book relevance first published revised theory takes name principle every utterance conveys information relevant enough worth addressees effort process say something safely assume believe conveyed information worthwhile effort listen comprehend also relevant one compatible communicators abilities preferences tried make utterance easy understand possible given information content communicative skills key ingredients relevance theory utterances ostensive draw addressees attention fact communicator wants convey information inferential addressee infer communicator wanted convey based utterances literal meaning along addressees realworld knowledge sensory input information inferences intended communicator categorised explicatures implicatures explicatures utterance explicitly said often supplemented contextual information thus susan told kiwis sour might certain circumstances explicate susan told speaker kiwifruit susan grew sour judges fruit growers contest implicatures conveyed without actually stating utterance might example implicate susan needs cheered speaker wants addressee ring susan cheer relevance theory also attempts explain figurative language hyperbole metaphor irony critics stated relevance specialised sense used theory defined well enough measured criticisms include theory reductionist account large variety pragmatic phenomena relevance theory aims explain wellrecognized fact communicators usually convey much information utterances contained literal sense end sperber wilson argue acts human verbal communication ostensive draw addressees attention fact communicator wants convey information way automatically assert relevant addressees relevant utterance technical sense one many conclusions drawn low processing cost addressee uses information contained utterance together expectations relevance realworld knowledge well sensory input infer conclusions communicator wanted convey typically conclusions drawn utterance contains information related addressee already knows believes inference process literal meaning utterance one piece evidence among sperber wilson sum properties verbal communication calling ostensiveinferential characterized two layers intention part describe claims relevance theory rigorous level need define number technical terms introduced sperber wilson fact manifest individual capable accepting true probably true given set facts manifest individual comprises everything perceive remember infer including facts currently aware effect individuals cognitive environment triggered outside information utterances directed individual includes addition new facts beliefs well increase decrease confidence existing beliefs rejection also reorganization information schemas maybe structures simplify subsequent processing typically utterance cognitive effects contains new information somehow related addressees current cognitive environment draw conclusions combined old new cognitive effect helpful rather hindering individual eg providing true information opposed wrong information technically cognitive effect contributes positively fulfilment individuals cognitive functions utterance observed phenomenon relevant individual extent positive cognitive effects individual large mental processing effort achieve effects relevance comparative property positive cognitive effects less processing effort relevant examples illustrate concept relevance alice bob planning go trip next weekend alice tells bob highly relevant bob draw host conclusions modifying cognitive environment alice wants rethink plans wants inform bob wish bob agrees doesnt agree wants bring oilskins alice wants know bobs opinion matter etc contrast saying makes one piece new unrelated information manifest bob thus hardly relevant relevant doesnt tell bob anything new already seen finally sentence contains largely information requires effort process thus less relevant definition first cognitive principle relevance says human cognition tends geared maximisation relevance historically evolutionary pressure resulted cognitive systems recognise potentially relevant stimuli try draw relevant importantly issue hand second communicative principle relevance says every utterance conveys information principle summed every utterance conveys presumption optimal relevance alice tells bob something anything entitled expect alice wanted utterance consistent communicative principle relevance consequently alice tells bob something seem worth processing effort sentences something seems less relevant alice could put bob automatically search alternative interpretation easily accessible interpretation consistent communicative principle relevance one bob accepts right one stops processing interpretations would cost processing effort would thus violate condition b relevancetheoretic comprehension procedure follow path least effort computing cognitive effects test interpretive hypotheses order accessibility stop expectations relevance satisfied wilson sperber constraint utterances compatible communicators abilities preferences accounts suboptimal communication communicator unable think better phrasing moment well stylistic cultural preferences eg politeness considerations withholding information lying hearing utterance addressee first concludes presumption optimal relevance met decodes however yields incomplete information usually information conveyed utterance inferred inference process based decoded meaning addressees knowledge beliefs context guided communicative principle example take utterance information addressee infer includes consequently explicit meaning called explicature inferences understood specifications extensions original utterance speaker addressee know susan sore loser implicature could distinction explicature implicature always clearcut example inference traditionally seen implicature however relevance theorist robyn carston argued utterances implicatures entail explicatures otherwise resulting redundancy would consistent relevance principle therefore inference explicature specifically case another argument explicature embedded negations clauses supposedly impossible described process run sequential order addressee utterance first decode derive explicatures select implicated premises cognitive environment derive implicated conclusions instead subtasks run parallel aid solving sperber wilson distinguish interpretive use utterances descriptive use utterance used descriptively usual situation communicator claims represent state affairs ie true state affairs raining used interpretively represents utterance thought irrespective truth state affairs case direct indirect quotations summaries quoting folk wisdom linguistic example sentences tentative scientific hypotheses et cetera deeper level every utterance interpretive thought speakers makes interpretations peoples thoughts interpretive second degree path utterance achieves relevance interpreting another utterance expressing propositional attitude towards endorsement doubt ridicule etc called echoic attribution attitude made explicit left implicit implicit information course quotations necessarily identical material quote interpret resemble extent utterance need identical speakers thought interprets consequently continuum strictly literal notquiteliteral figuratively used utterances examples latter loose language use saying earn month one really earns hyperbole metaphor words relevance theory views figurative language literal language description actual state affairs path c diagram difference extent utterance resembles speakers thought figurative expression needs less processing effort literal expression earn contextual effects good metaphors principle relevance mandates use relevance theory explains irony echoic utterance implicit attribution implicit attitude attitude one rejection disapproval ridicule like example overly cautious driver pulls main road completely clear except cyclist horizon codriver might reprovingly say theres something coming saying echoes drivers usual attitude ridicules makes utterance ironic continuum literal metaphorical utterances continuum echoic utterances approving literal quotations disapproving relevance theory recognises three types generic universal speech acts saying telling asking whether speech acts either saying speech act type associated declarative sentences paths c diagram depending context declarative utterance bus leaving assertion c prediction c report bus driver said telling associated imperative sentences serve different functions depending context expressing request desire speaker path advice desire hearer path asking whether speech act type interrogative sentences cover ordinary questions also rhetorical questions exam questions etc speech act type analysed request information assertion answer would relevant speaker hearer asking ordinary question speaker expresses answer would relevant rhetorical questions brings something addressees attention thinks relevant foundations relevance theory criticised relevance technical sense used possible say exactly meant relevant enough relevant stephen levinson sees relevance theory reductionist single principle account large variety pragmatic phenomena implicatures view particular argues theory account generalized conversational implicatures inherently theory context dependency also levinson asserts relevance theory explain arrive implicated premises via creative two ways conceive thoughts communicated one person another first way use strict coding decoding used morse code also known model approach speakerauthor
