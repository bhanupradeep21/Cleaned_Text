iminoglycinuria autosomal disorder renal tubular transport affecting reabsorption amino acid glycine imino acids proline results excess urinary excretion three acids uria denotes iminoglycinuria rare complex disorder associated number genetic mutations cause defects renal intestinal transport systems glycine imino imino acids typically contain imine functional group instead amino group found amino
