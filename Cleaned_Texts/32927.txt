interdisciplinary approach includes studies nonhuman subjects artificial intelligence philosophically ruminations human mind processes around since times ancient greeks bce plato suggested brain seat mental ren√© descartes posited humans born innate ideas forwarded idea mindbody dualism would come known substance dualism essentially idea mind body two separate time major debates ensued century regarding whether human thought solely experiential empiricism included innate knowledge nativism involved debate included george berkeley john locke side empiricism immanuel kant side philosophical debate continuing mid late century critical time development psychology scientific discipline two discoveries would later play substantial roles cognitive psychology paul brocas discovery area brain

behavior processes include limited following three stages memory psychological definition attention state focused awareness subset available sensation perception key function attention identify irrelevant data filter enabling significant data distributed mental example human brain may simultaneously receive auditory visual olfactory taste tactile information brain able consciously handle small subset information accomplished attentional attention divided two major attentional systems exogenous control endogenous exogenous control works bottomup manner responsible orienting reflex popout endogenous control works topdown deliberate attentional system responsible divided attention conscious one major focal point relating attention within field cognitive psychology concept divided attention number early studies dealt ability person wearing headphones discern meaningful conversation presented different messages ear known dichotic listening key findings involved increased understanding minds ability focus one message still somewhat aware information taken ear consciously attended example participants wearing earphones may told hearing separate messages ear expected attend information related basketball experiment starts message basketball presented left ear nonrelevant information presented right ear point message related basketball switch right ear nonrelevant information left ear happens listener usually able repeat entire message end attended left right ear ability attend one conversation face many known cocktail party effect major findings include participants comprehend passages shadowing one passage report content unattended message shadow message better pitches ear however deep processing occur early sensory processing subjects notice pitch unattended message changed ceased altogether even oriented unattended message name two main types memory shortterm memory longterm memory however shortterm memory become better understood working memory cognitive psychologists often study memory terms working memory though working memory often thought shortterm memory clearly defined ability process maintain temporary information wide range everyday activities face distraction famously known capacity memory plus minus combination memories working memory longterm memory one classic experiments ebbinghaus found serial position effect

forgetting large debate among psychologists decay theory versus interference theory modern conceptions memory usually longterm memory break three main subclasses three classes somewhat hierarchical
