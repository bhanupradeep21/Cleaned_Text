biology birds mammals altricial species young underdeveloped time birth aid parents mature birth precocial species young relatively mature mobile moment birth hatching precocial species normally nidifugous meaning leave nest shortly birth hatching categories form continuum without distinct gaps fish often refers presence absence stomach precocial larvae stomach onset first feeding whereas altricial fish depending species larvae may develop functional stomach metamorphosis gastric remain stomachless agastric word derived latin root alere meaning nurse rear nourish indicates need young fed taken care long contrast species whose young immediately quickly mobile called precocial word precocial derived root precocious latin root praecox meaning early maturity extremely precocial species called superprecocial examples megapode birds fullflight feathers hatching species fly day hatch pterosaurscitation needed also capable flight soon hatching another example blue wildebeest calves stand within average six minutes birth walk within thirty outrun hyena within behavior gives advantage herbivore species times abundant serengeti ecosystem hartebeests closest taxonomic relative hartebeest calves precocial wildebeest calves take thirty minutes stand long fortyfive minutes follow mothers short distances unable keep mothers week precociality thought ancestral birds thus altricial birds tend found derived groups evidence precociality enantiornithes least superprecocial way similar megapodes able fly soon speculated superprecociality prevented enantiornithines acquiring specialized toe anatomy seen modern altricial bird mammal biology altricial species species whose newly hatched born young relatively immobile lack hair able obtain food must cared adults closed eyes common though ubiquitous altricial young born helpless require care length time altricial birds include hawks herons woodpeckers owls cuckoos passerines among mammals marsupials rodents altricial domestic cats dogs primates humans bestknown altricial example newborn domestic cats see hear maintain body temperature gag require external stimulation order defecate giant panda notably largest placental mammal altricial hairless young upon birth larval stage insect development considered form altricial development accurately depicts especially amongst eusocial animals independent phase development larvae bees ants many arachnids completely physically different developed forms prepupal stages insect life might regarded equivalent vertebrate embryonic development hastier alternative employed precocial animals young open eyes hair large brains immediately mobile somewhat able flee defend predators example groundnesting birds ducks turkeys young ready leave nest one two days among mammals ungulates precocial able walk almost immediately birth beyond precocial superprecocial animals megapode birds hatch fullflight ecological niches require young precocial survival cetaceans restricted water young would quickly drown immobile helpless span precocial altricial species particularly broad birds precocial birds hatch eyes open covered downy feathers soon replaced adulttype birds kind also swim run much sooner hatching altricial young precocial birds ready leave nest short period time following hatching eg hours many precocial chicks independent thermoregulation ability regulate body temperatures depend attending parents brood body heat short time precocial birds find food sometimes help instruction parents examples precocial birds include domestic chicken many species ducks geese waders rails hoatzin precocial birds provide proteinrich eggs thus young hatch fledgling stage able protect predators females less postnatal involvement altricial birds less able contribute nutrients prenatal stage eggs smaller young still need much attention protection predators may related rk selection however association fails birds altricial young usually grow faster precocial young hypothesized occur exposure predators nestling stage development case mammals suggested large hearty adult body sizes favor production large precocious young develop longer gestation period large young may associated migratory behavior extended reproductive period reduced litter size may altricial strategies mammals contrast develop species less migratory territorial lifestyles carnivorans mothers capable bearing fetus early stages development focusing closely personally upon raising opposed precocial animals provide youths bare minimum aid otherwise leave human children primates exemplify unique combination altricial precocial development infants born minimal eyesight compact fleshy bodies fresh features thinner skin small noses ears scarce hair however stage brief amongst primates offspring soon develop stronger bones grow spurts quickly mature features unique growth pattern allows hasty adaptivity simians anything learned children infancy adolescence memorized instinct pattern also contrast prominently altricial mammals many rodents remain largely immobile undeveloped grown near stature parentscitation needed birds terms aves altrices aves precoces introduced carl jakob sundevall terms nidifugous nidicolous lorenz oken two classifications considered identical early times meanings slightly different altricial precocial refer developmental stages nidifugous nidicolous refer leaving staying two strategies result different brain sizes newborns compared adults precocial animals brains fully developed birth relative body size limiting knowledge largely instincts providing immediate access bodies however adults brains develop memorize little birth death altricial animals brains comparatively undeveloped birth thus need care protection brains immediately begin developing birth independently adapting individual circumstances hence adults altricial animals attain versatile brains precocial counterparts capable strategic thought based experience thus altricial species ultimately possess greater potential skill adaptability notably factor human developmental httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprecocialityandaltriciality
