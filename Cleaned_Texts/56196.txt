lucrative business applies example camellias one also grown tea plant japan china species turned cultivable central europe people quickly discovered aesthetic appeal camellia species ornamental plant botanical gardens played major role acclimatization plants distant agochoric plants spread accidental transport unlike speirochoric plants usually sown humanprepared soil land agochoric plants used common harbors train stations along railway however mainly aquatic plants spread agochory ballast water plays major role agochoric spread aquatic plants around world around ten billion tons seawater organisms contains shipped way exporting countries particular affected spread organisms ballast water ships arrive ports empty cargo hold fully pumped ballast tanks draining ballast water ports receive thousands cubic meters seawater brimming alien creatures new environment seaweed undaria pinnatifida native japanese coast reached tasmanian coast via ballast water formed dense kelp forests along coast since displacing native flora fauna caulerpa taxifolia one plants often spread ballast water also spread fact ships tear parts algae anchors australia first country introduce ballast water
