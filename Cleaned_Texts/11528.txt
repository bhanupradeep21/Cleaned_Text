stimulus organism response stimulus condition environmental trigger causes organism involves internal responses person like physiological responses emotions response behaviour person exhibits

different behavioural rating forms types assessments used behaviour therapist determine exactly clients problem may establish baseline maladaptive responses client may baseline therapy continues measure used check clients progress help determine therapy working behaviour therapists typically ask questions tend focused questions tests rorschach inkblot test personality tests like mmpi

behavioural competence behavioural competence looks whether person appropriate skills behaviours necessary performing specific response certain situation making behavioural assessment behaviour therapist wants answer two questions different factors environmental psychological maintaining maladaptive behaviour type behaviour therapy technique help individual improve effectively first question

alcohol use chronic substance functional analysis even applied problems therapists commonly encounter like client resistance partially engaged clients involuntary applications problems left clinicians considerable tools enhancing therapeutic effectiveness one way enhance therapeutic effectiveness use positive reinforcement operant conditioning although behaviour therapy based general learning model applied lot different treatment packages specifically developed deal problematic behaviours well known types treatments relaxation training systematic desensitization virtual reality exposure exposure response prevention techniques social skills training modelling behavioural rehearsal homework aversion therapy relaxation training involves clients learning lower arousal reduce stress tensing releasing certain muscle groups throughout systematic desensitization treatment client slowly substitutes new learned response maladaptive response moving hierarchy situations involving systematic desensitization based part counter conditioning counter conditioning learning new ways change one response another case desensitization substituting maladaptive behaviour relaxing exposure response prevention techniques also known flooding response general technique therapist exposes individual anxietyprovoking stimuli keeping avoidance virtual reality therapy provides realistic computerbased simulations troublesome situations modelling process involves person subjected watching individuals demonstrate behaviour considered adaptive adopted client exposure involves cues model person well situations certain behaviour way relationship seen appropriateness certain behaviour situation behaviour occurs behavioural rehearsal homework treatment client gets desired behaviour therapy session

support particularly however schizophrenia behavioural programs generally lost techniques used behaviour therapy contingency contracting response costs token economies biofeedback using shaping grading task shaping graded task assignments used behaviour needs learned complex complex behaviours need learned broken simpler steps person achieve small things gradually building complex behaviour step approximates eventual goal helps person expand activities gradual way behaviour used person feels something lives changed lifes tasks appear another technique behaviour therapy involves holding client patient accountable behaviours effort change called contingency contract formal written contract two people defines specific expected behaviours wish change rewards punishments go along order contingency contract official needs five elements first must state person get successfully complete desired behaviour secondly people involved monitor behaviours third desired behaviour performed way agreed upon contract punishments defined contract must done fourth persons involved complying contract must receive bonuses last element involves documenting compliance noncompliance using treatment order give persons involved consistent feedback target behaviour provision token economies behaviour therapy technique clients reinforced tokens considered type currency used purchase desired rewards like able watch television getting snack want perform designated token economies mainly used institutional therapeutic settings order token economy effective must consistency administering program entire staff procedures must clearly defined confusion among clients instead looking ways punish patients deny rewards staff reinforce positive behaviours clients increase occurrence desired behaviour time tokens need replaced less tangible rewards compliments client prepared leave institution wont expect get something every time perform desired closely related token economies technique called response costs technique either used without token economies response costs punishment side token economies loss reward privilege someone performs undesirable like token economies technique used
