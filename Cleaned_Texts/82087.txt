chemical categorey identified stereocenter found opposite piperidine nitrogen adjacent aniline nitrogen seems stereocenter apparent unique substituents transfer stereocenter equivalent molecule cyclohexanol analogous apparent stereocenter draw potential stereoisomers see two structures superimposable three dimensions therefore selfsame molecule reason fentanyl rs assignments second case studied two potential stereocenters also additionally methyl group mark carbon potential stereocenters asterisk see many potential stereoisomers eliminate see four permutations stereoisomers none superimposable three dimensions meaning unique stereoisomer potential stereocenters true gives potential rs assignments particularly interesting quite contrast previous example cyclohexanol stereocenter indeed true stereocenter whereas previous example cyclohexanol analogy fentanyl true stereocenter changed modification carbon without equivalent change carbon created imbalance two formerly identical substituents creating novel stereocenter one previously important follow steps procedure every time inherited procedural wisdom may hold organic chemist back finding true correct answer third case studied alphamethylfentanyl group contains substitution similar examined previous example previous image series fentanyl synthesis phenethyl chain opposed implanted piperidine ring mark two stereocenters one carbon fentanyl cα alpha carbon analogize stereocenters chose draw potential stereoisomers see stereocenter superimposable eliminating true stereocenter leaves rs

fentanyl example activiates onthering addition loses αmethylfentanyl offthering addition fourth case studied ohmfentanyl ohmfentanyl potential stereocenters best analogized another piperidine derivative uses similar structure analogize three potential stereocenters ohmfentanyl namely βc beta carbon three stereocenters analogized respectively draw potential stereoisomers see superimposable combination pairing therefore unique stereoisomers true stereocenters yields unique rs assignment combinations outlined captions stereoisomers analogous molecule fundamentals typically enough help chemists navigate world fentanyl analogues proficiently substituents substitutions generally follow naming conventions outlined section however presence three sixmembered rings independently substituted easily lead confusion especially inconsistent use prime notation instance known compounds varying potencies pharmacokinetics confusion different positional isomers especially significant case fentanyls huge variation potency different members weakest compounds benzylfentanyl around potency codeine ie approximately potency morphine strongest compounds carfentanil ohmefentanil potent morphine meaning variation potency strongest weakest fentanyl derivatives means two positional isomers molecular weight may difficult tell apart without detailed chemical analysis may hundreds even thousands times different pharmacological potency also wide variety substitutions used basic fentanyl structure either reduce increase potency unpredictable used combination may impossible estimate
