ethion organophosphate insecticide ethion known affect neural enzyme called acetylcholinesterase prevent working ethion one many substances approved use based data industrial biotest laboratories prompted food agriculture organization world health organization recommend reanalysis ethion first registered us insecticide however usage ethion varied years due overall crop values weather conditions example dry year drought reduced yields usage ethion became less economically since serious studies risk assessment ethion conducted among others epa united states environmental protection agency risk assessments ethion presented july briefing stakeholders florida followed opportunity public comment risk management ethion produced controlled ph conditions reacting dibromomethane diethyl dithiophosphoric acid methods manufacturing reaction methylene bromide sodium diethyl phosphorodithioate reaction diethyl dithiophosphoric acid known ethion small lipophilic molecule characteristics rapid absorption across cell membranes expected absorption skin lungs gut blood happen via passive diffusion furthermore ethion changed liver via desulfuration active metabolite ethion monoxon due change happening liver primary place damage expected ethion monoxon inhibitor neuro enzyme cholinesterase che che facilitator nerve impulse transmission secondary damage thus brain ethion monoxon organophosphate mechanism action thought mechanism works follows see figure inhibition cholinesterase ethion monoxon hydroxyl group serine residue active site che phosphorylated organophosphate thereby inhibiting enzyme inhibition result inability serine hydroxyl group participate hydrolysis another enzyme called acetyl cholineach figure indicated inhibition reaction two step process phosphorylated form enzyme highly stable depending r groups attached phosphorus inhibition reversible goats exposed ethion showed clear distinctions excretion absorption halflife bioavailabilities

four days concentration yolk still rising ten days also investigated chicken six polar watersoluble metabolites goat study also heart kidney tissue investigated period ethion exposure tissue ethionderivatives found study also indicates highest level found liver kidneys lowest levels fat goat milk derivatives also ethion undergo biotransformation human body happens liver ethion undergoes desulfurization thereby changed active metabolite ethion monoxon enzyme cytochrome catalyzes ethion monoxon inhibitor neuro enzyme cholinesterase che contains active oxygen che dephosphorylate organophosphate next step biotransformation ethion monoxon dephosphorylated che next step biotransformation yet completely known happens via esterases blood liver besides dephosphorylation ethion monoxon che likely ethion monoxon partially oxidized toward ethion solvent partitioning urine rats fed ethion became clear metabolites found urine dissolved aqueous phase means nonsignificant levels
