linguistics particularly phonology stress accent relative emphasis prominence given certain syllable word certain word phrase sentence emphasis typically caused properties increased loudness vowel length full articulation vowel changes terms stress accent often used synonymously context sometimes distinguished example emphasis produced pitch alone called pitch accent produced length alone called quantitative caused combination various intensified properties called stress accent dynamic accent english uses called variable stress accent since stress realised wide range phonetic properties loudness vowel length pitch also used linguistic functions difficult define stress solely phonetically stress placed syllables within words called word stress languages fixed stress meaning stress virtually multisyllable word falls particular syllable penultimate eg polish first eg finnish languages like english russian lexical stress position stress word predictable way lexically encoded sometimes one level stress primary stress secondary stress may identified stress necessarily feature languages french mandarin chinese sometimes analyzed lacking lexical stress entirely stress placed words within sentences called sentence stress prosodic stress one three components prosody along rhythm intonation includes phrasal stress default emphasis certain words within phrases clauses

syllable timing eg spanish mora timing eg japanese whose syllables moras spoken roughly constant rate regardless stress details see isochrony common stressed unstressed syllables behave differently language evolves example romance languages original latin short vowels e often become diphthongs stressed since stress takes part verb conjugation produced verbs vowel alternation romance languages example spanish verb volver return come back form volví past tense vuelvo present tense see spanish irregular verbs italian shows phenomenon alternating uo instead behavior confined verbs note example spanish viento wind latin ventum italian fuoco fire latin focum also examples french though less systematic viens latin venio first syllabe stressed vs venir latin venire main stress penultimate

núminumí language word stress task involves reproduction order stimuli sequence key strokes whereby key associated one stress location eg númi key eg numí trial may stimuli length thus order núminúminumínúmi reproduced found listeners whose native language french performed significantly worse spanish listeners reproducing stress patterns key strokes explanation spanish lexically contrastive stress evidenced minimal pairs like topo mole topó hesheit met french stress convey lexical information equivalent stress minimal pairs spanish important case stress deafness relates
