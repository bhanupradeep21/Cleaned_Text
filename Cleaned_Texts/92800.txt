hamartoma mostly local malformation cells resembles neoplasm local tissue usually due overgrowth multiple aberrant cells basis systemic genetic condition rather growth descended single mutated cell monoclonality would typically define benign despite many hamartomas found clonal chromosomal aberrations acquired somatic mutations basis term hamartoma sometimes considered synonymous neoplasm hamartomas definition benign slowgrowing though underlying condition may still predispose individual towards malignancies hamartomas usually caused genetic syndrome affects development cycle least multiple many conditions classified overgrowth syndromes cancer syndromes hamartomas occur many different parts body often asymptomatic incidentalomas undetected found incidentally imaging study obtained another reason additionally definition hamartoma versus benign neoplasm often unclear since lesions clonal lesions adenomas developmental cysts hemangiomas lymphangiomas rhabdomyomas within kidneys lungs pancreas interpreted experts hamartomas others consider true neoplasms moreover even though hamartomas show benign histology risk rare lifethreatening complications found neurofibromatosis type tuberous different choristoma closely related form two differentiated follows hamartoma excess normal tissue normal situation eg birthmark skin choristoma excess tissue abnormal situation eg pancreatic tissue term hamartoma greek ἁμαρτία hamartia error introduced dpg albrecht hamartomas caused abnormal formation normal tissue occur spontaneously result underlying disorder hamartomas likely result developmental error manifest multiple locations development hamartomas also linked certain genes pten disorders associated hamartomas include tuberous sclerosis cowden syndrome pten hamartoma tumour syndrome peutzjeghers solitary lung nodules benign lung tumors almost always arise connective tissue generally formed cartilage connective tissue fat cells although may include many types cells great majority form connective tissue outside lungs although form deep linings bronchi worrisome especially situated deep lung sometimes difficult make important distinction hamartoma lung malignancy xray often provide definitive diagnosis even ct scan may insufficient hamartoma lacks typical cartilage fat cells lung hamartomas may popcornlike calcifications chest xray computed tomography ct scan lung hamartomas common men women may present additional difficulties smokers lung hamartomas compress surrounding lung tissue degree generally debilitating often asymptomatic especially common peripheral growths treated surgical resection excellent prognosis generally real danger inherent possibility surgical complications cardiac rhabdomyomas hamartomas composed altered cardiac myocytes contain large vacuoles glycogen common tumor heart children infants strong association cardiac rhabdomyomas tuberous sclerosis characterized hamartomas central nervous system kidneys skin well pancreatic cysts patients cardiac rhabdomyomas tuberous sclerosis patients tuberous sclerosis cardiac masses echocardiography symptoms depend size tumor location relative conduction system whether obstructs blood flow symptoms usually congestive heart failure utero heart failure may occur rhabdomyomas diagnosed fetal ultrasound cardiac imaging birth rhabdomyomas often signal presence rare genetic disorder called tuberous sclerosis patients survive infancy tumors may regress spontaneously resection symptomatic patients good results nerves sometimes nerves also affected common nerve affected hamartoma reported median one troublesome hamartomas occurs hypothalamus unlike growths hypothalamic hamartoma symptomatic often causes gelastic seizures cause visual problems seizures rage disorders associated hypothalamic diseases early onset puberty symptoms typically begin early infancy progressive often general cognitive andor functional disability moreover resection usually difficult growths generally adjacent even intertwined optic nerve symptoms tend resistant medical control however surgical techniques improving result immense improvement one general danger hamartomas may impinge blood vessels resulting risk serious bleeding hamartoma typically lacks elastic tissue may lead formation aneurysms thus possible hemorrhage hamartoma impinges major blood vessel renal artery hemorrhage must considered lifethreatening angiomyolipoma kidney previously considered hamartoma choristoma myoepithelial hamartoma also known pancreatic rest ectopic pancreatic tissue found stomach duodenum proximal jejunum seen upper gastrointestinal series pancreatic rest may appear submucosal mass gastric neoplasm asymptomatic cause dyspepsia upper gastrointestinal hamartoma identified cause partial outflow obstruction abomasum true gastric stomach dairy hamartomas spleen uncommon dangerous cases manifest abdominal pain often associated hematologic abnormalities spontaneous rupture cowden syndrome serious genetic characterized multiple hamartomas usually skin hamartomas exist commonly cases hamartoma thyroid gland exists additional growths form many parts body especially bones cns eyes genitourinary tract gi tract mucosa hamartomas may cause symptoms even death morbidity often associated increased occurrence malignancies usually breast thyroid cowden syndrome considered pten hamartoma tumor syndrome phts also includes syndrome proteus syndrome proteuslike syndrome hamartomas generally benign cause problems due location example located skin especially face neck disfiguring cases reported hamartomas size small may obstruct practically organ body colon eye etc particularly likely cause major health issues located hypothalamus kidneys lips spleen removed surgically necessary likely recur prognosis depend upon location size lesion well overall health patientcitation needed
