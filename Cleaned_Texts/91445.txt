fallopian tube female reproductive main functions crucial beginning folliculogenesis seen image primordial follicle made oocyte single layer flattened granulosa cells released oocyte surrounding granulosa tissue binds two membrane bound receptors granulosa promotes granulosa cell proliferation via mitosis promotes change primordial primary secondary follicles surrounded several granulosa cell layers doesnt promote transition preovulatory prevents differentiation preovulatory follicle inhibiting fsh action granulosa fsh released anterior pituitary part hypothalamicpituitarygonadal axis promotes differentiation early follicles later preovulatory ones prevents transition inhibiting production fsh receptor mrna granulosa cells therefore fsh bind granulosa cells inhibits fsh dependent progesterone production luteinization subsequently granulosa cells acts directly granulosa cells important influence granulosa function including steroidogenesis inhibition luteinization
