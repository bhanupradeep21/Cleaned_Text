cognitive flexibilitynote intrinsic property cognitive system often associated mental ability adjust activity content switch different task rules corresponding behavioral responses maintain multiple concepts simultaneously shift internal attention term cognitive flexibility traditionally used refer one executive sense seen neural underpinnings adaptive flexible behavior flexibility tests developed assumption several decades ago nowadays cognitive flexibility also referred set properties brain facilitate flexible yet relevant switching functional brain states cognitive flexibility varies lifespan addition certain conditions disorder associated reduced cognitive flexibility since cognitive flexibility vital component deficits area might implications two common approaches studying cognitive flexibility focus unconscious capacity task switching conscious ability cognitive shifting methods measuring cognitive flexibility include anotb task dimensional change card sorting task multiple classification card sorting task wisconsin card sorting task stroop test functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri research shown specific brain regions activated person engages cognitive flexibility tasks regions include prefrontal cortex pfc basal ganglia anterior cingulate cortex acc posterior parietal cortex studies conducted people various ages particular deficits informed cognitive flexibility develops changes within brain american psychological association apa defines cognitive flexibility capacity objective appraisal appropriately flexible action cognitive flexibility also implies adaptability fairmindedness cognitive flexibility varies lifespan researchers specifically described cognitive flexibility capacity shift switch ones thinking attention different tasks operations typically response change rules example sorting cards based specific rules children considered cognitively flexible able successfully switch sorting cards based color object sorting based type object card cognitive flexibility broadly described ability adjust ones thinking old situations new situations well ability overcome responses thinking become habitual adapt new one able overcome previously held beliefs habits required new situations would considered cognitively flexible lastly ability simultaneously consider two aspects object idea situation one point time refers cognitive according definition sorting cards based specific rules children considered cognitively flexible sort cards based color objects type objects card simultaneously similarly cognitive flexibility defined understanding awareness possible options alternatives simultaneously within given regardless specificity definition researchers generally agreed cognitive flexibility component executive functioning higherorder cognition involving ability control ones executive functioning includes aspects cognition including inhibition memory emotional stability planning organization cognitive flexibility highly related number abilities including inhibition planning working thus individual better able suppress aspects stimulus focus important aspects ie inhibit color object focus kind object also cognitively flexible sense better planning organizing employing particular memory strategies researchers argued cognitive flexibility also component multiple classification originally described psychologist jean piaget multiple classification tasks participants primarily children already developed process developing skill must classify objects several different ways thereby thinking flexibly similarly order cognitively flexible must overcome centration tendency young children solely focus one aspect object example children young may solely able focus one aspect object ie color object unable focus aspects ie color kind object thus research suggests individual centrated thinking cognitively inflexible research suggested cognitive flexibility related cognitive abilities fluid intelligence reading fluency reading fluid intelligence described ability solve problems new situations enables fluid reasoning ability one able reason fluidly turn likely cognitively flexible furthermore able cognitively flexible shown ability switch andor simultaneously think sounds meanings increases reading fluency comprehension cognitive flexibility also shown related ones ability cope particular situations example individuals better able shift thinking situation situation focus less stressors within general researchers field focus development cognitive flexibility ages three however cognitive flexibility shown broad concept studied different ages thus tasks ranging simple complex research suggests developmental continuum spans infancy adulthood variety assessments appropriate distinguishing different levels cognitive flexibility different ages common tests used assess cognitive flexibility order developmentally appropriate age anotb task children shown object hidden location within reach prompted search object location find activity repeated several times hidden object location critical trial child watching object hidden location b second location within easy reach child researchers agreed anotb task simple task effectively measures cognitive flexibility dimensional change card sorting task dccs children initially asked sort cards single dimension color subsequently required alter strategy sort cards based second dimension typically threeyearold children able sort cards based single dimension unable switch sort cards based second dimension however fiveyearold children able sort cards based one dimension switch sorting cards second multiple classification card sorting task children shown cards asked sort based two different dimensions eg color yellow blue object type animals food simultaneously four piles within matrix eg yellow animals yellow foods blue animals blue foods task appears difficult research shown sevenyearold children incapable sorting cards based two dimensions simultaneously children focused two dimensions separately whereas age eleven children capable sorting cards based two dimensions simultaneously demonstrates increase cognitive flexibility ages seven wisconsin card sorting test wcst used determine individuals competence abstract reasoning ability change problemsolving strategies test number cards presented participants figures cards differ respect color quantity shape participants told match cards match however told whether particular match right wrong ability switch matching rules measured typically children ages nine eleven demonstrate cognitive flexibility needed stroop test also known colorword naming test measure three types cards deck color card displays patches different colors participants asked identify quickly possible word card displays names colors printed black white ink participants asked name quickly possible final card type colorword card displays names colors printed ink conflicting color eg word red would printed yellow requires participants name ink colors ignoring conflicting color names basic score card total time seconds participant takes respond typically naming color word takes longer results errors color ink match name color situation adults tend take longer respond children adults sensitive actual color word thus likely influenced naming conflicting color word printed understanding mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility subject current research remains elusive property distributed brain function instantiates many ways human studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri animal studies using optogenetics shown cognitive flexibility relies variety distinct regions brain work concert including prefrontal cortex pfc anterior cingulate cortex acc posterior parietal cortex ppc basal ganglia regions active engagement cognitive flexibility depend task various factors involved flexibility used assess behavior flexible thinking requires aspects inhibition attention working memory response selection goal several studies using task switching paradigms demonstrated complexities network involved cognitive flexibility activation dorsolateral pfc shown resolution interference irrelevant task another study extended results demonstrating level abstractness switch type influenced recruitment differing regions pfc depending whether participant asked make cognitive set switch response switch stimulus perceptual switch set switch would require switching task rules wcst considered abstract response switch would require different response mapping circle right button square left button vice versa lastly stimulus perceptual set switch would require simple switch circle square activation mediated level abstractness set switch anterior posterior fashion within pfc anterior activations elicited set switches posterior activations resulting stimulus perceptual basal ganglia active response selection ppc along inferior frontal junction active representation updating task sets called domain general children strikingly inflexible assessed using traditional tests cognitive
