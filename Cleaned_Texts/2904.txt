reproductive surgery surgery field reproductive medicine used contraception eg vasectomy wherein vasa deferentia male severed also used plentifully assisted reproductive technology reproductive surgery generally divided three categories surgery infertility vitro fertilization fertility reproductive surgeon obstetriciangynecologist urologist specializes reproductive reproductive surgeries referred based biological sex terms male female used denote men women respectively reproductive surgery aims address concerns spanning male female fertility genderaffirming uses reproductive surgery may encompass different abnormalities dysfunctions areas focus unable treated solely medication nonsurgical screening measures may completed determine necessity surgery example intrauterine pathology may assessed utilizing techniques hysteroscopy identify complications reproductive surgical assisted reproductive technology art supports enhancement fertility success processes vitro fertilization screening reproductive surgery also role identifying addressing abnormalities notable cysts prior initiating surgical sperm retrieval alternative means semen collection means possible circumstances like posthumous sperm retrieval male surgical techniques may also utilized form permanent contraception referred vasectomy tubal ligation would examples procedure male female individuals reproductive surgeons potentially perform reverse vasectomy restore male reproductive function following vasectomy individuals may choose reverse procedure due pain experience people might find wanting preserve fertility biological material sperm oocyte capable surgically collected preserved fertility preservation also provides individuals receiving genderaffirming surgeries option preserving gametes biological children desired following procedures hormonal reproductive surgery also considered complications endometriosis polycystic ovary syndrome ectopic pregnancy vas deferens albeit increase overall use assisted reproductive technology art surgeries fallopian tubes ovaries decreased leading rise insecurity field reproductive reproductive surgery women largely complementary art methods medication except tubal infertility surgery remains main although reproductive surgery relevant severe symptoms strong interest greater analysis surrounding topic reproductive surgery first began fertility sparing surgeries uterine myomectomy transitioned later addition surgeries infertility advancement success rates fertility hysterectomies myomectomies date back ancient times fascination grew around fertility sparing surgeries specifically young women able conceive considered suspected however lack knowledge medicine eventually led mortality thereby causing myomectomies become uncommon overtime various advancements extensive research allowed discovery minimally invasive myomectomies became popular among women capable bearing laparoscopy continues common procedure approach minimally invasive thought associated decrease hospital stay surgical development newer technology surgical techniques allowed increase success rates various surgeries endometriosis adenomyosis surgeries adnexal surgeries respect future reproductive surgeries greater advancements surgical techniques equipment growing popularity increase potential fertility success rates example vaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery vnotes new innovative approach used ovarian torsion tubal ectopic pregnancy ovarian surgical approach minimally invasive emerged effort reduce pain risks potential another technique emerged radiofrequency ablation rfa used uterine fibroids works necrotize fibroids use laparoscopic transcervical procedures two devices acessa hologic sonata gynesonics however two medical devices come caveat fertility may preserved uterine although ideal people able wanting bear children rfa still poses alternative successful technique reducing volume new common interest alliance reproductive surgery use regenerative medicine although studied entirety use stem cells restore damaged endometrium shown promising regenerative medicine used premature ovarian failure continue studied vitro fertilization ivf use various stem cells researchers hope mitigate treat future signs infertility use two specific stem cells induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs mesenchymal stem cells risks complications reproductive surgery depend patient specific characteristics degree surgery however common complications general reproductive surgery hemorrhage visceral damage infection blot vasectomies infection hematomas frequently reported complications surgery incidence rate infection incidence rate hematoma ranging around important note consider fact surgical technique vasectomy impact incident rates complications noscalpel vasectomy nsv widely recognized due low incident rate another common complication vasectomy postvasectomy pain syndrome pvps pvps involves chronic pain may persistent intermittent one testicles lasting longer three months pathophysiology pvps unknown various causes include damage structures testis buildup pressure epididymal congestion compression nerves testis pain pvps manifest various forms pain tenderness scrotum pressure pain ejaculation pain sex incidence rates pvps around hysterectomies complications procedure include infection gastrointestinal injury venous thromboembolic injury similar vasectomies one common complications infection incidence rate abdominal hysterectomy vaginal hysterectomy laparoscopic today one effective forms art vitro fertilization effective experiencing infertility numerous risks ivf multiple births premature delivery ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome condition involves enlargement ovaries result injected fertility drugs causing increased capacity blood vessels allow molecules go lead abdominal pain soreness nausea experiencing symptoms severity ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome classified amongst various grades grade involves mild discomfort abdominal distention grades increase severity symptoms also increase grade grade encompass severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome involve changes blood volume viscosity due history heightened response gonadotropins history previous ovarial hyperstimulation andor history polycystic ovary syndrome pcos increased risk developing existing medical guidelines outline absolute contraindications reproductive surgery however relative contraindications recommended current literature several circumstances reproductive surgery contraindicated surgery may cause extensive tissue damage person success procedure limited ie condition invasive metastatic surgerys potential risk outweighs potential however persons situation different possibility reproductive surgery consulted healthcare professional uterine atony fetal extraction preexisting maternal bleeding disorders reported accepted contraindications cesarean myomectomies contraindications reproductive surgery used tubal surgery infertility include women ages older tubal disease surgery treat ie surgery safely performed without hurting person patient multiple medical conditions reduces chance success bipolar disease abnormal semen many studies examining surgery endometriosis excluded women previously received medical surgical treatment women preoperative diagnosis deep endometriosis bowel bladder also excluded male reproductive surgery treatment varicocele percutaneous embolization current literature considers adolescents allergies contrast men bilateral grade varicocele men primary infertility relative contraindications httpsenwikipediaorgwikireproductivesurgery
