autogamy selffertilization refers fusion two gametes come one individual autogamy predominantly observed form selfpollination reproductive mechanism employed many flowering plants however species protists also observed using autogamy means reproduction flowering plants engage autogamy regularly protists engage autogamy stressful environments paramecium aurelia commonly studied protozoan autogamy similar unicellular organisms paramecium aurelia typically reproduce asexually via binary fission sexually via crossfertilization however studies shown put nutritional stress paramecium aurelia undergo meiosis subsequent fusion gameticlike process defined hemixis chromosomal rearrangement process takes place number steps first two micronuclei p aurelia enlarge divide two times form eight nuclei daughter nuclei continue divide create potential future gametic nuclei potential gametic nuclei one divide two times four daughter nuclei arising step two become anlagen cells form part new organism two daughter nuclei become gametic micronuclei undergo autogamous nuclear divisions observed mainly p aurelia put nutritional stress research shows p aurelia undergo autogamy synchronously individuals species paramecium tetraurelia vitality declines course successive asexual cell divisions binary fission clonal aging associated dramatic increase dna paramecia experienced clonal aging undergo meiosis either conjugation automixis old macronucleus disintegrates new macronucleus formed replication micronuclear dna experienced meiosis followed syngamy paramecia rejuvenated sense restored clonal lifespan thus appears clonal aging due large part progressive accumulation dna damage rejuvenation due repair dna damage meiosis occurs micronucleus conjugation automixis reestablishment macronucleus replication newly repaired micronuclear dna similar paramecium aurelia parasitic ciliate tetrahymena rostrata also shown engage meiosis autogamy development new macronuclei placed nutritional due degeneration remodeling genetic information occurs autogamy genetic variability arises possibly increases offsprings chances survival stressful environments allogromia laticollaris perhaps beststudied foraminiferan amoeboid autogamy laticollaris alternate sexual reproduction via crossfertilization asexual reproduction via binary fission details life cycle laticollaris unknown similar paramecium aurelia laticollaris also shown sometimes defer autogamous behavior placed nutritional stress seen paramecium nuclear dimorphism observed laticollaris often observations macronuclei chromosomal fragments coexisting laticollaris indicative nuclear chromosomal degeneration process similar subdivisions observed p aurelia multiple generations haploid laticollaris individuals exist autogamy actually takes autogamous behavior laticollaris added consequence giving rise daughter cells substantially smaller rising binary hypothesized survival mechanism employed cell stressful environments thus able allocate resources creating offspring cell nutritional stress able function regularly would strong possibility offsprings fitness subpar flowering plants predominantly selfpollination example autogamy occurs flowering plants selfpollination occurs sperm pollen stamen plant goes carpels plant fertilizes egg cell present selfpollination either done completely autogamously geitonogamously former egg sperm cells unite come flower latter sperm egg cells come different flower plant latter method blur lines autogamous selffertilization normal sexual reproduction still considered autogamous selfpollination lead inbreeding depression due expression deleterious recessive meiosis followed selfpollination results little genetic variation raising question meiosis selfpollinating plants adaptively maintained extended period preference less complicated less costly asexual ameiotic process producing progeny instance arabidopsis thaliana predominantly selfpollinating plant outcrossing rate wild estimated less selfpollination appears evolved roughly million years ago adaptive benefit meiosis may explain longterm maintenance selfpollinating plants efficient recombinational repair dna basically two distinct types sexual reproduction among fungi first outcrossing heterothallic fungi case mating occurs two different haploid individuals form diploid zygote undergo meiosis second type selffertilization selfing homothallic fungi case two haploid nuclei derived individual fuse form zygote undergo meiosis examples homothallic fungi undergo selfing include species aspergilluslike asexual stage anamorphs occurring many different several species ascomycete genus ascomycete pneumocystis examples see homothallism review evidence evolution sexual reproduction fungi led concept original mode sexual reproduction last eukaryotic common ancestor homothallic selffertile unisexual several advantages selffertilization observed flowering plants protists flowering plants important plants dependent pollinating agents plants rely fertilization unusual however considering many plant species evolved become incompatible gametes species would well served autogamous selffertilization reproductive mechanism species selfincompatibility would benefit autogamy protists advantage diversifying modes reproduction useful multitude reasons first unfavorable change environment puts ability deliver offspring risk advantageous organism autogamy disposal organisms seen genetic diversity arising sexual reproduction maintained changes environment favor certain genotypes others aside extreme circumstances possible form reproduction gives rise genotype offspring increase fitness environment due nature genetic degeneration remodeling intrinsic autogamy unicellular organisms thus autogamous behavior may become advantageous individual wanted ensure offspring viability survival advantage also applies flowering plants however important note change shown produce progeny fitness unicellular possible nutrition deprived state parent cells autogamy created barrier producing offspring could thrive stressful environments flowering plants autogamy disadvantage producing low genetic diversity species use predominant mode reproduction leaves species particularly susceptible pathogens viruses harm addition foraminiferans use autogamy shown produce substantially smaller progeny indicates since generally emergency survival mechanism unicellular species mechanism nutritional resources would provided organism undergoing binary fission selffertilization results loss genetic variation within individual offspring many genetic loci heterozygous become homozygous result expression harmful recessive alleles serious consequences individual effects extreme selffertilization occurs organisms usually plants selfing occur autogamous geitonogamous pollinations varying fitness affects show autogamy depression several generations inbreeding depression likely purge deleterious alleles population individuals carrying mostly died failed reproduce effects interfere proportion heterozygous loci halved successive generation shown following table illustration model decrease genetic variation population selffertilized organisms derived heterozygous individual assuming equal fitness evolutionary shift outcrossing selffertilization one frequent evolutionary transitions plants since autogamy flowering plants autogamy unicellular species fundamentally different plants protists related likely instances
