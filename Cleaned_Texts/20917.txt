autoimmunity refers pathologic response bodys immune system autoimmune disease widely recognized significantly common women men often presents differently reasons disparities still investigation may part involve presence additional x chromosome given several genes x chromosome associated immune system development well higher presence female sex hormones estrogen increases immune system risk incidence character autoimmune disease women may also associated femalespecific physiological changes hormonal shifts menses pregnancy common autoimmune symptoms experienced sexes include rashes fevers fatigue joint pain symptoms specific women include irregular menses pelvic pain vaginal dryness depending given disease diseases graves disease rheumatoid arthritis multiple may improve pregnancy whereas others lupus may currently possible cure autoimmune disease many treatments available treatment autoimmune disease broadly classified antiinflammatory immunosuppressive palliative ie correcting functional disturbance related medications used treat autoimmune diseases might safe use antibodyassociated disease mogad autoimmune conditions described majority prevalent women approximately patients autoimmune disease autoimmune diseases overwhelmingly affect women include affect thyroid gland hashimotos thyroiditis graves disease rheumatic diseases systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis scleroderma sjögren syndrome hepatobiliary diseases primary biliary cholangitis autoimmune neurological diseases myasthenia gravis neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders nmosd multiple sclerosis men may develop conditions epidemiological symptomological differences may still exist example multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis occur men tend develop later life men around age women incidence rises autoimmune diseases affect sexes roughly equal rates slight female conditions include inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis crohns disease immune thrombocytopenic purpura itp mog antibody disease among others although lifetime incidence diseases may similar may still exist difference disease onset course complications prognosis vary based sex example men likely develop crohns disease upper gi tract compared males females equally likely affected crohns disease around age women become overrepresented crohns disease women men equally likely develop ulcerative colitis age shifts significant male autoimmune diseases thought common men women examples may include ankylosing spondylitis primary sclerosing cholangitis type diabetes certain vasculitides including antigbm disease goodpasture syndrome behçets disease though whether represents autoimmune disease vs autoinflammatory disease remains unclear closer inspection diseases initially thought overrepresented men trended towards sex neutrality time example early studies ankylosing spondylitis reported ratio male female patients recent reports indicated closer may reflect true increased incidence women time may due improvements diagnostic testing additionally sex ratios affected patients vary widely geographic regions instance crohns disease slightly common women western countries whereas slightly common men asian behçets disease common males regions along historic silk road common women united suggests risks developing autoimmune disease multifactorial may vary based race environment well sex autoimmune diseases result systemic localized symptoms depending given typical systemic symptoms include fevers fatigue muscle aches joint pain rashes seen diseases lupus rheumatoid arthritis autoimmune diseases localized effects specific organ tissue types instance alopecia areata presents patchy baldness due autoimmune destruction hair follicles whereas multiple sclerosis presents neurological symptoms due autoimmune demyelination central nervous system systemic localized disease present symptoms exclusive women women sjögren syndrome autoimmune disease characterized destruction inflammation salivary lacrimal glands times likely report vaginal dryness postmenopausal causes autoimmunity still subject extensive research include genetic well environmental factors however clear overrepresentation women persons autoimmune disease suggests sexspecific factors highly instrumental development conditions posited reasons disparity include differential effects sex hormones especially estrogen immune response xchromosome inactivation changes associated pregnancy evolutionary pressures affect sexes due biological development many elements inextricably linked difficult isolate individual effects factor many genes involved immune response reside x chromosome women two copies whereas men typically one cell division embryological development one two xchromosomes inactivated random process called lyonization ensures expression x chromosome genes randomly suppressed one two copies females order compensate extra copy incomplete suppression extra copies genes may lead overexpression genes involved immune response resulting robust immune response increased risk developing autoimmune additional support hypothesis illustrated higher rates autoimmune disease men klinefelter syndrome like women males klinefelter syndrome also two copies xchromosome may predispose increased risk autoimmune disease risk highest autoimmune diseases femalepredominant eg addisons disease multiple sclerosis sjögren exception type diabetes affects sexes roughly equal rates klinefelter syndrome correlated increased risk autoimmune diseases occur males greater equal eg ankylosing spondylitis psoriasis despite one copy xchromosome women turner syndrome still twice likely general female population develop autoimmune interestingly autoimmune diseases turner syndrome patients greater risk include inflammatory bowel disease type diabetes alopecia areata several autoimmune disorders tend affect sexes roughly equal rates suggests development autoimmune disease solely mediated differential expression genes xchromosome sex hormones instrumental nearly every aspect human biology including development response adaptive immune system sex hormones estrogen progesterone testosterone present healthy men women albeit different levels estrogen progesterone considered primary female sex hormones testosterone primary male sex hormone broadly speaking estrogen understood immuneactivating testosterone considered immunesuppressing ideal immune system response must alert enough recognize destroy foreign antigens also selective enough avoid attacking self exists necessary tradeoff immune system hyperactivity autoimmunity versus hypoactivity immune deficiency since men women different levels sex hormones necessarily incur unequal risk developing conditions broadly speaking men predisposed infectious disease less likely develop autoimmune disease women conversely higher risk developing autoimmune disease protected infectious disease men women greater number circulating antibodies implications development autoimmune disease well increased resistance infectious disease estrogen significant effects response adaptive immune higher levels estrogen correlated higher levels circulating antibodies responsible mounting immune addition shortterm changes immune system may also influenced longerterm changes total lifetime exposure course disease may also related hormonal fluctuations especially puberty pregnancy menopause immunocompetence handicap hypothesis proposes testosterone may utility secondary sexual characteristic signals fitness prospective males higher levels testosterone suppresses immune system activity signaling fitness spite handicap demonstration mate quality spite handicap additional proofofconcept demonstrated testosterone supplementation men klinefelter syndrome naturally make little testosterone androgen supplementation shown decrease serum levels immunoglobulins pregnancy short longterm effects immune system changes may persist even completion pregnancy effects course autoimmune diseases vary widely dependent specific disease well individual patient conditions rheumatoid arthritis often improve course pregnancy especially second third trimesters however women often relapse within three months giving conditions lupus often become much worse course pregnancy hormone estrogen spikes additionally hormonal fluctuations may continue long changes could trigger improve even worsen autoimmune disease addition estrogen hormones like progesterone prolactin may trigger mothers immune system tends suppressed pregnancy prevent fetal rejection foreign antibodies stated pregnancy causes increase estrogen female body increase hormone weakens functioning immune cells thus debilitating mothers immune addition possible fetal cells continue circulate mothers body years childbirth making possible trigger autoimmune diagnosis autoimmune disease based upon clinical laboratory order diagnose autoimmune disease typical symptoms given disorder must present along laboratory evidence autoantibodies autoantibodies develop throughout course autoimmune disease immune system mistakenly forms specific antibodies tissues resulting inflammation presence autoantibodies alone sufficient diagnosis autoantibodies may arise variety reasons including malignancy infection injury may present even persons completely however possible persons detectable autoantibody levels prior clinical development autoimmune disease state may characterized additionally possible display clinical signs autoimmune disease autoantibody levels autoantibody assays sensitive specific negative autoantibody test better excluding given disease positive autoantibody test diagnosing disease generally autoantibody results reported form titers higher titers eg indicating greater autoantibody concentration lower titers eg different autoantibody assays different criteria determining whether given test positive negative indeterminate laboratories ordered workup autoimmune disease may include white blood cell count wbc crp creactive protein esr erythrocyte sedimentation rate complement levels among others additional circumstantial evidence indicate likely autoimmune disease include family history clustering autoimmune diseases within given family presence hla haplotypes associated given disease sex bias proofofconcept response immunosuppressive currently possible fully cure autoimmune disease however treatments exist improve course given disease andor result long periods pharmacological treatment autoimmune disease broadly classified antiinflammatory immunosuppressive palliative eg correcting functional disturbance related condition overall goals treatment limit severity flareups disease well limit total number flares extend periods disease remission nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids commonly used reduce inflammation associated flares autoimmune illness nsaids work inhibiting responsible generating prostaglandins cause inflammation additionally may inhibit chemotaxis stop neutrophil aggregation decrease levels proinflammatory considered immunosuppressive agents directly target immune cells examples nsaids include ibuprofen naproxen diclofenac drugs recommended past week pregnancy may adverse effects development fetal circulatory system corticosteroids also antiinflammatory immunosuppressive used widely treatment autoimmune disease work promoting synthesis multiple proteins annexin stop downstream production prostaglandins leukotrienes promote examples corticosteroids used autoimmune disease include prednisone methylprednisolone robust randomized controlled studies humans regarding safety corticosteroid use corticosteroid use may associated cleft palate formation data limited little evidence suggest material corticosteroid use associated early delivery low birth weight preeclampsia prednisone methylprednisolone classed pregnancy category c used maternal benefits outweigh potential risks optimal treatment autoimmune disease addition quelling generalized inflammation may occur autoimmune disease treatment also focused specifically targeting adaptive immune system goal direct immunosuppression treat flares well extend period remission episodes immunosuppressive drugs categorized dmards diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs well dmards classified conventionalsynthetic targetedsynthetic biologic agents autoimmune diseases targeted effects endocrine organs result inability produce hormones necessary maintain normal physiology palliative treatment autoimmune disease involves treating secondary condition replacing vital hormones longer produced examples include treatment diabetes exogenous insulin though cure primary autoimmune disease effectively treats lack hormone caused nonpharmacological treatments effective treating autoimmune disease contribute sense wellbeing women complementary treatments may effective include concerns fertility pregnancy present women autoimmune diseases talking health care provider becoming pregnant recommended may suggest wait disease remission suggest change medication becoming pregnant endocrinologists specialize treating women highrisk women autoimmune diseases may problems getting pregnant happen many reasons medication types even disease tests tell fertility problems caused autoimmune disease unrelated reason fertility treatments able help women autoimmune disease become changes severity disease seem vary depending type disease observable trend pregnant women rheumatoid arthritis condition seems improve differently expecting mothers sle may likely worsened symptoms pregnancy however difficult medications influence female fertility well furthermore fertility impact pregnancy certain medications hinder womens ability get pregnant cyclophosphamide reason may extremely helpful women autoimmune diseases seek
