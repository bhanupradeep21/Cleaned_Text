aphasiology study language impairment usually resulting brain damage due neurovascular associated variety neurodegenerative diseases including different types dementia specific language deficits termed aphasias may defined impairments language production comprehension attributed trivial causes deafness oral paralysis number aphasias described two best known expressive aphasia brocas aphasia receptive aphasia wernickes sensory aphasia acute aphasias often result tissue damage following strokecitation needed first described french neurologist paul broca nineteenth century expressive aphasia causes speech affected display considerable vocabulary show grammatical characterized halting speech consisting mainly content words ie nouns verbs least english distinctly lacking small grammatical function words articles prepositions observation gave rise terms telegraphic speech recently agrammatism extent expressive aphasics retain knowledge grammar matter considerable controversy nonetheless comprehension spoken language mostly preserved speech usually good enough get point across agrammatic nature speech suggests disorder chiefly involves expressive mechanisms language turn thoughts wellformed view expressive aphasia expressive disorder supported frequent cooccurrence facial motor difficulties anatomical localization although expressive aphasia may caused brain damage many regions commonly associated inferior frontal gyrus region overlaps motor cortex controlling mouth tongue extending periventricular white surprisingly region come known brocas area however intriguing line research demonstrated specific comprehension deficits expressive aphasics well deficits generally involve sentences grammatical atypical word order simplest example sentences passive
