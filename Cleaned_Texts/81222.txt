cognitive psychology recall test test memory mind participants presented stimuli delay asked remember many stimuli memory performance indicated measuring percentage stimuli participant able recall example would studying list words later recalling percent recall participants responses also may analyzed determine pattern way items recalled memory example participants given list consisting types vegetables types fruit recall assessed determine whether grouped vegetables together fruits together recall also involved person asked recollect life events graduating high school recall facts learned capital measuring recall contrasts measuring recognition people asked pick item previously seen heard number items previously seen heard occurs example typical multiplechoice question free recall one commonly used recall tests free recall tests participants asked study list words asked recall words whatever order choose recall words participants recall typically presented one time short duration recalling words starts immediately final item recalled shown items listed either verbal written recall immediate recall itemsimmediate free recall common form free call tests recall items delayeddelayed free recall immediate free recall delayed free recall used test recency primacy effects free recall often used measure number items recalled list murdock experiment serial position effects used six groups participants group given different combinations list lengths presentation rates three groups shown lists ten fifteen twenty words presentation rate two seconds per word three groups shown lists twenty thirty forty words onesecond presentation rate word eighty lists total included randomly selected common english words presentation list subjects asked recall many words possible order results experiment showed groups expressed primacy effects recency effects recency effects exhibited regardless length list strongest words last eight serial positions primacy effect extended first four serial serial recall paradigm form free recall participants list items presented correct order presented research shows learning curve serial recall increases linearly every trial bruno miller zimmerman experiment tested learn serial recall learning curve increases linearly testing see linear increase result order participant sees items instead dependent order participant told recall items study involved three different conditions serial recall free recall items recalled randomized trial free recall order items kept constant experiment tested nine college students series words addition linear serial recall learning curve found words forgotten recall free serial study also supported notion difference types recall depends order learner must recall items order items presented cued recall test procedure testing memory participant presented cues words phrases aid recall previously experienced endel tulving zena pearlstone conducted experiment presented participants list words remembered words specific categories birds pigeon sparrow furniture chair dresser professions engineer lawyer categories made apparent original list participants free recall group asked write many words could remember list participants cued recall group also asked recall words group provided names categories birds furniture professions results tulving pearlstones experiment demonstrate retrieval cues aid memory participants free recall group recalled percent words whereas participants cued recall group recalled percent principle encoding specificity states encode information along context memory utilizes cues information encoded environment experiment demonstrating encoding specificity conducted r godden alan baddeley diving experiment experiment one group participants studied list words underwater another group participants studied list words land groups divided half participants land water groups tested recall land half tested underwater participants

memory recalled learned grouped together paired sensory information saying franks colleagues performed thirteen experiments tap found memory best enhanced learning situation matched retrieval idea behind levels processing theory depth processing effects well encode information learning craik tulving performed study participants presented list words word three questions questions varied requiring think word remembering saw craik tulving discovered words required deeper processing remembered craik tulving also discovered familiar stimulus recalling information increased reason
