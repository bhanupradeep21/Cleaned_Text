sense balance equilibrioception perception balance spatial helps prevent humans nonhuman animals falling standing moving equilibrioception result number sensory systems working together eyes visual system inner ears vestibular system bodys sense space proprioception ideally need vestibular system region inner ear three semicircular canals converge works visual system keep objects focus head moving called vestibuloocular reflex vor balance system works visual skeletal systems muscles joints sensors maintain orientation balance visual signals sent brain bodys position relation surroundings processed brain compared information vestibular skeletal systems vestibular system equilibrioception determined level fluid called endolymph labyrinth complex set tubing inner ear sense balance

sense balance impaired orbit constant state weightlessness causes form motion sickness called space adaptation syndrome overview also explains acceleration processes interconnected balance five sensory organs innervated vestibular nerve three semicircular canals horizontal scc superior scc posterior scc two otolith organs saccule utricle semicircular canal ssc thin tube doubles thickness briefly point called osseous ampullae centerbase contains ampullary cupula cupula gelatin bulb connected stereocilia hair cells affected relative movement endolymph bathed since cupula part bony labyrinth rotates along actual head movement without endolymph stimulated therefore could detect movement endolymph follows rotation canal however due inertia movement initially lags behind bony labyrinth delayed movement endolymph bends activates cupula cupula bends connected stereocilia bend along activating chemical reactions hair cells surrounding crista ampullaris eventually create action potentials carried vestibular nerve signaling body moved space extended rotation endolymph catches canal cupula returns upright position resets extended rotation ceases however endolymph continues due inertia bends activates cupula signal change pilots long banked turns begin feel upright longer turning endolymph matches canal rotation pilot exits turn cupula stimulated causing
