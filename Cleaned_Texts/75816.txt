chondroblastoma rare benign locally aggressive bone tumor typically affects epiphyses apophyses long thought arise outgrowth immature cartilage cells chondroblasts secondary ossification centers originating epiphyseal plate remnant chondroblastoma uncommon accounting less bone tumors chances condition roughly one affects mostly children young adults patients less years chondroblastoma shows predilection towards male sex ratio male female patients commonly affected site femur followed humerus less commonly affected sites include talus calcaneus foot flat common symptom mild severe pain gradually progressive affected region may initially attributed minor injury sportsrelated pain may present several weeks months symptoms order common least commonly observed include swelling limp affected bone lower extremity joint stiffness soft tissue physical findings include localized tenderness decreased range motion involved bone nearby joint muscle atrophy palpable mass soft tissue swelling joint effusion affected less commonly pathological fractures found especially cases involving cases involving temporal bone tinnitus dizziness hearing loss publication turcotte et al found average duration symptoms patients chondroblastoma months ranging weeks currently genetic environmental factors predispose individual chondroblastoma well known chondroblastoma affects males often females ratio clinical furthermore often observed young patients skeletally immature cases diagnosed second decade approximately patients presenting chondroblastoma younger indication racial predilection etiology chondroblastoma uncertain specific characteristic abnormality chromosomal breaking point observed despite cytogenetic abnormalities highly specific romeo et al noted chondroblastoma arising long bones mainly affects epiphyses locations close ossification additionally rare prevalence chondroblastoma intramembranous ossification suggests close relationship growth

typical occurrence growth plate indian hedgehogparathyroid hormonerelated protein ihhpthrp fibroblast growth factor fgf signaling pathways important development epiphyseal growth plate active chondroblastoma leading greater proliferation among cells proliferatingprehypertrophic zone cellularrich area versus hypertrophiccalcifying zone matrixrich findings suggest chondroblastoma derived mesenchymal cell undergoing chondrogenesis via active growthplate signaling pathways see endochondral highly heterogeneous nature tumor makes classification particularly difficult especially considering origins two opposing views nature chondroblastoma one favoring osseous origin favoring cartilaginous origin work aigner et al suggests chondroblastoma reclassified boneforming neoplasm versus cartilaginous neoplasm due presence osteoid matrix type collagen absence true cartilage matrix collagen however edel et al found collagen ii marker mature chondrocytes expressed chondroblastoma supporting chondroid nature results romeo colleagues favor view edel et al chondroblastoma cartilaginous nature recognize definitive determinations regarding origin neoplasm possible plasticity mesenchymal cells set different microenvironments static approaches used romeo et al observed chondroblastoma neoplasms composed mesenchymal cells completed normal chondrogenesis along production osteoid collagen could result transdifferentiation chondrocytes towards variety imaging studies used diagnose chondroblastoma radiographs laboratory studies considered classical chondroblastoma appearing long bones appears welldefined eccentric oval round lytic lesion usually involves adjacent bone cortex without periosteal sclerotic margin seen long bone chondroblastomas tumor typically contained epiphysis apophysis may extend epiphyseal chondroblastomas usually located medullary portion bones cases include however true metaphyseal chondroblastomas rare typically result extension neighboring epiphyseal lesions less mottled appearance radiograph atypical indicates areas calcification commonly associated skeletally immature additionally onethird cases involve aneurysmal bone cysts thought result stress trauma cases involving older patients flat bones typical radiographic presentation common may mimic aggressive imaging techniques involve computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri bone scans may helpful determining anatomical boundaries associated edema biological activity chondroblastoma mri studies may show extensive oedema around lesion show variable

present prerequisite mitotic figures observed chondroblastoma tissue considered atypical nature therefore viewed sign serious correlation mitotic activity location furthermore presence atypical cells rare associated malignant discernible histological differences observed comparing aggressive form chondroblastoma cause recurrence metastases less aggressive benign counterpartcitation needed chondromyxoid fibromas share characteristics chondroblastomas regards histologic radiographic findings however commonly originate metaphysis lack calcification different histologic organization differential diagnoses chondroblastoma consist giant cell tumors bone cysts eosinophilic granulomas clear cell chondrosarcomas enchondromas list chondroblastoma known spontaneously heal standard treatment surgical curettage lesion bone prevent recurrence complications important excise entire tumor following strict oncologic however skeletally immature patients intraoperative fluoroscopy may helpful avoid destruction epiphyseal patients near end skeletal growth complete curettage growth plate addition curettage electric chemical cauterization via phenol used well cryotherapy wide marginal depending size subsequent defect autograft allograft bone grafts preferred filling options include substituting polymethylmethacrylate pmma fat implantation place bone work ramappa et al suggests packing pmma may optimal choice heat polymerization cement thought kill remaining radiotherapy chemotherapy commonly radiotherapy implemented chondroblastoma cases increased risk aggressive suspected malignant furthermore radiofrequency ablation used typically successful small chondroblastoma lesions approximately treatment radiofrequency ablation highly dependent size location due increased risk larger weightbearing lesions increased risk articular collapse overall success method treatment highly dependent upon location size although specific one mode management lesion size patient sex followup recurrence rate chondroblastoma relatively high shown select studies dependent upon anatomical location method treatment biological aggressiveness initial rate recurrence highly variable ranging study results generally however local recurrence long bone lesions around chondroblastoma flat bones higher recurrence recurrences common cases involving open epiphyseal plate attributed inadequate curettage avoid lesions proximal femur particularly problematic difficulties accessing femoral head complete chondroblastoma may recur soft tissue surrounding initial lesion especially case incomplete recurrences shown occur months years initial treatment generally treated repeat curettage excision affected histological differences seen recurrent nonrecurrent rarely aggressive
