identification hearing loss usually conducted general practitioner medical doctor otolaryngologist certified licensed audiologist school industrial audiometrist audiometric technician diagnosis cause hearing loss carried specialist physician audiovestibular physician otorhinolaryngologist difference subjective objective hearing test subjective require child parents participation co operation informal assessment measure overall function ability depends behavioural techniques objective dont require patients participation formal test defines patients hearing ability well ear work depends autonomic physiologic response case history usually written form questionnaire provide valuable information context hearing loss indicate kind diagnostic procedures employ case history include items case infection inflammation blood body fluids may submitted laboratory analysis hearing loss generally measured playing generated recorded sounds determining whether person hear hearing sensitivity varies according frequency sounds take account hearing sensitivity measured range frequencies plotted audiogram method quantifying hearing loss hearing test using mobile application hearing aid application includes hearing hearing diagnosis using mobile application similar audiometry procedure result hearing test hearing thresholds different frequencies audiogram determined despite errors measurements application help diagnose hearing audiogram obtained using mobile application used adjust hearing aid alternative approach assessing hearing impairment utilization speechinnoise test evaluation method assesses individuals ability comprehend speech amidst background noise individuals hearing loss typically experience difficulty understanding speech particularly environments high levels noise especially true people sensorineural loss far common type hearing loss speechinnoise tests provide valuable information persons hearing ability used detect presence sensorineural hearing loss recently developed digittriple speechinnoise test may efficient screening otoacoustic emissions test objective hearing test may administered toddlers children young cooperate conventional hearing test test also useful older children adults important measure diagnosing auditory neuropathy described auditory brainstem response testing electrophysiological test used test hearing deficits caused pathology within ear cochlear nerve also within brainstem test used identify delay conduction neural impulses due tumours inflammation also objective test hearing thresholds electrophysiological tests cortical evoked responses look hearing pathway level auditory cortex mri ct scans useful identify pathology many causes hearing loss needed selected casesvague hearing loss categorized type severity configuration furthermore hearing loss may exist one ear unilateral ears bilateral hearing loss temporary permanent sudden progressive severity hearing loss ranked according ranges nominal thresholds

severe profound defined belowmedical citation needed audiometric classifications hearing impairment according international bureau audiophonology biap belgium hearing loss may affect one ears ears affected one ear may affected thus possible example normal hearing one ear none mild hearing loss one ear moderate hearing loss certain legal purposes insurance claims hearing loss described terms percentages given hearing loss vary frequency audiograms plotted logarithmic scale idea percentage hearing loss somewhat arbitrary decibels loss converted via legally recognized formula possible calculate standardized percentage hearing loss suitable legal purposes three main types hearing loss conductive hearing loss sensorineural hearing loss combinations conductive sensorineural hearing losses called mixed hearing additional problem increasingly recognised auditory processing disorder hearing loss difficulty perceiving sound conductive hearing loss present sound reaching inner ear cochlea due external ear canal malformation dysfunction eardrum malfunction bones middle ear eardrum may show defects small total resulting hearing loss different degree scar tissue ear infections may also make eardrum dysfunction well retracted adherent medial part middle ear dysfunction three small bones middle ear malleus incus stapes may cause conductive hearing loss mobility ossicles may impaired different reasons including boney disorder ossicles called otosclerosis disruption ossicular chain due trauma infection ankylosis may also cause hearing loss sensorineural hearing loss one
