nectar robbing foraging behavior utilized organisms feed floral nectar carried feeding holes bitten flowers rather entering flowers natural openings nectar robbers usually feed way avoiding contact floral reproductive structures therefore facilitate plant reproduction via pollination many species act pollinators also act nectar robbers nectar robbing considered form exploitation plantpollinator mutualism variation dependency nectar robber species species rob facultatively nectar robbers vary greatly species diversity include species carpenter bees bumblebees stingless trigona bees solitary bees wasps ants hummingbirds passerine birds including nectar robbing mammals include fruit swinhoes striped squirrel robs nectar ginger records nectar robbing nature date back least german naturalist christian konrad sprengel observed bumblebees perforating recorded book secret nature form fertilization flowers discovered written berlin charles darwin observed bumblebees stealing nectar flowers observations published book origin species nectar robbing specifically behavior consuming nectar perforation robbing hole floral tissue rather floral opening two main types nectar robbing primary robbing requires nectar forager perforates floral tissues secondary robbing foraging robbing hole created primary former often flowers whose nectar concealed hard reach long flowers tubular corollas prone robbing primary robbing often performed species long corollas able pierce bite holes flower secondary robbers often suitable mouth parts able create penetrations flowers reach nectar without robbing thus take advantage perforations already made organisms able steal nectar example shorttongued bees early bumblebee bombus pratorum unable reach nectar located base long flowers comfreys order access nectar bee enter flower hole bitten base stealing nectar without aiding pollination birds mostly primary robbers typically use beaks penetrate corolla tissue flower petals upper mandible used hold flower lower mandible creates hole extracts nectar common method employed bird species steal nectar aggressive manner example bullfinches reach nectar completely tearing corolla calyx mammal robbers striped squirrel chew holes base flower consume term floral larceny proposed include entire suite foraging behaviors floral rewards potentially disrupt include nectar theft floral visits remove nectar floral opening without pollinating flower base working removing nectar petals generally bypasses floral reproductive also important note individuals may exhibit mixed behaviors individual may practice combination legitimate pollination nectar robbing choose perform mix primary secondary robbing nectar robbing rates also greatly vary temporally spatially abundance nectar robbing fluctuate based season even within season inconsistency displayed nectar robbing makes difficult label certain species thieves complicates research ecological phenomenon nectar pollination systems mostly mutualistic meaning plant benefits pollinators transport male gametes pollinator benefits reward pollen nectar robbers receive rewards without direct contact reproductive parts flower behaviour easily assumed cheating however effect robbery plant sometimes neutral even example proboscis eurybia elvina come contact reproductive parts flower calathea ovandensis lead significant reduction fruitset another example percent flowers study site robbed robbers pollinate neither seed fruit set negatively effect floralnectar robbing plant fitness depends several issues firstly nectar robbers carpenter bees bumble bees birds pollinate pollination may take place body robber contacts reproductive parts plant robs pollen collection bees practice concert nectar impact trigona bees eg trigona ferricauda plant almost always negative probably aggressive territorial behaviour effectively evicts legitimate nectar robbers may change behaviour legitimate pollinators ways reducing amount nectar available may force pollinators visit flowers nectar foraging increased number flowers visited longer flight distances increase pollen flow outcrossing beneficial plant lessens inbreeding requires robbers completely consuming flowers nectar robber consumes flowers nectar legitimate pollinators may avoid flower resulting negative effect plant response different species legitimate pollinators also varies species like bumble bees bombus appositus b occidentalis many species nectarfeeding birds distinguish robbed unrobbed plants minimize energy cost foraging avoiding heavily robbed pollinating birds may better insects higher sensory ways bees distinguish robbed unrobbed flowers studied thought related damage petal tissue robbery changes nectar xylocopa sonorina steals nectar slit make base petals nectar robbing severely reduces success legitimate pollinators may able switch nectar functionality flowers curtailed nectar robbers severely maim flower shortening life span damaged flowers less attractive thus lead decrease visit frequency pollinators practice avoidance robbed flowers favor intact flowers nectar robbers diminish volume nectar flowers may also leave behind odor causes decrease visitation frequency legitimate pollinators nectar robbing also cause plants reallocate resources reproduction growth replenishing stolen nectar costly produce nectar robbing especially damage reproductive parts flower thus diminish fitness case effect robbery plant direct good example indirect effect change behaviour legitimate pollinator either increases decreases fitness plant primary secondary nectar secondary robbers take advantage holes made primary robbers flies bees secondary robbers species bombylius major act primary effect robbing positive robber also pollinates increases pollination legitimate pollinator negative robber damages reproductive parts plant reduces pollination success either competing legitimate pollinator lessening attractiveness positive reproductive results may occur nectar robbing robbers act pollinators different visit holes created primary robbers may attract secondary robbers commonly search nectar collect pollen anthers visit additionally certain dense arrangements flowers allow pollen transferred robber birds pierce holes flowers access nectar thus plant reproduction potentially boosted nectar robbing due increase potential pollen distinguishing legitimate pollinator nectar robber pollination systems cause coevolution close relationships figs fig wasps well yuccas yucca nectar robbers effect direct indirect plant pollinator fitness part coevolution nectar robbing detrimental plant plant species might evolve minimize traits attract robbers develop type protective mechanism hinder another option try neutralize negative effects nectar robbers nectar robbers adapted efficient nectar robbing instance hummingbirds diglossa flowerpiercers serrated bills thought aid incising flower tissue nectar nectar robbers may get food illegitimate ways mismatch morphologies mouthparts floral structure may rob nectar energysaving way get nectar completely clear pollination mutualisms persist presence cheating nectar robbers nevertheless exploitation always harmful plant relationship may able endure cheating mutualism may simply confer higher payoff nectar studies shown nectar robbing significant negative effect reproductive success male female even though much research defences evolved plants nectar robbers adaptations assumed rise traits used interactions plants herbivores especially florivores defences may evolved traits originally referred pollination defences nectar robbers thought include toxins secondary compounds escape time space physical barriers indirect toxins secondary compounds likely act defence nectar robbing often found floral nectar petal tissue evidence secondary compounds nectar affect nectar robbers one example plant called catalpa speciosa produces nectar containing iridoid glycosides deter nectarthieving ants legitimate bee low sugar concentration nectar may also deter nectar robbers without deterring pollinators dilute nectar yield net energy profits
