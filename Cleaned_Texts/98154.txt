typically considered basal theropod lies outside clade neotheropoda group includes advanced triassic theropods like coelophysis basal position daemonosaurus represents lineage extended earliest radiation dinosaurs middle triassic alongside forms eoraptor herrerasaurus south america phylogenetic analysis conducted original description found daemonosaurus chauliodus closely related tawa hallae theropod described ghost ranch neotheropoda although two theropods closely related tawa found quarry slightly older whitaker quarry ghost ranch sues et al noted discovery daemonosaurus provided
