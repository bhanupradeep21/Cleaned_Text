influenza b virus species genus betainfluenzavirus virus family orthomyxoviridae influenza b virus known infect humans pigs limited host range apparently responsible lack associated influenza pandemics contrast caused morphologically similar influenza virus mutate antigenic drift nevertheless accepted influenza b virus could cause significant morbidity mortality worldwide significantly impacts adolescents two known circulating lineages influenza b virus based antigenic properties surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin lineages termed quadrivalent influenza vaccine licensed cdc designed protect cocirculating lineages shown greater effectiveness prevention influenza caused influenza b virus previous trivalent however byamagata lineage might become extinct due pandemic october world health organization concluded protection yamagata lineage longer necessary seasonal flu vaccine reducing number lineages targeted vaccine four influenza b virus capsid enveloped virion consists envelope matrix protein nucleoprotein complex nucleocapsid polymerase complex sometimes spherical sometimes filamentous surface projections made hemagglutinin influenza b virus genome nucleotides long
