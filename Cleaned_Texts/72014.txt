hilda megabonebed complex fourteen probable centrosaurus apertus bonebeds discovered near town hilda alberta canada first described scientific literature david eberth donald brinkman vaia barkas ten years research hilda megabonebed significant behavior preserved dinosaurs dominant cause existence rather stratums geological history like also canadas largest wann langston jr recorded evidence centrosaurus bonebed near hilda alberta later taylor provincial museum alberta called royal alberta museum oversaw collection fossils yet another bonebed prospective bonebeds attracted attention scientists working royal tyrell museum hilda ideal location maintaining physical continuity across bonebeds physical continuity important discontinuity rock strata make harder tell bones deposited time eberth researchers considered hilda prime site continuous bonebed two reasons one related history one related present geography first cretaceous area situated closer western interior seaway sediment would deposited dinosaur provincial park secondly modern hilda area lacks rough badland terrain breaks many probably equivalent deposits dinosaur provincial royal tyrell museum finally performed preliminary survey area studied langston taylor entire new bonebeds next year research hilda began earnest two days researchers discovered separate bonebeds one mudstone bed extended least

mostly composed researchers found larger bones bonebeds tended lie base stratum fragments bone becoming smaller less concentrated higher positions mudstone bed bones angled parallel plane bed researchers found associated articulated fossils two hildas bone beds partial centrosaurus skull partial ceratopsian tail regarded higher quality specimens eberth brinkman barkas tried estimate number bones megabonebed order infer number animals died together formation however complexity bonebeds geologic taphonomic history allow rough represented densest part hilda megabonebed formed core fossil nevertheless amount quality preserved bone highly variable within centrosaur fossils densely concentrated middle side central region bonebed much researchers took average bone density two excavations within individual per square meters projected square meters bonebed estimated core area preserved remains researchers found least individuals discovered square meter area suspected relatively high density uniform throughout deposit concluded number centrosaurs preserved probably low remaining square meters hilda megabonebed contained fossil density observed core assuming periphery estimated average density would centrosaurs overall thus total estimated number centrosaurs preserved hilda area ranged several hundred however presence centrosaur bonebeds sides south saskatchewan river

centrosaur bonebeds interpreted formation terms herd dinosaurs drowning trying cross swollen eberth brinkman barkas proposed different explanation hilda megabonebed hypothesizing herd centrosaurus apertus well local wildlife killed researchers concluded component bonebeds hilda complex formed individual region around western interior seaway prone tropical storm activity many could become fullscale hurricanes similar weather events occur today gulf mexico floods would large enough entirely submerge coastal lowland plains dinosaurs living leaving nowhere hide escape centrosaurus likely poor swimming abilities herd would drowned sufficiently severe flooding centrosaurs killed flooding would vulnerable floodrelated disease outbreaks tropical storminduced floods probably common sources mass mortality centrosaurus according david eberth smaller local wildlife better equipped escape floodwaters centrosaurs noting birds could escape flight mammals reptiles could taken shelter trees died dinosaurss carcasses deposited clumps spread variation location concentration centrosaur bones caused factors like force dimensions flood smoothness roughness local terrain centrosaurs distribution variations likely coincided presence small subenvironments commonly found rivers like splays ponds deposited final resting places carcasses torn apart bones trampled chewed processes left

taphonomies suggests centrosaur carcasses permanently buried later flood rather one drowned floods may actually common enough primary means sediment deposited hilda area eberth brinkman barkas observed evidence sediment deformed contorted near top bottom hardened mudstone hilda megabonebed million years old age lower dinosaur park formation outcrops dinosaur provincial park monodominant bonebeds horned dinosaurs like styracosaurus pachyrhinosaurus centrosaurus common late cretaceous strata central southern close proximity large number bonebeds fueled suspicions experts different bonebeds may actually formed simultaneously according eberth brinkman barkas idea several bonebeds could formed together difficult test however difficulty emerges complicated nature local stratigraphy individual bonebeds difficult track hundred meters divided ancient channel deposits certainty regarding number events involved formation bone beds one occurred since least one bonebed known preserved rock stratum directly another hilda bonebeds distinguish preserved single easily traceable two scientific papers eberth getty currie formulated hypothesis formation centrosaur bonebeds dinosaur provincial park envisioned common flooding events drowning large numbers local wildlife including herds centrosaurus flowing water would distribute remains across local floodplain would buried later burial always permanent remains seem uncovered later flood activity buried yet later process reworking reburial might occurred decades millennia remains buried good final resting place often deposits left channels flowing eberth brinkman barkas thought scenario applied particularly well hilda bonebeds formed result similar processes dinosaur provincial bonebeds hilda dinosaur provincial park also preserve similar quantities types plant two areas differed however component bonebeds hilda megabonebed apart smaller preserved lower numbers dinosaurs centrosaur bonebeds dinosaur provincial park often square meters bonebeds tended preserve centrosaurs hundreds low thousands although first centrosaurus bonebed study fossils preserved hilda megabonebed provides additional data help scientists estimate size ceratopsid herds therefore better understand ceratopsid social hilda increases evidence herding centrosaurus centrosaur herds sometimes significantly larger previously thought possibly containing numbers high hundreds low abundant mudstone beds hilda area may imply floods like one drowned centrosaurs hilda researchers contended existence single megabonebed individual components hilda may imply bonebeds dinosaur provincial park may components larger hilda megabonebed may also support previously suggested notion kinds centrosaurines participated seasonal migrations travelling east brinkman others proposed hypothesis explain ceratopsians represented greater portion ornithischian biodiversity sites like unity saskatchewan onefour alberta near ancient coast famous centrosaur bonebeds dinosaur provincial park preserved inland migration hypothesis proposed brinkman others centrosaurs bred near coast reared young small family groups groups would migrate toward west order avoid seasonal hazards like storms exploit seasonally available resources direction migration progressed family groups would gradually merge becoming large herds may protected predators journey eberth
