placebo pləˈsiːboʊ pləseeboh roughly defined sham medical common placebos include inert tablets like sugar pills inert injections like saline sham placebos used randomized clinical trials test efficacy medical treatments serve epistemological tools screen noise clinical research placebos clinical trials ideally indistinguishable socalled verum treatments investigation except latter particular hypothesized remedial prevent recipient others knowing consent whether treatment active inactive expectations efficacy influence placebos also popular sometimes produce relief psychological mechanisms phenomenon known placebo effect affect patients perceive condition encourage bodys chemical processes relieving impact disease improvements patients experience treated placebo also due unrelated factors regression mean statistical effect unusually high low measurement likely followed less extreme use placebos clinical medicine raises ethical concerns especially disguised active treatment introduces dishonesty relationship bypasses informed assumed deception necessary placebos effect evidence placebos may subjective effects even patient aware treatment placebo known openlabel

bioethically complex issue placebocontrolled trials might provide information effectiveness treatment denies patients could best available unproven treatment informed consent usually required study considered ethical including disclosure test subjects receive placebo treatments ethics placebocontrolled studies debated revision process declaration particular concern difference trials comparing inert placebos experimental treatments versus comparing best available treatment experimental treatment differences trials sponsors developed countries versus trials targeted developing suggest existing medical treatments used instead placebos avoid patients receive medicine practice doctors prescribing placebos disguised real medication controversial chief concern deceptive could harm relationship long run say blanket consent general consent unspecified treatment given patients beforehand ethical others argue patients always obtain specific information name drug receiving side effects treatment view shared grounds patient also concerns legitimate doctors pharmacists could open charges fraud malpractice using critics also argued using placebos delay proper diagnosis
