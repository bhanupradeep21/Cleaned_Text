neural adaptation sensory adaptation gradual decrease time responsiveness sensory system constant stimulus usually experienced change stimulus example hand rested table tables surface immediately felt skin subsequently however sensation table surface skin gradually diminishes virtually unnoticeable sensory neurons initially respond longer stimulated respond example neural adaptation sensory neural systems form adaptation constantly detect changes environment neural receptor cells process receive stimulation go constant changes mammals living organisms sense vital changes environment key players several neural systems include see calcium biology send negative feedback second messenger pathways allow neural receptor cells close open channels response changes ion also mechanoreception systems use calcium inflow physically affect certain proteins move close open channels functionally highly possible adaptation may enhance limited response range neurons encode sensory signals much larger dynamic ranges shifting range stimulus also neural adaptation sense returning baseline stimulated recent work suggests baseline states actually determined longterm adaptation varying rates speed adaptation important indicator tracking different rates change environment organism current research shows although adaptation occurs multiple stages sensory pathway often stronger stimulus specific cortical level rather subcortical short neural adaptation thought happen central level fast adaptation slow adaptation fast adaptation occurs immediately stimulus presented ie within hundreds milliseconds slow adaptive processes take minutes hours even days two classes neural adaptation may rely different physiological time scale adaptation builds recovers depends time course brief stimulation produces adaptation occurs recovers prolonged stimulation produce slower lasting forms also repeated sensory stimulation appears temporarily decrease gain thalamocortical synaptic transmission adaptation cortical responses stronger recovered vastly different timescales adaptation also shown implemented single neuron level give rise timescale free late hermann helmholtz german

studies using magnetoencephalography meg demonstrated subjects exposed repeated visual stimulus brief intervals become attenuated stimulus comparison initial stimulus results revealed visual responses repeated compared novel stimulus showed significant reduction activation strength peak latency duration neural although motion images extremely important regarding adaptation important adaptation adjusting brightness levels entering dark room brightly lit room takes little adjust different levels adjusting brightness levels allows mammals detect changes surrounding called dark adaptation auditory adaptation perceptual adaptation senses process individuals adapt sounds noises research shown time progresses individuals tend adapt sounds tend distinguish less frequently sensory adaptation tends blend sounds one variable sound rather several separate sounds series moreover repeated perception individuals tend adapt sounds point longer consciously perceive rather block individual lives close train tracks eventually stop noticing sounds passing trains similarly individuals living larger cities longer notice traffic sounds moving completely different area quiet countryside individual would aware silence crickets mechanoreception sound requires specific set receptor cells called hair cells allow gradient signals pass onto spatial ganglia signal sent brain
