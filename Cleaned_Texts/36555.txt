pain negatively affects health welfare pain defined international association study pain unpleasant sensory emotional experience associated actual potential tissue damage described terms animal experiencing pain know pains quality intensity degree suffering harder even possible observer know whether emotional experience occurred especially sufferer therefore concept often excluded definitions pain animals provided zimmerman aversive sensory experience caused actual potential injury elicits protective motor vegetative reactions results learned avoidance may modify speciesspecific behaviour including social nonhuman animals report feelings languageusing humans manner human communication observation behaviour provides reasonable indication extent pain doctors medics sometimes share common language patients indicators pain still understood according us national research council committee recognition alleviation pain laboratory animals pain experienced many animal species including mammals possibly overview anatomy nervous system across animal kingdom indicates vertebrates also invertebrates capacity feel although numerous definitions pain almost involve two key components first nociception ability detect noxious stimuli evoke reflex response rapidly moves entire animal affected part body away source stimulus concept nociception imply adverse subjective feeling reflex action example humans would rapid withdrawal finger touched something hot withdrawal occurs sensation pain actually experienced second component experience pain suffering internal emotional interpretation nociceptive experience humans withdrawn finger begins hurt moments withdrawal pain therefore private emotional experience pain directly measured animals including humans responses putatively painful stimuli measured experience address problem assessing capacity species experience pain argumentbyanalogy used based principle animal responds stimulus similar way likely analogous experience nociception usually involves transmission signal along nerve fibers site noxious stimulus periphery spinal cord although signal also transmitted brain reflex response flinching withdrawal limb produced return signals originating spinal cord thus physiological behavioral responses nociception detected reference need made conscious experience pain based criteria nociception observed major animal nerve impulses nociceptors may reach brain information stimulus eg quality location intensity effect unpleasantness registered though brain activity involved studied brain processes underlying conscious awareness well knowncitation needed adaptive value nociception obvious organism detecting noxious stimulus immediately withdraws limb appendage entire body noxious stimulus thereby avoids potential injury however characteristic pain mammals least pain result hyperalgesia heightened sensitivity noxious stimuli allodynia heightened sensitivity nonnoxious stimuli heightened sensitisation occurs adaptive value less clear first pain arising heightened sensitisation disproportionate actual tissue damage caused second heightened sensitisation may also become chronic persisting well beyond tissues healing mean rather actual tissue damage causing pain pain due heightened sensitisation becomes concern means sensitisation process sometimes termed maladaptive
