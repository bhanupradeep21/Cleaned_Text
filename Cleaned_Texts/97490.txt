adrenergic storms caused use stimulant drugs notably phenethylamines cathinones several known causes adrenergic storms united states cocaine overdose leading stimulant drug capacity cause syndrome

serotonin synapses causes similar crisis hypertension mental confusion could confused adrenergic storm serotonin tryptamine noncatecholamine involved higher brain functions cause dangerous hypertension tachycardia effects sympathetic nervous symptoms caused excessive adrenergic signalling occur alongside serotonergic signalling one example would overdose drugs influencing multiple

death close however aggravate patient taken first line treatments diazepam nonselective beta blocker antihypertensive drugs may also used important note benzodiazepines beta blockers safe use adrenergic storm instance alprazolam alprazolam weakly agonizes dopamine receptors causes catecholamine release propranolol mildly promotes catecholamine release worsening antipsychotics also used treat psychiatric symptoms aggression agitation psychosis paranoia anxiety originally use antipsychotics discouraged potential prolong qt however newer research revealed careful use carry potential significant side effects today judicious use adrenergic storms often idiopathic nature however underlying condition must addressed bringing heart rate blood pressure
