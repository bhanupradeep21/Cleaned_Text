wimanius genus ichthyosaur middle triassic switzerland containing single species wimanius odontopalatus described michael maisch andreas matzke based incomplete skull monte san giorgio mountain swissitalian border wimanius possesses teeth palate though whether located palatine pterygoid disputed features wimanius include large orbit jugals two rami similar lengths different phylogenetic placements wimanius recovered different studies including mixosaurid relative merriamosaur monotypic family wimaniidae named however validity also questioned synonymy various genera proposed type specimen wimanius first recognized belonging new genus michael maisch andreas matzke examining mixosaurus specimens museum für geologie und paläontologie der universität tübingen specimen numbered

shales monte san giorgio italy switzerland rich fossils yielded many marine reptiles including ichthyosaurs besanosaurus cymbospondylus especially common wimanius odontopalatus named maisch matzke genus name honoring swedish paleontologist carl wiman species name referring presence teeth palate unusual feature foremost bones snout wimanius premaxillae long thin next tooth row premaxilla marked palatal ridge inner premaxillae would extended external nares openings behind premaxillae maxillae bear nine teeth teeth extend weakly hooked upwardsprojecting processes maxillae form external nares back edges portions maxillae front processes shallow behind platelike tapering bear ridge marking jugal articulated nasal bones mostly narrow broad flat toward hind seem extended far back skull poorly preserved curved bone tentatively identified postfrontal maisch matzke backtracked identification following jugal thin bone consisting two rami intersect curved shape like leptonectids triassic ichthyosaur features lower two rami bears ridge along top outer surface bowed inwards ramus rises vertically thick keeled postorbital probably located front therefore rear portion orbit would formed crescentic based reconstruction skull maisch matzke found wimanius large orbits proportionally largest known among triassic ichthyosaurs time resulting back part skull rather tall however considered possibly result specimen juvenile circle bony plates within orbit known sclerotic ring would supported eye two plates known maisch matzke estimated complete ring would total based reconstructed orbit size plates quite large wimanius gave ring rather small inner portion skull behind orbits reduced length though may due specimen supratemporals triradiate bones skull region two processes contributed rim supratemporal fenestrae one process large wide quadrangular reaching forwards thin extending towards midline third backwardsprojecting process reduced probable squamosal also known incomplete poorly quadratojugals flat roughly triangular bones postorbital region less straight rear lower edges bowed upper edges maisch matzke considered probable jugal front lower portion quadratojugal contact life distinct constricted process quadratojugal would articulated quadrate cranial bone involved jaw joint preserved based quadratojugals shape maisch matzke predicted large opening would present two bones wimanius possesses palatal teeth though bone located disputed due poor preservation palatal maisch matzke considered flakelike bone upon teeth situated palatine original description citing presence teeth bone however ryosuke motani argued toothbearing palatal bone instead likely pterygoid utatsusaurus noting supposed palatal teeth grippia instead additional rows maxillary spread area millimetres long palatal teeth arranged one two rows different regions oriented front back complete teeth millimetre tall smoothsided conical crown coarse bone maisch matzke identified pterygoid straight inner edge indicating pterygoids would enclosed little space articulated bone possesses robust process outer side interpreted articulating prominent backwards projection inner side posteromedial wimanius quadrangular supraoccipital midline braincase bone forms top part opening foramen magnum semicircular taxon otic capsules would attached supraoccipital welldeveloped facets maisch matzke tentatively identified small flat narrow bone stapes unusually bone forked end typical temnospondyl though morphology reported lower jaw wimanius measures around centimetres holotype indicating animal probably rather dentaries reach far back along lower jaw level coronoid wimanius low eminence situated surangular front jaw surangulars long reinforced rear mandibular bones surangulars upcurved located directly teeth wimanius straight coneshaped tooth set distinct socket tooth crowns bear vertical striations strongly pronounced bases tips lack cutting edges ornamentation less pronounced known lower teeth upper teeth jaws tooth size smaller front larger paper naming wimanius maisch matzke noted fragmentary nature known specimen made difficult determine classify much confidence noted seem closely resemble either mixosaurids shastasaurids though considered closely related latter group extension ichthyosaurs jurassic however following year authors restudied skull found closely resemble mixosaurid therefore proposed potentially closely related group instead however also considered possible wimanius branched earlier ichthyosaur evolution compared mikadocephalus another ichthyosaur monte san giorgio considered two different variety motani classified wimanius ichthyosauria incertae sedis additionally noted wimanius mikadocephalus differ aspects quite similar others therefore arguging study needed distinctiveness wimanius could martin sander also expressed doubt whether wimanius valid stated study would needed ichthyosaurs region determine addition noting similarity mikadocephalus also argued mikadocephalus probably synonymous besanosaurus sander classified wimanius shastasaurid considered possible represented juvenile however maisch matzke considered wimanius valid diagnosable taxon including phylogenetic analysis finding sister taxon book christopher mcgowan motani considered wimanius mikadocephalus might junior synonyms taxonomically problematic pessosaurus however personally observered relevant specimens refrained formally synonymizing taxa instead listing species maisch named new monotypic family wimaniidae using name mixosauria group
