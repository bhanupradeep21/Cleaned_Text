nemaline myopathy also called rod myopathy nemaline rod myopathy congenital often hereditary neuromuscular disorder many symptoms occur muscle weakness hypoventilation swallowing dysfunction impaired speech ability severity symptoms varies change throughout ones life extent prevalence estimated live common nondystrophic myopathy means muscle disease muscle fibers person nemaline myopathy contains rods sometimes called nemaline rods diagnostic disorder likely byproduct disease process rather causing dysfunction people nemaline myopathy nm usually experience delayed motor development motor development severe cases weakness may occur skeletal muscles muscles arms legs torso neck flexors throat face weakness tends severe proximal muscles rather distal muscles ocular muscles normally spared disorder often clinically categorized groups wide ranges overlapping severity severe neonatal form incompatible life form mild may diagnosed since person appears function lowest end normal strength breathing adequacy sporadic late onset nemaline myopathy slonm congenital disorder considered different muscle disease nm onset birth early respiratory problems usually primary concern people forms nm respiratory infections quite common nm shortens life expectancy particularly severe forms aggressive proactive care allows individuals survive even lead active lives nemaline myopathy one neuromuscular diseases covered muscular dystrophy association united states signs vary person person young children babies lack movement difficult time eating breathing young children diagnosed immediately birth usually first visible symptoms one sign swollen face disproportional areas examples newborns include swaying difficulty moving symptoms include feeble muscles neck upper rib cage area adults common symptom respiratory symptoms adults could range mild severe speech impediments common diagnosed scoliosis relations nemaline babies nm develop become age start walking many take longer average due lack muscle muscle since facial muscles involved nm takeover elongated faces lower mandible often observed people nm people affected nm usually begin feel muscle exhaustion ages nm usually progressive gastroesophageal reflux although common associated nm heart abnormalities occur result nm likelihood happening children mild nm eventually walk independently although often later age peers use wheelchairs devices walkers braces enhance mobility individuals severe nm generally limited limb movement use wheelchairs fulltime due weakness trunk muscles people nm prone scoliosis usually develops childhood worsens puberty many individuals nm undergo spinal fusion surgery straighten stabilize backscitation needed although patients early often mobility joints past normal range age joint deformities scoliosis usually person nemaline myopathy keeps eye joints early problems detected begin progression delayed treatment joint problems ranges stretching exercises physical therapy surgical introduction braces benefits exercise people nemaline myopathy still studied however researchers seen improvements muscle function lowintensity exercise vigorous exercise use heavy weights avoidedcitation needed attention respiratory issues critical health many people nm infants severe nm frequently experience respiratory distress soon birth although found rarest forms though respiratory compromise may immediately apparent people intermediate mild nm often always exists extent many neuromuscular disorders hypoventilation begin insidiously may cause serious health problems remedied use noninvasive mechanical devices assist breathing particularly nightcitation needed bulbar throat muscle weakness main feature nemaline myopathy individuals severe forms nm unable swallow receive nutrition feeding tubes people intermediate mild nm take nutrition orally bulbar muscle impairment may also lead difficulty communication people nm often hypernasal speech result poor closure velopharyngeal port soft palate back throat may able surgically corrected communicative skills may enhanced speech therapy oral prosthetic devices surgery augmentative communication devices nm impact cognition intelligencecitation needed physical expression nemaline myopathy varies greatly weakness usually concentrated proximal muscles particularly respiratory bulbar trunk people severe nm show obvious symptoms birth intermediate mild nm may initially appear unaffected babies nm frequently observed floppy hypotonic children born nm often gain strength grow though effect muscle weakness body features may become evident time adults nm typically slender nemaline myopathy caused mutations one least different nemaline myopathy clinically genetically heterogeneous disorder autosomal dominant autosomal recessive forms occur diagnosis made based upon clinical signs muscle weakness absent low deep tendon reflexes hyporeflexia higharched palate along electrondense aggregates called nemaline rods observed microscopic level within muscle fibers genetic confirmation identification known genetic mutation patient also important component two common gene mutations causing nemaline myopathy
