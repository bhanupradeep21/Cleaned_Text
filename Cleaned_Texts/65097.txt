capillary leak syndrome vascular leak syndrome characterized escape blood plasma capillary walls blood circulatory system surrounding tissues muscle compartments organs body cavities phenomenon commonly witnessed sepsis less frequently autoimmune diseases differentiation syndrome engraftment syndrome hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome viral hemorrhagic fevers snakebite ricin pharmaceuticals including chemotherapy medications gemcitabine denileukin diftitox well certain interleukins monoclonal antibodies also cause capillary conditions factors sources secondary capillary leak syndrome systemic capillary leak syndrome scls also called clarksons disease primary capillary leak syndrome rare grave episodic medical condition observed largely otherwise healthy individuals mostly middle characterized selfreversing episodes endothelial cells line capillaries usually extremities separate one three days causing leakage plasma mainly muscle compartments arms legs abdomen central nervous system organs including lungs typically spared extravasation extremities sufficiently massive cause circulatory shock compartment syndromes dangerous

exceedingly rare estimated one per million inhabitants several diseases exhibit features akin scls including secondary capillaryleak syndrome hypoproteinemia militate early preserved consciousness despite severe shock hypotension additional intriguing clinical manifestation often reported episodes hospital natural history scls episodes indicates usually resolve spontaneously within days consist two distinct initial stage capillary leak phase lasting days total plasma volume invades body cavities especially common clinical features flulike symptoms fatigue runny nose lightheadedness including syncope fainting limb abdominal generalized pain facial edema dyspnea hypotension results circulatory shock potentially cardiopulmonary collapse organ distress acute kidney injury failure common risk due acute tubular necrosis consequent hypovolemia escape fluid capillaries similar effects circulation dehydration slowing flow oxygen delivered tissues organs well output urine causing oliguria urgent medical attention phase often features fluid resuscitation efforts mainly intravenous administration saline solution plus hetastarch albumin colloids increase remaining blood flow vital organs like kidneys well glucocorticoids steroids like methylprednisolone reduce stop capillary however impact fluid therapy always transient leads increased extravascular fluid accumulation engendering multiple complications especially compartment syndrome thus limbdestructive rhabdomyolysis consequently fluid resuscitation minimized much possible patients experiencing episodes scls closely monitored hospital intensivecare setting including orthopedic complications requiring surgical recent clinical experience suggests administration immunoglobulins ivig minimal additional intravenous fluids close start episode scls safe way support patients leak phase associated rapid clinical second stage features reabsorption initially extravasated fluid albumin tissues usually lasts days intravascular fluid overload leads polyuria cause flash pulmonary edema cardiac arrest possibly fatal death scls typically occurs recruitment phase pulmonary edema arising excessive intravenous fluid administration earlier leak severity problem depends quantity fluid supplied initial phase damage may sustained kidneys promptness diuretics administered help patient discharge accumulated fluids recent study acute episodes occurring hospitalized scls patients concluded highvolume fluid therapy independently associated poorer clinical outcomes main complications scls episodes recoveryphase
