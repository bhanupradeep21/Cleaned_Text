supporters german zoologist ernst haeckel criticised using theory explain origin life haeckel wrote chief defect darwinian theory throws light origin primitive simple others descended darwin assumes special creative act first species consistent think quite although darwin speak explicitly origin life origin species mention warm little pond letter joseph dalton hooker dated february often said

still complex changes present matter would instantly devoured absorbed would case living creatures formed coherent scientific argument introduced soviet biochemist alexander oparin according oparin primitive earths surface carbon hydrogen water vapour ammonia reacted form first organic compounds unbeknownst oparin whose writing circulated russian english scientist j b haldane independently arrived similar conclusion haldane first used term soup describe accumulation organic material water primitive earth ultraviolet light acts mixture water carbon dioxide ammonia vast variety organic substances made including sugars apparently materials proteins built origin life must accumulated till primitive oceans reached consistency hot dilute soup according theory organic compounds essential life forms synthesized primitive earth prebiotic conditions mixture inorganic organic compounds water primitive earth became prebiotic primordial soup life originated first forms life able use organic molecules survive reproduce today theory variously known heterotrophic theory heterotrophic origin life theory oparinhaldane biochemist robert shapiro summarized basic points theory mature form alexander oparin first postulated theory russian small pamphlet titled proiskhozhdenie zhizny origin according oparin primitive earths surface thick redhot liquid composed heavy elements carbon form iron carbide nucleus surrounded lightest elements ie gases hydrogen presence water vapour carbides reacted hydrogen form hydrocarbons hydrocarbons first organic molecules combined oxygen ammonia produce hydroxy aminoderivatives carbohydrates proteins molecules accumulated oceans surface becoming gellike substances growing size gave rise primitive organisms cells called original theory oparin considered oxygen one primordial gases thus primordial atmosphere oxidising one however elaborated theory book title translated english modified chemical composition primordial environment strictly reducing consisting methane ammonia free hydrogen water work impregnated darwinian thought involved slow gradual evolution simple complex oparin proposed heterotrophic origin result long process chemical prebiological evolution first forms life microorganisms dependent molecules organic substances present external external environment primordial soup idea heterotrophic origin based part universality fermentative reactions according oparin first appeared evolution due simplicity opposed idea widely accepted time first organisms emerged endowed autotrophic metabolism included photosynthetic pigments enzymes ability synthesize organic compounds oparin impossible reconcile original photosynthetic organisms ideas darwinian evolution detailed analysis geochemical astronomical data known date oparin also proposed primitive atmosphere devoid composed conditions pointed origin life preceded period abiotic synthesis subsequent accumulation various organic compounds seas primitive accumulation resulted formation primordial broth containing wide variety molecules according oparin particular type colloid coacervates formed due conglomeration organic molecules polymers positive negative charges oparin suggested first living beings preceded precellular structures similar coacervates whose gradual evolution gave rise appearance first like coacervates several oparins original ideas reformulated replaced includes example reducing character atmosphere primitive earth coacervates precellular model primitive nature glycolysis way understand gradual processes necessarily slow even know thanks fossil record origin early evolution life occurred short geologic time lapses however general approach oparins theory great implications biology since work achieved transformation study origin life purely speculative field structured broad research thus since second half twentieth century oparins theory origin early evolution life undergone restructuring accommodates experimental findings molecular biology well theoretical contributions evolutionary biology point convergence two branches biology perfectly incorporated heterotrophic origin theory found rna world hypothesis jbs haldane independently postulated primordial soup theory eightpage article origin life rationalist according haldane primitive earths atmosphere essentially reducing little oxygen ultraviolet rays sun induced reactions mixture water carbon dioxide ammonia organic substances sugars protein components amino acids synthesised molecules accumulated till primitive oceans reached consistency hot dilute soup first reproducing things created priority theory haldane accepted oparin came first saying little doubt professor oparin priority one important pieces experimental support soup theory came graduate student stanley miller professor harold urey performed experiment demonstrated organic molecules could spontaneously formed inorganic precursors conditions like posited hypothesis nowfamous experiment used highly reduced mixture ammonia form basic organic monomers amino provided direct experimental support second point soup theory one remaining two points
