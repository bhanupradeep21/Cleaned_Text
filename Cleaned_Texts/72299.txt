neutral theory molecular evolution holds evolutionary changes occur molecular level variation within species due random genetic drift mutant alleles selectively neutral theory applies evolution molecular level compatible phenotypic evolution shaped natural selection postulated charles darwin neutral theory allows possibility mutations deleterious holds rapidly removed natural selection make significant contributions variation within species molecular level neutral mutation one affect organisms ability survive reproduce neutral theory assumes mutations deleterious neutral rather beneficial fraction gametes sampled generation species neutral theory suggests mutant allele arise within population reach fixation chance rather selective theory introduced japanese biologist motoo kimura independently two american biologists jack lester king thomas hughes jukes described detail kimura monograph neutral theory molecular evolution proposal neutral theory followed extensive controversy interpretation patterns molecular divergence gene polymorphism peaking neutral theory frequently used null hypothesis opposed adaptive explanations describing emergence morphological genetic features organisms populations suggested number areas including explaining genetic variation populations one nominal emergence complex subcellular convergent emergence several typical microbial scientists freese freese yoshida suggested neutral mutations probably widespread original mathematical derivation theory published ra fisher fisher however gave reasoned argument believing practice neutral gene substitutions would coherent theory neutral evolution first proposed motoo kimura king jukes independently kimura initially focused differences among species king jukes focused differences within species many molecular biologists population geneticists also contributed development neutral principles population genetics established jbs haldane ra fisher sewall wright created mathematical approach analyzing gene frequencies contributed development kimuras theory haldanes dilemma regarding cost selection used motivation kimura haldane estimated takes generations beneficial mutation become fixed mammalian lineage meaning number substitutions per year evolution humans chimpanzees high explained beneficial mutations neutral theory holds functional constraint diminishes probability mutation neutral rises rate sequence divergence comparing various proteins extremely high evolutionary rates observed proteins fibrinopeptides c chain proinsulin molecule little

linkage nonneutral alleles appearing mutation neutral allele may become common within population via genetic drift usually lost rare cases may become fixed meaning new allele becomes standard population according neutral theory molecular evolution amount genetic variation within species proportional effective population size heated debate arose kimuras theory published largely revolving around relative percentages polymorphic fixed alleles neutral versus nonneutral genetic polymorphism means different forms particular genes hence proteins produce coexisting within species selectionists claimed polymorphisms maintained balancing selection neutralists view variation protein transient phase molecular studies richard k koehn w f eanes demonstrated correlation polymorphism molecular weight molecular consistent neutral theory assumption larger subunits higher rates neutral mutation selectionists hand contribute environmental conditions major determinants polymorphisms rather structural functional according neutral theory molecular evolution amount genetic variation within species proportional effective population size levels genetic diversity vary much less census population sizes giving rise paradox variation high levels genetic diversity one original arguments favor neutral theory paradox variation one strongest arguments neutral theory large number statistical methods testing whether neutral theory good description evolution eg mcdonaldkreitman many authors claimed detection researchers nevertheless argued neutral theory still stands expanding definition neutral theory include background selection linked tomoko ohta also emphasized importance nearly neutral mutations particularly slightly deleterious nearly neutral theory stems prediction neutral theory balance selection genetic drift depends effective population nearly neutral mutations carry selection coefficients less inverse twice effective population population dynamics nearly neutral mutations slightly different neutral mutations unless absolute magnitude selection coefficient greater n effective population size respect effective population size affects whether slightly deleterious mutations treated neutral large populations selection decrease frequency slightly deleterious mutations therefore acting deleterious however small populations genetic drift easily overcome selection causing slightly deleterious mutations act neutral drift fixation groundworks theory constructive neutral evolution cne laid two papers constructive neutral evolution theory suggests complex structures processes emerge neutral transitions although separate theory altogether emphasis neutrality process whereby neutral alleles randomly fixed genetic drift finds inspiration earlier attempt neutral theory invoke importance conceptually two components b may represent two proteins interact performs function system depend interaction b functionality interaction may randomly arisen individual ability disappear without effect fitness present yet currently unnecessary interaction therefore called excess capacity system however mutation may occur compromises ability perform function independently however ab interaction already emerged sustains capacity perform initial function therefore emergence ab interaction presuppresses deleterious nature mutation making neutral change genome capable spreading population via random genetic drift hence gained dependency interaction case loss b ab interaction would negative effect fitness purifying selection would eliminate individuals occurs steps individually reversible example may regain capacity function independently ab interaction may lost random sequence mutations tends reduce capacity function independently random walk dependency space may well result configuration return functional independence far unlikely occur makes cne onedirectional ratchetlike cne invoke adaptationist mechanisms origins complex
