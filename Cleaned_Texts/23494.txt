feline morbillivirus comes genus morbillivirus specifically influencing wild domestic cats first report feline morbillivirus outbreak occurred hong kong approximately stray cats hong kong mainland china reported possess virus time additional infections found japan well cats tested japan fmopv positive exhibited early symptoms kidney failure first cases feline morbillivirus found china hong kong japan virus also found italy germany united states feline morbillivirus exhibits substantial amount genetic diversity yet cases japan hong kong proved identical nucleotide sequences also hypothesized morbillivirus high adaptability due presence multiple species often found dogs cats cattle whales dolphins porpoises even humans likely originated ancestral version underwent viral evolution adapt transmission different species common morbilliviruses include measles rinderpest virus canine distemper virus peste des petits ruminants feline morbillivirus like morbilliviruses possesses negativestrand rna genomecitation needed virus spherical shape enveloped capsid approximately nm diameter capsid covered fusion hemagglutinin proteins inside capsid exists negativesense rna genome covered nucleoproteins matrix proteins well polymerase phosphoprotein toward end genetic material genome arranged linear pattern length known largest morbilliviruses due makeup base pairs guanine cytosine pairings make considerable portion viral genome ranging comparison adenine thymine morbilliviruses leader sequence trailer sequence typically made nt feline morbillivirus however breaks typical trailer sequence rule unusually long sequence genome encodes eight different proteins n c p v f h l l protein also called large protein involved atp binding rna polymerase activity mrna methyltransferase activity thus multifunctional enzyme n gene exhibits greatest incidence nucleotide polymorphism p protein highest incidence amino acid viral classification scheme species feline morbillivirus followscitation needed order mononegavirales family paramyxoviridae subfamily paramyxovirinae genus morbillivirus species feline morbillivirus genus morbillivirus fairly well known among various wild domesticated species discovery virus felines relatively novel therefore known replication cycle felines extrapolated experiments done animals ferret model used test entry spread transmission virus organism ferret model virus transmitted contact bodily fluids infected foods airborne contact infected fmopv often associated attacking associated renal tissues virus also compatible receptors following cells epithelial glial fibroblastic lymphoid cells increases risk transmission areas body well subsequent failure affected morbilliviruses enter cell attaching onto host cell via viral glycoproteins specifically acts receptor viral entry cell receptor often expressed dendritic cells macrophages bcells tcells offers clear information morbilliviruses quickly infect immune cells another newly discovered cellular receptor called allows morbillivirus entry bronchial epithelial cells keratinocytes additionally feline morbillivirus f protein known single cleavage site splits protein separate proteins play important role fusing viral cellular membranes together since virus possesses negativesense rna genome replication transcription cycles follow negativerna genome therefore replicate negative singlestranded rna genome must use rnadependent rna polymerase generate positive strand rna directly made protein host ribosomes likewise positive negative rna strands must present replication genome occur rnadependent rna polymerase binds end viral genome begins transcription regularly identifying start stop signals along way edge genes mrna synthesis viral l protein aids capping polyadenylating product replication occurs cytoplasm host cell begins viral h glycoprotein attaching surface host cell virus fused cell releases ribonucleocapsid allowing transcription genome mrna well sequential capping polyadenylation mrna replication starts enough nucleoprotein must available shield viral assembly takes place cytoplasm release virion takes place via budding host cell membrane virus transmits host host via respiratory droppings revealed via ferret virion interacts host manipulates cell machinery various ways enters using cells receptors originally designed viral entry specifically receptors used viral entry respective bodily regions found many immune cells including macrophages dendritic cells bcells tcells present keratinocytes epidermis bronchial epithelial cells additionally viral v protein known role inhibiting antiviral signaling acts increase interferon production face infection virally infected sends signals corresponding antiviral state order fewer interferons produced interfere viral replication virus uses enzyme make copy genome hijacks host ribosomes translate rna protein specifically felines virus known interact renal system species known negatively influence respiratory epithelial immune central nervous virus often affiliated tubulointerstitial nephritis domestic cats study done domestic cats woo et al tested fmopv positive also exhibited symptoms kidney disease namely necrosis tissues degeneration renal tubules expression cauxin protein also diminished correlates tubulointerstitial nephritis cauxin plays role production felinine glycine act feline pheromones cats use territorial markers cases tubulointerstitial nephritis brought feline morbillivirus cauxin levels significantly animals well morbillivirus connected acute febrile respiratory tract infection also hypothesized fmopv could linked cns disease due fact cells susceptible feline morbillivirus cells originate astrocytes glial cells central nervous systemcitation needed specific body tissues associated morbillivirus growth proliferation include epithelial renal immune central nervous tissues various systems virus able bind
