horizontal adduction elbow extensions barbell bench press dumbbell bench press machine bench press induce high activation pectoralis major sternocostal region heavy loads strongly correlated pectoralis major tears pectoralis major rare typically affect otherwise healthy individuals type injury known affect athletic population namely highimpact contact sports powerlifting may result pain weakness disability lesions located musculotendinous junction result violent eccentric contraction muscle bench less frequent rupture site muscle belly usually result direct blow developed countries lesions occur male athletes especially practicing contact sports weightlifting particularly bench press maneuver women less susceptible tears larger tendontomuscle diameter greater muscular elasticity less energetic injury characterized sudden acute pain chest wall shoulder area bruising loss strength muscle high grade partial full thickness tears warrant surgical repair preferred treatment function preserved particularly athletic population acting fast obtaining correct diagnoses getting surgical repair soon possible key successful recovery waiting cause acute injury become chronic chances success greatly diminished result surgery impacted arm immobilized sling six eight weeks minimize avoid movement arm potentially rerupturing surgery site two months surgery physical therapy
