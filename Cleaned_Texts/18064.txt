muscles circular group called sphincter pupillae radial group called dilator pupillae sphincter pupillae contract iris decreases constricts size pupil dilator pupillae innervated sympathetic nerves superior cervical ganglion cause pupil dilate contract muscles sometimes referred intrinsic eye muscles sensory pathway rod cone bipolar ganglion linked counterpart eye partial crossover eyes fibers

lighting people affected condition normally dilated pupils bright lighting cause pain end spectrum people condition trouble seeing darkness necessary people especially careful driving night due

pupilcitation needed would explain slit pupils tend found eyes animals crepuscular nocturnal lifestyle need protect eyes daylight constriction circular pupil ringshaped muscle less complete closure slit pupil uses two additional muscles laterally compress example cats slit pupil change light intensity retina compared however explanation account circular pupils closed small size eg mm tarsier
