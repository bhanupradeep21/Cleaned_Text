contributes bacteriostatic properties doxycycline affect bacteria surface sebaceous glands even lower doses called whether doxycyclines antiinflammatory effects reduce inflammation acne vulgaris rosacea contribute therapeutic effectiveness skin subantimicrobialdose doxycycline sdd still bacteriostatic effect especially taken extended periods several months treating acne sdd believed antiinflammatory effects rather solely antibacterial effects sdd proven work reducing inflammation associated acne rosacea still exact mechanisms yet fully one probable mechanism doxycyclines ability decrease amount reactive oxygen species ros inflammation rosacea may associated increased production ros inflammatory cells ros contribute towards exacerbating symptoms doxycycline may reduce ros levels induce antioxidant activity directly scavenges hydroxyl radicals singlet oxygen helping minimize tissue damage caused highly oxidative inflammatory studies shown sdd effectively improve acne rosacea probably without inducing antibiotic doxycyclines dual benefits antibacterial antiinflammatory make helpful treatment option diseases involving inflammation skin rosacea acne also conditions
