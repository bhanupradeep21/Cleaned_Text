ornithomimus ˌɔːrnɪθəˈmaɪməs bird mimic genus ornithomimid theropod dinosaurs campanian maastrichtian ages late cretaceous western north america ornithomimus swift bipedal dinosaur fossil evidence indicates covered feathers equipped small toothless beak may indicate omnivorous diet usually classified two species type species ornithomimus velox referred species ornithomimus edmontonicus velox

renamed struthiomimus currellii parks struthiomimus ingens parks ornithomimus currellii ornithomimus ingens time usual workers referred entire ornithomimid material simply solve confusion scientifically testing separation ornithomimus struthiomimus dale russell published morphometric study showed statistical differences proportions could used distinguish two concluded struthiomimus ornithomimus valid genera latter russell recognised two species type species ornithomimus velox ornithomimus edmontonicus even though trouble reliably distinguishing velox considered struthiomimus currellii younger synonym ornithomimus edmontonicus however russell also interpreted data indicating many specimens could referred either ornithomimus struthiomimus therefore created two new genera first one archaeornithomimus ornithomimus asiaticus ornithomimus affinis reassigned new genus becoming archaeornithomimus asiaticus archaeornithomimus affinis second one dromiceiomimus meaning emu mimic comes old generic name emu dromiceius russell assigned several former ornithomimus species named century including brevitertius ingens new genus dromiceiomimus brevitertius also renamed

vertebra originally named coelosaurus anonymous author known richard owen baird referred several specimens new jersey maryland antiquus beginning robert sullivan regarded velox edmontonicus junior synonyms antiquus like russell considered former two species indistinguishable noted shared distinctive features however david weishampel considered c antiquus indeterminate among ornithomimosaurs

ornithomimus sinking dromiceiomimus synonym however include type species velox analysis team supported synonymy dromiceiomimus edmontonicus lecture society vertebrate paleontology annual opinion followed later makovickys team also considered dromiceiomimus samueli junior synonym edmontonicus though longrich later suggested may belong distinct unnamed species dinosaur park formation yet
