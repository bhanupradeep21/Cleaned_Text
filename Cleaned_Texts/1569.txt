efraasia pronounced efrahseea genus basal sauropodomorph dinosaur herbivore lived middle norian stage late triassic around million years ago germany named eberhard fraas early twentieth century collected original type specimens specimens first assigned three already existing genera became divided among three separate species teratosaurus minor sellosaurus fraasi paleosaurus diagnosticus combined single valid species efraasia minor efraasia lightly built mediumsized sauropodomorph metres ft long efraasia complicated taxonomic history involving several genera species material known

eberhard fraas reported two partial skeletons smns smns collected assigned new species thecodontosaurus would never describe due failing health thus name remained nomen nudum von huene adopted specific name years later fraas death redescribing fraas specimens paleosaurus diagnosticus question mark indicates von huene considered reference provisional oskar kuhn pointed name paleosaurus riley stutchbury preoccupied renamed genus allen charig first use combination palaeosauriscus diagnosticus german however new generic name junior homonym palaeosauriscus fraserianus cope peter galton reassigned fraas specimens new genus efraasia palaeosaurus apart homonymy problems nondiagnostic tooth genus generic name contraction e fraas new species name combination thus became efraasia however galton robert bakker later recommended efraasia considered junior synonym another prosauropod sellosaurus adam yates published study incorporating fossils late triassic found sellosaurus material fell two clusters one included original sellosaurus gracilis assigned plateosaurus p gracilis included teratosaurus minor sellosaurus fraasi palaeosaurus diagnosticus efraasia oldest valid generic name fossils specific name could determined simply teratosaurus minor sellosaurus fraasi first appeared von huenes book former name page priority yates chose minor specific name providing type species teratosaurus minor new combination efraasia minor thus single valid species name yates take account two species based von huene fragmentary german basal sauropodomorph material teratosaurus trossingensis thecodontosaurus hermannianus though galton considered junior synonyms efraasia diagnostica apart specimens mentioned mostly consisting rather complete skeletons preserved large slabs though fully prepared rock matrix several fossils found together allow good impression animal looked like efraasia thought relatively small dinosaur metres ft long complete known fossils juvenile

interpreting forms predatory dinosaurs assigning separate family palaeosauridae part carnosauria charig established planteating galton assigned efraasia anchisauridae used name paraphyletic group
