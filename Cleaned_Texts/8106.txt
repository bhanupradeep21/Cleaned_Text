adult stem cells undifferentiated cells found throughout body development multiply cell division replenish dying cells regenerate damaged tissues also known somatic stem cells greek σωματικóς meaning body found juvenile adult animals humans unlike embryonic stem cells scientific interest adult stem cells centered around two main characteristics first ability divide selfrenew indefinitely second ability generate cell types organ originate potentially regenerating entire organ unlike embryonic stem cells use human adult stem cells research therapy considered controversial derived adult tissue samples rather human embryos designated scientific research main functions adult stem cells replace cells risk possibly dying result disease injury maintain state homeostasis within three main methods determine adult stem cell capable becoming specialized adult stem cell labeled vivo tracked isolated transplanted back organism isolated vivo manipulated growth mainly studied humans model organisms mice rats stem cell possesses two properties ensure selfrenewal stem cells undergo two types cell division see stem cell division differentiation diagram symmetric division gives rise two identical daughter stem cells whereas asymmetric division produces one stem cell one progenitor cell limited selfrenewal potential progenitors go several rounds cell division finally differentiating mature cell believed molecular distinction symmetric asymmetric divisions lies differential segregation cell membrane proteins receptors associated proteins daughter normal conditions tissue stem cells divide slowly infrequently exhibit signs quiescence reversible growth niche stem cell found plays large role maintaining perturbed niches cause stem cell begin actively dividing replace lost damaged cells
