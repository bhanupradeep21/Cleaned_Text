dyslexia attention deficit hyperactivity disorder oral written language learning disability owl ld impact type dysgraphia person tourette syndrome asd dyspraxia also common diagnoses among dysgraphic developmental dysgraphia originally described disorder occurs solely dyslexic individuals dysgraphia studied separate entity century researchers discovered different types occur without dyslexics dysgraphics experience similar synchronization difficulties issues spelling however dyslexia seem impair physical writing ability dramatically impact fine motor skills dysgraphia impact reading methods evaluating managing remedying dysgraphia still three principal subtypes dysgraphia recognized little information available different types dysgraphia likely subtypes ones listed people may

neurodevelopmental disorders extensively studied gold standard diagnosing dysgraphia likely due writing systems often differing substantially countries languages considerable heterogeneity among therapists charged diagnosing dysgraphia consequently several tests used diagnose dysgraphia like ajuriaguerra scale bhk children teenagers minnesota handwriting assessment etch script dash hhe devices like drawing tablets possible measure position tilt pressure real time features possible compute automatic features like speed shaking train classifier diagnose automatically children atypical features extracted different importances classification development allow characterize different subtypes dysgraphia could different origins outcomes could require different remediation uncommon dysgraphic individuals intellectually gifted possess rich vocabulary strong comprehension language speaking reading though disorder often detected treated may also part developmental dyslexia receiving far academic medical attention developmental addition gifted children transcription disabilities seldom receive programming intellectual talents due difficulties completing written treatment dysgraphia varies may include treatment motor disorders help control writing movements helping dysgraphic students overcome writing avoidance accept purpose necessity writing may use occupational therapy effective school setting teachers well informed dysgraphia aid carryover occupational therapists interventions one common form therapy use theraputty helps develop dexterity treatments may address impaired memory neurological problems physicians recommend individuals dysgraphia use computers avoid problems handwriting speechtotext programs also suggested potential treatments dysgraphia speechrecognition technologies used two ways dictation computer control dictation tool spoken words translated written text student speaks words microphone words typed computercontrol tool allows students control computer software applications speaking commands students going use speechrecognition software need use consistent clear speech use computers also allows patients experiment different ergonomic keyboards today many alternative keyboards consideration keyboards enlarged andor alphabetically arranged letters key boards ergonomically designed mini keyboards students limited range motion dysgraphia sometimes partially overcome appropriate conscious effort international dyslexia association suggests use kinesthetic memory early training child overlearn write letters later practice writing eyes closed averted reinforce feel letters written also suggest teaching students cursive writing fewer reversible letters help lessen spacing problems least within words cursive letters generally attached within wordcitation needed many students see great success cursive extensive therapy estimated children world affected disabilities like dysgraphia dyslexia dyscalculia estimates true prevalence dysgraphia available due lack research disorder special education category students united states national center learning disabilities suggests children dysgraphia handled casebycase manner individualized education program provided individual accommodation provide alternative ways submitting work modify tasks avoid area weakness often difficult students general accommodations student might dysgraphia careful planning precede technology purchases many technologies costly school budgets limited considering adoption technology recommendedunited students dysgraphia often complete written assignments legible appropriate length content within given suggested students dysgraphia receive specialized instructions appropriate children mostly benefit explicit comprehensive instructions help translating across multiple levels language review revision assignments writing direct explicit instruction letter formation guided practice help students achieve automatic handwriting performance use letters write words phrases older children may benefit use personal computer laptop class deal frustration falling behind predictive text technology suggested something could greatly help students dysgraphia also suggested berninger teachers dysgraphic students decide focus manuscript writing printing keyboarding either case beneficial students taught read cursive writing used daily classrooms may also beneficial teacher come methods assessing childs knowledge written tests example would oral testing causes less frustration child able get
