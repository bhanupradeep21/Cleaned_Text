even engulfed sea slug digestive cells ingested chloroplasts still functional work showed chloroplasts continued photosynthesize extended periods time following engulfment functioned captive

california santa barbara trench guided first detailed research examining differences photo physiological capacities different symbiont species work contributed characterization photosynthetic apparatus dinoflagellates found different species possessed distinct photo physiological adaptations trench lab also showed symbionts sensitive temperature stress crisis currently facing known coral bleaching additionally trench established functional biological ecological significance symbiont diversity reefbuilding corals trench worked graduate student roberto igelsiasprieto develop concept
