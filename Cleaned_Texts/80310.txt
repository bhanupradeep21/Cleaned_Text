including overall shape cranium tooth shape times anatomy postcrania included various degrees specialisation within longirostrines terrestrial ecomorphotypes pelagic species macrophages johnson colleagues conducted large scale principal component analysis focusing teeth lower jaw teleosaurs rather cranium postcrania study revealed several key adaptations indosinosuchus show teleosaurs least partially evolved convergently machimosaurids possessing relatively robust jaws strong muscle attachments ratio length mandibular ramus mandibular symphysis related animals ability resist biomechanic forces stress somewhat intermediate among members teleosauroidea however length region lower jaw musculature attaches well developed length compared mandibular ramus indicates indosinosuchus potamosiamensis rather strong bite easily comparable derived machimosaurids anterior mechanical advantage ama describes amount force reaches tip jaws high indosinosuchus species among highest teleosauroidea alongside many large machimosaurines particular importance teleosaurs due fanglike front teeth addition posterior mechanical advantage pma potamosiamensis describes overal maximum force along toothrow single highest among teleosaurs another important biomechanic aspect opening mechanical advantage oma indicates fast jaws could opened closed value generally inverse overall bite force smaller taxa capable biting efficiently greater speed order catch prey higher value meanwhile indicates animal couldnt close jaws rapidly instead relied strength deal prey two species indosinosuchus diverge potamosiamensis expectedly high opening mechanical advantage highest among teleosaurs kalasinensis relatively low oma giving much faster bite contemporary relative unusual due fact two species generally similar aspects biomechanics could explain two could live environment time different values allowed occupy different ecological although precise ecology remains generally unresolved johnson colleagues conclude indosinosuchus likely mesorostrine generalist species showing particular adaptations going large armored prey like derived teleosaurs generally considered marine animals vast
