history polio poliomyelitis infections began prehistory although major polio epidemics unknown disease caused paralysis death much human history millennia polio survived quietly endemic pathogen major epidemics began occur soon widespread epidemics appeared rest world frequent epidemics became regular events throughout developed world primarily cities summer months peak polio would paralyze kill half million people worldwide every needed fear collective response epidemics would give rise extraordinary public reaction mobilization spurring development new methods prevent treat disease revolutionizing medical philanthropy although development two polio vaccines eliminated wild poliomyelitis two countries afghanistan legacy poliomyelitis remains development modern rehabilitation
