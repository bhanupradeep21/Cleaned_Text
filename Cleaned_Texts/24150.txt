diagnosis facial angioma symptoms include glaucoma cerebral blood flow abnormalities headaches research needed type syndrome type leptomeningeal angioma involvement exclusively facial angioma absent glaucoma rarely occurs type diagnosed via brain embryonal developmental anomaly resulting errors mesodermal ectodermal development unlike neurocutaneous disorders phakomatoses occurs sporadically ie hereditary cause caused mosaic somatic activating mutation occurring gnaq imaging findings may include tram track calcifications ct pial angiomatosis hemicerebral syndrome usually manifested birth
