darwins origin species mentors sarukhán harper dirzo decided focus graduate work animals influence plant ecology evolution specifically evolution antiherbivore defenses masters thesis dissertation examined white clover trifolium repens may developed increased cyanogenic properties adaptation herbivory throughout career dirzo held many professional appointments serving professor director chairperson coordinator multiple institutions became professor instituto de biología los tuxtlas biological station veracruz mexico later appointed director los tuxtlas began researching patterns herbivory time los tuxtlas dirzo returned unam professor instituto de ecología taught years dirzo currently teaches ecology natural history conservation science biology department stanford university instructor since stanford also served director center latin american studies codirector inogo program woods institute environment finishing graduate programs dirzo went back mexico hoped determine concepts examined graduate work could explain plantanimal interactions tropical director los tuxtlas biological station began analyzing amounts herbivory region found evidence mammalian herbivory led believe mammalian herbivores relatively unimportant tropical dirzo received marine fellowship pew fellows program conservation environment used develop research laboratory chajul field station montes azules biosphere reserve used reserve research station continue work herbivory patterns found montes azules human encroachment impacting area los tuxtlas blatant signs mammalian research areas led understand contrary hypothesis mammals important tropical ecosystems los tuxtlas experiencing defaunation loss fauna likely due anthropogenic dirzo pioneered study impacts humans defaunation illuminated importance ecosystem services provided mammalian herbivores lower trophic levels ie plants tropical ecosystem recent years dirzo carried research parts world researching defaunation impacting regions well african savanna dirzo studied defaunation leads increase population rodents due loss medium large vertebrates either directly prey rodents consume rodent habitat ie since rodents known disease reservoirs one major consequence increase disease transmission especially since defaunation usually occurs highly populated areas however also finds effects defaunation vary based secondary land use currently dirzo conducting review analysis assess consistency differential defaunation across globe additionally working mexicos national commission biodiversity conabio countrywide evaluation biodiversity across mexican ecosystems also looking defaunation may increasing animaltohuman disease transmission aka zoonosis besides teaching conducting research dirzo also works educate young people local communities science environment san francisco bay area involved projects target minorities underprivileged groups redwood academy leadership real science technology
