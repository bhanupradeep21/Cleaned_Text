carotenoid complexes physical associations carotenoids molecules carotenoids hydrophobic molecules usually coupled lipids form complexes carotenoids help living species adapt environmental stresses particular temperature variations making complexes role supporting photosynthesis also well since plants microorganisms algae fungi bacteria exposure much higher daynight seasonal environmental temperature variability animals surprising level carotenoids tissues higher ectothermic animals mechanism control body temperature rely accumulation ingested carotenoids endotherms maintain thermal homeostasis surprising tissues fish reptiles carotenoid concentration could fold higher different lipids different crystalline structures determine viscosity heat thermal conductivity turn affects
