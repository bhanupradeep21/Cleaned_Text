halobacterium common abbreviation hbt genus family genus halobacterium salt ocean bacterium consists several species archaea aerobic metabolism requires environment high concentration salt many proteins function lowsalt environments grow amino acids aerobic conditions cell walls also quite different bacteria ordinary lipoprotein membranes fail high salt concentrations shape may either rods cocci color either red purple reproduce using binary fission constriction motile halobacterium grows best environment genome unspecified halobacterium species sequenced shiladitya dassarma comprises
