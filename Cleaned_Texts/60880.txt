knee examination medicine physiotherapy performed part physical examination patient presents knee pain history suggests pathology knee joint exam includes several parts latter three steps often remembered saying look feel move performing physical examination knee joint comprehensive history asked thorough history helpful locating possible pathological site physical examination mechanism injury location character knee pain presence pop sound time injury indicates ligamentous tear fracture swelling infections ability stand walk sensation instability suggestive subluxation previous traumatic injuries joint important historical features common knee problems soft tissue inflammation injury osteoarthritis mechanism knee injury give clue possible structures injured example applying valgus stress knee cause medial collateral ligament rupture meanwhile varus force cause lateral collateral ligament rupture person suddenly slows running twisting pivoting valgus force applying knee anterior cruciate ligament rupture posterior dislocation tibia cause posterior cruciate ligament injury twisting pivoting bearing weight cause tearing meniscus fractures knee less common considered direct trauma knee occurred fall examples fractures involving knee joints tibial plateau fractures fractures lateral condyle femur medial condyle femur patellar nontraumatic causes knee pain history fever morning stiffness pain exercise infections history gout psoriasis previous activities contributes longterm overuse knee joint asked knee pain due longterm overuse reproducible example repetitive jumping cause inflammation patellar tendon repetitive kneeling cause prepatellar inflammation synovial physical examination knee begins observing persons gait assess abnormalities seen walking gait assessment used differentiate genuine knee pain pain referred hip lower back foot person asked perform duckwalk requires person squat walk position order perform duckwalk person free ligamentous tear knee effusions meniscal tears person also asked stand feet stuck together position useful observe valgus varus deformity knees suggestive osteoarthritis circumference thigh measured look wasting quadriceps muscles skin around knee also observed psoriasis hematoma rash abrasions lacerations cellulitis could important causes knee palpation knee begin unaffected side first reassure patient useful comparison affected knee back hand used assess warmth knee knee flexed degrees anterior structures assessed inflammation patellar tendon present patellar tendon painful upon palpation radiographic imaging done examination findings fulfills ottawa rules age years older pain head fibula patellar pain unable flex knee degrees inability stand walk least four steps anterior cruciate ligament injury suspected radiographic imaging also ordered frequently associated lateral tibial plateau fracture painful reddish warm swelling front patella acute prepatellar bursitis considered may require aspiration drainage presented features usually history frequent kneeling direct trauma pain swelling defect insertion quadriceps tendon superior part patella suggestive quadriceps tendon rupture pop sound may associated injury followed loss ability straighten knee knee extension pain medial joint line medial inferior border patella indicates medial compartment osteoarthritis injury medial collateral ligament medial meniscal tear pain midpoint anterior part medial joint line tibial tuberosity suggestive pes anserine bursitis inflammation anserine bursa lateral joint line tenderness associated lateral compartment osteoarthritis lateral collateral ligament injury lateral meniscal tear pain lateral femoral condyle suggestive iliotibial band syndrome swelling popliteal fossa may reveal bakers absence normal grooves around patella may indicates patellar intraarticular effusion two ways confirm effusion knee extended fully examination begins first way patellar tap squeeze fluid patella femur pressing medial patella using nondominant hand using dominant hand press patella vertically patella ballotable patellar intraarticular effusion present another way milking patella first effusion milked medial border patella inferior superior aspect using another hand effusion milked lateral border patella superior inferior aspect effusion present bulge appear medial border patella effusion milked back medial active passive range motion assessed normal knee extension degrees normal knee flexion degrees pain abnormal movement crepitus patella noted pain crepitus active extension knee patella compressed patellofemoral groove patellofemoral pain syndrome chondromalacia patellae suspected pain active range motion pain passive range motion suggestive inflammation tendon pain active passive range motion suggestive pathology knee valgus stress test performed examined knee degrees flexion determine integrity medial collateral ligament similarly varus stress test performed access integrity lateral collateral ligament degree collateral ligament sprain also assessed valgus varus tests first degree tear ligament less mm laxity definite resistance knee pulled second degree sprain laxity knee tested degrees flexion laxity extension definite resistance knee pulled third degree tear mm laxity definite resistance either knee full extension anterior drawer lachman tests used access integrity anterior cruciate ligament anterior drawer test person examined lie back supine position knee degrees flexion foot secured bed examiner sitting foot tibia pulled forward using hands anterior movement affected knee greater unaffected knee anterior drawer test positive lachman test sensitive anterior drawer test lachman test person lies supine position knee flexed degrees heel touching bed tibia pulled forward millimeters laxity definitive resistance knee pulled test positive thus raising concern torn anterior cruciate ligament large collection blood knee associated bony fractures cruciate ligament posterior drawer test tibial sag tests determine integrity posterior cruciate ligament similar anterior drawer test knee flexed degrees tibia pushed backwards tibia pushed posteriorly posterior drawer test positive tibial sag test knees flexed degrees person supine position bilateral feet touching bed bilateral knees watch posterior displacement tibia affected tibia slowly displaced posteriorly posterior cruciate ligament meniscal injuries may report symptoms clicking catching locking knees apart joint line tenderness three methods accessing meniscus tear mcmurray test thessaly test apley grind test mcmurray test person lie supine position knee degrees flexion examiner put one hand thumb index finger medial lateral joint lines respectively another hand used control heel test medial meniscus hand heel applies valgus force external rotates leg extending knee test lateral meniscus varus force internal rotation applied leg extending knee clicking popping catching respective joint line indicates corresponding meniscal apley compression test person lie prone position knee flexed degrees one hand used stabilise hip another hand grasp foot apply downward compression force external internal rotates leg pain compression indicates meniscal tear examination anterior cruciate ligament tear done meniscal tear two conditions often occurs httpsenwikipediaorgwikikneeexamination
