colpocephaly cephalic disorder involving disproportionate enlargement occipital horns lateral ventricles usually diagnosed early birth due seizures nonspecific finding associated multiple neurological syndromes including agenesis corpus callosum chiari malformation lissencephaly although exact cause colpocephaly known yet commonly believed occur result neuronal migration disorders early brain development intrauterine disturbances perinatal injuries central nervous system individuals colpocephaly various degrees motor disabilities visual defects spasticity moderate severe intellectual specific treatment colpocephaly exists patients may undergo certain treatments improve motor function intellectual disability various symptoms colpocephaly patients experience effects ranging mild severe patients show symptoms related colpocephaly psychomotor abnormalities agenesis corpus callosum cases signs appear later life significant number children develop minor disabilities following list includes common symptoms intracranial abnormalities include known definitive single mechanism causes colpocephaly however researchers believe many possible causes colpocephaly common symptom neurological disorders newborns caused result shunt treatment hydrocephalus developmental disorders premature infants due intrauterine disturbances pregnancy genetic disorders underdevelopment lack white matter cerebrum exposure mother developing fetus medications infections radiation toxic also usually common premature infants fullterm infants especially babies born hypoxia lung immaturity central nervous system disorders associated colpocephaly often colpocephaly occurs result hydrocephalus hydrocephalus accumulation cerebrospinal fluid csf ventricles subarachnoid space brain increased pressure due condition dilates occipital horns causing colpocephaly generally accepted theory neuronal migration disorders occurring second fifth months fetal life neuronal migration disorders caused abnormal migration proliferation organization neurons early brain development seventh week gestation neurons start proliferating germinal matrix located subependymal layer walls lateral ventricles eighth week gestation neurons start migrating germinal zone cortex along specialized radial glial fibers next neurons organize layers form synaptic contacts neurons present cortex normal conditions neurons forming germinal layer around ventricles migrate surface brain form cerebral cortex basal ganglia process abnormal disturbed could result enlargement occipital horns lateral ventricles common prenatal disturbances shown disturb neuronal migration process include researchers also believe factors cause destruction neural elements previously normally suggested underdevelopment lack white matter developing fetus could cause colpocephaly partial complete absence white matter also known agenesis corpus callosum results anatomic malformations lead colpocephaly starts occur around middle second month fifth month pregnancy lateral ventricles formed large cavities telencephalic vesicle size ventricles decreased normal development formation foramen magendie decompresses ventricular cavities myelination ventricular walls association fibers corpus callosum calcarine fissure helps shape occipital horns cases developmental process interrupted occipital horns disproportionately colpocephaly associated chromosomal abnormalities trisomy mosaic trisomy reports genetically transmitted colpocephaly also found literature two siblings monozygotic twins nonidentical twins authors suggest genetic origin autosomal xlinked recessive inheritance rather resulting early prenatal colpocephaly characterized disproportionately large occipital horns lateral ventricles also frontal temporal ventricles cases mri ct scans patients demonstrate abnormally thick gray matter thin poorly myelinated white matter happens result partial complete absence corpus callosum corpus callosum band white matter connecting two cerebral hemispheres corpus callosum plays extremely important role interhemispheric communication thus lack absence neural fibers results number lemon sign ct scans patients refers shape fetal skull frontal bones lose normal convex contour appear flattened inwardly scalloped gives skull shape similar lemon sign seen transverse sonograms fetal cranium obtained level ventricles special case found literature lissencephaly colpocephaly septal agenesis present together ct scans patient shows ventricular system unique appearance crown king referred crown diagnosing colpocephaly prenatally difficult many cases signs start appear birth prenatal diagnosis made detecting enlargement either occipital horns lateral ventricles usually prenatal ultrasounds dont show cephalic abnormalities cases show abnormality low accuracy making difficult diagnose colpocephaly often abnormalities prenatal ultrasounds misdiagnosed birth mr imaging done look cephalic abnormalities commonly used method diagnosing colpocephaly physicians look abnormally large occipital horns lateral ventricles diminished thickness white spinal tapping preferred method diagnosis newborn babies colpocephaly hydrocephaly open fontanelles makes difficult collect csf also colpocephaly associated increased colpocephaly usually nonfatal relatively little research conducted improve treatments colpocephaly known definitive treatment colpocephaly yet specific treatment depends associated symptoms degree dysfunction anticonvulsant medications given prevent seizure complications physical therapy used prevent contractures shrinkage shortening muscles patients limited mobility patients also undergo surgeries stiff joints improve motor function prognosis individuals colpocephaly depends severity associated conditions degree abnormal brain rare case colpocephaly described literature associated macrocephaly instead microcephaly increased intracranial pressure also found condition similar symptoms absence corpus callosum increased head circumference noted case colpocephaly associated microcephaly biventricular peritoneal shunt performed greatly improved symptoms condition ventriculoperitoneal shunts used drain fluid peritoneal brain abnormalities first described benda vesiculocephaly yakovlev wadsworth coined term colpocephaly greek word kolpos hollow kephalos headcitation needed suggested enlargement ventricles occurred result white matter development arrest early fetal stated apparent dilatation occipital hornsit represented failure development cerebral wall persistence embryonal vesicular character brain yakovlev meant term apply result disturbances development brain suggested term hydrocephalus ex vauco used enlargement occipital horns lateral ventricles result damage brain normally formed however today term colpocephaly used describe stem cell therapy considered promising treatment patients colpocephaly oligodendroglial cells used increase production myelin alleviate symptoms colpocephaly damage developing oligodendrocytes near cerebral ventricles causes cerebral palsy well demyelinating diseases multiple sclerosis leukodystrophies demyelination reduces speed conduction affected nerves resulting disabilities cognition sensation motor therefore using oligodendrocyte stem cells effects cerebral palsy treated
