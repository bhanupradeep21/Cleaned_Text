observational learning learning occurs observing behavior others form social learning takes various forms based various processes humans form learning seems need reinforcement occur instead requires social model parent sibling friend teacher surroundings particularly childhood model someone authority higher status environment animals observational learning often based classical conditioning instinctive behavior elicited observing behavior another eg mobbing birds processes may involved many behaviors learner observes remembers imitates actions models display display modeling even though model may intentionally try instill particular behavior child may learn swear smack smoke deem inappropriate behavior acceptable poor modeling albert bandura claims children continually learn desirable undesirable behavior observational learning observational learning suggests individuals environment cognition behavior incorporate ultimately determine individual functions observational learning individual behaviors spread across culture process called diffusion chain basically occurs individual first learns behavior observing another individual individual serves model individuals learn behavior culture plays role whether observational learning dominant learning style person community cultures expect children actively participate communities therefore exposed different trades roles daily exposure allows children observe learn different skills practices valued albert bandura known classic bobo doll experiment identified basic form learning importance observational learning lies helping individuals especially children acquire new responses observing others behavior albert bandura states peoples behavior could determined environment observational learning occurs observing negative positive behaviors bandura believes reciprocal determinism environment influence peoples behavior vice versa instance bobo doll experiment shows model determined environment affects childrens behavior experiment bandura demonstrates one group children placed aggressive environment would act way control group group children placed passive role model environment hardly shows type communities childrens primary mode learning observation children rarely separated adult activities incorporation adult world early age allows children use observational learning skills multiple spheres life learning observation requires keen attentive abilities culturally learn participation contributions valued communities teaches children duty members community observe others contributions gradually become involved participate stages observational learning include exposure model acquiring models behaviour accepting ones banduras social cognitive learning theory states four factors influence observational bandura clearly distinguishes learning performance unless motivated person produce learned behavior motivation come external reinforcement experimenters promise reward banduras studies bribe parent come vicarious reinforcement based observation models rewarded highstatus models affect performance motivation example girls aged performed better motor performance task thought demonstrated highstatus cheerleader lowstatus even added step attention retention involving encoding behavior observational learning leads change individuals behavior along three dimensions according banduras social cognitive learning theory observational learning affect behavior many ways positive negative consequences teach completely new behaviors one also increase decrease frequency behaviors previously learned observational learning even encourage behaviors previously forbidden example violent behavior towards bobo doll children imitated albert banduras study observational learning also influence behaviors similar identical ones modeled example seeing model excel playing piano may motivate observer play saxophone albert bandura stressed developing children learn different social models meaning two children exposed exactly modeling influence infancy adolescence exposed various social models study found toddlers previous social familiarity model always necessary learning also able learn observing stranger demonstrating modeling new action another believed babies could imitate actions latter half first year however number studies report infants young seven days imitate simple facial expressions latter half first year babies imitate actions hours first see continue develop toddlers around age two acquire important personal social skills imitating social model deferred imitation important developmental milestone twoyearold children construct symbolic representations also remember unlike toddlers children elementary school age less likely rely imagination represent experience instead verbally describe models since form learning need reinforcement likely occur regularly age increases agerelated observational learning motor skills may decrease athletes younger skilled golfers higher observational learning compared older golfers less skilled golfers humans use observational moleen causal learning watch peoples actions use information gained find something works study infants found learn causal relations observing human interventions also learn observing normal actions created intentional human observational learning presumed occurred organism copies improbable action action outcome observed matching behavior explained alternative mechanism psychologists particularly interested form observational learning known imitation distinguish imitation processes successfully make distinction one must separate degree behavioral similarity results predisposed behavior b increased motivation resulting presence another animal c attention drawn place object learning way environment works distinguished think e imitation copying demonstrated observational learning differs imitative learning require duplication behavior exhibited model example learner may observe unwanted behavior subsequent consequences thus learn refrain behavior example riopelle found monkeys better observational learning saw tutor monkey make mistake making right heyes distinguished imitation nonimitative social learning following way imitation occurs animals learn behavior observing conspecifics whereas nonimitative social learning occurs animals learn environment observing imitation learning observing often differ degree take active passive form john dewey describes important distinction two different forms imitation imitation end imitation imitation end akin mimicry person copies anothers act repeat action kind imitation often observed animals imitation purpose utilizes imitative act means accomplish something significant whereas passive form imitation end documented european american communities kind active purposeful imitation documented communities around world observation may take active form childrens learning multiple indigenous american communities ethnographic anthropological studies yucatec mayan quechua peruvian communities provide evidence home communitycentered economic systems cultures allow children witness firsthand activities meaningful livelihoods overall wellbeing children opportunity observe activities relevant within context community gives reason sharpen attention practical knowledge exposed mean observe activities even though present children often make active decision stay attendance community activity taking place observe decision underscores significance learning style many indigenous american communities goes far beyond learning mundane tasks rote imitation central childrens gradual transformation informed members communities unique practices also study done children concluded imitated behavior recalled used another situation apprenticeship involve observational learning modelling apprentices gain skills part working masters profession observing evaluating work fellow apprentices examples include renaissance inventorpainter leonardo da vinci michelangelo succeeding profession michael tomasello described various ways observational learning without process imitation ethology observational learning beneficial positive reinforcing peer models involved although individuals go four different stages observational learning attention retention production motivation simply mean individuals attention captured automatically sets process exact order one important ongoing stages observational learning especially among children motivation positive performance enhanced children positively instructed improve situation children actively participate alongside skilled person examples scaffolding guided participation scaffolding refers expert responding contingently novice novice gradually increases understanding problem guided participation refers expert actively engaging situation novice novice participates observes adult understand resolve cultural variation seen extent information learned absorbed children nonwestern cultures learning observation cultural variation restricted ethnicity nationality rather extends specific practices within communities learning observation children use observation learn without verbal requests information without direct instruction example children mexican heritage families tend learn make better use information observed classroom demonstration children european children european heritage experience type learning separates family community activities instead participate lessons exercises special settings cultural backgrounds differ children display certain characteristics regards learning activity another example seen immersion children indigenous communities americas adult world effects observational learning

observation passive reflects childs intent participate learn within observational learning seen taking place many domains indigenous communities classroom setting one significant example functions differently indigenous communities compared commonly present western schooling emphasis keen observation favor supporting participation ongoing activities strives aid children learn important tools ways engaging shared endeavors experienced inexperienced allows experienced understand inexperienced need order grow regards assessment observational involvement inexperienced children matter either furthered childrens learning advancing activity performed assessment observational indigenous communities rely observational learning way children part ongoing activities community tharp although learning indigenous american communities always central focus participating studies shown attention intentional observation differs accidental observation intentional participation keen observation listening anticipation process engaging endeavors means intention participating event attention focused details compared accidentally observing observational learning active process many indigenous american communities learner must take initiative attend activities going around children communities also take initiative contribute knowledge ways benefit community example many indigenous american cultures children perform household chores without instructed adults instead observe need contributions understand role community take initiative accomplish tasks observed others learners intrinsic motivations play important role childs understanding construction meaning educational experiences independence responsibility associated observational learning many indigenous american communities significant reasons method learning involves watching imitating learner must actively engaged demonstrations experiences order fully comprehend apply knowledge children indigenous heritage communities americas often learn observation strategy carry adulthood heightened value towards observation allows children multitask actively engage simultaneous activities exposure uncensored adult lifestyle allows children observe learn skills practices valued children observe elders parents siblings complete tasks learn participate seen contributors learn observe multiple tasks completed learn complete task still engaging community members without distracted indigenous communities provide opportunities incorporate children everyday seen mayan communities children given full access community events allows observational learning occur children mazahua mexico known observe ongoing activities intensely native northern canadian indigenous mayan communities children often learn thirdparty observers stories conversations young mayan children carried mothers back allowing observe mothers work see world mother sees often children indigenous american communities assume majority responsibility learning additionally children find approaches children often allowed learn without restrictions minimal guidance encouraged participate community even know work selfmotivated learn finish children
