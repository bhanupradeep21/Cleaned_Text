traumatic aortic rupture also called traumatic aortic disruption transection condition aorta largest artery body torn ruptured result trauma body condition frequently fatal due profuse bleeding results rupture since aorta branches directly heart supply blood rest body pressure within great blood may pumped tear blood vessel rapidly quickly result shock death thus traumatic aortic rupture common killer automotive accidents deaths occur automobile collisions related fact aortic disruption due blunt chest trauma second leading cause injury death behind traumatic brain aortic rupture also caused nontraumatic mechanisms particularly abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture symptoms often unreliable include severe tearing chest pain cough dyspnea shortness breath dysphagia difficulty swallowing back pain hoarseness blood pressure usually high upper body low lower body widened mediastinum massive left hemothorax often found xray bruising anterior chest wall systolic murmur heard bottom injury usually caused high speed impacts occur vehicle collisions serious may due different rates deceleration heart aorta fixed far common site tearing traumatic aortic rupture proximal descending aorta near left subclavian artery branches tethering aorta ligamentum arteriosum makes site prone shearing forces sudden study people died traumatic aortic rupture found cases damage aortic isthmus ascending aorta aortic angiogram often show irregular outpouching beyond takeoff left subclavian artery aortic isthmus representing aortic pseudoaneurysm caused trauma damage also lower thoracic abdominal aorta always torn completely may also tear layers arterial wall sometimes forming false subintimal hemorrhage least serious mildest form often weaken wall aorta may heal usually occurs descending aorta originally defined small intimal flap less one centimeter length little haematoma aortic condition difficult detect may go unnoticed many patients specific symptoms diagnosis complicated fact many patients injury experienced multiple serious injuries attention hospital staff may distracted possibility aortic rupture fact cases occur along common symptom unusually high blood pressure upper body low blood pressure lower limbs another sign kidney failure creatinine level shoots high urine output becomes negligible cases however doctors would misinterpret kidney failure due issues kidney may recommend dialysiscitation needed though completely reliable chest xrays firstline initially used diagnose condition patient unstable sent ct bay preferred method diagnosis used ct angiogram found cause complications people reserved ct scans classical findings chest xray widened apical cap displacement trachea left main bronchus nasogastric tube normal chest xray exclude transection diagnose conditions pneumothorax hydrothorax aorta may also torn point connected heart aorta may completely torn away heart patients injuries rarely survive long injury thus much common hospital staff treat patients partially torn aorta partially torn may form pseudoaneurysm patients live long enough seen hospital majority partially torn blood vessel outermost adventitial layer still patients adventitia nearby structures within chest may serve prevent severe trauma aorta assessed ct angiogram direct angiogram contrast introduced aorta via catheter traumatic aortic rupture treated surgery however morbidity mortality rates surgical repair aorta condition among highest cardiovascular example surgery associated high rate spinal cord sensitive ischemia lack blood supply nerve tissue damaged killed interruption blood supply surgerycitation needed less invasive option treatment endovascular repair require open thoracotomy safer people injuries since high blood pressure could exacerbate incomplete tear aorta even separate completely heart would almost inevitably kill patient hospital staff take measures keep blood pressure measures include giving pain medication keeping patient calm avoiding procedures could cause gagging beta blockers vasodilators given lower blood pressure intravenous fluids might normally given foregone avoid raising passaro reported first successful surgical repair torn aorta kirsh reported success rate surgery repair torn aorta based years experience surgeon therefore make hospital successfully diagnosed time quickly operated upon chances survival cases intimal tears may resolve therefore conservative treatment like antihypertensives usually initiated limited data treatment type aortic injury places endovascular repair also option death occurs immediately traumatic rupture thoracic aorta time since bleeding severe patients die arriving live reach hospital die time shortly us estimated cases occur yearly make hospital alive low numbers make difficult estimate efficacy surgical however surgery performed time offer chance though concern small stable tear aorta could enlarge cause complete rupture aorta heavy bleeding may less common previously believed long blood pressure get five rare cases traumatic aortic rupture going undiagnosed year presenting chest back pain pseudoaneurysms large aneurysms caused pain asymptomatic chronic traumatic aneurysms always risk sudden death unless large growing aneurysms symptomatic risk rupture treatment surgical httpsenwikipediaorgwikitraumaticaorticrupture
