previously research revolved around hypothesis language bilingual individuals symmetrically represented brain symmetrical representation cerebral hemispheres attributed differential localization languages thus one languages heavily represented right hemisphere partially represented different locus explanation nonparallel recovery patterns based studies communication deficits associated right hemisphere lesions safely assumed right hemisphere crucial processing pragmatics using languages bilinguals likely compensate gaps linguistic understandings weaker language increasing reliance pragmatics therefore highly expect involving use right hemisphere allow process thus supporting notion lateralization multiple two proposed theoretical views generally taken approach bilingual aphasia traditional localizationist view states loss one language occurs patients languages represented different brain areas different hemispheres thus one area damaged language represented would suffer others would second view dynamic view selective language recovery proposes language system representation control compromised result theory supported functional imaging data normal bilinguals holds
