loop diuretics diuretics act nakcl cotransporter along thick ascending limb loop henle nephrons primarily used medicine treat hypertension edema often due congestive heart failure chronic kidney disease thiazide diuretics effective patients normal kidney function loop diuretics effective patients impaired kidney loop diuretics bonded proteins secreted proximal convoluted tubule organic anion transporter loop diuretics act symporter thick ascending limb loop henle inhibit sodium chloride potassium reabsorption achieved competing binding site loop diuretics also inhibits macula densa reducing sodium transported macula densa cells stimulates release renin system increases fluid retention body increases perfusion glomerulus thus increasing glomerular filtration rate gfr time loop diuretics inhibits tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism increase salts lumen near macula densa trigger response reduces loop diuretics also inhibit magnesium calcium reabsorption thick ascending limb absorption magnesium calcium dependent upon positive voltage luminal side less positive voltage interstitial side transepithelial voltage gradient mv causes magnesium calcium ions repelled luminal side interstitial side promoting absorption difference voltage sides set potassium recycling renal outer medullary potassium channel inhibiting potassium recycling voltage gradient abolished magnesium calcium reabsorption disrupting reabsorption ions loop diuretics prevent generation hypertonic renal medulla without concentrated medulla water less osmotic driving force leave collecting duct system ultimately resulting increased urine production loop diuretics cause decrease renal blood flow mechanism diuresis leaves less water reabsorbed blood resulting decrease blood volume secondary effect
