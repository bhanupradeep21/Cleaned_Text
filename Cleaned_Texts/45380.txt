doudna born february washington dc daughter dorothy jane williams martin kirk father received phd english literature university michigan mother stayathome parent held masters degree doudna seven years old family moved hawaii father could accept teaching position american literature university hawaii doudnas mother earned second masters degree asian history university taught history local community growing hilo hawaii doudna fascinated environmental beauty island flora fauna nature built sense curiosity desire understand underlying biological mechanisms coupled atmosphere intellectual pursuit parents encouraged home father enjoyed reading science filled home many books popular doudna sixth grade gave copy james watsons book discovery structure dna double helix major doudna also developed interest science mathematics even though doudna told women dont go science knew wanted scientist matter nothing said made doubt doudna said someone tells cant something know makes resolved attended hilo high school doudnas interest science nurtured chemistry teacher ms jeanette wong routinely cited significant influence sparking nascent scientific visiting lecturer cancer cells encouraged

uncover structure biological function rna enzymes szostak lab doudna reengineered selfsplicing tetrahymena group catalytic intron true catalytic ribozyme copied rna focus engineering ribozymes understanding underlying mechanisms however came realize able see molecular mechanisms ribozymes major problem doudna went lab thomas cech university colorado boulder crystallize determine threedimensional structure ribozyme first time ribozyme structure could compared enzymes catalytic started project cech lab finished yale university doudna joined yales department molecular biophysics biochemistry assistant professor yale doudnas group able crystallize solve threedimensional structure catalytic core tetrahymena group showed core five magnesium ions clustered one region domain ribozyme forming hydrophobic core around rest structure could analogous chemically distinct way proteins typically core hydrophobic amino group crystallized including hepatitis delta virus initial
