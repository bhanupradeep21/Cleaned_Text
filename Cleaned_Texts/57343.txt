dame amanda gay fisher dbe frs british cell biologist director medical research council mrc london institute medical hammersmith hospital campus imperial college london also professor leading institute clinical made contributions multiple areas cell biology including determining function several genes hiv describing importance genes location within cell nucleus postdoctoral researcher produced first functional copies hiv providing researchers access enough biologically active material study function viruss genes later became interested epigenetics nuclear reprogramming particularly white blood cells known lymphocytes embryonic stem cells research focuses gene expression patterns inherited cells divide using lymphocytes model fisher educated university birmingham awarded phd research antigens expressed phd awarded lady tata memorial fellowship study gene regulation laboratory robert gallo national institutes health nih usacitation needed fishers used lymphocytes model analyse gene expression patterns transmitted cell division fisher also explored molecular basis lineage choice studies transcriptional epigenetic mechanisms underlie cellular differentiation experimental research activities also include pluripotency reprogramming polycomb repressor complexes stem cells cohesion function gene expression genome organisation ikaros family transcription factors tfs uses current technologies address events involved maintaining embryonic stem es cell pluripotency versus differentiation towards mesoderm endoderm ectoderm well mechanisms cell b cell lineage choice fishers discoveries hiv extensive critical future research viruss characteristics produced first functional copies hiv allowing scientists access biologically active material future research viruss determined roles several genes hiv findings significant studying understanding different characteristics hiv human tlymphotropic virus nih fisher developed approaches allowed successful introduction exogenous dna onto human blood cells two methods protoplast fusion electroporation proved successful allowed fisher test whether molecular clones isolated hivinfected cultures could generate infectious retrovirus upon transfectioncitation needed fisher showed molecular clones hiv contained within approximately contiguous proviral dna biologically active generated cytopathic virus introduced primary human tcellscitation needed established products viral genome rather cofactor contaminant capable killing human cells therefore potentially capable mediating immunosuppressive effect hiv provided basis dissecting molecular function viral genes developing dnabased diagnostic tests hiv infectioncitation needed following four years fisher showed transactivator gene tat essential virus replication truncation open reading frame orf disrupts virus cytopathogenicity sor called vif required efficient cell cell transmission hiv virus clinical collaboration walter reed national military medical center fisher showed patient antisera displayed typespecific neutralising properties multiple hiv isolates derived single patient biologically diverse contained replicationcompetent well replicationincompetent cytopathic variantscitation needed fisher moved us uk study human cell development established first human thymus organ cultures based studies pioneered owen jenkinson mousecitation needed refinement allowed cellfate mapped vitro provided system potential factors shape human cell repertoire could experimentally testedcitation needed spent years training mouse genetics transgenic knockout technologies institut de génétique et de biologie moléculaire et cellulaire igbmc strasbourg invited medical research council establish research team partner matthias merkenschlager clinical sciences centre csccitation needed fisher joined csc subsequently became director needed csc work focused understanding gene regulation cell commitment january csc renamed mrc london institute medical sciences mrc lmscitation needed fishers group published important dnabinding factor ikaros time presumed transcriptional activatorcitation needed fishers group showed ikaros proteins unexpectedly localised percentric heterochromatin cycling lymphocytes association transcriptionally silent genescitation needed provided first evidence gene located inside nucleus may relevant expression development three dimensional immunofish techniques fishers team protein structure nuclear architecture sample remains preserved critical revealing spatial distribution chromosomes genes within nucleuscitation needed last years analogous approaches widely used interrogate relationship gene function nuclear organisation example studies showed ikaros target genes b cells recruited pericentric heterochromatin domains gene silencing inherited daughter cellscitation needed study together others established nuclear location physical compaction local chromatin environment many genes important maintaining heritable silencing subsequent studies characterise differences transient heritablepermanent silencing revealed several silent genes assumed replicate late synthesis phase sphase cell cycle based fluorescence situ hybridisation fish detection doublet signals actually replicated much earlier based quantitative increases dna content discovery led fisher merkenschlager hypothesis rather altering time dna replication heritable gene silencing could retard chromatid separation resolution viewpoint began series studies subsequently shown involvement cohesin complexes gene regulation fisher awarded embo gold medal recognition early work hiv role nuclear organisation gene regulation since fisher studying gene regulation embryonic stem cells es model understanding pluripotency lineage commitment lineage restrictioncitation needed showed promoters many lineagespecifying genes es cells simultaneously enriched modified histones thought mark either active genes acetylation di trimethylation repressed domains trimethylation needed discovery ran contrary prevailing dogma time chromatin markers actively transcribed inactive domains mutually exclusivecitation needed study published contemporaneously similar reports several usbased groups suggesting important developmental regulator genes might poised transcription es cells yet repressed activity polycomb repressor complexes prcscitation needed fisher elected member european molecular biology organization embo awarded embo gold medal recognition work nuclear organisation gene expression well research molecular characterisation elected fellow royal society nomination reads amanda fisher distinguished pioneering work hiv pathogenesis lymphocyte development embryonic stem cells epigenetic gene regulation described first active clones hiv discovered functions several hiv genes including tat nef vif lymphocytes showed genes position within nucleus important maintaining heritable gene silencing embryonic stem cells showed important developmental regulator genes poised expression whilst repressed polycomb repressor elected fellow academy medical sciences fmedsci
