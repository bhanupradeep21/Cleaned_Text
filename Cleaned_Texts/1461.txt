nocturnin deadenylase thought involved degradation mrna polya tails suggesting plays role posttranscriptional stability regulation circadian gene expression beneficial metabolism ultimately survival green discovered nocturnin noc retinal photoreceptors xenopus laevis noc mrna displayed rhythmic expression isolated xenopus eye lightdark constant conditions isolated gene using high stringency differential display screen rhythmic genes xenopus retina green found noc homologues species mice high degree coding sequence similarity since expanding studies mice shown mouse nocturnin mrna also rhythmic expressed many circadian clockcontaining tissues interestingly greens group shown though noc directly involved regulating master clock gene expression required oscillator output functions thereby contributing circadian rhythmic expression nocturnin noc seen throughout body notably tissues crucial metabolism like liver intestine green douris others able show differing noc phenotypes
