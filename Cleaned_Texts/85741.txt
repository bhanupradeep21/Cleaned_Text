lower respiratory tract infection lrti term often used synonym pneumonia also applied types infection including lung abscess acute bronchitis symptoms include shortness breath weakness fever coughing routine chest xray always necessary people symptoms lower respiratory tract influenza affects upper lower respiratory tractscitation needed antibiotics first line treatment pneumonia however neither effective indicated parasitic viral infections acute bronchitis typically resolves timecitation needed million resulted million deaths million deaths deaths bronchitis describes swelling inflammation bronchial tubes additionally bronchitis described either acute chronic depending presentation also described causative agent acute bronchitis defined acute bacterial viral infection larger airways healthy patients history recurrent affects adults per year consists transient inflammation major bronchi often caused viral infection hence antibiotic therapy indicated immunocompetent viral bronchitis sometimes treated using antiviral medications depending virus causing infection medications antiinflammatory drugs expectorants help mitigate treatment acute bronchitis antibiotics common controversial use moderate benefit weighted potential side effects nausea vomiting increased resistance cost treatment selflimiting agonists sometimes used relieve cough associated acute bronchitis recent systematic review found evidence support acute exacerbations chronic bronchitis aecb frequently due noninfective causes along viral ones patients colonised haemophilus influenzae streptococcus

antibiotics vary adverse effects pneumonia also leading cause death children less five years age low income common cause pneumonia pneumococcal bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae accounts bacteremic invasive pneumococcal pneumonia mortality rate around optimal management pneumonia patient following must assessed pneumonia severity including treatment location eg home hospital intensive care

acute antibiotics help many lower respiratory infections caused parasites viruses acute bronchitis often require antibiotic therapy antibiotics given patients acute exacerbations chronic indications
