operant conditioning chamber also known skinner box laboratory apparatus used study animal behavior operant conditioning chamber created b f skinner graduate student harvard university chamber used study operant conditioning classical skinner created operant conditioning chamber variation puzzle box originally created edward skinners early studies done using rats later moved study operant conditioning chamber may used observe manipulate behaviour animal placed box must learn activate levers respond light sound stimuli reward reward may food removal noxious stimuli loud alarm chamber used test specific hypotheses controlled setting skinner noted expressed distaste becoming believed clark hull yale students coined expression skinner box skinner stated use term went far ask howard hunt use lever box instead skinner box published american psychologist edward thorndike proposed law effect formed basis operant thorndike conducted experiments discover cats learn new behaviors work involved monitoring cats attempted escape puzzle boxes puzzle box trapped animals moved lever performed action triggered thorndike ran several trials recorded time took perform actions necessary escape discovered cats seemed learn trialanderror process rather insightful inspections environment animals learned actions led effect type effect influenced whether behavior would repeated thorndikes law effect contained core elements would become known operant conditioning b f skinner expanded upon thorndikes existing skinner theorized behavior followed reward behavior likely repeated added followed sort punishment less likely repeated introduced word reinforcement thorndikes law experiments skinner discovered law operant learning included extinction punishment skinner designed operant conditioning chamber allow specific hypothesis testing behavioural observation wanted create way observe animals controlled setting observation behaviour nature operant conditioning chamber allows researchers study animal behaviour response conditioning teaching animal perform certain actions like pressing lever response specific stimuli correct action performed animal receives positive reinforcement form food reward cases chamber may deliver positive punishment discourage incorrect responses example researchers tested certain invertebrates reaction operant conditioning using heat box two walls used manipulation one wall undergo temperature change soon invertebrate crosses side undergo temperature change researcher increase temperature eventually invertebrate conditioned stay side undergo temperature change conditioning even temperature turned lowest invertebrate avoid side skinners pigeon studies involved series levers lever pressed pigeon would receive food made complex researchers studied animal learning behaviours pigeon would placed conditioning chamber another one would placed adjacent box separated plexiglass wall pigeon chamber would learn press lever receive food pigeon watched pigeons would switched researchers would observe signs cultural learning outside shell operant conditioning chamber large box big enough easily accommodate animal used subject commonly used animals include rodents usually lab rats pigeons primates chamber often soundproof lightproof avoid distracting stimuli operant conditioning chambers least one response mechanism automatically detect occurrence behavioral response action ie pecking pressing pushing etc may lever series lights animal respond presence stimulus typical mechanisms primates rats response levers subject presses lever opposite end closes switch monitored computer programmed typical mechanisms pigeons birds response keys switch closes bird pecks key sufficient minimal requirement operant conditioning chamber means delivering primary reinforcer food reward simple configuration one response mechanism one feeder may used investigate variety psychological phenomena modern operant conditioning chambers may multiple mechanisms several response levers two feeders variety devices capable generating different stimuli including lights sounds music figures drawings configurations use lcd panel computer generation variety visual stimuli set led lights create patterns wish operant conditioning chambers also electrified nets floors shocks given animals positive punishment lights different colors give information food available positive operant conditioning chambers become common variety research disciplines especially animal learning chambers design allows easy monitoring animal provides space manipulate certain behaviours controlled environment may allow research experimentation performed field variety applications operant conditioning instance shaping behavior child influenced compliments comments approval disapproval ones important factor operant conditioning ability explain learning reallife situations early age parents nurture childrens behavior using reward praise following achievement crawling taking first step reinforces behavior child misbehaves punishment form verbal discouragement removal privileges used discourage repeating actions skinners studies animals behaviour laid framework needed similar studies human subjects based work developmental psychologists able study effect positive negative reinforcement skinner found environment influenced behaviour environment manipulated behaviour change developmental psychologists proposed theories operant learning children research applied education treatment illness young skinners theory operant conditioning played key role helping psychologists understand behavior learned explains reinforcement used effectively learning process schedules reinforcement affect outcome conditioning slot machines online games sometimes cited examples human devices use sophisticated operant schedules reinforcement reward repetitive gamification technique using game design elements nongame contexts also
