relaxin protein hormone first described frederick relaxin family peptide hormones belong insulin superfamily consists seven peptides high structural low sequence similarity insulinlike insl peptides functions remain female relaxin produced corpus luteum ovary breast pregnancy also placenta chorion decidua male produced prostate present human structurally relaxin heterodimer two peptide chains amino acids linked disulfide bridges appears related relaxin produced prohormone prorelaxin posttranslational proteolytic cleavage signal peptide c domain females relaxin produced mainly corpus luteum pregnant nonpregnant relaxin levels rise peak within approximately days ovulation decline absence pregnancy resulting relaxin may involved vital process decidualisation working alongside steroid hormones allow endometrium prepare first trimester pregnancy levels rise additional relaxin produced decidua blood plasma levels relaxin peak first trimester weeks ngml subsequently drop following demise corpus pregnancy relaxin mediates hemodynamic changes occur increased cardiac output increased renal blood relaxin believed relax uterine muscle loosen ligaments holding pelvic bones together order prepare birth canal birth may cause woman feel ligaments looser shoulders knees hips males relaxin enhances motility sperm semen also relaxin found higher normal concentrations ejaculate men born without vas deferens seminal cardiovascular system relaxin secreted functions vasodilator mainly nitric oxide pathway mechanisms include activation nfÎºb leading vascular endothelial growth factor vegf activation signaling matrix metalloproteinases ex vivo experiments using subcutaneous resistance arteries relaxin shown powerful endotheliumdependent via upregulation vegf relaxin also plays key role blood vessel formation angiogenesis pregnancy tumour development ischaemic animals relaxin widens pubic bone facilitates labor also softens cervix cervical ripening softens pubic symphysis rat guinea pig thus long time relaxin looked pregnancy hormone however significance may reach much relaxin may affect collagen metabolism inhibiting collagen synthesis enhancing breakdown increasing matrix also enhances angiogenesis potent renal vasodilatorcitation needed horses equus caballus relaxin also important hormone involved pregnancy however pregnancy occurs relaxin expressed ovarian structures oestrous prior ovulation relaxin produced ovarian stromal cells promote secretion gelatinases tissue inhibitors metalloproteinases enzymes aid process ovulation lead release developed follicle fallopian furthermore granular theca cells follicles express relaxin increasing levels depending early pregnancy preimplantation conceptus express relaxin promote angiogenesis endometrium upregulating allow endometrium prepare implantation horses alone embryo uterus express relaxin mrna least days ovulation conceptus develops expression increase likely promote embryo addition relaxin production horse embryo maternal placenta main source relaxin production whereas animals main source relaxin corpus placental trophoblast cells produce relaxin however size placenta determine level relaxin production seen different breeds horses show different relaxin day gestation onwards relaxin levels increase mares serum levels peaking late moreover pattern relaxin expression follow expression oestrogen however yet known link two labour spike relaxin hours delivery involved myometrial relaxation softening pelvic ligaments aid preparation birth canal delivery horse following birth levels relaxin gradually decrease placenta also delivered however placenta retained mare levels remain addition mare undergoes abortion relaxin levels decline placenta ceases relaxin shown relax vascular smooth muscle cells increase nitric oxide production rat endothelial cells thus playing role regulation cardiovascular function dilating systemic resistance relaxin increases rate force cardiac contraction rat models found promote maturation cardiomyocytes several animal studies found relaxin cardioprotective function ischaemia reperfusion injury reducing cellular damage via antiapoptotic antiinflammatory effectscitation needed relaxin shown reduce cardiac fibrosis animal models inhibiting cardiac fibroblasts secreting collagen stimulating matrix european rabbit oryctolagus cuniculus relaxin associated squamous differentiation expressed tracheobronchial epithelial cells opposed involved relaxin interacts relaxin receptor belong g proteincoupled receptor contain heptahelical transmembrane domain large glycosylated ectodomain distantly related receptors glycoproteohormones lhreceptor fshreceptorcitation needed relaxin receptors found heart smooth muscle connective tissue central autonomous nervous systemcitation needed women relaxin treatment unrelated clinical trials experienced heavier bleeding menstrual cycle suggesting relaxin levels could play role abnormal uterine however research needed confirm relaxin direct causecitation needed lower expression relaxin found amongst women endometriosis research area limited studying relaxins contribution could contribute greatly understanding specific disorders related relaxin heavily described yet link scleroderma fibromyalgia also possible relaxin placenta could contributing factor inducing labour humans therefore serum relaxin levels pregnancy linked premature recombinant form human developed investigational drug serelaxincitation needed suggested relaxin could used therapeutic target comes gynaecological relaxin relaxin arose duplication protorln gene million years ago last common ancestor catarrhine duplication led thought result positive selection convergent evolution nucleotide level relaxin gene new world monkeys gene result old world monkeys group includes subfamilies colobines cercopithecines lost paralog apes retained httpsenwikipediaorgwikirelaxin
