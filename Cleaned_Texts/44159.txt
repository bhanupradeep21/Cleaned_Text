lactation describes secretion milk mammary glands period time mother lactates feed young process naturally occurs sexually mature female mammals although may predate process feeding milk female creatures called nursing humans also called breastfeeding newborn infants often produce milk breast tissue known colloquially witchs milk species lactation sign female pregnant point life although humans goats happen without nearly every species mammal nipples except monotremes egglaying mammals instead release milk ducts abdomen one species mammal dayak fruit bat southeast asia milk production normal male function galactopoiesis maintenance milk production stage requires prolactin oxytocin critical milk letdown reflex response suckling galactorrhea milk production unrelated nursing occur males females many mammal species result hormonal imbalances hyperprolactinaemia chief function lactation provide nutrition immune protection young birth due lactation motheryoung pair survive even food scarce hard young attain expanding environmental conditions species withstand costly investment energy resources milk outweighed benefit offspring almost mammals lactation induces period infertility humans lactational amenorrhea serves provide optimal birth spacing survival eighteenth week pregnancy second third trimesters womans body produces hormones stimulate growth milk duct system breasts also possible induce lactation without pregnancy combinations birth control pills galactagogues milk expression using breast pump latter part pregnancy womans breasts enter secretory differentiation stage breasts make colostrum see thick sometimes yellowish fluid stage high levels progesterone inhibit milk production medical concern pregnant woman leaks colostrum babys birth indication future milk production birth prolactin levels remain high delivery placenta results sudden drop progesterone estrogen hpl levels abrupt withdrawal progesterone presence high prolactin levels stimulates copious milk production secretory activation breast stimulated prolactin levels blood rise peak minutes return prebreastfeeding state three hours later release prolactin triggers cells alveoli make milk prolactin also transfers breast milk research indicates prolactin milk greater times higher milk production lower breasts fuller highest levels tend occur insulin thyroxine also involved roles yet well understood although biochemical markers indicate secretory activation begins hours birth mothers typically begin feeling increased breast fullness sensation milk coming breast hours days birth colostrum first milk breastfed baby receives contains higher amounts white blood cells antibodies mature milk especially high immunoglobulin iga coats lining babys immature intestines helps prevent pathogens invading babys system secretory iga also helps prevent food first two weeks birth colostrum production slowly gives way mature breast hormonal endocrine control system drives milk production pregnancy first days birth milk supply firmly established autocrine local control system begins stage milk removed breasts breast produce research also suggests draining breasts fully also increases rate milk thus milk supply strongly influenced often baby feeds well able transfer milk breast low supply often traced mechanism milk transported breast alveoli nipple suckling baby stimulates paraventricular nuclei supraoptic nucleus hypothalamus signals posterior pituitary gland produce oxytocin oxytocin stimulates contraction myoepithelial cells surrounding alveoli already hold milk increased pressure causes milk flow duct system released nipple response conditioned eg cry baby milk ejection initiated mothers breast act suckling baby milk ejection reflex also called letdown reflex always consistent especially first woman conditioned nursing letdown triggered variety stimuli including sound baby even thinking breastfeeding stimulate reflex causing unwanted leakage breasts may give milk infant feeding one breast however problems often settle two weeks feeding stress anxiety cause difficulties breastfeeding release hormone oxytocin leads milk ejection letdown reflex oxytocin stimulates muscles surrounding breast squeeze milk breastfeeding mothers describe sensation differently feel slight tingling others feel immense amounts pressure slight paindiscomfort still others feel anything different minority mothers experience dysphoric milk ejection reflex immediately letdown causing anxiety anger nausea amongst negative sensations minutes per feed poor milk ejection reflex due sore cracked nipples separation infant history breast surgery tissue damage prior breast trauma mother trouble breastfeeding different methods assisting milk ejection reflex may help include feeding familiar comfortable location massage breast back warming breast cloth shower mechanism milk transported breast alveoli nipple suckling baby innervates mechanoreceptors densely packed around areolar region electrical impulse follows spinothalamic tract begins innervation fourth intercostal nerves electrical impulse ascends posterolateral tract one two vertebral levels synapses secondorder neurons called tract cells posterior dorsal horn tract cells decussate via anterior white commissure anterolateral corner ascend supraoptic nucleus paraventricular nucleus hypothalamus synapse oxytocinergic thirdorder neurons somas neurons located hypothalamus axon axon terminals located infundibulum pars nervosa posterior pituitary respectively oxytocin produced neurons soma supraoptic paraventricular nuclei transported infundibulum via hypothalamoneurohypophyseal tract help carrier protein neurophysin pars nervosa posterior pituitary stored herring bodies stored synapse second thirdorder neurons following electrical impulse oxytocin released bloodstream bloodstream oxytocin makes way myoepithelial cells lie extracellular matrix luminal epithelial cells also make alveoli breast tissue oxytocin binds myoepithelial cells cells contract increased intraalveolar pressure forces milk lactiferous sinuses lactiferous ducts study found lactiferous sinuses may true milk simply enters lactiferous ducts nipple surge oxytocin also causes uterus contract breastfeeding mothers may feel contractions afterpains may range periodlike cramps strong labourlike contractions severe second subsequent humans induced lactation relactation observed frequently cultures demonstrated varying success adoptive mothers wet appears plausible possibility lactation women females species biological mothers confer evolutionary advantage especially groups high maternal mortality tight social phenomenon also observed primates lemurs dwarf lactation induced humans combination physical psychological stimulation drugs combination several protocols inducing lactation developed dr jack newman lenore goldfarb commonly called newmangoldfarb protocols regular protocol involves use birth control pills mimic hormone levels pregnancy domperidone stimulate milk production followed discontinuing birth control introducing use double electric breast pump induce milk additional protocols exist support accelerated timeline support induced lactation menopausal parents couples may stimulate lactation outside pregnancy sexual purposes rare accounts male lactation distinct galactorrhea exist historical medical anthropological recently subject transgender health care multiple case reports described patients assigned male birth successfully inducing research indicated breast milk nutritionally comparible milk naturally lactating induced lactating cisgender domperidone drug induce charles darwin recognized mammary glands seemed developed specifically cutaneous glands hypothesized evolved glands brood pouches fish would provide nourishment latter aspect hypothesis confirmed however recently mechanism postulated early mammals lactate lactation must evolved last common ancestor mammals places minimum middle late triassic monotremes diverged oftedal argued therapsids evolved protolacteal fluid order keep eggs moist adaptation necessitated due synapsids parchment shelled eggs vulnerable evaporation dehydration mineralized eggs produced protolacteal fluid became complex nutrientrich milk allowed decline egg size reducing dependence large yolk evolution lactation also believed resulted complex dentition seen mammals lactation would allowed prolonged development jaw eruption early evolution lactation secretion milk pilosebaceous glands mammary patches analogous areola hairs patch transported nourishing fluids hatchlings seen development nipple occurred mammal lineages diverged monotremes metatheria another well known example nourishing young secretions glands crop milk columbiform birds mammals also appears directed birds flamingos penguins utilize similar feeding discus fish symphysodon known biparentally feeding offspring epidermal mucus closer examination reveals mammals birds secretion nourishing fluid may controlled similar behavior seen least species lactation also hallmark adenotrophic viviparity breeding mechanism developed insects notably tsetse flies single egg tsetse develops larva inside uterus fed milky substance secreted milk gland inside cockroach species diploptera punctata also known feed offspring milky toxeus magnus antmimicking jumping spider species southeast asia also lactates nurses offspring days although able forage days blocking nursing immediately birth resulted complete mortality offspring whereas blocking days birth resulted increased foraging reduced survival form lactation may evolved production trophic
