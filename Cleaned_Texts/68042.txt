peripheral neuropathy often shortened neuropathy general term describing damage disease affecting damage nerves may impair sensation movement gland function andor organ function depending nerves affected neuropathy affecting motor sensory autonomic nerves result different symptoms one type nerve may affected simultaneously peripheral neuropathy may acute sudden onset rapid progress chronic symptoms begin subtly progress slowly may reversible permanent common causes include systemic diseases diabetes leprosy hyperglycemiainduced vitamin deficiency medication eg chemotherapy commonly prescribed antibiotics including metronidazole fluoroquinolone class antibiotics ciprofloxacin levofloxacin moxifloxacin traumatic injury ischemia radiation therapy excessive alcohol consumption immune system disease celiac disease nonceliac gluten sensitivity viral infection also genetic present birth idiopathic known conventional medical usage word neuropathy neuro nervous system pathy disease without modifier usually means peripheral neuropathy neuropathy affecting one nerve called mononeuropathy neuropathy involving nerves roughly areas sides body called symmetrical polyneuropathy simply polyneuropathy two typically sometimes many separate nerves disparate areas body affected called mononeuritis multiplex multifocal mononeuropathy multiple neuropathy may cause painful cramps fasciculations fine muscle twitching muscle loss bone degeneration changes skin hair nails additionally motor neuropathy may cause impaired balance coordination commonly muscle weakness sensory neuropathy may cause numbness touch vibration reduced position sense causing poorer coordination balance reduced sensitivity temperature change pain spontaneous tingling burning pain allodynia pain normally nonpainful stimuli light touch autonomic neuropathy may produce diverse symptoms depending affected glands organs common symptoms poor bladder control abnormal blood pressure heart rate reduced ability sweat peripheral neuropathy may classified according number distribution nerves affected mononeuropathy mononeuritis multiplex polyneuropathy type nerve fiber predominantly affected motor sensory autonomic process affecting nerves eg inflammation neuritis compression compression neuropathy chemotherapy chemotherapyinduced peripheral neuropathy affected nerves found emg electromyography ncs nerve conduction study test classification applied upon completion mononeuropathy type neuropathy affects single diagnostically important distinguish polyneuropathy single nerve affected likely due localized trauma infectioncitation needed common cause mononeuropathy physical compression nerve known compression neuropathy carpal tunnel syndrome axillary nerve palsy examples direct injury nerve interruption blood supply resulting ischemia inflammation also may cause mononeuropathycitation needed polyneuropathy pattern nerve damage quite different mononeuropathy often serious affecting areas body term peripheral neuropathy sometimes used loosely refer polyneuropathy cases polyneuropathy many nerve cells various parts body affected without regard nerve pass nerve cells affected particular case distal axonopathy one common pattern cell bodies neurons remain intact axons affected proportion length longest axons affected diabetic neuropathy common cause pattern

neuropathy chief symptoms include motor symptoms weakness clumsiness movement sensory symptoms unusual unpleasant sensations tingling burning reduced ability feel sensations texture temperature impaired balance standing walking many polyneuropathies symptoms occur first severely feet autonomic symptoms also may occur dizziness standing erectile dysfunction difficulty controlling

ages related diabetic causes relate particular type polyneuropathy many different causes type including inflammatory diseases lyme disease vitamin deficiencies blood disorders toxins including alcohol certain prescribed drugs types polyneuropathy progress fairly slowly months years rapidly progressive polyneuropathy also occurs important recognize one time thought many cases small fiber peripheral

autonomic neuropathy form polyneuropathy affects nonvoluntary nonsensory nervous system ie autonomic nervous system affecting mostly internal organs bladder muscles cardiovascular system digestive
