retrievalinduced forgetting rif memory phenomenon remembering causes forgetting information memory phenomenon first demonstrated although concept rif previously discussed context retrieval inhibition rif demonstrated threephase experiment consisting study practice studied material final test studied material experiments also used multiple kinds final tests including recall using category cues recall using category word stems recognition tests effect produced using many different kinds materials produced group settings reduced special clinical populations although rif occurs consequence conscious remembering explicit retrieval actual forgetting thought occur implicitly level awareness cognitive psychologists continue debate rif occurs relates larger picture memory general cognition particular researchers divided idea whether forgetting caused process actively inhibits information due interference information memory inhibition associated rif looked similar forms physical inhibition rif also tied memory retrieval strategies disrupting strategies affecting phenomenon although term retrievalinduced forgetting first used described earlier review robert bjork terms suppressing memories become active relevant given situation bjork described study neely found participants slower recognizing words shown related word immediately beforehand researchers hypothesized participants actually trying suppress related words recognition irrelevant unhelpful information completing recognition rif similar memory phenomena comparable partset cuing show lowered memory performance given previously studied information one example partset cuing people asked recall many us states could remembered states asked shown names states beforehand cued portion toberecalled information recall performance rif also related forgetting attributable changes ones context forgetting automatic without output interference related phenomenon generation words category fruits make words category harder remember cause perseverations participants repeat alreadyremembered rif shown retrievalpractice paradigm experiments exact instructions procedures varying slightly experiment experiment original version booklets used present stimuli complete testing since procedure often done using computer software microsoft powerpoint experiments typically consist study retrievalpractice test study phase participants asked study word pairs consist category name word belongs category example typically multiple word pairs across number categories say items divided equally categories used among several others participants might study word pairs subset items tested using fillintheblank test given item participant shown category name first two letters studied word category eg participants instructed fill blank appropriate studied word category participants typically practice remembering items multiple retrievalpractice phase splits items three different types interest final test often denoted using following retrieval practice participants given final test asked remember studied items goal test phase assess whether prior retrieval practice affects well words remembered compared words rif ultimately measured difference proportion items recalled two categorycued test one studied category shown time participants asked remember studied items category although set amount time given category exact amount time varies across studies instance anderson coresearchers gave participants seconds category cue given words category meant participants seconds average remember item studies used longer categoryplusstemcued tests add word stem category cue typically category participants given specific number letters corresponding unique studied word category cues specific particular word participants given relatively less time respond cue compared categorycued tests response times cue vary study study although many experiments used interval though studies reported using response times typically categoryplusstemcued tests include first initial letter included multiple recognition tests require participants produce word memory instead participants literally shown word asked report whether word appeared study phase recognition tests typically show studied words number nonstudied words lures researchers measure often participants correctly recognize studied items often incorrectly recognize lures difference two proportions statistic measuring ones ability discriminate studied nonstudied items used represent reaction time also used represent rif slower reaction times thought represent rif due difficulty recognizing studied rif studies generally yielded results average words remembered less well baseline rif studies generally used words basic easily recognized categories effects shown wide variety stimuli although typical paradigm includes retrieval practice previously studied words studies shown rif even participants asked retrieve something else instance rif occurred even participants generated new unstudied items previously studied categories called extralist retrieval practice semantic method called impossible retrieval practice rif also observed participants asked generate word category even though one actually rif still observed final test cases successful retrieval possible one studied number fruits participant asked generate word given cue resembling studies also examined effect rif participants instead asked perform retrieval practice given additional study trials making restudy material instead remembering prior information cases participants failed show rif rif effect related accessibility information researchers studied whether persists populations certain disorders related memory one study students diagnosed adhd degree rif observed compared control group depended kind final test used using categorycued test differences rif compared control group however categoryplusstemcued test used participants adhd average showed less rif patients depression show rif compared controls using categoryplusstemcued patients schizophrenia show comparable rif effects control groups categorycued test reduced rif using recognition effects studying remembering information groups also examined groups individuals experience event together jointly remember event conditions created

instances forgetting often accounted interference heightened accessibility associated information memory researchers described interference may explain rif number ways instance theory blocking suggests practiced words easily remembered test may occupy response channel memory effectively prevent words memory remembered words would less affected blocking effect retrieval practiced words would block items different theories resource diffusion response decrement similar blocking theories describe retrieval processes finite set resources distributed adequately enough items models interference proposed precisely define idea items strength memory separating strength item memory contextual information linked models may explain certain strengthening methods predict rif others generally speaking inhibition theory assumes existence set processes allows suppression central inhibition account rif access items actively suppressed inhibitory process retrievalpractice instance participants perform retrieval practice category cue may activate many associated items degree related inappropriate associates words become accessible serves source competition disrupts retrieval appropriate response resolve competition inhibitory process intervenes suppress accessibility items subsequently suppression facilitates retrieval appropriate item prevents retrieval contextually inappropriate items items unrelated categories items less competitive retrieval practice thus require less inhibition final test consequences suppression persist previously competitive items inhibited become difficult reduction accessibility consistent definition inhibition proposed robert bjork inhibition active direct form suppression serves reduce access one several responses adaptive memory inhibition reference rif sometimes likened processes inhibition associated motor control responsible baseball players stopping swing anticipate similarly dominant response memory inappropriate inhibitory processes must recruited temporarily suppress response appropriate one addition recent studies indicate increase activity frontal cortex manifestation rif phenomenon speaks favor increased cognitive control inhibiting retrieval related nontarget individual strategies retrieval considered one way rif might occur retrieval practice may inconsistent way participants remember items studied categories retrieval practice disrupts participants memory strategy may affect ability remember particular items final participants preparing remember items retrievalpractice based strategy certain presentation
