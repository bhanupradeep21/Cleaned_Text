hyperchromicity increase absorbance optical density material famous example hyperchromicity dna occurs dna duplex uv absorption increased two single dna strands separated either heat addition denaturant increasing ph level opposite decrease absorbance called hypochromicity heat denaturation dna also called melting causes double helix structure unwind form single stranded dna dna solution heated melting temperature usually doublestranded dna unwinds form singlestranded dna bases become unstacked thus absorb light native state bases dna absorb light wavelength region bases become unstacked wavelength maximum absorbance change amount absorbed increases double stranded dna strand dissociating two single strands produces sharp cooperative transition hyperchromicity used track condition dna temperature changes transitionmelting temperature tm temperature absorbance uv light maximum minimum ie dna denatured ten fold increase monovalent cation concentration increases temperature hyperchromic effect striking increase absorbance dna upon denaturation two strands dna bound together mainly stacking interactions hydrogen bonds hydrophobic effect complementary bases hydrogen bond limits resonance aromatic ring absorbance sample limited well dna double helix treated denatured agents interaction force holding double helical structure disrupted double helix separates two single strands random coiled conformation time basebase interaction reduced increasing uv absorbance dna solution many bases free form form hydrogen bonds complementary bases result absorbance singlestranded dna higher double stranded dna concentration biology article stub help wikipedia expanding spectroscopyrelated article stub help wikipedia expanding ithttpsenwikipediaorgwikihyperchromicity
