piagets theory cognitive development comprehensive theory nature development human intelligence originated swiss developmental psychologist jean piaget theory deals nature knowledge humans gradually come acquire construct use piagets theory mainly known developmental stage theory working alfred binet laboratory school paris piaget intrigued fact children different ages made different kinds mistakes solving experience observations alfred binet laboratory beginnings theory cognitive believed children different ages made different mistakes quality rather quantity piaget proposed four stages describe development process children sensorimotor stage preoperational stage concrete operational stage formal operational stage describes specific age group stage described children develop cognitive skills example believed children experience world actions representing things words thinking logically using reasoning piaget cognitive development progressive reorganisation mental processes resulting biological maturation environmental experience believed children construct understanding world around experience discrepancies already know discover environment adjust ideas moreover piaget claimed cognitive development centre human organism language contingent knowledge understanding acquired cognitive piagets earlier work received greatest attention childcentred classrooms open education direct applications piagets despite huge success piagets theory limitations piaget recognised example theory supports sharp stages rather continuous development horizontal vertical piaget noted reality dynamic system continuous change reality defined reference two conditions define dynamic systems specifically argued reality involves transformations transformations refer manners changes thing person undergo states refer conditions appearances things persons found transformations example might changes shape form instance liquids reshaped transferred one vessel another similarly humans change characteristics grow older size toddler walk run without falling yrs age childs sensorimotor anatomy well developed acquires skill faster placement location space time eg various objects persons might found one place one time different place another time thus piaget argued human intelligence adaptive must functions represent transformational static aspects proposed operative intelligence responsible representation manipulation dynamic transformational aspects reality figurative intelligence responsible representation static aspects operative intelligence active aspect intelligence involves actions overt covert undertaken order follow recover anticipate transformations objects persons figurative intelligence less static aspect intelligence involving means representation used retain mind states ie successive forms shapes locations intervene transformations involves perception imitation mental imagery drawing therefore figurative aspects intelligence derive meaning operative aspects intelligence states exist independently transformations interconnect piaget stated figurative representational aspects intelligence subservient operative dynamic aspects therefore understanding essentially derives operative aspect time operative intelligence frames world understood changes understanding successful piaget stated process understanding change involves two basic functions assimilation study field education piaget focused two processes named assimilation accommodation piaget assimilation meant integrating external elements structures lives environments could assimilation humans perceive adapt new information process fitting new information preexisting cognitive assimilation new experiences reinterpreted fit assimilate old ideas analyzing new facts occurs humans faced new unfamiliar information refer previously learned information order make sense contrast accommodation process taking new information ones environment altering preexisting schemas order fit new information happens existing schema knowledge work needs changed deal new object accommodation imperative people continue interpret new concepts schemas frameworks piaget believed human brain programmed evolution bring equilibrium believed ultimately influences structures internal external processes assimilation piagets understanding assimilation accommodation exist without two sides coin assimilate object existing mental schema one first needs take account accommodate particularities object certain extent instance recognize assimilate apple apple one must first focus accommodate contour object one needs roughly recognize size object development increases balance equilibration two functions balance assimilation accommodation generate mental schemas operative intelligence one function dominates generate representations belong figurative piaget agreed developmental psychologists three important factors attributed development maturation experience social environment theory differs involves addition fourth factor equilibration refers organisms attempt keep cognitive schemes also see booms detailed equilibration motivational element guides cognitive development humans biological need make sense things encounter every aspect world order muster greater understanding therefore flourish concept equilibration comes play child confronted information fit previously held schemes disequilibrium said occur one would imagine unsatisfactory child try fix incongruence fixed one three ways child either ignore newly discovered information assimilate information preexisting scheme accommodate information modifying different scheme using methods return child state equilibrium however depending information presented child state equilibrium likely permanent example lets say dave three year old boy grown farm accustomed seeing horses regularly brought zoo parents sees elephant first time immediately shouts look mommy horsey dave scheme elephants interprets elephant horse due large size color tail long face believes elephant horse mother corrects new information dave received put state disequilibrium one three things either turn head move towards another section animals ignore newly presented information distort defining characteristics elephant assimilate horsey scheme modify preexisting animal schema accommodate new information regarding elephants slightly altering knowledge animals knows age comes entry higher stage development said previously held schemes children hold likely confronted discrepant information older get silverman geiringer propose one would successful attempting change childs mode thought exposing child concepts reflect higher rather lower stage development furthermore children better influenced modeled performances one stage developmental level opposed modeled performances either lower two stages level theory cognitive development jean piaget proposed humans progress four developmental stages sensorimotor stage preoperational stage concrete operational stage formal operational first sensorimotor stage extends birth acquisition stage infants progressively construct knowledge understanding world coordinating experiences vision hearing physical interactions objects grasping sucking infants gain knowledge world physical actions perform within progress reflexive instinctual action birth beginning symbolic thought toward end children learn separate environment think aspects environment even though may outside reach childs senses stage according piaget development object permanence one important object permanence childs understanding object continues exist even though see hear peekaboo game children yet fully develop object permanence respond sudden hiding revealing face end sensorimotor period children develop permanent sense self object quickly lose interest piaget divided sensorimotor stage six observing sequences play piaget able demonstrate second stage theory preoperational stage said stage starts towards end second year starts child begins learn speak lasts age seven preoperational stage cognitive development piaget noted children yet understand concrete logic mentally manipulate childrens increase playing pretending takes place stage however child still trouble seeing things different points view childrens play mainly categorized symbolic play manipulating symbols play demonstrated idea checkers snacks pieces paper plates box table observations symbols exemplifies idea play absence actual objects involved preoperational stage sparse logically inadequate regard mental operations child able form stable concepts well magical beliefs magical thinking child however still able perform operations tasks child mentally rather physically thinking stage still egocentric meaning child difficulty seeing viewpoint others preoperational stage split two substages symbolic function substage intuitive thought substage symbolic function substage children able understand represent remember picture objects mind without object front intuitive thought substage children tend propose questions come stage children want understand two four years age children yet manipulate transform information logical way however think images symbols examples mental abilities language pretend play symbolic play children develop imaginary friends roleplay friends childrens play becomes social assign roles examples symbolic play include playing house tea party type symbolic play children engage connected level creativity ability connect additionally quality symbolic play consequences later development example young children whose symbolic play violent nature tend exhibit less prosocial behavior likely display antisocial tendencies later stage still limitations egocentrism precausal thinking egocentrism occurs child unable distinguish perspective another person children tend stick viewpoint rather consider view others indeed even aware concept different viewpoints egocentrism seen experiment performed piaget swiss developmental psychologist bärbel inhelder known three mountain problem experiment three views mountain shown child asked traveling doll would see various angles child consistently describe see position seated regardless angle asked take dolls perspective egocentrism would also cause child believe like lion guard high school student next door must like lion guard similar preoperational childrens egocentric thinking structuring cause effect relationships piaget coined term precausal thinking describe way preoperational children use existing ideas views like egocentrism explain causeandeffect relationships three main concepts causality displayed children preoperational stage include animism artificialism transductive animism belief inanimate objects capable actions lifelike qualities example could child believing sidewalk mad made fall stars twinkle sky happy artificialism refers belief environmental characteristics attributed human actions interventions example child might say windy outside someone blowing hard clouds white someone painted color finally precausal thinking categorized transductive reasoning transductive reasoning child fails understand true relationships cause unlike deductive inductive reasoning general specific specific general transductive reasoning refers child reasons specific specific drawing relationship two separate events otherwise unrelated example child hears dog bark balloon popped child would conclude dog barked balloon popped main feature preoperational stage development primitive reasoning ages four seven reasoning changes symbolic thought intuitive thought stage marked greater dependence intuitive thinking rather children begin automatic thoughts dont require evidence stage heightened sense curiosity need understand things work piaget named substage intuitive thought starting develop logical thought explain thought stage still immature cognitive errors occur children stage depend subjective perception object stage characterized centration conservation irreversibility class inclusion transitive inference centration act focusing attention one characteristic dimension situation whilst disregarding others conservation awareness altering substances appearance change basic properties children stage unaware conservation exhibit centration centration conservation easily understood familiarized piagets famous experimental task task child presented two identical beakers containing amount liquid child usually notes beakers contain amount liquid one beakers poured taller thinner container children younger seven eight years old typically say two beakers longer contain amount liquid taller container holds larger quantity centration without taking consideration fact beakers previously noted contain amount liquid due superficial changes child unable comprehend properties substances continued remain conservation irreversibility concept developed stage closely related ideas centration conservation irreversibility refers children unable mentally reverse sequence events beaker situation child realize sequence events reversed water tall beaker poured back original beaker amount water would exist another example childrens reliance visual representations misunderstanding less two rows containing equal numbers blocks placed front child one row spread farther apart child think row spread farther contains class inclusion refers kind conceptual thinking children preoperational stage yet grasp childrens inability focus two aspects situation inhibits understanding principle one category class contain several different subcategories example fouryearold girl may shown picture eight dogs three cats girl knows cats dogs aware animals however asked dogs animals likely answer dogs due difficulty focusing two subclasses larger class time may able view dogs dogs animals struggled trying classify similar concept relating intuitive thought known transitive inference transitive inference using previous knowledge determine missing piece using basic logic children preoperational stage lack logic example transitive inference would child presented information greater b b greater c child may difficulty understanding also greater c concrete operational stage third stage piagets theory cognitive development stage follows preoperational stage occurs ages middle childhood preadolescence characterized appropriate use logic stage childs thought processes become mature adult like start solving problems logical fashion abstract hypothetical thinking yet developed child children solve problems apply concrete events objects stage children undergo transition child learns rules piaget determined children able incorporate inductive reasoning inductive reasoning involves drawing inferences observations order make generalization contrast children struggle deductive reasoning involves using generalized principle order try predict outcome event children stage commonly experience difficulties figuring logic heads example child understand b b c however asked c child might able logically figure question mentally two important processes concrete operational stage logic elimination egocentrism egocentrism inability consider understand perspective ones phase thought morality child completely self stage child acquires ability view things another individuals perspective even think perspective incorrect instance show child comic jane puts doll box leaves room melissa moves doll drawer jane comes back child concrete operations stage say jane still think box even though child knows drawer see also falsebelief task children stage however solve problems apply actual concrete objects events abstract concepts hypothetical tasks understanding knowing use full common sense yet completely adapted piaget determined children concrete operational stage able incorporate inductive logic hand children age difficulty using deductive logic involves using general principle predict outcome specific event includes mental reversibility example able reverse order relationships mental categories example child might able recognize dog labrador labrador dog dog animal draw conclusions information available well apply processes hypothetical abstract quality adolescents thought formal operational level evident adolescents verbal problem solving logical quality adolescents thought children likely solve problems trialanderror adolescents begin think scientist thinks devising plans solve problems systematically test use hypotheticaldeductive reasoning means develop hypotheses best guesses systematically deduce conclude best path follow solving stage adolescent able understand love logical proofs values stage young person begins entertain possibilities future fascinated adolescents also changing cognitively way think social matters one thing brings change egocentrism happens heightening selfconsciousness giving adolescents idea personal uniqueness invincibility adolescent egocentrism dissected two types social thinking imaginary audience personal fable imaginary audience consists adolescent believing others watching things personal fable thing imaginary audience often confused imaginary audience personal fable consists believing exceptional way types social thinking begin concrete stage carry formal operational stage development piagetian tests well known practiced test concrete operations prevalent tests conservation important aspects experimenter must take account performing experiments children one example experiment testing conservation water level task experimenter two glasses size fill level liquid make sure child understands glasses amount water experimenter pour liquid one small glasses tall thin glass experimenter ask child taller glass liquid less liquid amount liquid child give answer three keys experimenter keep mind experiment justification number times asking word choice new cognitive skills increase childs understanding physical world however according piaget still think abstract ways additionally think systematic scientific ways example children age twelve would able come variables influence period pendulum takes complete arc even given weights could attach strings order experiment would able draw clear final stage known formal operational stage early middle adolescence beginning age finalizing around intelligence demonstrated logical use symbols related abstract concepts form thought includes assumptions necessary relation point person capable hypothetical deductive reasoning time people develop ability think abstract concepts piaget stated hypotheticodeductive reasoning becomes important formal operational stage type thinking involves hypothetical whatif situations always rooted reality ie counterfactual thinking often required science mathematics children primary school years mostly use inductive reasoning adolescents start use deductive reasoning inductive reasoning children draw general conclusions personal experiences specific facts adolescents learn use deductive reasoning applying logic create specific conclusions abstract concepts capability results capacity think however research shown persons cultures reach formal operations people use formal operations aspects piaget colleagues conducted several experiments assess formal operational one experiments piaget evaluated cognitive capabilities children different ages use scale varying weights task balance scale hooking weights ends scale successfully complete task children must use formal operational thought realize distance weights center heaviness weights affected balance heavier weight placed closer center scale lighter weight placed farther center two weights balance year olds could comprehend concept balancing children age could balance scale placing weights ends failed realize importance location age children could think location failed use logic instead used trialanderror finally age early middle adolescence children clearly understood relationship weight distance could successfully implement piaget sees childrens conception causation march primitive conceptions cause scientific rigorous mechanical nature primitive concepts characterized supernatural decidedly nonnatural nonmechanical tone piaget basic assumption babies phenomenists knowledge consists assimilating things schemas action appear childs point view qualities fact stem organism consequently subjective conceptions prevalent piagets first stage development dashed upon discovering deeper empirical truths piaget gives example child believing moon stars follow night walk upon learning case friends must separate self object resulting theory moon immobile moves independently agents second stage around three eight years age characterized mix type magical animistic nonnatural conceptions causation mechanical naturalistic causation conjunction natural nonnatural causal explanations supposedly stems experience though piaget make much attempt describe nature differences conception interviews children asked questions specifically natural phenomena makes clouds move makes stars move rivers flow nature answers given piaget says objects must perform actions fulfill obligations towards men calls moral first note distinction schemes analogous lists actioninstructions eg leading separate penstrokes figurative schemas aka schemata akin

indirect evidence indeed child concept development retain model disproved observableorother new evidence calls new accommodation spirit might said rnainfrared model valid explaining piagetian higher intelligence anyhow current opens way testing development several directions including finer points piaget agenda parents use piagets theory many ways support childs teachers also use piagets theory help students example recent studies shown children grade age perform differently tasks measuring basic addition subtraction children preoperational concrete operational levels cognitive development perform arithmetic operations addition subtraction similar accuracy however children concrete operational level able perform addition problems subtraction problems overall greater teachers use piagets theory see child class stands subject discussing syllabus students students stage cognitive growth person differ another cognitive development thinking active process beginning end life intellectual advancement happens people every age developmental period look cognitive equilibrium achieve balance easiest way understand new experiences lens preexisting ideas infants learn new objects grabbed way familiar objects adults explain days headlines evidence existing however application standardized piagetian theory procedures different societies established widely varying results lead speculate cultures produce cognitive development others without specific kinds cultural experience also formal schooling development might cease certain level concrete operational levelcitation procedure done following methods developed geneva ie water level task participants presented two beakers equal circumference height filled equal amounts water water one beaker transferred another taller smaller circumference children young adults nonliterate societies given age likely think taller thinner beaker water hand experiment effects modifying testing procedures match local cultural produced different pattern results revised procedures participants explained language indicated water quantity piagets water level task also applied elderly formann results showed ageassociated nonlinear decline researchers linked piagets theory cattell horns theory fluid crystallized piagets operative intelligence corresponds cattellhorn formulation fluid ability concern logical thinking eduction relations expression cattell used refer inferring relationships piagets treatment everyday learning corresponds cattellhorn formulation crystallized ability reflect impress experience piagets operativity considered prior ultimately provides foundation everyday much like fluid abilitys relation crystallized piagets theory also aligns another psychometric theory namely psychometric theory g general intelligence piaget designed number tasks assess hypotheses arising theory tasks intended measure individual differences equivalent psychometric intelligence tests notwithstanding different research traditions psychometric tests piagetian tasks developed correlations two types measures found consistently positive generally moderate magnitude g thought underlie performance two types tasks shown possible construct battery consisting piagetian tasks good measure g standard iq piagetian accounts development challenged several grounds first piaget noted development always progress smooth manner theory seems predict décalage progressive forms cognitive developmental progression specific domain suggest stage model best useful furthermore studies found children may able learn concepts capability complex reasoning supposedly represented advanced stages relative ease lourenço machado p broadly piagets theory domain general predicting cognitive maturation occurs concurrently across different domains knowledge mathematics logic understanding physics piaget take account variability childs performance notably child differ sophistication across several domains cognitive developmentalists influenced neonativist evolutionary psychology ideas ideas deemphasized domain general theories emphasized domain specificity modularity modularity implies different cognitive faculties may largely independent one another thus develop according quite different timetables influenced real world vein cognitive developmentalists argued rather domain general learners children come equipped domain specific theories sometimes referred core knowledge allows break learning within domain example even young infants appear sensitive predictable regularities movement interactions objects example object pass another object human behavior example hand repeatedly reaching object object particular path motion becomes building block elaborate knowledge constructed piagets theory said undervalue influence culture cognitive development piaget demonstrates child goes several stages cognitive development come conclusions however childs sociocultural environment plays important part cognitive development social interaction teaches child world helps develop cognitive stages piaget neglected recent work newer dynamic systems approach strongly challenged basic presumptions core knowledge school piaget suggested dynamic systems approaches harken modern neuroscientific research available piaget constructing brought new light research psychology new techniques brain imaging provided new understanding cognitive one important finding domainspecific knowledge constructed children develop integrate knowledge enables domain improve accuracy knowledge well organization however suggests smooth integration learning development either piaget neonativist critics envisioned additionally psychologists lev vygotsky jerome bruner thought differently piaget suggesting language important cognition development piaget recent years several theorists attempted address concerns piagets theory developing new theories models accommodate evidence violates piagetian predictions
