reducing inflammation without affecting macrophage survival furthermore bromated derivative noscapine times potent effects noscapine brominated derivative also inhibits tolllike receptor tlr tumour necrosis factor α tnfα human mous macrophages without causing toxicity furthermore brominated noscapine potent antiinflammatory activity models septic inflammation inhibits inflammatory factors dosedependent manner prevents release tnfα human mouse macrophages another study inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis colon cancer found noscapine excellent antiinflammatory effect could significantly decrease levels proinflammatory factors ifnc compared control group additionally found chitosan nanoparticles containing brominated noscapine derivatives could reduce proinflammatory
