description naming two new genera palaeosaurus riley stutchbury briefly informally published two new fossil teeth holotype tooth p platyodon listed brsmg holotype tooth p cylindrodon listed brsmg listed latter species found near city bristol england called palaeosaurus cylindrodon palaeosaurus riley stutchbury mean assign species sainthilaires genus teleosaurids simply know name used thecodontosaurus also named publication riley stutchbury fully describe two species palaeosaurus based single sharp tooth late triassic period spellings corrected read paleosaurus cylindrodon paleosaurus platyodon sir richard owen created name dinosauria publication attempted redescribe riley stutchburys paleosaurus thecodontosaurus consider dinosaurs knowing change spelling changed name back palaeosaurus spelling followed subsequent authors owen assigns bones palaeosaurus would later reclassified prosauropod dinosaur thecodontosaurus contrary owen thomas henry huxley described thecodontosaurus palaeosaurus dinosaurs first time considered palaeosaurus platyodon synonymous thecodontosaurus antiquus likely due thecodontosaurus bones owen assigned former genus however huxley regarded p cylindrodon unrelated carnivorous theropod american paleontologist edward drinker cope named third species palaeosaurus fraserianus isolated tooth found triassic rocks pennsylvania today regarded belonging indeterminate sauropodomorph dinosaur unrelated fourth species created palaeosaurus stricklandi recognized von huene recognized tooth palaeosaurus platyodon belonged phytosaur placed new genus rileya forming new combination rileya platyodon one holotype teeth p cylindrodon presumably brsmg destroyed world war ii tooth survives day german paleontologist oskar kuhn first time since recognized genus palaeosaurus created riley stutchbury preoccupied created new generic name palaeosauriscus contain palaeosaurus cylindrodon species previously described palaeosaurus owens misclassified specimens caused american edwin harris colbert classify prosauropods two groups palaeosauria included palaeosaurus teratosaurus thought carnivorous chimaeric nature palaeosaurus plateosauria included thecodontosaurus plateosaurus described correct skulls therefore correctly described herbivorous group thecodontosaurus redescribed team paleontologists led michael benton placed owens misclassified material genus thecodontosaurus rather palaeosaurus still followed today skeletal bones ever assigned palaeosaurus cylindrodon p platyodon also reassigned thecodontosaurus genera rileya palaeosauriscus well species palaeosaurus cylindrodon palaeosaurus platyodon declared nomina dubia peter galton reviewing archosaurian fossils bristol finds reaffirmed identification two teeth

nowdestroyed tooth subcircular crosssection fine obliquely inclined von huene assigned new material palaeosaurus numerous prosauropod bones found germany owens thecodontosaurus bones misassigned palaeosaurus cylindrodon species thought prosauropod von huene therefore referred new species palaeosaurus creating name p diagnostica peter galton british paleontologist moved species genus creating new combination efraasia diagnosticus several decades scientists considered efraasia junior synonym sellosaurus however adam yates another british palaeontologist redescribed bones assigned sellosaurus resurrected genus efraasia bones also assigned bones first described teratosaurus minor well although leaving teeth recognized nondinosaurian like galton yatess efraasia also included remains previously known palaeosaurus diagnosticus although unlike galton yates calls species efraasia minor synonymizing species e minor claimed priority von huene described teratosaurus minor
