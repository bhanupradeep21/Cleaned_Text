speech language impairment basic categories might drawn issues communication involve hearing speech language fluency speech impairment characterized difficulty articulation words examples include stuttering problems producing particular sounds articulation refers sounds syllables phonology produced individual voice however may refer characteristics sounds pitch quality intensity sound often fluency also considered category speech encompassing characteristics rhythm rate emphasis sound language impairment specific impairment understanding sharing thoughts ideas ie disorder involves processing linguistic information problems may experienced involve form language including grammar morphology syntax functional aspects language including semantics individual one types impairment impairmentsdisorders identified speech language pathologist following brief definitions several prominent speech disorders apraxia speech acquired form motor speech disorder caused brain injury stroke dementia developmental verbal dyspraxia refers specifically motor speech disorder neurological disorder individuals developmental verbal apraxia encounter difficulty saying sounds syllables words difficulties due weakness muscles rather coordination brain specific parts apraxia speech acquired form disorder caused brain injury stroke dementia interventions effective occur individually first three five times per week improvements children apraxia may transitioned group therapy settings therapeutic exercises must focus planning sequencing coordinating muscle movements involved speech production children developmental verbal dyspraxia must practice strategies techniques learn order improve addition practice feedback helpful improve apraxia speech tactile feedback touch visual feedback watching self mirror verbal feedback important biofeedback also cited possible therapy functional training involves placing individual speech situations providing himher speech model cause neurological however patients progress cases aac may appropriate dysarthria motor speech disorder results neurological injury stem central damage stem peripheral nerve damage difficulties may encountered respiratory problems vocal fold function velopharyngeal closure orofacial myofunctional disorders refers problems encountered tongue thrusts forward inappropriately speech typical infants children outgrow children continue exaggerate tongue movement may incorrectly produce speech sounds z ʃ tʃ dʒ example word might pronounced treatment omd based upon professionals child present unique oral posture must corrected thus individual interventions vary examples include speech sound disorders may two varieties articulation production sounds phonological processes sound patterns articulation disorder may take form substitution omission addition distortion normal speech sounds phonological process disorders may involve systematic difficulties production particular types sounds made back mouth like k naturally abnormalities speech mechanisms would need ruled medical professional therapies articulation problems must individualized fit individual case placement individual location tongue blow air helpful difficulties certain speech sounds another individual might benefit developing auditory discrimination skills since heshe learned identify error sounds hisher speech generalization learned speech techniques need generalized everyday phonological process treatment hand involve making syntactical errors omissions words cases explicit teaching linguistic rules may cases speech sound disorders example may involve difficulties articulating speech sounds educating child appropriate ways produce speech sound encouraging child practice articulation time may produce natural speech speech sound disorder likewise stuttering single known cause shown effectively reduced eliminated fluency shaping based behavioral principles stuttering modification techniques stuttering disruption fluency individuals speech begins childhood may persist lifetime stuttering form disfluency disfluency becomes problem insofar impedes successful communication two parties disfluencies may due unwanted repetitions sounds extension speech sounds syllables words disfluencies also incorporate unintentional pauses speech individual unable produce speech effectiveness debated treatment programs stuttering behavioral cases individual learns skills improve oral communication abilities controlling monitoring rate speech slps may also help individuals speak slowly manage physical tension involved communication process fluency may developed selecting slow rate speech making use short phrases sentences success speed may increased natural rate smooth speech additionally punishment incorrect speech production eliminated permissive speaking environment encouraged electronic fluency devices alter auditory input provide modified auditory feedback individual shown mixed results research reviews stuttering common phenomenon entirely understood various opposing schools thought emerge describe etiology breakdown theories maintain stuttering result weakening breakdown physical systems necessary smooth speech production cerebral dominance theories stutterer cerebral hemisphere takes neurological lead theories perseveration neurological skipping record sorts breakdown theories auditory monitoring theories suggest stutters hear differently people hear since speakers adjust communication based upon auditory feedback hear speech creates conflict input output process psychoneurotic theories posit repressed needs source stuttering lastly learning theories learn stutter clear etiological position would suggest different intervention leading controversy voice disorders range aphonia loss phonation dysphonia may phonatory andor resonance disorders phonatory characteristics could include breathiness hoarseness harshness intermittency pitch etc resonance characteristics refer overuse underuse resonance chambers resulting hypernasality several examples voice problems vocal cord nodules polyps vocal cord paralysis paradoxical vocal fold movement spasmodic dysphonia vocal cord nodules polyps different phenomena may caused vocal abuse may take form growths bumps swelling vocal cords vocal fold paralysis inability move one vocal cords results difficulties voice perhaps swallowing paradoxical vocal fold movement occurs vocal cords close actually open spasmodic dysphonia caused strained vocal cord movement results awkward voice problems jerkiness nodules polyps present large surgery may appropriate choice removal surgery recommended children however medical treatment may suffice slighter problems induced gastroesophageal reflux disease allergies thyroid problems outside medical surgical interventions professional behavioral interventions useful teaching good vocal habits minimizing abuse vocal cords voice therapy may instruct attention pitch loudness breathing exercises additionally individual may instructed optimal position produce maximum vocal quality bilateral paralysis another disorder may require medical surgical interventions return vocal cords normalcy unilateral paralysis may treated medically paradoxical vocal fold movement pvfm also treated medically behaviorally behavioral interventions focus voice exercises relaxation strategies techniques used support breath generally however pvfm interventions focus helping individual understand triggers episode deal cure spasmodic dysphonia medical psychological interventions alleviate symptoms medical interventions involve repeated injections botox one vocal cords weakens laryngeal muscles results smoother language disorder impairment ability understand andor use words context verbally nonverbally characteristics language disorders include improper use words meanings inability express ideas inappropriate grammatical patterns reduced vocabulary inability follow directions one combination characteristics may occur children affected language learning disabilities developmental language delay children may hear see word able understand meaning may trouble getting others understand trying communicate interventions specific language impairment based upon individual difficulties impairment manifests example child incapable separating individual morphemes units sound speech interventions may take form rhyming tapping syllable comprehension trouble intervention may focus developing metacognitive strategies evaluate hisher knowledge reading reading complete important whatever intervention employed must generalized general education selective mutism disorder manifests child speak least one social setting despite able speak situations selective mutism normally discovered child first starts behavioral treatment plans effective bringing desired communication across settings stimulus fading involves gradual desensitization individual placed comfortable situation environment gradually modified increase stress levels without creating large change stress level shaping relies behavioral modification techniques successive attempts produce speech reinforced selfmodeling techniques may also helpful example selfmodeling video tapes child watches video himherself performing desired action useful additional confounding speech problems exist slp may work student identify factors complicating speech production factors might increasing mute behaviors additionally heshe might work individual

numerous intervention services guided strengths needs determined speech language evaluation areas need may addressed individually one functional alternatively multiple needs may addressed simultaneously intervention techniques possible interventions geared towards goal developing typical communicative interaction end interventions typically follow either preventive remedial compensatory model preventive service model common early intervention technique especially children whose disorders place higher risk developing later communication problems model works lessen
