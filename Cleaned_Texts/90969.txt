cancer center yale stem cell center giraldez specializes understanding newly fertilized egg transforms highlyfunctioning complex animal critical period embryonic development many pathways molecules drive transformation shared across animal species giraldez uses zebrafish model system easily manipulated visualized genetic tools unlock secrets sophisticated egg fertilized must shut maternal

developmental genetics giraldez established laboratory yale continued investigate regulatory code shapes embryonic development using zebrafish model early days laboratory discovered new mechanism microrna processing independent dicer requires catalytic activity argonaute type argonaute pathway required process vertebrates regulate development cellular responses stress work also defined hundreds targets different micrornas embryonic development demonstrating micrornas shape gene expression patterns space giraldez laboratory applied genomic approaches understand translation regulation development using ribosome footprinting lab identified novel translated genes encode micropeptides one regulates cell motility embryogenesis shown alexander bruno laboratories analysis translation giraldezs work uncovered important role codon composition translation regulating mrna stability maternaltozygotic transition across different regulatory layer must conserved based previous discovery yeast jeff coller giraldezs work established concept mrnas differential stability dependent codon composition trna showed importance regulating mrna levels cellular transitions homeostasis work giraldez laboratory explored mechanisms zygotic genome activation lab identified set transcription factors enabled activation large fraction genome fertilization maternal nanog factors involved stem cell maintenance cellular findings offer new understanding genome becomes activated linking cellular developmental reprogramming giraldezs current work involves deciphering posttranscriptional
