cryofibrinogenemia refers condition classified fibrinogen disorder persons blood plasma allowed cool substantially ie normal temperature nearfreezing temperature causing reversible precipitation complex containing fibrinogen fibrin fibronectin occasionally small amounts fibrin split products albumin immunoglobulins plasma proteins return plasma normal temperature resolubilizes cryofibrinogenemia may occur individuals obvious evidence precipitateinduced tissue damage asymptomatic cryofibrinogenemia consequence cryofibrinogen precipitation resulting blood clots small medium

blood plasma individuals cryofibrinogenemia lack fibrinolysis activity normally degrades thereby resolubilizes precipitate hypothesis based findings individuals disorder abnormally high levels one two agents antitrypsin inhibit naturally occurring fibrinolytic agent plasmin blood individuals increased ability procoagulant thrombin bind fibrinogen thereby promote coagulation blood individuals particularly cryofibriognemic disease associated severe disorders high levels immunological elements immunoglobulins immune complexes interact fibronectin promote blood clotting hypothesis based

cryofibrinoginemic disease involved relatively patients limited primarily case reports differ based whether disease primary secondary cases cryofibrinogenemic disease however patients avoid exposure affected body parts cold weather environmental triggers symptoms avoid using cigarettes tobacco products severe cases individuals also risk developing serious thrombotic events lead tissue necrosis may result secondary bacterial infections require intensive antimicrobial therapy andor amputations careful treatment developments success treating primary disease reported using blood clot lysing agents anabolic steroids eg danazol stanozolol longer available united states streptokinase streptodornase anticoagulants heparin warfarin immunosuppressive drug regimens corticosteroid eg prednisone combined either azathioprine chlorambucil moderate cases may well simply avoiding cold exposure treatment corticosteroid plus lowdose aspirin followed maintenance therapy anabolic steroid necessary recommended moderately severe cases severe cases generally require immunosuppressive drug regimen extreme lifethreatening require resorting plasmaphoresis plasma cryofiltration apheresis method remove plasma agents removing coldinduced precipitated material may effective alternative plasmaphoresis plasma exchange still regarded secondline therapy cryofibirnogenemic disease several years following
