mountains near new lootsberg pass karoo basin south africa progalesaurus first described christian sidor roger h smith paper titled new galesaurid therapsida cynodontia lower triassic south africa although specimen progalesaurus found yet sidor smiths findings included many papers permiantriassic extinction event cynodont diversity paleoenvironment south progalesaurus relatively small mammallike creature skull holotype measuring cm likely closely resembled early cynodont relatives walking four legs covered progalesaurus like galesaurus remarkably large nares compared early cynodonts nares formed externally premaxilla maxilla nasal septomaxilla resides inside nares top junction maxilla premaxilla orbit faces anteriorly formed lacrimal prefrontal jugal post orbital post orbital notably deeply forked posterior margin characteristic seen basal cynodonts widely maxilla forms good portion side face dotted small foramina mostly canines foramina likely housed nerves perhaps associated nasal also dotted tiny progalesaurus parietal foramen used light sensing extant posterior parietal foramen parietals fused forming sagittal crest crest narrows posterior foramen like galesaurus cynosaurus unlike derived cynodonts progalesaurus like galesaurus cynosaurus thrinaxodon possesses large zygomatic arch arch posterior view lies foramen associated outer ear tube

preserved well enough conclude lack serration lower canines still sharp enough make conclusions serration lower canines slightly longer upper canines postcanine teeth distinct feature progalesaurus recurved main cusp resembles galesaurus cynosaurus probelesodon however number placement accessory cusps unique upper postcanines poorly preserved teeth wellenough preserved see accessory cusps least

right scapula left atlantal neural spine recovered elements closely resemble progalesaurus galesaurid belonging clade epicynodontia epicynodont progalesaurus belongs greater clade cynodontia cynodonts therapsids turn belong greater group synapsida even broader dvinia procynosuchus cynosaurus galesaurus progalesaurus thrinaxodon platycraniellus cynognathia probainognathia early cynodonts like progalesaurus likely large litters derived cynodonts like tritylodontid found litters far larger modern mammals early cynodonts also preserved juveniles suggesting provided parental care young birth progalesaurus likely burrowed closely related taxa like thrinaxodon galesaurus found burrows making burrowing probably helped triassic cynodonts avoid harsh aboveground conditions shortly permiantriassic extinction early cynodonts even found burrows taxa indicating may cohabitated based tooth shape paleontologists believe early cynodonts like progalesaurus insectivores coprolites fossilized feces cynodonts also found used investigate diet one coprolite million year old cynodont even preserved parasitic nematode eggs earliest evidence pinworms ever progalesaurus lived soon devastating permiantriassic extinction event modern south africa cynodonts potentially even galesaurids like cynosaurus crossed extinction cynodonts may able survive mass extinction due burrowing perhaps living mostly underground would preconditioned burrowers high levels carbon dioxide low levels oxygen present extinction cynodont diversity increased relatively rapidly extinction early triassic period one hottest history earth however climate areas cynodonts discovered temperate high levels carbon dioxide karoo basin progalesaurus discovered evidence suggest area moderately damp
