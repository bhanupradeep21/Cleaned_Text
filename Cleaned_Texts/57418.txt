rounded shoulder posture rsp also known mom posture common postural problem resting position shoulders leans forward body ideal patients usually feel slouched situation deteriorating left untreated study concluded workers aged years right rounded left rounded commonly believed combined improper use digital devices resulted prevalence sedentary lifestyles contribute bad posture symptoms rsp lead upper back stiffness neck stiffness shoulder diagnosed several tests including physical imaging prevent rsp worsening maintaining proper posturecitation needed regular undergoing therapeutic could effective situation worsens patients seek help medical treatments rsp left untreated chronic reduction lung worsened psychosocial likely resulted poor posture cause rounded shoulders muscle uneven weight distribution upper long periods time spent positions put undue strain shoulders neck may wear muscles weakening others instance individual spends long period time sitting positions without stretching chest front arm muscles shorten tighten whereas upper back neck muscles weaken due asymmetry shoulders may roll forward upper back may rounded development rsp often influenced genetics certain inherited traits could possibly impact bone structure muscular strength connective tissue instance people naturally rounded upper back way spinal vertebrae others may naturally muscles upper back neck weaker prone stretching well chest front shoulder muscles resistant stretching connective tissue disorders ehlersdanlos could also alter strength elasticity ligaments risk joint hypermobility instability increased brain detects threat whether physical psychological body prepare react threat also known fight flight response common responses include tensing one jaw contracting abdominal muscles holding one breath hunching one persistent psychological stressors career dissatisfaction financial difficulties family may cause physical changes body like rounded shoulders tension headaches muscle rsp could symptom medical conditions kyphosis scoliosis ankylosing kyphosis spinal disorder contributes excessive curvature upper leading hunched posture rsp scoliosis refers condition sideways curve persons causing shoulders become uneven rounded symptoms rsp include forward head chronic shoulder neck well reduced mobility flexibility hindering ability perform daily activities diagnosis rounded shoulders involves physical examination healthcare professionals assess patient posture range motion strength examination following tests may carried patients instructed stand normally hands sides coracoid process cp sternal notch sn posterolateral angle acromion pla adjacent thoracic vertebral spine ts found distance cp sn distance pla ts measured tape calculate scapular index using formula cp snpla ts ability patient move shoulders upper back complete range assessed medical professionals check restrictions limitations muscle strength testing also utilised evaluate rsp following tests assess strength muscles test strength external rotators shoulders examined including infraspinatus teres minor patients instructed keep forearms bent right angles holding arms sides resistance applied patients patient rotates shoulders middle lower trapezius responsible retracting scapula evaluated test patients instructed pose arms resistance applied patients try pinch shoulder blades together deltoid muscle strength measured patients instructed lift arm away body resistance applied patients attempt raise arm test examiner feel patient upper back neck muscles hands check tightness tension abnormalities imaging tests xrays ct scans scans used determine cause extent rsp examiner able identify areas weakness provide patients targeted exercise regime treatment improve rsp although cause rsp multifactorial two major contributors rsp tightness pectoralis minor muscle weakening lower trapezius scapulothoracic muscle anteriorly originating inserting scapula pectoralis minor function favoring internal downward rotation scapula clinically muscle strength deficits lower trapezius muscles also common clinical finding patients rounded shoulders speculated restrict zygapophyseal extension middle lower thoracic therefore rsp treatment often targets symptoms root causes associated problem areas randomized blinded controlled experimental study concluded physical therapy treatment targeting pectoralis minor soft tissue combined selfstretching significantly improved rounded shoulder commonly applied regimens include mckenzie self therapy exercise consisting repetitive motions mobilization manipulation aid posture correction kendall exercise strengthening deep cervical flexor pectoral muscle correct neck alignment chiropractic adjustments decompression therapy well therapeutic massages also known unlock tight shoulders strengthening chest applying controlled forces spinal joints creating space kneading soft tissues respectively therapeutic treatments address core sources rounded shoulders restore musculoskeletal imbalances realigning spine shoulders prevalence rounded shoulders often linked modern spending long hours sitting front computer hunching mobile one direct preventive measure rounded shoulders consistently maintaining good sitting straight engaging core muscles keep shoulders back help maintain proper alignment prevent shoulders rounding additionally stretching chest muscles strengthening back muscles also help improve exercises strengthen back muscles include rows pullups shoulder blade squeezes exercises like doorway stretches chest help stretch tension contributes rounded shoulders synergistically implementing muscle strengthening stretching effectively prevent development rounded rounded shoulders also prevented taking frequent breaks prolonged sitting engage regular physical activities require arm shoulder motion swimming walking sports help strengthen stretch associated muscles improving posture reducing likelihood developing rounded however left undiagnosed rounded shoulders lead several prolonged complications extent postural abnormality may result significantly increased incidence pain discomfort neck shoulders upper back possibly affects overall health chronic pain discomfort brought persistent tension muscles upper body may negative influence everyday discomfort leads reduced agility range motion making harder accomplish regular chores patients quality life may also significantly impacted unilateral cervicogenic headaches originate musculoskeletal tissue innervated cervical nerves progress frontotemporal orbital lung capacity reduction another issue associated rounded shoulders chest cavity might become constrained shoulders positioned forward making difficult take deep breaths due lowered total lung capacity furthermore secondary muscles inspiration serratus anterior sternocleidomastoid pectoralis minor become weak result kyphotic posture posterior pelvic tilt flatten lumbar atypical breathing patterns arise overactivation secondary muscles inspiration due might lead shortness breath exhaustion making increasingly difficult participate physical rounded shoulders also affect psychosocial mental depression anxiety two prevalent psychological side effects chronic pain individuals chronic pain may anxiety future capacity manage pain well depressive symptoms owing negative effects pain quality life pain properly managed interfering everyday tasks emotions particularly difficult social interactions could also impacted chronic patients chronic pain could find discomfort makes difficult work exercise socialize lead feelings loneliness frustration might exacerbate psychological issues outlined additional reported complications rounded shoulders include poor balance jaw pain migraines issues rsp issue addressed many serious complications chronic pain headaches breathing difficulties result left untreated rsp may also lower one selfesteem confidence atypical appearance prevent correct rsp individuals maintain good posture performing daily tasks take frequent breaks necessary regular exercise also useful strengthening upper back neck muscles postural alignment pain discomfort reduced improve overall health wellbeing prolonged pain discomfort result rounded shoulders reported medical seeking counsel physician physical therapist
