microtubule dynamics important target developing anticancer microtubules composed two globular protein subunits α βtubulin two subunits combine form αβheterodimer assembles filamentous tubeshaped structure tubulin heterodimers arrange head tail manner αsubunit one dimer coming contact βsubunit arrangement results formation long protein fibres called protofilaments protofilaments form backbone hollow cylindrical microtubule nanometers diameter varies nanometers micrometers length protofilaments arrange parallel form cshaped protein sheet curls around give pipelike structure called microtubule head tail arrangement hetero dimers gives polarity resulting microtubule αsubunit one end βsubunit end αtubulin end negative charges βtubulin end positive microtubule grows discrete assembly sites cells called microtubule organizing centers mtocs network microtubule associated proteins two molecules energy rich guanosine triphosphate gtp also important components microtubule

microtubule one end net shortening end involves intrinsic flow tubulin subunits plus end minus end dynamic behaviors important particular microtubule may exhibit primarily dynamic instability treadmilling mixture agents act inhibitors tubulin also act inhibitors cell division microtubule exists continuous dynamic state growing shortening reversible association dissociation αβtubulin heterodimers ends dynamic behavior resulting control length microtubule vital proper functioning mitotic spindle mitosis ie cell division microtubule involved different stages cell cycle first stage prophase microtubules required cell division begins form grow towards newly formed chromosomes forming bundle microtubules called mitotic spindle prometaphase metaphase spindle attaches chromosomes particular point called kinetochore undergoes several growing shortening periods tuning back forth oscillations chromosomes anaphase also microtubules attached chromosomes maintain carefully regulated shortening lengthening process thus presence drug suppress microtubule dynamics sufficient block cell cycle result death cells tubulin inhibitors thus act interfering dynamics microtubule ie growing polymerization shortening depolymerization one class inhibitors operate inhibiting polymerization tubulin form microtubules called polymerization inhibitors like colchicine analogues vinca alkaloids decrease microtubule polymer mass cells high concentration act microtubuledestabilizing agents class inhibitors operate inhibiting depolymerization polymerized tubulin increases microtubule polymer mass cells act microtubulestabilizing agents called depolymerization inhibitors like paclitaxel three classes drugs seems operate slightly different mechanism colchicine analogues blocks cell division disrupting microtubule reported βsubunit tubulin involved colchicine binding binds soluble tubulin form colchicinetubulin complex complex along normal tubulins undergoes polymerization form microtubule however presence tc complex prevents polymerization microtubule complex brings conformational change blocks tubulin dimers addition thereby prevents growth microtubule tc complex slows addition new dimers microtubule disassembles due structural imbalance instability metaphase vinca alkaloids bind βsubunit tubulin dimers distinct region called vincabinding domain bind tubulin rapidly

alkaloids paclitaxel enhances microtubule polymerization promoting nucleation elongation phases polymerization reaction reduces critical tubulin subunit concentration ie soluble tubulin concentration steady state microtubules polymerized presence paclitaxel extremely binding mechanism paclitaxel mimic gtp nucleotide along important differences gtp binds one end tubulin dimer keeping contact next dimer along protofilament paclitaxel binds one side βtubulin keeping contact next protofilament gtp binds unassembled tubulin dimers whereas paclitaxel binding sites located assembled tubulin hydrolysis gtp permits disassembly regulation microtubule system however activation tubulin paclitaxel results permanent stabilization microtubule thus suppression microtubule dynamics described main
