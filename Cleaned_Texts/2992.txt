chinese paleoanthropologist ji qiang persuaded family donate hebei geo university study since stored catalogue number owing skulls history exact provenance thus stratigraphic context age difficult chinese geologist shao qingfeng colleagues performed nondestructive xray fluorescence rareearth element strontium isotope analyses skull various mammalian fossils unearthed around dongjiang bridge determined fossils vicinity likely deposited around time lived region probably originate upper huangshan formation dating thousand years direct dating various points skull yielded wide range dates thousand years ago likely result uranium leaching statistically determined likely minimum age years old exact value difficult determine given exact provenance unidentifiable nonetheless skull

simultaneously published papers ji colleagues declared harbin skull represent new species dubbed homo longi harbin skull quite similar dali skull dali skull discovered given new nomen h sapiens daliensis discoverer wu xinzhi soon thereafter abandoned name consequently middle pleistocene asian humans represent single unique species nomen h daliensis would take priority though recommended resurrecting h daliensis argued h longi sufficiently distinct allocated dali hualong remains often allocated h heidelbergensis convention h daliensis thus claim least two human species inhabited late middle pleistocene one authors chris stringer stated would preferred assigning harbin skull h based conspicuously massive size molars suggested h longi closely related possibly species xiahe mandible
