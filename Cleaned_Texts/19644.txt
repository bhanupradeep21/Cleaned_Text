hepatic hydrothorax rare form pleural effusion occurs people liver cirrhosis defined effusion ml people liver cirrhosis caused heart lung pleural disease found people liver cirrhosis people pleural effusions much common right side cases occurring right left although common people severe ascites people mild ascites condition symptoms specific mostly involve respiratory system condition diagnosed based existence liver cirrhosis fluid buildup abdomen ascites analysis fluid fluid low protein content mainly condition treated medical management diet adjustment usage diuretics cases respond known refractory cases condition treated transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt tips curative treatment liver transplant prognosis usually poor hepatic hydrothorax specific symptoms generally occurs ascites manifestations increased pressure portal vein caused liver disease pleural fluid causes symptoms far easily ascitic fluid due lower volume pleural cavity compared abdominal cavity main symptoms usually related symptoms liver cirrhosis less often may manifestation chronic liver disease symptoms depend many factors effusions volume rate accumulation coexistence cardiopulmonary disease disease may cause symptoms incidentally detected medical scans may cause large pleural effusions result respiratory symptoms like cough shortness breath low blood oxygen respiratory people progressive difficulty breathing reduced tolerance exercise rarely may acute cases accumulate fluid rapidly result circulatory cases main symptoms people cirrhosis respiratory related effusion disease known precise defined mechanism several similar mechanisms behind ascites cases portal medically accepted mechanism low albumin levels blood reduce osmotic increase pressure azygos vein causing leak plasma pleural cavity accepted theory fluid originating ascites travels defects diaphragm pleural cavity defects exist normal population defects usually less cm common right side tendency towards right side could due left side muscular right side tendinous due proximity liver microscope look like discontinuities bundles collagen make tendon part hepatic hydrothorax pressure created ascites thinning diaphragm caused malnutrition cirrhosis cause defects become larger blebs peritoneum herniate defects burst pleuroperitoneal communication created fluid moves abdomen pleural cavity via pressure gradient cavities fluid accumulates faster pleural membranes absorb hepatic hydrothorax noticeable symptoms usually cirrhosis portal affected people show signs endstage liver disease diagnosis involves extracting fluid via thoracentesis fluid analyzed diagnose rule fluid analyzed serum protein albumin lactate dehydrogenase cell count fluid transudate similar fluid found may higher protein albumin content hepatic hydrothorax due pleura absorbing rule heartrelated causes pleural effusion echocardiogram performed pleuroperitoneal communications best detected peritoneal scintigraphy hydrothorax without ascites reported occur many people cirrhosis detected cases via ct scan disease causes leaking ascitic fluid treatment centers around managing ascites cases respond medical management cases condition respond medical management case known refractory hepatic hydrothorax cases first treatment choice insertion transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt curative treatment liver transplant medical management main treatment although simple cheap noninvasive high rate failure comes risk acute kidney injury kidney failure reducing sodium diet usage diuretics may help reduce ascites stop growth effusion goal medical management low sodium diet mmol per day lose kgday cases without edema kgday cases edema usually diet modification enough diuretics next line treatment distal agent loop diuretic used together cause kidneys excrete least meqday sodium via urine amount sodium excreted urine monitored treatment adjust diuretic dosage based cases refractory hepatic hydrothorax definite treatment liver transplant however majority people condition unsuitable transplantation majority die awaiting however treatments improve symptoms increase survival ideally give time liver transplant main treatment refractory hepatic hydrothorax insertion transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt tips tips decompresses portal system reducing portal hypertension ascites estimated work cases however improve prognosis cases endstage liver disease childpugh score greater equal meld score greater higher creatinine levels response tips indicates increased risk cases serious liver dysfunction tips may cause liver failure shunts blood away liver thoracocentesis though typically safe provides temporary benefit fluid tends return possible complications may include pain empyema hemothorax subcutaneous additionally repeat thoracocentesis operations increase risk complications review indicated cumulative risk complications pneumothorax hemothorax approaches cases tips contradicted another treatment option insert indwelling pleural catheter last resort pleurodesis used cases without ascites irritating pleura together repair defects diaphragm however requires multiple procedures general anesthesia additionally amount pleural fluid produced overcome pleurodesis causing complications may include empyema sepsis septic shock chest tubes contradicted cause loss protein infection pneumothorax hemothorax electrolyte imbalances additionally removing may pose challenge fluid tends return prognosis poor mortality rate high median survival time cases condition
