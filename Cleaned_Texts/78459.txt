paleontologist stephan lautenschlager team examined endocasts brain cavity several therizinosaurs including n mckinleyi concluding members well developed senses smell hearing balance mostly useful foraging enlarged forebrain therizinosaurs may also useful complex social behavior predator evasion senses also welldeveloped earlier coelurosaurs theropods indicating therizinosaurs may inherited many traits carnivorous ancestors used different specialized dietary holotype braincase nothronychus mckinleyi reexamined smith colleagues updating numerous basicranial softtissues aspects noted braincase particularly large pneumatic chambers sensorial areas suggesting increased tympanic systems would result optimal low frequency sound reception possibly infrasound complex social behavior enlarged cochlea presence enlarged pneumatic chambers near middle ear also supports insight smith colleagues established average hearing frequency hz upper limits hz stated however estimates could slightly exaggerated also n mckinleyi retained elongated semicircular canals ear related active predatory lifestyle trait indicates therizinosaurids possibly therizinosaurs retained ancestral carnivorous ear suggested erlikosaurus finally based erlikosaurus n mckinleyi may relatively horizontal head posture associated overlapping visual fields binocular vision given orientation horizontal
