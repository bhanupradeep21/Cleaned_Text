immunofluorescence technique used light microscopy fluorescence microscope used primarily biological samples technique uses specificity antibodies antigen target fluorescent dyes specific biomolecule targets within cell therefore allows visualization distribution target molecule sample specific region antibody recognizes antigen called efforts epitope mapping since many antibodies bind epitope levels binding antibodies recognize epitope additionally binding fluorophore antibody interfere immunological specificity antibody binding capacity immunofluorescence widely used example immunostaining using antibodies stain proteins specific example immunohistochemistry use antibodyantigen relationship tissues technique primarily makes use fluorophores visualise location immunofluorescence used tissue sections cultured cell lines individual cells may used analyze distribution proteins glycans small biological nonbiological molecules technique even used visualize

fluorescent staining example use dapi label dna several microscope designs used analysis immunofluorescence samples simplest epifluorescence microscope confocal microscope also widely used various superresolution microscope designs capable much higher resolution also make fluorochromelabeled antibodies fluorochrome must conjugated tagged antibody likewise antigen also conjugated antibody fluorescent probe technique called fluorescent antigen technique staining procedures apply fixed antigen cytoplasm cell surface antigens living cells called membrane immunofluorescence also possible label complement antibodyantigen complex fluorescent probe addition element fluorescence probes attached two general classes immunofluorescence techniques primary secondary following descriptions focus primarily classes terms conjugated two classes immunofluorescence techniques primary direct secondary indirect primary direct immunofluorescence uses single primary antibody chemically linked fluorophore primary antibody recognizes target molecule antigen binds specific region called epitope accomplished process manipulates immune response organism adaptive immunity attached fluorophore detected via fluorescent microscopy depending messenger used emit specific wavelength light direct immunofluorescence although somewhat less common notable advantages secondary indirect procedure direct attachment messenger antibody reduces number steps procedure saving time reducing nonspecific background also limits possibility antibody crossreactivity possible mistakes throughout process however disadvantages exist method since number fluorescent molecules bound primary antibody limited direct immunofluorescence substantially less sensitive indirect immunofluorescence may result false negatives direct immunofluorescence also requires use much primary antibody extremely expensive sometimes running secondary indirect immunofluorescence uses two antibodies unlabeled first primary antibody specifically binds target molecule secondary antibody carries fluorophore recognizes primary antibody binds multiple secondary antibodies bind single primary antibody provides signal amplification increasing number fluorophore molecules per protocol complex timeconsuming primary direct protocol allows flexibility variety different secondary antibodies detection techniques used given primary protocol possible antibody consists two parts variable region recognizes antigen constant region makes structure antibody molecule important realize division artificial reality antibody molecule four polypeptide chains two heavy chains two light chains researcher generate several primary antibodies recognize various antigens different variable regions share constant region antibodies may therefore recognized single secondary antibody saves cost modifying primary antibodies directly carry fluorophore different primary antibodies different constant regions typically generated raising antibody different species example researcher might create primary antibodies goat recognize several antigens employ dyecoupled rabbit secondary antibodies recognize goat antibody constant region rabbit antigoat antibodies researcher may create second set primary antibodies mouse could recognized separate donkey antimouse secondary antibody allows reuse difficulttomake dyecoupled antibodies multiple experiments fluorescence techniques significant problem immunofluorescence photobleaching loss activity caused photobleaching controlled reducing limiting intensity timespan light exposure increasing concentration fluorophores employing robust fluorophores less prone bleaching eg alexa fluors seta fluors dylight fluors problems may arise technique include autofluorescence extraneous undesired specific fluorescence nonspecific fluorescence autofluorescence includes fluorescence emitted sample tissue cell extraneous undesired specific fluorescence occurs targeted antigen impure contains antigenic contaminants nonspecific fluorescence involves loss probes specificity due fluorophore improper fixation dried immunofluorescence limited fixed ie dead cells structures within cell visualized antibodies penetrate cell membrane reacting fluorescent labels antigenic material must fixed firmly site natural localization inside intact antibodies also large dye cancer cells size results slow tumor penetration long circulating halflife research done investigating use diabodies get around proteins supernatant outside cell membrane bound antibodies allows living cells stained depending fixative used proteins interest might become crosslinked could result either false positive false negative signals due nonspecific binding alternative approach using recombinant proteins containing fluorescent protein domains eg green fluorescent protein gfp use tagged proteins allows determination localization live cells even though seems elegant alternative immunofluorescence cells transfected transduced gfptag consequence become least organisms require stricter security standards laboratory technique involves altering genetic information many
