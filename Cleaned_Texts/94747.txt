transcortical motor aphasia usually provided speechlanguage pathologist slp chooses specific therapy tasks goals based speech language abilities needs general individuals tmoa treatment capitalize strong auditory comprehension repetition skills address individuals reduced speech output difficulty initiating maintaining new research aphasia treatment showing benefit life participation approach aphasia lpaa goals written based skills needed individual patient participate specific reallife situations ie communicating effectively nurses gaining based specific needs patient slps provide variety treatment activitiescitation needed improve word retrieval initiation difficulties clinicians may use confrontation naming patient asked name various objects pictures depending severity may also use sentence completion tasks clinician says sentences final words missing expects patient fill limited research suggests nonsymbolic limb movement left side ie tapping left hand table sentence production increase verbal initiations use left arm left space stimulates initiation mechanisms right hemisphere brain also used language allowing individuals produce grammatical sentences higher fluency verbal increase speech output clinician may provide set pictures prompt patient describe elaborate events pictured clinician also provide spoken written words prompt patient use words additionally clinician ask questions based patients experiences opinions general knowledge prompt patient answer phrases sentences work connected speech clinician may ask patient describe procedures making sandwich study found syntax training sentence constructions elicited hierarchy difficulty produced gains grammatically complete utterances utterances successfully communicated novel accurate improve conversational skills slps may engage patient structured conversations supports provided help patient take appropriate conversational turns maintain topic conversation formulate appropriate clinicians often need provide pragmatic guidelines patients responses go beyond clinicians request clinician majority research shows conversation therapy improve percent complex utterances efficiency utterances expressing ideas total time spent talking traditional stimulation order improve patients abilities functionally communicate natural settings slp provide strategies techniques enhance success communicative settings ie supplementing speech nonverbal research supports use reduced syntax therapy help patients overcome nonfluent speech agrammatism often occurs tmoa agrammatism inhibits patients ability form grammatically correct sentences type treatment involves reducing agrammatic deficits teaching patient simplify linguistic structures still conveying message order language used productive additionally may train patients communication partners support conversational abilities patient facilitating use preserved cognitive social functions research supports use various partner training programs supported conversation adults aphasia aphasia program focus put acknowledging patients competence helping reveal competence strategies include saying know know appropriate using gestures supplement messages limiting background noise given sufficient time neuroscience perspective research found dopamine agonist bromocriptine taken mouth provided positive outcomes intervention nonfluent types aphasia tmoa adynamic studies found bromocriptine increased neural networks assist initiation speech individuals possess nonfluent characteristics order capitalize neuroplasticity treatment types aphasia timing intensity duration repetition treatment taken consideration research found aphasia treatment initiated earlier acute postinjury phase effective compared treatment initiated chronic regard intensity duration treatment studies reported maximum recovery occurred intense weekly therapy approximately hours per week delivered month research shows distributed therapy may beneficial high intensity research needed determine best may found ideal duration intensity therapy variable depending patient needs relation types aphasia tmoa occurs less frequently less information general individuals aphasia recovery seen within months stroke injury although recovery may continue following months timeline recovery may look different depending type stroke caused aphasia ischemic stroke recovery greatest within first two weeks diminishes overtime progress stabilizes hemorrhagic stroke patient often shows little improvement first weeks relatively rapid recovery study involving eight patients border zone lesions patients presented transcortical mixed aphasia initially stroke three patients made complete recovery within days poststroke three patients anterior lesions aphasia transitioned tmoa participants study regained full language abilities within months following suggests positive longterm prognosis patients tmoa however might case patients research needed order solidify findings another study found prognosis tmoa affected lesion size smaller lesions typically cause delays speech initiation whereas larger lesions lead profound language abnormalities difficulty abstract language research shown treatment direct effect aphasia intensity duration timing treatment need taken consideration choosing course treatment determining prognosis general greater intensity leads greater duration longerterm treatment produces permanent timing beginning treatment early may difficult system recovered enough intensive therapy beginning late may result missing window opportunity change neuroplasticity brains natural ability reorganize following traumatic event occurs best treatment connects simultaneous events maintains attention taps positive emotion utilizes repetition tasks specific individuals factors affecting prognosis includes location site lesion since lesion results tmoa usually occurs watershed area directly involve areas brain responsible general language abilities prognosis patients good factors determine patients prognosis include age education prior stroke gender motivation
