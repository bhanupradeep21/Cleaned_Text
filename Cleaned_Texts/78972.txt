mainly expressed stomach midgut fig observations longterm feed restriction significantly affect lep expression atlantic also noted teleosts however likely prolonged feed restriction influence several endocrine parameters adapt nutritional condition example common carp rapid response ob gene expression hepatic tissue common carp shortly feeding changes expression response different longterm feeding regime authors suggested effect could explained fact starved fish lose weight rapidly mammals consequence ectothermic possessing much lower standard metabolic rate therefore withstand longer periods starvation similar study grass carp showed chronic injection speciesspecific lep affect longterm food intake body weight acute injection decreased food conversely murashita et al unpublished results observed increased proopiomelanocortin levels following chronic injection lep atlantic salmon suggests chronic exposure elevated lep levels decrease food intake pomc pathway species recent studies

speciesspecific differences longterm leptin regulation appetite growth known however consensus data indicate effects lep appetite regulation may shortterm teleosts recent studies shortterm effects meal absence revealed expression specifically peaks peripheral tissues hr unfed fish suggests transcript specific response could associated absence food conversely since unfed fish received food hr hr peaks could represent unrelated effect peak occurred phase falling plasma lep since occurred fed unfed fish temporal upregulation fact appear specifically related absence food earliest peak occurred white muscle represents important lipid reservoir atlantic unlike pufferfish utilizes liver major lipid atlantic salmon shows despite high visceral lipid content hepatocytes contain lipid droplets compared fish yet important site leptin moen reported peaked hr liver unfed fish contrast however studies common carp demonstrated peak liver hr post feeding earlier expression response leptins common carp likely reflects higher temperature experiments conducted contrasts findings upregulation due absence similarly mice postprandial increase hepatic leptin expression also however grass carp
