urban population disease epidemic crisis became much prevalent seen consequence urban problems arose governments medical professionals time tried get handle spread yet figure actually causes authority scrambled make leaps bounds science track may cause epidemics entire communities would lost grips terrible many outbreaks members medical profession rapidly began trying different cures treat cholera epidemic doctor london thomas latta discovered could greatly increase survival rate patients injecting saline solutions however due wide range medicines touted cures treatments technique failed gain widespread many medical discoveries made century failed gain traction similar reasons increasing circulation mass media little content review medical journals almost anyone without proper education could publish potential cure actual practicing medical professionals also compete ever expanding pharmacy companies ready provide new elixirs promising treatments epidemics emerging medical chaos
