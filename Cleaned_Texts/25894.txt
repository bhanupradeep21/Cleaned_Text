dynapenia pronounced dahynuhpēnēa greek translation poverty strength power force loss muscular strength caused neurological muscular disease typically associated older dynapenia loss muscle strength rather muscle mass preservation muscular strength aging process become increasingly significant increasing life expectancy modern world muscular degeneration occurs throughout aging process one greatest concerns mankind thousands years greeks centuries bc viewed aging chronic incurable progressive disease century bc century ad aging began thought something modifiable resisted cicero essay old age bc states resist old age compensate defects fight would fight disease adopt regimen health practice moderate exercise take enough food drink restore strength cicero also highlights

dynapenia important note dynapenia defined based muscle strength rather muscle power factors perform similarly identifying individuals physical disability poor physical performance recent study bean

equivalent increases muscle strength mobility performance despite difference muscle power also limited amount data muscle power epidemiological studies aging equipment measure muscle strength also readily available equipment used measure muscle together factors justify reasoning behind using muscle strength define dynapenia rather muscle powercitation needed three principal risk factors stand considering preemptive components dynapeniacitation needed possible biological contributors dynapenia include nervous system deteriorating control voluntary skeletal muscle activation decreased number functioning motor nervous systems lowered ability stimulate full muscle contraction subsequently leads loss muscle strength power study harridge et also showed dynapenic subjects incomplete voluntary activation maximum contraction suggesting loss voluntary muscle activation plays important role loss muscle strength studies involving dissection cadavers uncovered decrease cell body size neurons found premotor cortex compared younger new studies recently verified finding living subjects using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging recent evidence suggests aging also related loss myelinated nerve fiber length mass white matter individuals losing approximately total nerve fiber length changes develop aging process affect connectivity cortex within well connectivity rest central nervous another potential contributor dynapenia disruption process converts electrical signal given muscular activation actual contraction particularly impairments release calcium sarcoplasmic reticulum suggested explain decreased muscle quality prevalent older systematic review literature regarding relationship type ii muscle fiber loss aging found total number fibers vastus lateralis

also suggested nutritional factors may contribute onset dynapenia proposed low levels vitamin associated lower levels muscle strength activity vitamin receptors muscle found decrease aging receptors initiate nuclear response leading de novo synthesis however results multiple studies relation vitamin muscle strength highly controversial making effect vitamin muscle strength need investigation recommended dietary allowance rda protein clear older adults may underestimate amount protein needed maintain optimal physical function age study houston colleagues showed decreased protein intake may

physiological mechanisms nervous skeletal muscle systems even late life recent studies peterson et uncovered two critical aspects resistance training must implemented training process achieve positive
