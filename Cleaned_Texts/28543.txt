hadrosaurids also commonly referred duckbilled dinosaurs hadrosaurs large terrestrial herbivores diet hadrosaurid dinosaurs remains subject debate among paleontologists especially regarding whether hadrosaurids grazers fed vegetation close ground browsers ate highergrowing leaves twigs preserved stomach content findings indicated may browsers whereas studies jaw movements indicate may grazers mouth hadrosaur hundreds tiny teeth packed dental batteries teeth continually replaced new hadrosaur beaks used cut food either stripping believed hadrosaurs cheeks order keep food researchers long believed unusual mouth mechanics may played role evolutionary however lack complex flexible lower jaw joint todays mammals difficult scientists determine exactly hadrosaurs broke food without understanding impossible form complete understanding late cretaceous ecosystems affected extinction event million years also remained unclear exactly hadrosaurids ate particular never definitively proven whether hadrosaurs grazers ate vegetation close ground like modernday sheep cows whether dinosaurs browsers ate highergrowing leaves twigs like todays deer study university leicester researchers analyzed hundreds microscopic scratches teeth fossilized edmontosaurus jaw determined hadrosaurs unique way eating unlike creature living today contrast flexible lower jaw joint prevalent todays mammals hadrosaur unique hinge upper jaws rest skull team found dinosaurs upper jaws pushed outwards sideways chewing lower jaw slid upper teeth coprolites fossilized droppings late cretaceous hadrosaurs show animals sometimes deliberately ate rotting wood wood nutritious decomposing wood would contained fungi decomposed wood material detrituseating invertebrates would first hadrosaur finds

amphibious eaters aquatic plants became ingrained first possible case hadrosaur gut contents described found made terrestrial plants author made point noting specimen established hadrosaurs could eat land plants well water early study hadrosaurid dietary adaptations feeding behavior summarized monograph richard swann lull nelda wright unlike previous authors moved away soft water plants major part diet retained interpretation amphibious lifestyle drew attention extensive development hadrosaurid dental batteries compared dental equipment horses noting advantage dinosaurs continual replacement teeth however found purpose dental batteries uncertain hadrosaur jaws unlike modern reptiles appear evolutionary pressure hadrosaurids like grasses horses lull wright eliminated soft plants primary choice diet eliminated grasses grounds beak unlike grazing birds like geese quantity available grasses appeared insufficient feed hadrosaurids instead proposed equisetaleans horsetails major food source plants existed times places hadrosaurids known rich starch contain abrasive silica would necessitate teeth could replaced softer land water plants proposed secondary foods lull wright found proposed feeding ecology comparable modern moose browses trees feeds water plants wetlands interpreted complex anatomy hadrosaurid snouts nasal passages adaptations feeding underwater like lull wright added new element hadrosaurid feeding proposing presence muscles analogous mammalian cheek muscles would hold food chopped teeth muscles would attached bony ridges present upper lower jaws authors interpreted action jaws limited simple motions finding motion unlikely based skull articulation vertical motion would cut food short lengths pieces would retained cheeks manipulated food cheeks authors inferred presence welldeveloped general preexisting consensus hadrosaurid paleobiology challenged john ostrom found little evidence support either diet aquatic plants amphibious lifestyle unlike previous depictions interpreted hadrosaurids terrestrial foragers browsed land plants aquatic plants like lull wright drew attention robust dental batteries found hard resistant foods likely diet woody fibrous materials unlike lull wright interpreted hadrosaur jaws using complex grinding motion comment possibility cheeks drawing older proposal made study hadrosaur specimen preserved beak noted possibility animals stripped leaves shoots branches closing beak branches pulling back terrestrial diet also supported gut content study found conifer needles twigs seeds fruits inside specimen also circumstantial evidence terrestrial feeding ostrom found hadrosaurid skeletal anatomy indicated animals move land ossified tendons along vertebral spines would hindered swimming also reported aquatic plant pollen rare rock units hadrosaurids known indicates aquatic plants david b weishampel proposed new hypothesis hadrosaurids fed study sutures bones fossil skulls concluded ornithopods group birdhipped dinosaurs includes hadrosaurids flexible upper jaws lower jaw clamped shut pressure would spread outward sides upper jaw upper teeth would grind lower teeth like rasps trapping plants grinding theory remained largely unproven study purnell williams barrett science magazine called strongest independent evidence yet unique jaw however group american canadian researchers led vertebrate paleobiologist natalia rybczynski replicated weishampels proposed chewing motion using computerized threedimensional animation model rybczynski et al believe weishampels model may viable

concluded september animal likely browser study exactly hadrosaur broke ate food conducted vince williams graduate student university leicester paul barrett paleontologist londons natural history museum mark purnell british paleontologist geology department university three men employed new approach analyze feeding mechanisms dinosaurs thus help understand place prehistoric chewing solid food always leaves tiny scratches teeths surfaces trio believed looking size orientation markings hadrosaurid teeth would able learn movements purnell said although believed form study could help determine hadrosaur ate said previous studies ever employed type williams barrett purnell conducted study using jaws edmontosaurus hadrosaurid lived million years ago united states canada specific edmontosaurus jaw used study collected late cretaceous rocks found united individual teeth jaw contained multiple hundreds microscopic scratches preserved intact fossilization researchers carefully cleaned jaws molded coated gold make detailed replica tooth surface used scanning electron microscope give highpower magnification scratches study conducted threedimensional statistical analysis direction study found hadrosaur chewed using method completely different creature living utilized type jaw study found edmontosaurus jaw four different sets parallel scratches running different directions purnell concluded set scratches related specific jaw movement revealed movement hadrosaurs complex employed movement several different directions including upanddown fronttoback sideways movements trio concluded contrast flexible lower jaw joint prevalent modern mammals hadrosaur hinge upper jaws rest according study hadrosaur would push upper jaws outwards sideways lower teeth slid upper tooth surfaces slid sideways across food would ground shredded purnell said style eating scissorlike movement seems dinosaurs invented way although upperjaw teeth hinged outward hadrosaur ate purnell said likely dinosaur could still chew mouth closed outward flexure upper jaws might visible purnell said chewing likely concealed hadrosaurs cheeks probably looked quite study also made conclusions hadrosaurids ate although purnell cautioned conclusions hadrosaurs diet little less secure good evidence motions teeth relative scratches found individual tooth equal measuring area one square millimeter enough sample whole jaw team concluded evenness scratches suggested hadrosaur used series jaw motions result study determined hadrosaur diet probably made leaves lacked bulkier items twigs stems might required different chewing method created different wear lack pit marks teeth also upheld conclusions suggested hadrosaurs likely grazed lowlying vegetation lacked pits rather browsing highergrowing vegetation scratches also indicated hadrosaurs food contained either small particles grit normal vegetation cropped close ground contained microscopic granules silica common grasses evolved late cretaceous period particularly common study concluded probably play major component hadrosaurs diet instead believed horsetails common plant time containing characteristics probably important food results study published online june proceedings national academy sciences official journal united states national academy sciences study published title quantitative analysis dental

change better understand changes going pan lawrence witmer paleontologist ohio university college osteopathic medicine athens called study one best microwear papers ive seen although said yet convinced hadrosaurid upper jaw could hypothesis hadrosaurs likely grazers rather browsers appears contradict previous findings preserved stomach contents found fossilized guts previous hadrosaurs response findings purnell said preserved stomach contents questionable necessarily represent usual diet alan boyle journalist msnbc science editor reported teams findings said apparent contradictions williams et als study previous stomach content findings subject debate necessarily render williams et als study irrelevant incorrect specifically boyle said claims grazing vs browsing certainly conclusive researchers surmise likely williams et als hypothesis hadrosaurids grazers ate vegetation close ground rather browsing highergrowing leaves twigs would also contradict portrayal hadrosaurs
