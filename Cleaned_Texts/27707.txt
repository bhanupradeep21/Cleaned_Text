nearly neutral theory molecular evolution modification neutral theory molecular accounts fact mutations either deleterious ignored else neutral slightly deleterious mutations reliably purged selection coefficient greater one divided effective population size larger populations higher proportion mutations exceed threshold genetic drift overpower selection leading fewer fixation events slower molecular evolution nearly neutral theory proposed tomoko ohta populationsizedependent threshold purging mutations called drift barrier michael lynch used explain differences genomic architecture among species according neutral theory molecular evolution rate molecular changes accumulate species equal rate neutral mutations hence relatively constant across species however pergeneration rate since larger organisms longer generation times neutral theory predicts rate molecular evolution slower however molecular evolutionists found rates protein evolution fairly independent generation time noting population size generally inversely proportional generation time tomoko ohta proposed amino acid substitutions slightly deleterious would increase rate effectively neutral mutation rate small populations could offset effect long generation times however noncoding dna substitutions tend neutral independent population size rate evolution correctly predicted depend population size generation time unlike rate nonsynonymous case faster rate neutral evolution proteins expected small populations due lenient threshold purging deleterious mutations offset longer generation times vice versa large populations short generation times noncoding dna evolves faster protein evolution retarded selection significant drift large ohta published short letter suggesting wide variety molecular evidence supported theory mutation events molecular level slightly deleterious rather strictly neutral early many studies molecular evolution used shift model negative effect fitness population due
