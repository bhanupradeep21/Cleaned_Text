test administration psychotropic drugs taking aims consistently help track severity td tardive dyskinesia first described shortly introduction chlorpromazine antipsychotic however exact mechanism disorder remains largely uncertain compelling line evidence suggests tardive dyskinesia may result primarily neurolepticinduced dopamine supersensitivity nigrostriatal pathway dopamine receptor affected neuroleptics act primarily dopamine system older neuroleptics greater affinity binding site associated high risk tardive hypersensitivity hypothesis also supported evidence relationship withdrawal effects studies agonists antagonists animal studies genetic polymorphism given similar doses neuroleptic differences among individuals still exist likelihood developing tardive dyskinesia individual differences may due genetic polymorphisms code receptor binding site affinity prior exposure environmental toxins decreased functional reserve cognitive dysfunction associated aging intellectual disability alcohol drug use traumatic head injuries also shown increase risk developing disorder among treated antipsychotic drugs sometimes camouflage signs tardive dyskinesia occurring early stages happen individual increased dose antipsychotic drug often symptoms tardive dyskinesia apparent individual comes antipsychotic drugs however tardive dyskinesia worsens signs become dopamine antagonists antiemetics cause tardive dyskinesia metoclopramide promethazine used treat gastrointestinal disorders atypical antipsychotics considered lowerrisk causing td typical counterparts incidence rates respectively shortterm trials primarily utilising haloperidol typical quetiapine clozapine considered lowest risk agents precipitating reported cases antipsychotic medication aripiprazole partial agonist receptors leading tardive reports tardive dyskinesia aripiprazole grown available research seems suggest concurrent prophylactic use neuroleptic antiparkinsonian drug useless avoid early extrapyramidal sideeffects may render person sensitive tardive dyskinesia since use drugs found associated development tardive increased risk tardive dyskinesia associated smoking although negative study seems cigarette smokeexposuredependent risk td people antipsychotictreated elderly people also heightened risk developing females organic brain injuries diabetes mellitus negative symptoms td also common experience acute neurological side effects antipsychotic drug racial discrepancies td rate also exist africans african americans higher rates td exposure certain genetic risk factors td identified including polymorphisms genes encoding prevention tardive dyskinesia achieved using lowest effective dose neuroleptic shortest time however diseases chronic psychosis schizophrenia strategy must balanced fact increased dosages neuroleptics beneficial preventing recurrence psychosis tardive dyskinesia diagnosed causative drug discontinued tardive dyskinesia may persist withdrawal drug months years even studies suggest practitioners consider using atypical antipsychotics substitute typical antipsychotics people requiring medication agents associated fewer neuromotor side effects lower risk developing tardive studies tested use melatonin high dosage vitamins different antioxidants concurrence antipsychotic drugs often used treat schizophrenia way preventing treating tardive dyskinesia although research needed studies reported much lower percentage individuals developing tardive dyskinesia current rate people taking antipsychotic tentative evidence supports use vitamin e valbenazine approved fda tardive dyskinesia april tetrabenazine dopamine depleting drug sometimes used treat tardive dyskinesia movement disorders eg huntingtons deutetrabenazine isotopic isomer tetrabenazine approved fda tardive dyskinesia august vitamin reported effective treatment td two randomised doubleblind placebocontrolled overall evidence effectiveness considered clonidine may also useful treatment td although doselimiting hypotension sedation may hinder botox injections used minor focal dystonia advanced tardive evidence insufficient support use benzodiazepines baclofen progabide sodium valproate gaboxadol calcium channel blockers eg tardive dyskinesia commonly occurs people psychiatric conditions treated antipsychotic medications many years average rate people affected estimated around individuals taking antipsychotic medication used treat study conducted yale university school medicine estimated people develop persistent tics years major tranquilizers years drastic data found longitudinal study conducted individuals years age older taking antipsychotic drugs according research study people developed tardive dyskinesia one year medication another atrisk group developed disorder years developed severe cases tardive dyskinesia within according estimates majority people eventually develop disorder remain drugs long elderly people prone develop tardive dyskinesia elderly women atrisk elderly men risk much lower younger men women also equal across several studies recently conducted comparing number people affected tardive dyskinesia second generation modern antipsychotic drugs first generation drugs newer antipsychotics appear substantially reduced potential causing tardive dyskinesia however studies express concern number people affected decreased far less expected cautioning overestimation safety modern practitioner evaluate diagnose person tardive dyskinesia conducting systematic examination practitioner ask person relax look symptoms like facial grimacing eye lip movements tics respiratory irregularities tongue movements cases people experience nutritional problems practitioner also look gain loss apart underlying psychiatric disorder tardive dyskinesia may cause afflicted people become socially isolated also increases risk body dysmorphic disorder bdd even lead suicide emotional physical stress increase severity dyskinetic movements whereas relaxation sedation opposite httpsenwikipediaorgwikitardivedyskinesia
