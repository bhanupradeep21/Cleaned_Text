beta blockers also spelled βblockers class medications predominantly used manage abnormal heart rhythms arrhythmia protect heart second heart attack first heart attack secondary also widely used treat high blood pressure although longer first choice initial treatment beta blockers competitive antagonists block receptor sites endogenous catecholamines epinephrine adrenaline norepinephrine noradrenaline adrenergic beta receptors sympathetic nervous system mediates fightorflight block activation types βadrenergic receptors others selective one three known types beta receptors designated receptors located mainly heart receptors located mainly lungs gastrointestinal tract liver uterus vascular smooth muscle skeletal receptors located fat beta receptors found cells heart muscles smooth muscles airways arteries kidneys tissues part sympathetic nervous system lead stress responses especially stimulated epinephrine adrenaline beta blockers interfere binding receptor epinephrine stress hormones weaken effects stress hormones james synthesized first clinically significant beta pronethalol revolutionized medical management angina considered many one important contributions clinical

heart influence system kidneys beta blockers cause decrease renin secretion turn reduces heart oxygen demand lowering extracellular volume increasing oxygencarrying capacity blood heart failure characteristically involves increased catecholamine activity heart responsible several deleterious effects including increased oxygen demand propagation inflammatory mediators abnormal cardiac tissue
