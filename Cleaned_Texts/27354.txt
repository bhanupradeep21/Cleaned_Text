agents used treat hyperlipidemia condition comes high cholesterol levels bile acid sequestrants nicotinic acid fibric acid derivatives probucol hmgcoareductase inhibitors cerivastatin mainly acts competitively inhibiting hmgcoareductase ratelimiting enzyme step cholesterol occurs mevalonate pathway liver hydroxylmethylglutaryl converted mevalonate cerivastatin synthetic enantiomerically pure inhibitor reductase meaning fit enzymes active site therefore compete substrate hmgcoa native substrate due competition rate mevalonate production enzyme reduced also means rates subsequent biosynthesis reduced since less starting material available eventually lead lower cholesterol levels location cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition hmgcoa significance since circulating cholesterol originates internal production rather diet liver produce cholesterol cholesterol levels blood decrease also hmgcoareductase inhibitors cause secondary upregulation hepatic ldl receptors increased ldlcholesterol clearance reduction total ldl cholesterol serum cerivastatin metabolized via hepatic vitro studies human liver cells showed two metabolic pathways equally important demethylation benzylic methyl ether hydroxylation one methyl group demethylation catalysed enzymes generates metabolite known cerivastatin metabolite pathway hydroxylation catalysed generates major active metabolite like cerivastatin pharmacologically active comparable potencies combination latter leads another minor metabolite detectable plasma also known following mg dose cerivastatin mean steady
