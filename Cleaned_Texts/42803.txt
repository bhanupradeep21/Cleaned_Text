exacerbate cmt well severe emotional stress patients cmt must avoid periods prolonged immobility recovering secondary injury prolonged periods limited mobility drastically accelerate symptoms pain due postural changes skeletal deformations muscle fatigue cramping fairly common people cmt mitigated treated physical therapies surgeries corrective assistive devices analgesic medications may also needed therapies provide relief neuropathic pain often symptom cmt though like symptoms cmt presence severity vary case case people pain significant severe interfere daily life activities however pain experienced people cmt neuropathic pain present symptom cmt comparable seen peripheral neuropathies well postherpetic neuralgia complex regional pain syndrome among disease caused genetic mutations cause defects neuronal proteins nerve signals conducted axon myelin sheath wrapped around mutations cmt affect myelin sheath affect cmt heterogeneous disease mutations linked may occur number different based affected gene cmt categorized several types common cause cmt cases duplication large region short arm chromosome includes gene mutations affect gene chromosome codes mitochondrial protein mutated causes mitochondria form large clusters clots unable travel axon towards synapses prevents synapses cmt also produced xlinked mutations named xlinked cmt cmtx cmtx mutated connexons create nonfunctional gap junctions interrupt molecular exchange signal mutation appear gene coding connexin protein gap junction protein expressed schwann cells protein also present oligodendrocytes demyelination appear schwann cells create myelin sheath wrapping plasma membrane around neurons schwann cells fibroblasts work together create functional nerve schwann cells neurons exchange molecular signals gap junctions regulate survival differentiationcitation needed demyelinating schwann cells causes abnormal axon structure function may cause axon degeneration may simply cause axons myelin sheath allows nerve cells conduct signals faster myelin sheath damaged nerve signals slower measured common neurological test electromyography axon damaged though results reduced compound muscle action axonal neuropathy types typically referred axonal neuropathies due axonal degeneration observed types result damage nerve axons rather damage myelin sheath case damaged axons cause slowed transmission signals muscles brain causing symptoms including muscle atrophy weakness decreased sensitivity foot deformity symptoms types typically appear ages one type forms diagnosed sensory deficits loss sensation due degradation sensory axons observed along motor deficits otherwise distal hereditary motor neuropathy type v diagnosed unknown sensory involvement varied neuropathy symptoms include foot deformity muscle weakness cramping compromised reflexes loss sensation muscle atrophy similar symptoms types symptoms severity vary patient mice often used model typically demonstrate aberrant neuromuscular function neuromuscular junction neuromuscular junction abnormal mice subjects showing neuromuscular junction degeneration hind muscles dorsal root ganglia drg also affected via aberrant sensory neuron fate meaning sensory neuron cell fates abnormally determined mice fewer proprioceptive mechanosensitive neurons nociceptive neurons possibly due mutant glyrs aberrantly interacting extracellular region tropomyosin receptor kinase trk trk receptors crucial survival development sensory neurons disrupted nerve development survival disrupted well possibly leading abnormal sensory neuron counts observed result autosomal dominant mutations human gene located thought caused aberrant gainoffunction missense gene proteincoding gene responsible encoding glycyltrna synthetase glyrs glycyltrna synthetase class ii aminoacyltrna synthetase acts catalyst synthesis glycyltrna covalently bonding amino acids corresponding cognate trnas protein translation glycyltrna synthetase integral protein translation attaches glycine cognate many different mutations found patients remains unclear mutations cause however thought mutant glycyltrna synthetase glyrs interferes transmembrane receptors causing motor mutations gene could disrupt ability glyrs interact cognate rna disrupting protein production mutations present cause deficient amount glycyltrna cells preventing elongation phase protein synthesis elongation key step protein production ribosomes unable continue protein synthesis glycine sites mutations also stall initiation translation glycine addition failure causes stress response stalls protein production preventing initiation translation stalling elongation initiation translation mutations gene cause translational repression meaning overall translation axonal neuropathy progressive meaning worsens time unknown mechanisms thought cause chronic neurodegeneration resulting aberrant glyrs however one theory disease vegfdeficiency mutant glysrs interferes neuronal transmembrane receptors including neuropilin vascular endothelial growth factor vegf causing mutations alter glyrs allow bind receptor interfering normal binding vegf enhanced expression vegf improves motor function reduced expression worsens binds mutant glyrs mutant individuals expression reduced turn worsening motor function mice deficient vegf demonstrate motorneuron disease time thus pathway considered targetable cmt diagnosed three different forms tests measurement speed nerve impulses nerve conduction studies biopsy nerve dna testing dna testing give definitive

maintain movement muscle strength flexibility therefore interprofessional team approach occupational therapy ot physical therapy pt orthotist podiatrist orthopedic surgeon pt typically focuses musclestrength training muscle stretching aerobic exercise ot provide education energy conservation strategies activities daily living physical therapy involved designing exercise program fits persons personal strengths flexibility bracing also used correct problems caused cmt orthotist may address gait abnormalities prescribing use orthoticscitation needed appropriate footwear also important people cmt often difficulty finding wellfitting shoes higharched feet hammertoes due lack good sensory reception feet cmt patients may also need see podiatrist assistance trimming nails removing calluses develop pads feet lastly patients also decide surgery performed podiatrist orthopedic surgeon surgery may help stabilize patients feet correct progressive problems procedures include straightening pinning toes lowering arch sometimes fusing ankle joint provide cmt patients must take extra care avoid falling fractures take longer heal someone underlying disease process additionally resulting inactivity may cause cmt association classifies chemotherapy drug vincristine definite high risk states vincristine proven hazardous avoided cmt patients including several corrective surgical procedures done improve physical condition affected muscles lower extremities weak makes sense prescribe customfabricated orthotics depending muscle groups affected correct orthoses
