menstruation reversible number medical conditions fewer menstrual periods less blood loss may addition suppression hormonal cyclicity may benefit menstrualrelated mood swings conditions increase frequency management menstruation may challenge developmental delay intellectual disability menstrual suppression benefit individuals specific job activityrelated increasing attention given menstrual suppression transgender men nonbinary transmasculine people may experience dysphoria menstrual suppression also used individuals variety personal reasons less frequent menses including honeymoon vacations travel specific reasons options menstrual suppression include hormonal medications like extended cycle combined hormonal contraceptive pills progestogenonly contraceptives including progestogenonly pills progestogencontaining implants progestogencontaining intrauterine devices progestogenonly injectable contraceptives gonadotropinreleasing hormone modulators testosterone well surgical options hysterectomy removal uterus endometrial ablation removal options suppression menstrual bleeding immediately effective many options unscheduled bleeding termed breakthrough bleeding

nonbinary transmasculine people may experience dysphoria menses thus may request medical therapy menstrual use hormonal methods containing estrogen combined oral contraceptives contraceptive patch contraceptive ring may associated risks outweigh benefits individuals specific medical problems migraine headaches aura history breast cancer history deep vein thus options would contraindicated menstrual suppression conditions progestinonly options depot medroxyprogesterone acetate oral progestins appropriate individuals drugdrug interactions also important consider particularly combined hormonal optionscitation needed extended cycle regimens combined hormonal contraceptives provide greater cumulative dose steroid hormones questions raised safety data currently provide reassurance options forms birth control affect menstrual cycle hormonal contraceptives work disrupting progestogen negative feedback decreases pulse frequency gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh release

progestogen negative feedback lack estrogen positive feedback lh release prevent midcycle lh surge inhibition follicular development absence lh surge prevent use combined hormonal contraceptives pill patch vaginal ring methods contraception contain estrogen progestogen methods traditionally used cyclic fashion three weeks days hormones followed hormonefree interval combined oral contraceptives often week placebo pills time withdrawal bleeding hormonallyinduced menstrual period occurs mimicking idealized spontaneous menstrual methods taken without hormonefree week withdrawal bleeding reduced eliminated thus extended cycle combined hormonal contraceptive pills commonly used menstrual suppression although breakthrough bleeding common initial months use rate amenorrhea bleeding range users continuing use combined hormonal contraceptive pills end year combined hormonal contraceptives include estrogen progestogen estrogen negative feedback anterior pituitary greatly decreases release fsh makes combined hormonal contraceptives effective inhibiting follicular development preventing ovulation estrogen also reduces incidence irregular breakthrough several combined hormonal pill vaginal ring contraceptive usually used way causes regular withdrawal bleeding normal cycle menstruation occurs estrogen progesterone levels drop temporarily discontinuing use combined hormonal contraceptives placebo week using patch ring week similar effect causing uterine lining shed withdrawal bleeding desired combined hormonal contraceptives may taken continuously although increases risk breakthrough bleedingmedical citation needed progestogenonly medications including progestogenonly pills slowrelease depot injectable medication depot medroxyprogesterone acetate dmpa depoprovera contain estrogen

injections dmpa became available later became used also achieve amenorrhea majority patients achieve amenorrhea within year initiating dmpa therapy dmpa therapy typically successful achieving amenorrhea also side effects decreased bone mineral density must considered beginning using subdermal progestogenonly implants unpredictable bleeding continues amenorrhea commonly achieved amongst progestogenonly contraceptive pills sometimes called mini pill taken continuously without span using placebo pills therefore menstrual periods less likely occur combined pill placebo pills however disturbance menstrual cycle common minipill onethird onehalf women taking experience prolonged periods experience breakthrough bleeding metrorrhagia irregular prolonged bleeding common reason women discontinue using mini hormonal iuds containing progestogen levonorgestrel side effect inducing amenorrhea types iuds shown markedly decrease menstrual blood loss thus efficacious treating heavy abnormal menstrual rate amenorrhea one year use range although users hormonal iuds mirena liletta experience marked decrease menstrual bleeding beneficial led reported high rates user satisfaction levonorgestrel iuds also used shown induce amenorrhea lower dose device lower rate achieving amenorrhea compared higher dose device users found achieve amenorrhea within year use concern usage devices invasive administration initial breakthrough bleeding utilizing devices however advantage infrequent dosing schedule every years use iuds also shown reduce menorrhagia gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh modulators including gnrh agonists gnrh antagonists associated amenorrhea used induce therapeutic amenorrhea among oncologists caring adolescents cancer gnrh modulators commonly recommended
