sensory gating describes neural processes filtering redundant irrelevant stimuli possible environmental stimuli reaching brain also referred gating filtering sensory gating prevents overload information higher cortical centers brain sensory gating also occur different forms changes perception sensation affected various factors arousal recent stimulus exposure selective although sensory gating largely automatic also occurs within context attention processing brain selectively seeks goalrelevant previous studies shown correlation sensory gating different cognitive functions yet solid evidence implying relationship sensory gating cognitive functions modalityindependent cocktail party effect illustrates brain inhibits input environmental stimuli still processing sensory input attended stimulus cocktail party effect demonstrates sensory gating hearing senses also go process protecting primary cortical areas overwhelmed information sensory receptors make way brain neurons synapse thalamus pulvinar nuclei thalamus plays major role attention major role filtering unnecessary information regards sensory gating proven clinical study found two stimuli transported within clicks seconds pairs known generate trace memory lingers presumably hippocampal region arrives later compared first stimuli gets inhibited provided new information commonly referred auditory stimuli caused machines used test sensory gating pulvinar nuclei thalamus function gatekeeper deciding information inhibited sent cortical cns central nervous system pulvinar nuclei deems information irrelevant acts essential inhibitory mechanism prevents information flowing higher cortical centers sensory gating mediated network brain involves auditory cortex ac prefrontal cortex hippocampus well olfactory cortex plays part sensory gating phenomenon areas brain associated sensory gating include amygdala striatum medial prefrontal cortex midbrain dopamine cell region gabaergic neurons research sensory gating primarily occurring cortical areas stimulus consciously identified less invasive means studying sensory gating studies rats also show brain stem thalamus primary auditory cortex play role sensory gating auditory pairedclick paradigm common noninvasive technique used measure sensory gating type eventrelated potential normal sensory gating person hears pair clicks within ms one another person gate second click perceived redundant evidence gating seen wave occurring brain ms click low values wave indicate sensory gating occurred high values wave indicate lack sensory gating individuals schizophrenia reduce amplitude whereas individuals without schizophrenia reduce amplitude electroencephalography eeg magnetoencephalographies meg used measure brain responses common techniques studying sensory gating one type eeg measure used sensory gating research eventrelated potential erp eeg research sensory gating shows gating starts almost immediately receiving stimulus positron emission tomography pet studies shown increased need gate information accompanied increased engagement thalamus wave testing one many auditory eventrelated potential studies large interest sensory gating research directed improving deficits among people diagnosed schizophrenia people schizophrenia often deficits gating neuronal response wave widespread method diagnosis test conducted patients hear two uniform sounds interval milliseconds patients hearing sound eeg cap used measure brain activity response sounds normal subject shows decrease brain activity hearing second sound subject showing equal brain activity first sound likely schizophrenia since people schizophrenia often overload attended stimuli wave may serve critical role illuminating sensory gating neurological currently test conducted mice results identical human subjects brain activity decreased second sound second experiment scientists placed internal electrodes auditory regions brain found time second sound occurred drop brain activity already initiated brainstem discovery filter effect activating soon brainstem perceives sound carried mice deletion syndrome syndrome associated schizophrenia continuing study verified suggests filter system indeed brainstem offering hope finding neurological source schizophrenia ptsd also exhibit impaired sensory gating compared generalized anxiety disorder control groups ptsd show high sensory hyperactivity impaired sensory studies effect ptsd gating produced mixed results finding similar pattern finding limited auditory stimulation others finding impaired gating also one reason people report like smoking cigarettes nicotines ability aid selective nicotine causes receptors release nitric oxide slows sensory inhibition causing suppression subsequent stimuli due effect nicotine correct sensory gating deficits individuals schizophrenia individuals schizophrenia smoke although effects last minutes since nicotine receptors desensitize quickly selfmedication present among attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder even autism spectrum well research shows evidence connection sensory gating creative thinking one experiment conducted suggests socalled leaky attention spans people high levels psychopathology may lead increased creativity study researchers discovered creative people tend show reduced sensory gating filtering sound less normal subjects reduced ability inhibit secondary information caused wider range unfiltered stimuli come conscious brain enabling creative person integrate different ideas rendering creative thinking experiment carried participants whose creativity measured recording achievements conducting divergent thinking test sensory gating measured eeg auditory clicks results proved people creative achievements indeed show reduced latent inhibition compared average subjects thus study showed evidence correlation creativity sensory gating reduced filtering proving mechanism
