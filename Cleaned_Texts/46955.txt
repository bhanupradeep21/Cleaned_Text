indication common materials used dental impressions impressions also described mucostatic mucocompressive defined impression material used type impression tray used ie spaced closely adapted mucostatic means impression taken mucosa normal resting position impressions generally lead denture good fit rest chewing denture tend pivot around incompressible areas eg torus palatinus dig compressible areas mucocompressive means impression taken mucosa subject compression impressions generally lead denture stable function rest dentures rest time could argued mucostatic impressions make better dentures however reality likely tissue adaption presence either denture made mucostatic mucocompressive technique make little difference two long term another type impression technique

blended together stainless steel spatula clarident spatula paper pad zincoxide eugenol plaster produce mucostatic impression agar material provides high accuracy therefore used fixed prosthodontics crowns bridges dental model duplicated dental technician agar true hydrophilic material hence teeth need dried placing reversible hydrocolloid means physical state changed altering temperature allows reuse material multiple times material comes form tubes cartridges special hardware required process taking agar impressions namely water bath rim lock trays coiled edges allowing passage cold water cooling material set mouth bath consists three containers filled water different temperatures first set liquefy agar second used lower temperature material safe intraoral use usually set third one

avoid changes dimensional modern dentistry offers materials eg elastomerics provide high accuracy impressions easier use hence agar used less frequently alginate hand irreversible hydrocolloid exists two phases either viscous liquid solid gel transition generated chemical impression material created adding water powdered alginate contains mixture sodium potassium salts alginic acid overall setting

fully set removal mouth water content completed impression exposed must controlled improper storage either result syneresis material contracts upon standing exudes liquid imbibition water uptake uncontrolled extent direction therefore impression must stored correctly involves wrapping set material damp tissue storing sealed polythene bag impression cast alginate used dental circumstances less
