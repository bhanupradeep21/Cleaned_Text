fluorescent chemical compound strong affinity dna used fluorescent marker dna fluorescence microscopy flow cytometry intercalates doublestranded dna high affinity gcrich making useful chromosome banding absorption maximum nm efficiently excited using nm laser also excited somewhat lower efficiency using nm nm argon laser lines emission large stokes shift maximum deep red nm therefore compatible blue green fluorophores even many red fluorophores multicolour applications readily pass intact cell membranes used stain imaging dna fluorescence cell membrane must permeabilized disrupted method used combination formaldehyde fixation samples also used cell viability stain cells compromised membranes stain live cells intact cell membranes remain dark viability cells flow cytometry around less related compound actinomycin nonfluorescent binds dna way absorbance changes bound dna used stain conventional transmission microscopy absorptions
