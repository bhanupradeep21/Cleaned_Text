pharyngeal flap surgery procedure correct airflow speech procedure common among people cleft palate types dysarthria posterior pharyngeal flap surgery commonly used operation restore velopharyngeal competence ie develop functional seal vocal oral cavity therefore correct hypernasality nasal air escape ysunza et al posterior pharyngeal flaps based superiorly inferiorly velum split transversely along midline lidemanboshki et al centrally positioned superior based flaps continue popular pharyngeal flap choice yet inferior based flaps easier surgeon perform compared superiorly based flaps inferiorly based flaps limited regard size velopharyngeal opening covered petersonfalzone et al pharyngolasties correcting hypernasal speech traced back far century passavant first explored palatopexy female hall et al schenborn also attempted reduce amount air entering nasal cavity developing first true inferior based pharyngeal flap surgery flap tissue sutured velum attached lower end posterior pharyngeal wall modifying technique schoenborn published superior based pharyngeal flap surgery flap tissue attached upper end posterior pharyngeal wall peninsula together rosenthal used inferiorly based posterior pharyngeal flap combination modified von langenbeck palatoplasty primary surgery cleft palate repair taking different approach padgett utilized superiorly based flap cleft palate patients whose primary surgical repair unsuccessful sloan posterior pharyngeal flap surgery became widely adopted correction vpi petersonfalzone et al hogan shprintzen advanced posterior pharyngeal flaps leading increased success rate elimination vpi hogan proposed lateral portal control flap modulate postoperative port size flap lateral ports exist sides pharyngeal flap assist drainage nasal breathing nasal resonance using pressureflow studies warren colleagues basis lateral port size hogan placed mm diameter catheter lateral ports either side flap tailor port size perception nasal resonance sloan consistent warren aerodynamic data hogan advocated velopharyngeal opening greater mm diameter larger gap would likely result hypernasal speech petersonfalzone et al shprintzen advocated tailormade flaps width flap determined degree preoperative lateral pharyngeal wall adduction according shprintzen base pharyngeal flap positioned site greatest level lateral pharyngeal wall movement addition shprintzen recommends narrower flap used pronounced lateral pharyngeal wall movement wider flap used limited lateral pharyngeal wall sloan use narrow flap individuals limited preoperative lateral pharyngeal wall movement potential increase lateral pharyngeal wall movement postoperatively karling et al pharyngeal flap surgery may recommended resolve velopharyngeal inadequacy patients prove unable achieve significant speech improvements speech therapy alone requirements qualify surgery include short immobile easily fatigued palate mazaheri et al patient pattern vp closure one aspect taken take consideration doctors deciding whether pharyngeal flap surgery appropriate method treatment armour et al variety closure patterns found pattern varies person person planning pharyngeal flap surgery imperative doctor match postoperative structure preoperative movements order adequate seal achieved ysunza et al research found pharyngeal flap surgery effective sagittal closure pattern good lateral wall movement poor velar movement armour et al pharyngeal flap surgery recommended everyone alternative treatment methods available one alternative use prosthesis instances prosthesis capable stimulating pharyngeal wall movement thus aiding vp closure often prostheses recommended use young children mazaheri et al currently accurate method available determine whether pharyngeal flap alternative method better results eliminating velopharnygeal incompetence pharyngeal flap surgery completed children adults younger children undergo surgery fewer speech impairments tend occur possible explanation earlier surgery less likely child developed compensatory strategies overcome velopharyngeal incompetence armour et al however thorough preoperative planning pharyngeal flap surgery effective eliminating vpi adults children hall et al common complications pharyngeal flap surgery include airway obstruction obstructive sleep apnea pena snoring also noted possible negative outcome surgery sloan result flap surgery airway compromised several ways issues associated compromise include narrowing nasal oral airway secondary edema impeding nasopharynx flap anatomical changes oropharynx becomes smaller decreased respiratory drive following general anaesthesia also correlation individuals surgery presence craniofacial neurological conditions factors together may lead complications pena postoperative airway obstruction may range mild stridor events severe blockage airway resulting tracheal intubation tracheotomy patients closely monitored following surgery due possible damage newly repaired palate even risk death literature airway obstruction following pharyngeal flap surgery using wardillkilner von langenbeck techniques well documented concluded individuals franceschetti syndrome pierre robin sequence increased risk developing airway obstruction following pharyngoplasty due shallow nasopharyngeal airway inadequate maxillofacial growth time surgery also believed prolonged duration surgical procedure may directly correlated increased incidence airway obstruction age seem influence risk factors increase risk airway obstruction include associated congenital anomalies history airway problems anthony sloan sleep apnea categorized obstructive sleep apnea osa central sleep apnea potential health risks osa severe therefore even small percentage incidence considered significant obstructive sleep apnea symptoms must carefully assessed following pharyngeal flap surgery ysunza condition found commonly linked posterior pharyngeal flap surgery however pharyngeal flaps considered valuable correcting velopharyngeal function treatment options especially severe cases vpi sloan also reported large tonsils found high percentage osa cases large tonsils may shifted posteriorly ports flap superiorlybased pharyngeal flaps tonsils likely contributor osa surgical procedures uvulopalatopharyngoplasties tonsillectomies may required resolve osa consequently tonsillar tissue important area preoperative assessment ysunza et al pharyngeal flap surgery may able improve speech performance children adults cleft palate velopharyngeal insufficiency fact high success rate improvement speech following pharyngeal flap surgery however surgery guarantee perfect intelligible speech addition speech improvements pharyngeal flap surgery may help eliminate hypernasality nasal turbulence facial grimacing tonz et al often speech improvements obvious immediately following surgery speech improvements prevalent one year post surgery usually continue several years outcomes pharyngeal flap surgery vary among individual regards improvements hyponasality hypernasality nasal turbulence voice quality articulation intelligibility tonz et al liedmanboshki et al patients undergo pharyngeal flap surgery encounter risk never breathing nose could create abnormal speech ie denasal resonance witt et al estimated around patients clefts develop hypernasal speech pharyngeal flap surgery heliovaara et al percentage reported individuals developing hypernasal speech debated researchers possible hypernasality side effect pharyngeal flap surgery however hyponasal speech occurs frequently successful surgery liedmanboshki et al also possible pharyngeal flap surgery unsuccessful patients may even require secondary surgery velopharyngeal insufficiency common individuals undergo second surgery could develop secondary speech problems specifically compensatory articulation resonance disorders problems occurring post secondary surgery often difficult extinguish tonz et al previously mentioned one problem may occur surgery hypernasality caused narrow flap inadequate lateral pharyngeal wall movement prohibit lateral port closure phonation several reasons surgery may fail first time including poorly designed flap one narrow postoperative scar contracture flap inappropriate patient selection also flap may wide occlude lateral ports higher rates surgical failure children history perinatal upper airway obstruction robin sequence witt et al type cleft well type flap used superiorly inferiorlybased seem make difference postoperative speech outcomes reported different types flaps give different speech configurations however results showed equally good outcomes postoperative speech regardless type flap used therefore imperative surgeon selects right type flap individual liedmanboshki et al overall speech improve pharyngeal flap surgery important remember improvement variable individuals react surgery differently changes speech always occur immediately surgery mean improvements made lastly speech problems compensatory articulation strategies often extinguish speech language pathologist
