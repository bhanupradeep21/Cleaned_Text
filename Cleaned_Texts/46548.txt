mannitol type sugar alcohol used sweetener used low calorie sweetener poorly absorbed medication used decrease pressure eyes glaucoma lower increased intracranial medically given injection effects typically begin within minutes last common side effects medical use include electrolyte problems serious side effects may include worsening heart failure kidney unclear use safe mannitol osmotic diuretic family medications works pulling fluid brain discovery mannitol attributed joseph louis proust world health organizations list essential originally made flowering ash called manna due supposed resemblance biblical mannitol world antidoping agencys banned drug list due concerns may mask united states mannitol indicated reduction intracranial pressure treatment cerebral edema elevated intraocular european union mannitol indicated treatment cystic fibrosis cf adults aged years addon therapy best standard mannitol used intravenously reduce acutely raised intracranial pressure definitive treatment eg head trauma mannitol injection mainstay treating high pressure skull bad brain injury better hypertonic saline firstline treatment treatmentresistant cases hypertonic saline works intraarterial infusions mannitol transiently open barrier disrupting tight may also used certain cases kidney failure low urine output decreasing pressure eye increase elimination certain toxins treat fluid build intraoperative mannitol prior vessel clamp release renal transplant shown reduce posttransplant kidney injury shown reduce graft rejectionmedical citation needed mannitol acts osmotic oral doses larger sometimes sold laxative childrencitation needed use mannitol inhaled bronchial irritant alternative method diagnosis exerciseinduced asthma proposed systematic review concluded evidence support use purpose time mannitol commonly used circuit prime heart lung machine cardiopulmonary bypass presence mannitol preserves renal function times low blood flow pressure patient bypass solution prevents swelling endothelial cells kidney may otherwise reduced blood flow area resulted cell damage mannitol also used temporarily encapsulate sharp object helix lead artificial pacemaker passes venous system mannitol dissolves readily blood sharp point becomes exposed destination mannitol also first drug choice treat acute glaucoma veterinary medicine administered solution intravenously dehydrates vitreous humor therefore lowers intraocular pressure however requires intact bloodocular barrier mannitol increases blood glucose lesser extent sucrose thus relatively low glycemic used sweetener people diabetes chewing gums although mannitol higher heat solution sugar alcohols comparatively low solubility reduces cooling effect usually found mint candies gums however mannitol completely dissolved product induces strong cooling also low hygroscopicity pick water air humidity level makes mannitol useful coating hard candies dried fruits chewing gums often included ingredient candies chewing pleasant taste mouthfeel mannitol also makes popular excipient chewable mannitol used form complex boric acid increases acid strength boric acid permitting better precision volumetric analysis mannitol primary ingredient mannitol salt agar bacterial growth medium used others mannitol used cutting various drugs used intranasally snorted cocaine mixture mannitol fentanyl fentanyl analogs ratio labeled sold china white popular heroin substitutecitation needed mannitol contraindicated people anuria severe hypovolemia preexisting severe pulmonary vascular congestion pulmonary edema irritable bowel syndrome ibs active intracranial bleeding except adverse effects include hyponatremia volume depletion leading metabolic mannitol isomer sorbitol another sugar alcohol two differ orientation hydroxyl group carbon similar two sugar alcohols different sources nature melting points uses mannitol classified sugar alcohol derived sugar mannose reduction sugar alcohols include xylitol sorbitol mannitol sorbitol isomers difference orientation hydroxyl group carbon mannitol commonly produced via hydrogenation fructose formed either starch sucrose common table sugar although starch cheaper source sucrose transformation starch much complicated eventually yields syrup containing fructose glucose maltose sucrose simply hydrolyzed invert sugar syrup contains fructose cases syrups chromatographically purified contain fructose fructose hydrogenated nickel catalyst mixture isomers sorbitol mannitol yield typically although slightly alkaline reaction conditions slightly increase mannitol mannitol one abundant energy carbon storage molecules nature produced plethora organisms including bacteria yeasts fungi algae lichens many fermentation microorganisms alternative traditional industrial synthesis fructose mannitol metabolic pathway known mannitol cycle fungi discovered type red algae caloglossa leprieurii highly possible microorganisms employ similar class lactic acid bacteria labeled heterofermentive multiple fermentation pathways convert either three fructose molecules two fructose one glucose molecule two mannitol molecules one molecule lactic acid acetic acid carbon dioxide feedstock syrups containing medium large concentrations fructose example cashew apple juice containing fructose glucose produce yields g oz mannitol per liter feedstock research conducted studying ways engineer even efficient mannitol pathways lactic acid bacteria well use microorganisms e coli mannitol production foodgrade strains aforementioned microorganisms used mannitol organism directly applicable food products avoiding need careful separation microorganism mannitol crystals although promising method steps needed scale industrially needed since mannitol found wide variety natural products including almost plants directly extracted natural products rather chemical biological syntheses fact china isolation seaweed common form mannitol mannitol concentrations plant exudates range seaweeds plane tree constituent saw palmetto traditionally mannitol extracted soxhlet extraction using ethanol water methanol steam hydrolysis crude material mannitol recrystallized extract generally resulting yields original natural product another method extraction using supercritical subcritical fluids fluids stage difference exists liquid gas stages diffusive normal fluids considered make much effective mass transfer agents normal liquids super subcritical fluid pumped natural product mostly mannitol product easily separated solvent minute amount byproduct supercritical carbon dioxide extraction olive leaves shown require less solvent per measure leaf traditional extraction g oz versus g oz ethanol per g oz olive leaf heated pressurized subcritical water even cheaper shown dramatically greater results traditional extraction requires g oz water per g oz olive leaf gives yield mannitol super subcritical extractions cheaper faster purer environmentally friendly traditional extraction however required high operating temperatures pressures causes hesitancy industrial use julije domac elucidated
