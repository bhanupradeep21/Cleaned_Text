choking also known foreign body airway obstruction fbao phenomenon occurs breathing impeded blockage inside respiratory tract obstruction prevents oxygen entering lungs results oxygen deprivation although oxygen stored blood lungs keep person alive several minutes breathing choking often leads death around chokingrelated deaths occur united states every deaths choking often occur young
