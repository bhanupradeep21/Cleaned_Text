paroxysmal extreme pain disorder originally named familial rectal pain syndrome rare disorder whose notable features pain mandibular ocular rectal areas well flushing pepd often first manifests beginning life perhaps even utero symptoms persisting throughout life pepd symptoms reminiscent primary erythromelalgia result flushing episodic pain though pain typically present extremities primary erythromelalgia disorders recently shown allelic caused mutations voltagegated sodium channel encoded gene different mutation ion channel causes congenital insensitivity pain distinctive feature pepd episodic burning pain rectum ocular mandibular regions stressed pain often originates centered areas also spread diffuse nature pain experienced patients disorder underestimated women disorder also given birth describe pepd pain worse labor pain concomitant pain typically flushing often area associated attacks infants child often looks startled terrified scream inconsolably attacks precipitated injections defecation wiping perineum eating consumption oral medication attacks occur due precipitation pain flushing often present area attack precipitation though symptoms may also diffuse symptoms may include hypersalivation attacks localized mandibular region leg weakness foot trauma prominent nonphysical symptom tonic nonepileptic seizures seizures common infancy childhood adulthood older children inconsolable screaming usually precedes attack followed apnea paleness stiffness stiffness last seconds attack precipitants usually physical nature defecation eating taking medicine less common precipitants micturition coitus painful stimuli also nonphysical precipitants thought sight food general attacks tend occur precipitated area though always case individuals described buildup
