psychophysics quantitatively investigates relationship physical stimuli sensations perceptions produce psychophysics described scientific study relation stimulus completely analysis perceptual processes studying effect subjects experience behaviour systematically varying properties stimulus along one physical psychophysics also refers general class methods applied study perceptual system

argued medieval scientist alhazen considered founder psychophysics although alhaytham made many subjective reports regarding vision evidence used quantitative psychophysical techniques claims discuss psychophysicists usually employ experimental stimuli objectively measured pure tones varying intensity lights varying luminance senses studied vision hearing touch including skin enteric perception taste smell sense time regardless sensory domain three main areas investigation absolute thresholds discrimination thresholds scaling threshold limen point intensity participant detect presence stimulus absolute presence difference two stimuli difference stimuli intensities threshold considered detectable hence subliminal stimuli values close enough threshold often detectable proportion occasions therefore threshold considered point stimulus change stimulus detected proportion p occasions absolute threshold level intensity stimulus subject able detect presence stimulus proportion time p level often example absolute threshold number hairs back ones hand must touched felt participant may unable feel single hair touched may able feel two three exceeds threshold absolute threshold also often referred detection threshold several different methods used measuring absolute thresholds discrimination thresholds see difference threshold justnoticeable difference jnd magnitude smallest difference two stimuli differing intensities participant able detect proportion time percentage depending kind task test threshold several different methods used subject may asked adjust one stimulus perceived method adjustment may asked describe direction magnitude difference two stimuli may asked decide whether intensities pair stimuli forced choice justnoticeable difference jnd fixed quantity rather depends intense stimuli measured particular sense webers law states justnoticeable difference stimulus constant proportion despite variation discrimination experiments experimenter seeks determine point difference two stimuli two weights two sounds detectable subject presented one stimulus example weight asked say whether another weight heavier lighter experiments subject may also say two weights point subjective equality pse subject perceives two weights justnoticeable difference limen dl magnitude difference stimuli subject notices proportion p time usually used p comparison task addition twoalternative forced choice paradigm used assess point performance reduces chance discrimination two alternatives p typically since corresponds chance task absolute difference thresholds sometimes considered similar principle always background noise interfering ability detect psychophysics experiments seek determine whether subject detect stimulus identify differentiate another stimulus describe magnitude nature software psychophysical experimentation overviewed psychophysical experiments traditionally used three methods testing subjects perception stimulus detection difference detection experiments method limits method constant stimuli method ascending method limits property stimulus starts level low stimulus could detected level gradually increased participant reports aware example experiment testing minimum amplitude sound detected sound begins quietly perceived made gradually louder descending method limits reversed case threshold considered level stimulus property stimuli experiments ascending descending methods used alternately thresholds averaged possible disadvantage methods subject may become accustomed reporting perceive stimulus may continue reporting way even beyond threshold error habituation conversely subject may also anticipate stimulus become detectable undetectable may make premature judgment error anticipation avoid potential pitfalls georg von békésy introduced staircase procedure study auditory perception method sound starts audible gets quieter subjects responses subject report hearing point sound made louder step subject reports hearing point made quieter steps way experimenter able zero instead presented ascending descending order method constant stimuli levels certain property stimulus related one trial next presented randomly prevents subject able predict level next stimulus therefore reduces errors habituation expectation absolute thresholds subject reports whether able detect difference thresholds constant comparison stimulus varied levels friedrich hegelmaier described method constant stimuli method allows full sampling psychometric function result lot trials several conditions interleaved method adjustment subject asked control level stimulus alter barely detectable background noise level another stimulus adjustment repeated many times also called method average method observers control magnitude variable stimulus beginning level distinctly greater lesser standard one vary satisfied subjective equality two difference variable stimuli standard one recorded adjustment error tabulated considerable series end mean calculated giving average error taken measure sensitivity classic methods experimentation often argued inefficient advance testing psychometric threshold usually unknown data collected points psychometric function provide little information parameter interest usually threshold adaptive staircase procedures classical method adjustment used points sampled clustered around psychometric threshold data points also spread slightly wider range psychometric functions slope also interest adaptive methods thus optimized estimating threshold threshold slope adaptive methods classified staircase procedures see bayesian maximumlikelihood methods staircase methods rely previous response easier implement bayesian methods take whole set previous stimulusresponse pairs account generally robust lapses practical examples found staircases usually begin high intensity stimulus easy detect intensity reduced observer makes mistake point staircase reverses intensity increased observer responds correctly triggering another reversal values last reversals averaged many different types staircase procedures using different decision termination rules stepsize updown rules spread underlying psychometric function dictate psychometric function threshold values obtained staircases fluctuate wildly care must taken design many different staircase algorithms modeled practical recommendations suggested one common staircase designs fixedstep sizes staircase participant makes correct response n times row stimulus intensity reduced one step size
