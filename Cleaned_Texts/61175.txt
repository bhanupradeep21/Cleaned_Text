cardiac glycosides class organic compounds increase output force heart decrease rate contractions inhibiting cellular sodiumpotassium atpase beneficial medical uses treatments congestive heart failure cardiac arrhythmias however relative toxicity prevents widely commonly found secondary metabolites several plants foxglove plants compounds nevertheless diverse range biochemical effects regarding cardiac cell function also suggested use cancer general structure cardiac glycoside consists steroid molecule attached sugar glycoside r steroid nucleus consists four fused rings functional groups methyl hydroxyl aldehyde groups attached influence overall molecules biological cardiac glycosides also vary groups attached either end steroid specifically different sugar groups attached sugar end steroid alter molecules solubility kinetics however lactone moiety r group end serves structural particular structure ring attached r end molecule allows classified either cardenolide bufadienolide cardenolides differ bufadienolides due presence enolide fivemembered ring single double bond lactone end bufadienolides hand contain dienolide sixmembered ring two double bonds lactone compounds groups used influence cardiac output heart cardenolides commonly used medicinally primarily due widespread availability plants derived cardiac glycosides specifically categorized based plant derived following list example cardenolides primarily derived foxglove plants digitalis purpurea digitalis lanata bufadienolides derived venom cane toad rhinella marina formerly known bufo marinus receive bufo portion list organisms cardiac glycosides derived cardiac glycosides affect sodiumpotassium atpase pump cardiac muscle cells alter normally sodiumpotassium pumps move potassium ions sodium ions cardiac glycosides however inhibit pump stabilizing transition state sodium extruded intracellular sodium concentration therefore increases regard potassium ion movement cardiac glycosides potassium compete binding atpase pump changes extracellular potassium concentration potentially lead altered drug nevertheless carefully controlling dosage adverse effects avoided continuing mechanism raised intracellular sodium levels inhibit function second membrane ion exchanger ncx responsible pumping calcium ions cell sodium ions ratio thus calcium ions also extruded begin build inside cell disrupted calcium homeostasis increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations cause increased calcium uptake sarcoplasmic reticulum sr via transporter raised calcium stores sr allow greater calcium release stimulation myocyte achieve faster powerful contraction crossbridge refractory period av node increased cardiac glycosides also function decrease heart rate example ingestion digoxin leads increased cardiac output decreased heart rate without significant changes blood pressure quality allows widely used medicinally treatment cardiac cardiac glycosides identified senolytics selectively eliminate senescent cells sensitive atpaseinhibiting action due cell membrane cardiac glycosides long served main medical treatment congestive heart failure cardiac arrhythmia due effects increasing force muscle contraction reducing heart rate heart failure characterized inability pump enough blood support body possibly due decrease volume blood contractile treatments condition thus focus lowering blood pressure heart exert much force pump blood directly increasing hearts contractile force heart overcome higher blood pressure cardiac glycosides commonly used digoxin digitoxin deal latter due positive inotropic activity hand cardiac arrhythmia changes heart rate whether faster tachycardia slower bradycardia medicinal treatments condition work primarily counteract tachycardia atrial fibrillation slowing heart rate done cardiac nevertheless due questions toxicity dosage cardiac glycosides replaced synthetic drugs ace inhibitors beta blockers longer used primary medical treatment conditions depending severity condition though may still used conjunction ancient times humans used cardiacglycosidecontaining plants crude extracts arrow coatings homicidal suicidal aids rat poisons heart tonics diuretics emetics primarily due toxic nature thus though cardiac glycosides used medicinal function toxicity must also recognized example us poison centers reported cases digoxin toxicity
