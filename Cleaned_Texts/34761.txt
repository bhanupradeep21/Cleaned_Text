erythropoietin receptor epor protein humans encoded epor epor peptide single carbohydrate chain resulting approximately kda protein found surface epo responding cells member cytokine receptor family epor preexists dimers dimers originally thought formed extracellular domain however assumed formed interactions transmembrane original structure extracellular interaction site due crystallisation conditions depict native binding kda ligand erythropoietin epo changes receptors conformational change resulting autophosphorylation kinases preassociated receptor ie epor possess intrinsic kinase activity depends present bestestablished function epor promote proliferation rescue erythroid red blood cell progenitors cytoplasmic domains epor contain number phosphotyrosines phosphorylated serve docking sites variety intracellular pathway activators stats addition activating rasakt erkmap kinase phosphatidylinositol pathway stat transcription factors phosphotyrosines also serve docking sites phosphatases negatively affect epor signaling order prevent overactivation may lead disorders erythrocytosis general defects erythropoietin receptor may produce erythroleukemia familial erythrocytosis

mice truncated viable suggests activity sufficient support basal erythropoiesis activating necessary pathways without phosphotyrosine docking sites needed eporh form epor truncation contains first
