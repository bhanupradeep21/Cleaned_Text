familial natural short sleep rare genetic typically inherited trait individual sleeps fewer hours average without suffering daytime sleepiness consequences sleep deprivation process entirely natural kind individual caused certain genetic person trait known natural short condition confused intentional sleep deprivation leaves symptoms irritability temporarily impaired cognitive abilities people predisposed sleep normal amount time people sleep type considered genetic disorder rather considered genetic benign individuals trait known lifelong ability able sleep lesser amount time average people usually hours less average sleeptime hours night waking feeling relatively wellrested also notable absence sort consequence derives depriving oneself sleep something average person would able sleeptime frequency said sleeptime common people another common trait among people familial natural short sleep increased ability recalling common traits include outgoing personality high productiveness lower body mass index average possibly due faster metabolism higher resilience heightened pain traits slightly better quality people natural short sleep people natural normal sleep essentially making slightly efficient average condition lifelong meaning natural short sleeper naturally slept shorter time average trait inherited autosomal dominant trait means person natural short sleeper must least one copy mutation related condition mutation must either inherited must arisen spontaneous genetic carrier mutation associated fnss chance transmitting mutation one offspring
