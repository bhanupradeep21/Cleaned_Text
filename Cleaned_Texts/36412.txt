red mercury described many commentatorswho exact nature supposed working mechanism varied widely among general however none explanations appear scientifically historically supportable traditional staged thermonuclear weapons consist two parts fission primary fusionfission secondary energy released primary explodes used indirectly compress secondary start fusion reaction within conventional explosives far weak provide level compression needed primary generally built small possible energy released secondary much larger thus building larger primary generally inefficient lower limit size primary known critical mass weapons grade plutonium around kg lb reduced use neutron reflectors clever arrangements explosives compress core methods generally add size complexity resulting device need fission primary difficulty purifying weaponsgrade fissile materials majority arms control efforts limit nuclear proliferation rely detection control fissile material equipment needed obtain theory

widely known elements within us power structure deliberately suppressing hiding information due frightening implications weapon would nuclear proliferation since red mercury bomb would require fissile
