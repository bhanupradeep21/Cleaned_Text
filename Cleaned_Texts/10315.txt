occupational dust exposure occur various settings including agriculture construction forestry mining dust hazards include arise handling well mining wood dust commonly referred sawdust another occupational dust hazard pose risk workers health without proper safety precautions dust exposure lead occupational lung diseases dust particles generated disturbanceagitation rockmineral dry grain timber fiber material particles generated range size become airborne depending origin physical characteristics ambient types dust present occupational setting various mining processes rockminerals broken collected processing mineral dusts created become airborne inhalation dusts lead various respiratory illnesses depending dust type eg coal silica etc size dust particulates exposure duration stages wood processing wood dust generated wood dust wood particle arising processing handling sawing routing sanding among activities form wood dust become airborne process dust removal furniture maintenance equipment dust generated milling handling storage grains fibers pose threat workers health milling process solid agricultural grains corn barley wheat cotton etc may undergo crushing grinding process generates agricultural dust improperly handling grains also expose workers grain dusts grain storage also present hazards workers storage structures create dangerous conditions due gases emitted spoiled grains chemical fumes workers may exposed unhealthy levels airborne contaminants including molds chemical fumigants toxic chemicals gases associated decaying fermenting working dry food manufacturing plant lead many adverse health affects already predisposed asthma allergic reactions risk respiratory many adverse effects inhaling grain dust including dangerous grain symptoms include irritated eyes nose wheezing chest tightness sponsored study concluded limit proposed osha based evaluation grain handlers wisconsin minnesota determined physical exam questionnaire rankin et al found grain workers likely experience respiratory symptoms city dust collection system place reduce amount settled dust surfaces reducing risk explosions addition central vacuum system facility make convenient operators production workers regularly vacuum exposures controlled proper personal protective equipment needed working environment airborne dust crystalline silica typical mineral
