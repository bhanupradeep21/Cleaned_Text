geological history north america comprises history geological occurrences emergence life north america interval time spanning formation earth emergence humanity start prehistory start paleozoic era north america actually southern hemisphere marine life flourished countrys many seas although terrestrial life yet evolved latter part paleozoic seas largely replaced swamps home amphibians early reptiles continents assembled pangaea drier conditions prevailed evolutionary precursors mammals dominated country mass extinction event ended reign triassic first period mesozoic era followed dinosaurs evolved began rise dominance quickly spreading united states soon pangaea began split north america began drifting north westward latter jurassic floodplains western states home dinosaurs like allosaurus apatosaurus stegosaurus cretaceous gulf mexico expanded split north america half plesiosaurs mosasaurs swam waters later period began withdraw coastal plains western states home dinosaurs like edmontosaurus triceratops tyrannosaurus another mass extinction ended reign dinosaurs cenozoic era began afterward inland sea cretaceous gradually vanished mammals beginning dominate land eocene western states home small primitive camels horses well carnivorous creodonts soon mammals entered oceans early whale basilosaurus swam coastal waters southeast rhinolike titanotheres

continents different arrangement generally smaller today southeastern part us connected south america africa located polar latitudes southern hemisphere western states located near known life cambrian aquatic areas united states sea level would sterile trilobites common kind animal cambrian fossil especially notable elrathia antelope springs region spongelike archaeocyathids common brachiopods gastropods sponges also important cambrian sea levels around north america dropped end cambrian ecosystems shallow water probably cambrian ended mass extinction globally brachiopods gastropods lost much biodiversity sponges lost half families almost three quarters contemporary trilobite families vanished much continent would submerged sea finally rose common animal ordovician fossil record seems brachiopods large numbers flourished preserved great detail near cincinnati middle ordovician members fauna preserved indiana kentucky known ordovician trilobites distinct cambrian forebears taxa surviving mass extinction diversified middle ordovician early armored jawless fish called ostracoderms left behind fragmentary shards bone rocky mountains late ordovician sea levels another mass extinction marked end ordovician globally families disappeared major losses experienced brachiopods fishes echinoids sponges trilobites mass extinction also damaging trilobites lost silurian warm

extinction ammonoids one first groups marine invertebrates become abundant diverse middle triassic scleractinian corals typical modern oceans appeared triassic corals rare north america nevertheless present west coast although corals congregate ichthyosaurs one important groups marine reptiles triassic important ichthyosaur fossils age preserved land north americas vegetation included plants like conifers cycads ferns ginkgoes triassic vegetation east coast indicated swampy conditions local rift valleys arizona home great forest would later leave behind areas famous petrified reptiles first began claiming ecological dominance marine terrestrial aerial habitats triassic would earn mesozoic nickname age late triassic also saw origin dinosaurs left behind abundant fossils four corners region area known one best sources late triassic dinosaur fossils united states texas also good source dinosaur remains oldest dinosaur remains eastern us million years dinosaurs reached east coast united states long evolved first fossil footprints common kind early dinosaur fossil eastern united triassic ended pangaea breaking separate continents rift valleys formed along east coast north american european african plates process created rifts east coast one rift valleys inundated ocean water became young atlantic ocean volcanism related tectonic processes fracturing pangaea also left deposits eastern end triassic another mass extinction globally extinction event wiped roughly one quarter families conodonts went completely extinct ammonoids barely survived brachiopods lost much former diversity well land families amphibians reptiles became eastern coast us became warmer wetter early jurassic newly formed atlantic ocean brought contact humid fossils spanning late triassic early jurassic preserved newark supergroup found canadian province nova scotia south rifting continued eastern part country early jurassic eastern united states drifted apart greenland europe pacific plate forced way north american plate triggering geologic upheaval including volcanism west ichthyosaurs remained dominant marine reptiles early jurassic jurassic progressed title gradually transferred stratigraphic unit known morrison formation deposited late sediments exposed arizona new mexico oklahoma utah colorado wyoming south dakota time region country home forests conifers ginkgos tree ferns coal would later form remains local mammals diversified significantly jurassic morrison formation best source jurassic mammal fossils north local dinosaurs included ornithopod camptosaurus sauropods apatosaurus diplodocus theropod unlike many periods geologic history jurassic end mass extinction however lesser extinction events going time notable losses occurring among ammonoids early cretaceous gulf mexico began gradually expanding land eastern united states resembled modern mississippi delta lowlying plain divided rivers thick coat vegetation covered region plants like club mosses conifers cycads ferns ginkgoes horsetails early late cretaceous gulf mexico expanded north america reaching half continents modern surface area may submerged called western interior covered majority states like texas new mexico oklahoma colorado kansas nebraska dakotas seafloor smooth probably never submerged feet water great diversity invertebrates flourished bottom water column examples include ammonites giant clams crinoids rudists squid vertebrate life included bony fishes mosasaurs plesiosaurs sharks areas occupied plains east coast new jersey southward well gulf coast region covered seawater sea levels reached highest level geologic history cretaceous although declined period scleractinian corals diverse cretaceous today back coral reefs formed along gulf rudist bivalves also constructed reefs gulf coast another bivalve exogyra common fossils found almost every cretaceous marine cretaceous dominant group living fishes teleosts first achieved ascendency holostean aquatic toothed bird hesperornis known cretaceous bird whose remains found frequency north near end cretaceous western interior seaway began withdraw regression would end resulting halves north america reuniting seaway withdrew coastal plain expanded southward northern part western powerful geologic forces began fold distort rocks idaho utah wyoming beginning processes would form rocky rivers flowing across eastern part montana deposited sediments known hell creek formation time montana home famous dinosaurs creatures like edmontosaurus pachycephalosaurus triceratops despite western upheaval eastern us achieved geological stability late weather uniformly warm rainy throughout flowering plants common fossil broadleaf trees shrubs preserved late cretaceous cretaceous ended another mass extinction one second devastating geologic history roughly half animal families became extinct ammonoids belemnoids among marine invertebrates extinguished planktonic foraminiferans barely survived two thirds coral species became extinct half sponge families became extinct bivalves bryozoans gastropods also sustained heavy losses major mesozoic marine reptile groups became extinct land nonavian dinosaurs pterosaurs became popular explanation mass extinction end cretaceous resulted meteorite impact impact would explain presence high levels heavy element iridium sediments time iridium

cretaceous new era geologic time began cenozoic era means era recent life traditionally first period cenozoic called however recent recommendations international commission stratigraphy discourage use correspondent time span divided earlier paleogene recent neogene geologic turmoil west coast maintained pacific plate continued slide north american early part cenozoic period climates much warmer today latitudes high south dakota subtropical climate recently end sea level fell throughout areas cenozoic north america covered seawater tended areas near modern cannonball sea near minot north dakota last north american cenozoic marine invertebrates best known deposits near coasts tend resemble modern forms solitary corals became common coral reefs formed around gulf sharks common eocene times onward began increasing beginning cenozoic also beginning age mammals small shrewlike generalist insectivores survived late cretaceous extinction event began diversifying mammals dominate modern worlds terrestrial creodonts first appeared paleocene among first mammals specialize coastal region southeastern states like covered seawater home primitive whale basilosaurus eocene diversity mammalian carnivores land increased eocene around time camels becoming common north america although barely bigger modern rabbits eocene early camels four early part eocene first primitive horses also began appearing among earliest eohippus small animal four toes front feet three group mammals called oreodonts also appeared oligocene camels size sheep two gradually time horses also lost toes unlike camels horses reduced single oligocene teeth adapted endure abrasion silica increasingly grassy horses gradually became common throughout large numbers oreodonts grazed badlands south dakota middle oreodonts vaguely pig like size modern goats numbers peaked largest mammals oligocene north america rhinoceroslike titanotheres one spectacular example abundant brontotherium south dakota could feet tall shoulder despite early success end epoch entire group became following oligocene temperatures began decline warmweather vegetation forced southward lower miocene sharks increasing size since eocene feet mastodons arrived north america crossing bering land bridge old world miocene oreodonts became extinct time pliocene ended modern carnivores like wolves cats appeared notable among latter group sabertoothed woolly mammoths became abundant across us late late pleistocene large volumes water held frozen part glaciers caused drop sea level exposed land bridge asia alaska humans crossed bridge started becoming abundant north america years despite withstanding fluctuating climate concomitant advance retreat glaciers around years ago around genera large mammals suddenly became horses
