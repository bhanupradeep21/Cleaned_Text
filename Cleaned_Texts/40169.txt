ascites liver enlargement usually seen younger adults median age diagnosis ages similar incidence males syndrome fulminant acute chronic asymptomatic subacute presentation common form acute syndrome presents rapidly progressive severe upper abdominal pain yellow discoloration skin whites eyes liver enlargement enlargement spleen fluid accumulation within peritoneal cavity elevated liver enzymes eventually encephalopathy fulminant syndrome presents early encephalopathy ascites liver cell death severe lactic acidosis may present well caudate lobe enlargement often present majority patients

thrombophilia develop venous may acquire obstruction venous vasculature liver referred syndrome venules right atrium leads increased portal vein hepatic sinusoid pressures blood flow stagnates increased portal pressure causes increased filtration vascular fluid formation ascites abdomen collateral venous flow alternative veins leading esophageal gastric rectal varices obstruction also

anticoagulation required patients syndrome even cause hypercoagulability warfarin preferred best studied anticoagulant direct factor xa inhibitors may also many patients require intervention forms may treated surgical shunts portacaval shunt divert blood flow around obstruction liver shunts must placed early diagnosis best tips transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt replaced shunt surgery less invasive overcomes intrahepatic outflow obstruction diverting hepatic portal blood flow inferior vena cava tips accomplishes goal surgical shunt lower procedurerelated mortality factor led growth popularity effective treating ascites preventing variceal tips procedure shown good outcomes fiveyear transplantfree survival hepatic veins blocked portal vein approached via intrahepatic part inferior vena cava procedure called dips direct intrahepatic portocaval shunt segmental occlusions inferior vena cava portal vein treated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon passed via guidewire site venous obstruction inflated open blockage may followed stent placement either immediate stent placement deferred stent placed later limited studies thrombolysis direct infusion
