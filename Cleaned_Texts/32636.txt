platynereis dumerilii species annelid polychaete originally placed genus later reassigned genus platynereis dumerilii lives coastal marine waters temperate tropical zones found wide range azores mediterranean north sea english channel atlantic cape good hope black sea red sea persian gulf sea japan pacific kerguelen platynereis dumerilii today important lab considered living used many phylogenetic studies model organism platynereis dumerilii small marine ragworm males reach length cm females reach length like number invertebrate phyla platynereis dumerilii axochord paired longitudinal muscle displays striking similarities notochord regarding position developmental origin expression early trochophore larva pair simplest eyes animal kingdom eye consists photoreceptor cell pigment p dumerilii worms ciliated surface beats synchronously drive locomotion fluid flow larvae segmental multiciliated cells regularly display spontaneous coordinated ciliary arrests compose ciliomotor circuitry worms wholebody coordination ciliary locomotion performed stopandgo pacemaker worms develop use chaetae parapodia locomotion unlike polychaetes platynereis larvae parapodia used navigation cilia responsible propulsive platynereis dumerilii larvae possess two kinds photoreceptor cells rhabdomeric ciliary photoreceptor cells ciliary photoreceptor cells located deep brain larva shaded pigment thus perceive nondirectional light ciliary photoreceptor cells resemble molecularly morphologically rods cones human eye additional express ciliary opsin similar visual ciliary opsins

cell forms pigment cell simple pair eyes mediate phototaxis early platynereis dumerilii trochophore later nectochaete larva phototaxis mediated complex adult adult eyes express least three opsins two rhabdomeric opsins three opsins mediate phototaxis way via even scallop goopsin known p dumerilii senses chemicals four types organs antennae palps nuchal organs tentacular cirri organs detect food chemical cues alcohols esters amino acids among four types antennae primary chemosensory organs sense broad range chemicals palps specialized taste means detect foodrelated chemicals cirri thin threadlike head appendages specialized tactile sensation also give spatial information chemical cue coming since single stimulus elicit left right cirrus response different cirri also sense light shaded worm retreats rapidly tube protect behavior called shadow nuchal organ singular ciliated pit p dumerilii among annelids nuchal organs conserved seem important chemosensory function however exact function still signals four chemosensory organs processed lateral region mushroom mushroom bodies annelids resemble insects anatomy morphology gene expression probably annelids insects inherited mushroom bodies last common platynereis dumerilii builds tubes substrate substrate may algaecovered hard sea pelagic sargassum rafts sargasso even rotting plant platynereis dumerilii commonly lives depths typical shallow bright infralittoral however also found buoy rotting seaweed may also live less favorable environments like thermal polluted areas near sewer outfall dominates polluted acidic areas ph values around fitting preferred ph value subpopulation late platynereis dumerilii nectochaete larvae feed plankton migrate vertically ocean response changes light causing daily transport platynereis dumerilii dioecious means two separate changes light importantly linked reproduction bristle worm originally found bay naples displays reproductive synchrony adult worms rise en masse water surface days full moon one twohour dark portion night sunset moonrise worm natural environment important synchronize spawning increase potential gametes meet fertilize detecting nighttime lighting accordance lunar cycle worms synchronize reproductive activity worms make lcry protein better able detect appropriate light conditions synchronize release gametes addition molecule ropsin extremely sensitive light appears help detect moonrise combination signals ropsin lcry believed help worms coordinate rising common time mating male swims around female female swimming small circles release eggs sperm water release triggered sexual pheromones eggs fertilized outside body like nereidids platynereis dumerilii segmental gonades oocytes mature freely swimming body cavity stain body mature female epitoke platynereis dumerilii develops stereotypically batches therefore time used stage platynereis dumerilii larvae however temperature influences speed development therefore following developmental times given reference temperature hours fertilized egg gives rise trochophore larva hours trochophore larva becomes metatrochophore trochophore metatrochophore swim ring cilia water positively metatrochophore beside larval eyes already anlagen complex adult eyes adult day later hours fertilization metatrochophore larva becomes nectochaete larva nectochaete larva already three segments pair parapodia bearing chaetae serve nectochaete larva switch positive negative five seven days larvae start feeding develop speed depending food supply three four weeks six segments formed head normal development subdivided platynereis dumerilii lives average lifespan seven months p dumerilii reproduces dies delivering genome platynereis dumerilii diploid chromosomes haploid set n contains approximately gbp giga base pairs base genome size close average observed animals however compared many classical invertebrate molecular model organisms genome size rather large therefore challenge identify gene regulatory elements far away corresponding promoter intron rich unlike drosophila melanogaster caenorhabditis elegans thus closer vertebrate genomes including human bristle worms contain complex protein haemoglobin found vertebrates annelids eg earthworms molluscs eg pond snails crustaceans eg daphnia believed haemoglobin must evolved multiple times feature different
