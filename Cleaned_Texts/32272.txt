contextual integrity theory privacy developed helen nissenbaum presented book privacy context technology policy integrity social comprises four essential descriptive claims contextual integrity seen reaction theories define privacy control information oneself secrecy regulation personal information private sensitive places contextual integrity odds privacy regulation based fair information practice principles also line cypherpunk view newly discovered cryptographic techniques would assure privacy digital age preserving privacy matter stopping data collection blocking flows information minimizing data flow stopping information fourth essential claim comprising contextual integrity gives privacy ethical standing allows evolution alteration informational norms often due novel sociotechnical systems holds practices norms evaluated terms distinctive considerations third contextual integrity highlights importance privacy individuals society respective social domains contexts contextual integrity social domains intuitively health finance marketplace family civil political etc five critical parameters singled describe data transfer operation illustrations contextual informational norms western societies include examples data subjects include patient shopper investor reader examples information senders include bank police advertising network friend examples data recipients include bank police friend examples information types include contents email message data subjects demographic information biographical information medical information financial information examples transmission principles include consent coerced stolen buying selling confidentiality stewardship acting authority court warrant national security key thesis assessing privacy impact information flows requires values five parameters specified nissenbaum found access control rules specifying five parameters incomplete lead problematic nissenbaum notes kinds language lead ones analysis astray example passive voice used describe movement data allows speaker gloss fact active agent performing data transfer example sentence alice identity stolen allows speaker gloss fact someone something actual stealing alices identity say carol able find bobs bankruptcy records placed online implicitly ignoring fact someone organization actual collection bankruptcy records court placing records online consider norm us residents required law file tax returns us internal revenue service containing information name address ssn gross earnings etc conditions strict confidentiality given norm evaluate hypothetical scenario see violates contextual integrity norm us internal revenue service agrees supply alices tax returns city newspaper requested journalist paper hypothetical clearly violates contextual integrity providing tax information local newspaper would violate transmission principle information obtained conceptual framework contextual integrity used analyze understand privacy implications sociotechnical systems wide array platforms eg web smartphone iot systems led many tools frameworks system designs help study address privacy issues book privacy context technology policy integrity social life nissenbaum discussed privacy issues related public data discussing examples like google street view privacy concerns problems caused converting previously paperbased public records digital forms making online recent years similar issues happening context social media revived discussion shi et al examined people manage interpersonal information boundary help contextual integrity framework found information access norms related expected view researchers also applied contextual integrity controversial social events eg analytica data concept contextual integrity also influenced norms ethics research work using social media data fiesler et al studied twitter users awareness perception research work analyzed twitter data reported results paper even quoted actual tweets turned users concerns largely dependent contextual factors ie conducting research study etc line contextual integrity privacy concerns induced collection dissemination use personal data via smartphones received large amount attention different stakeholders large body computer science research aims efficiently accurately analyze sensitive personal data eg geolocation user accounts flows across app flows contextual integrity widely referred trying understand privacy concerns objective data flow traces example primal et al argued smartphone permissions would efficient prompts user applications access sensitive data likely defy expectations examined applications accessing personal data gap current practice users lin et al demonstrated multiple problematic personal data use cases due violation users expectations among using personal data mobile advertising purposes became problematic one users unaware implicit data collection behavior found unpleasantly surprising researchers informed idea contextual integrity also infiltrated design system ios android using permission system help developers manage access sensitive resources eg geolocation contact list user data etc provide users control app access data official guidelines ios android recommend developers limit use permissionprotected data situations necessary recommend developers provide short description permission requested since android users prompted runtime context app referred increased situational context documentation barth datta mitchell
