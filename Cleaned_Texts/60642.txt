kenomagnathus scottae based specimen consisting maxilla lacrimal bones skull catalogued rom originally classified belonging haptodus garnettensis frederik spindler named new genus norman newell discovered fossil locality near garnett kansas united states belonging rock lake member stanton around henry lane claude hibbard collected variety animal plant fossils locality among skeletons petrolacosaurus subsequently described frank peabody hoping find material field team university kansas natural history museum conducted excavations found trackways coelacanth fish several additional petrolacosaurus skeletons pelycosaur earlydiverging synapsid fossils representing three genera one partial skeleton distinctly differed others peabody reported discoveries paper observed skeleton primitive sphenacodontid deferred description later robert carroll found another articulated partial skeleton locality philip currie attributed skeleton primitive sphenacodontid peabody recognized new species haptodus named haptodus however point specimens h garnettensis either badly crushed immature throughout number additional specimens discovered locality including adult subadult specimens allowed michel laurin identify distinguishing characteristics h garnettensis incorporate phylogenetic analysis found outside sphenacodontidae published results among additional specimens partial skull consisting left maxilla lacrimal catalogued royal ontario museum rom rom analyses specimens assigned h garnettensis frederik spindler colleagues later suggested one four six distinct taxa among primarily differed jaws teeth also recognized differences h garnettensis type species haptodus h conference presentation spindler kirstin brink graciela piñeiro suggested variation based diet making taxa prehistoric analogue darwins spindler formally named rom belonging new genus species named kenomagnathus scottae generic name kenomagnathus derived greek words κένωμα gap γνάθος jaw referencing diastema gap tooth row meanwhile specific name scottae honours diane scott fossil preparator university toronto mississauga greatly helped teaching specimen handling inspired spindlers research prepared specimen among close relatives kenomagnathus distinguished tall snout judging maxilla especially lacrimal projection front lacrimal would formed large part rear border bony h garnettensis lacrimal still contributed border narrow upward projection front maxilla would also contributed border nostrils angle projection differed h garnettensis height lacrimal bordered front eye socket also implies kenomagnathus large toothbearing bottom margin maxilla kenomagnathus convex h garnettensis unique lacked concave region precanine step another distinguishing characteristic diastema toothless region spanning width three teeth front maxilla bone noticeably thinned could borne tooth sockets behind diastema two precanine teeth two large canine teeth least fourteen postcanine teeth eleven preserved two weakly thickened regions buttresses maxilla one canines one back due shortness maxilla canines located forward close relatives like h garnettensis kenomagnathus tall nearly straight teeth striations inner surfaces teeth reaching tips kenomagnathus slender blunter spindler identified three characteristics placed kenomagnathus sphenacodontia blunt teeth convex bottom margin maxilla height lacrimal upward projection maxilla however based contribution lacrimal border bony nostrils kenomagnathus excluded restrictive group sphenacodontoidea within evolutionary grade haptodontine sphenacodontians fragmentary nature specimens complicated resolution relationships exacerbated fact many haptodontines similar save differences teeth skull thesis spindler conducted preliminary phylogenetic analysis haptodontines based new set characteristics assembled resolve relationships defining specimens associated h garnettensis opposed kenomagnathus taxon named tenuacaptor reiszi could resolve whether kenomagnathus ianthodon basal less specialized removing tenuacaptor produced derived specialized position kenomagnathus h garnettensis inside sphenacodontia phylogenetic trees

teeth teeth several different among extinct relatives stem group mammals gradient animals isodont uniform teeth animals heterodont teeth associated development distinct zones along tooth row caninelike teeth double canines like kenomagnathus particular common among basal synapsids also basal amniotes along enlargement first premaxillary tooth front morphological gap basal synapsids like haptodus garnettensis precanine teeth less tooth variation therapsids closer mammals precanine teeth one set canines subtle tooth variation precanine teeth often replaced large diastema kenomagnathus precanine teeth diastema fills gap basal synapsids therapsids extent reflects would ongoing transition stemmammals diastemata would also gone spindler hypothesized diastema initially developed consequence maxilla premaxilla angled precanine step would prevented precanine teeth growing longer seen initial diastema h garnettensis ianthasaurus ianthodon would allowed corresponding canines lower jaw grow longer fill gap turn would led full diastema however spindler also noted relationship development precanine step tooth loss diastema unclear feeding styles animals may also spindler likened kenomagnathus enigmatic synapsid tetraceratops short faces large eyes diastema jaws implies skulls specialized food processing spindler noted comparisons cover wide range possibilities particular tetraceratops highly specialized diastema tetraceratops line position lower canines located slightly behind first premaxillary tooth would jutted front jaws closed spindler suggested tetraceratops durophagous ie fed hardshelled prey based primarily inferred similar lifestyle kenomagnathus based tall skull suggested diastema kenomagnathus may covered rigid tissue potentially enlargened lower tooth would pressed crush prey rocks kenomagnathus found originate base rock lake member stanton formation turn part lansing group rocks assigned late pennsylvanian subperiod
