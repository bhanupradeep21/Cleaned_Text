misophonia selective sound sensitivity syndrome soundrage disorder decreased tolerance specific sounds associated stimuli cues cues known triggers experienced unpleasant distressing tend evoke strong negative emotional physiological behavioral responses seen misophonia misophonic symptoms adversely affect ability achieve life goals enjoy social situations first recognized though still similar reactions trigger sounds range annoyance anger possible activation fightorflight response misophonia responses seem elicited loudness sound rather specific pattern meaning hearer triggers commonly repetitive stimuli primarily exclusively related human body chewing eating smacking lips slurping coughing throat clearing sniffing swallowing trigger stimulus detected people misophonia may difficulty distracting stimulus may experience suffering distress andor impairment social occupational academic functioning expression misophonia symptoms varies severity ranges mild severe people misophonia aware reactions misophonic triggers disproportionate circumstances misophonia symptoms typically first observed childhood early studies shown misophonia cause problems school work social life term coined professor pawel jastreboff doctor margaret jastreboff assistance classicist guy introducing article explanation international tinnitus hyperacusis societys iths term misophonia first used peerreviewed journal disorder commonly called selective sound sensitivity syndrome named audiologist marsha johnson misophonia comes ancient greek words μῖσος ipa mîːsos meaning hate φωνή ipa meaning voice sound loosely translating hate sound coined differentiate condition forms decreased sound tolerance hyperacusis hypersensitivity certain frequencies volume ranges phonophobia fear literature misophonia initial small studies showed people misophonia generally strong negative feelings thoughts physical reactions specific sounds literature calls trigger sounds sounds usually appear quiet others seem loud person misophonia cant hear anything except sound one study found around sounds related mouth eg eating slurping chewing popping gum whispering whistling nose sniffing around repetitive recent research provides neural evidence nonorofacial visual trigger may develop related trigger misophonic reaction occur absence sound examples include leg swinging hair twirling finger reactions triggers range mild anxiety discomfort andor disgust severe rage anger hatred panic fear andor emotional reactions triggers include aggression toward origin sound leaving remaining presence suffering trying block trying mimic reactions also include physical responses increased heart rate tightness chest head first misophonic reaction may occur person young often ages originate someone close relationship fear anxiety associated trigger sounds cause person avoid important social interactions may expose sounds avoidance behaviors make harder people condition achieve goals enjoy interpersonal also significant negative effect careers combined studies illustrated cases misophonia became worse time without misophonias mechanism yet fully understood appears may caused dysfunction central nervous system brain perceived origin context sound appears play important role triggering found anterior insular cortex plays role emotions like anger integrating outside input sound input organs heart lungs causes activity parts brain response triggers particularly parts responsible longterm memories fear emotions also found people misophonia higher amounts myelin fatty substance wraps around nerve cells brain provide electrical insulation clear whether myelin cause effect misophonia triggering brain study found orofacial motor cortex part brain representing lip jaw mouth movement enhanced activation typical trigger sounds much aversive neutral sounds misophonia sufferers also found enhanced functional connectivity orofacial motor cortex secondary auditory cortex sound perception sound reported resting state fmri functional connectivity orofacial motor cortex secondary auditory visual brain areas well secondary interoceptive cortex left anterior insula
