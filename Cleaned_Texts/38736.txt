alström syndrome also called rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterised childhood obesity multiple organ dysfunction symptoms include earlyonset type diabetes conerod dystrophy resulting blindness sensorineural hearing loss dilated cardiomyopathy endocrine disorders typically also occur hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism hypothyroidism well acanthosis nigricans resulting hyperinsulinemia developmental delay seen almost half people alström caused mutations gene involved formation cellular cilia making alström syndrome ciliopathy least diseasecausing mutations described alström syndrome sometimes confused syndrome another ciliopathy similar symptoms syndrome tends later onset symptoms includes polydactyly caused mutations bbs cure alström syndrome treatments target individual symptoms include diet corrective lenses hearing aids medications diabetes heart issues dialysis transplantation case kidney liver failure prognosis varies depending specific combination symptoms

alström syndrome infancy frequently detected much later doctors tend detect symptoms separate problems currently alström syndrome often diagnosed clinically since genetic testing costly available limited physical examination would needed properly diagnose patient certain physical characteristics determine patient type genetic disorder usually geneticist would perform physical examination measuring distance around head distance eyes length arms legs addition examinations nervous system eyes may performed various imaging studies like computerized tomography scans ct magnetic resonance imaging mri xrays used see structures within family personal medical history required information health individual crucial provides traces genetic diagnosiscitation needed laboratory tests particularly genetic testing performed diagnose genetic disorders types genetic testing molecular biochemical chromosomal laboratory tests performed may measure levels certain substances urine blood also help suggest diagnosiscitation needed recent findings genetic research suggested large number genetic disorders genetic syndromes genetic diseases previously identified medical literature related
