tit tat english saying meaning equivalent retaliation developed tip tap first recorded also highly effective strategy game theory agent using strategy first cooperate subsequently replicate opponents previous action opponent previously cooperative agent cooperative agent titfortat successfully used strategy iterated prisoners dilemma strategy first introduced anatol rapoport robert axelrods two held around notably occasions simplest strategy successful direct competition agent using strategy first cooperate subsequently replicate opponents previous action opponent previously cooperative agent cooperative agent similar reciprocal altruism biology term developed concretely northern ireland describe increasing eye eye mentality amongst irish republicans ulster seen red lion pub bombing ira followed mcgurks bar bombing targeting civilians specifically attacks massacres would structured around mutual killings protestant catholic communities communities generally uninterested sectarian mentality led term tit tat bombings enter common lexicon northern irish success titfortat strategy largely cooperative despite name emphasizes adversarial nature took many surprise arrayed strategies produced various teams two competitions first competition new strategies formulated specifically combat titfortat failed due negative interactions successful strategy titfortat would formulated titfortat mind result may give insight groups animals particularly human societies come live largely entirely cooperative societies rather individualistic red tooth claw way might expected individuals engaged hobbesian state nature particularly application human society politics subject robert axelrods book evolution cooperation moreover titfortat strategy beneficial use social psychologists sociologists studying effective techniques reduce conflict research indicated individuals competition period time longer trust one another effective competition reverser use titfortat strategy individuals commonly engage behavioral assimilation process tend match behaviors displayed cooperating competing group members therefore titfortat strategy begins cooperation cooperation ensues hand party competes titfortat strategy lead alternate party compete well ultimately action member countered matching response competition competition cooperation cooperation case conflict resolution titfortat strategy effective several reasons technique recognized clear nice provocable forgiving firstly clear recognizable strategy using quickly recognize contingencies adjust behavior accordingly moreover considered nice begins cooperation defects response competition strategy also provocable provides immediate retaliation compete finally forgiving immediately produces cooperation competitor make cooperative move implications titfortat strategy relevance conflict research resolution many aspects applied social take example following infinitely repeated prisoners dilemma game tit tat strategy copies player previously chose players cooperate playing strategy cc cooperate forever cooperation gives following payoff δ displaystyle delta discount factor geometric series summing player deviates defecting next round get punished alternate outcomes cooperates deviates vice versa deviation gives following payoff sum two geometric series comes expect collaboration payoff deviation better cooperation continue cooperating δ displaystyle delta geq frac continue defecting δ displaystyle delta frac axelrod empirically shown strategy optimal cases direct competition two agents playing tit tat remain vulnerable onetime singlebit error either players interpretation events lead unending death spiral one agent defects opponent cooperates agents end alternating cooperate defect yielding lower payoff agents continually cooperate situation frequently arises real world conflicts ranging schoolyard fights civil regional wars reason issues tit tat subgame perfect equilibrium except knifeedge conditions discount subgame directly reachable two agents playing tit tat strategies strategy must nash equilibrium subgames subgame perfect subgame may reached noise allowed agents signaling subgame perfect variant tit tat known contrite tit tat may created employing basic reputation knifeedge equilibrium exists exact values exogenous variables vary variables even slightest way knifeedge equilibrium nash equilibrium knifeedge equilibrium known knifeedge equilibrium equilibrium rests precariously exact value example suppose x profitable deviation left right however value x deviates amount matter small equilibrium longer stands becomes profitable deviate example x value instead thus equilibrium precarious usage wikipedia article knifeedge conditions referring fact rarely specific condition met instance x equals specific value equilibrium tit two tats could used mitigate problem see description tit tat forgiveness similar attempt escape death spiral opponent defects player employing strategy occasionally cooperate next move anyway exact probability player respond cooperation depends lineup opponents furthermore titfortat strategy proved optimal situations short total competition example parties friends may best friendship player cooperates every step despite occasional deviations player situations real world less competitive total competition titfortat strategy competition tit tat different grim trigger forgiving nature immediately produces cooperation competitor chooses cooperate grim trigger hand unforgiving strategy sense even single defect would make player playing using grim trigger defect remainder tit two tats similar tit tat allows opponent defect agreed upon strategy twice player retaliates aspect makes player using tit tat strategy appear forgiving opponent tit tat strategy opponent defects tit tat player immediately responds defecting next move unfortunate consequence causing two retaliatory strategies continuously defect resulting poor outcome players tit two tats player let first defection go unchallenged means avoid death spiral previous example opponent defects twice row tit two tats player respond defecting strategy put forward robert axelrod second round computer simulations rand analyzing results first experiment determined participant entered tit two tats strategy would emerged higher cumulative score program result entered high expectations second tournament unfortunately owing aggressive nature programs entered second round able take advantage highly forgiving nature tit two tats significantly worse gametheory sense tit bittorrent peers use titfortat strategy optimize download specifically bittorrent peers use variant tit two tats called regular unchoking bittorrent terminology bittorrent peers limited number upload slots allocate peers consequently peers upload bandwidth saturated use titfortat strategy cooperation achieved upload bandwidth exchanged download bandwidth therefore peer
