flecainide medication used prevent treat abnormally fast heart includes ventricular supraventricular use recommended dangerous arrhythmias significant symptoms managed use decrease persons risk taken mouth injection common side effects include dizziness problems seeing shortness breath chest pain serious side effects may include cardiac arrest arrhythmias heart may used pregnancy well studied use recommended structural heart disease ischemic heart flecainide class ic antiarrhythmic works decreasing entry sodium heart cells causing prolongation cardiac action flecainide approved medical use united states available generic commonly prescribed medication united states million flecainide used treatment many types supraventricular tachycardias including av nodal reentrant tachycardia avnrt wolffparkinsonwhite syndrome wpw also limited use treatment certain forms ventricular tachycardia vt particular flecainide useful treatment ventricular tachycardias setting acute ischemic event use treatment right ventricular outflow tract rvot suppression arrhythmias arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia studies notably cardiac arrhythmia suppression trial shown increased mortality flecainide used suppress ventricular extrasystoles setting acute myocardial individuals suspected brugada syndrome administration flecainide may help reveal ecg findings characteristic disease process may help make diagnosis disease equivocal flecainide introduced treatment arrhythmias children longterm flecainide seems safe people healthy heart signs left ventricular hypertrophy ischemic heart

ventricular arrhythmias take drug results significant trial stopped early preliminary results dose may need adjusted certain clinical scenarios antiarrhythmic agents risk proarrhythmia associated use flecainide risk probably increased flecainide coadministered class ic antiarrhythmics encainide risk proarrhythmia may also increased risk proarrhythmia necessarily associated length time individual

blocking sodium channel heart slowing upstroke cardiac action thereby slows conduction electrical impulse within heart ie reduces excitability greatest effect hispurkinje system ventricular myocardium
