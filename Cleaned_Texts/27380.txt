animal sexual behaviour takes many different forms including within species common mating reproductively motivated systems include monogamy polygyny polyandry polygamy promiscuity sexual behaviour may reproductively motivated eg sex apparently due duress coercion situational sexual behaviour nonreproductively motivated eg homosexual sexual behaviour bisexual sexual behaviour crossspecies sex sexual arousal objects places sex dead animals etc animal sexual behaviour reproductively motivated often termed mating copulation nonhuman mammals mating copulation occur oestrus fertile period mammalian females reproductive cycle increases chances successful animal sexual behaviour involves competition sometimes fighting multiple males females often select males mating appear strong able protect male wins fight may also chance mate larger number females therefore pass genes historically believed humans small number species performed sexual acts reproduction animals sexuality instinctive simple stimulusresponse behaviour however addition homosexual behaviours range species masturbate may use objects tools help sexual behaviour may tied strongly establishment maintenance complex social bonds across population support success nonreproductive ways reproductive nonreproductive behaviours related expressions dominance another animal survival within stressful situation sex due duress coercion sociobiology behavioural ecology term mating system used describe ways animal societies structured relation sexual behaviour mating system specifies males mate females circumstances four basic systems monogamy occurs one male one female mate exclusively monogamous mating system one individuals form longlasting pairs cooperate raising offspring pairs may last lifetime may occasionally change one mating season another emperor contrast tournament species pairbonding species lower levels male aggression competition little sexual dimorphism zoologists biologists evidence monogamous pairs animals always sexually exclusive many animals form pairs mate raise offspring regularly engage sexual activities extrapair includes previous examples swans sometimes extrapair sexual activities lead offspring genetic tests frequently show offspring raised monogamous pair come female mating extrapair male discoveries led biologists adopt new ways talking monogamy according ulrich reichard social monogamy refers male females social living arrangement eg shared use territory behaviour indicative social pair andor proximity male female without inferring sexual interactions reproductive patterns humans social monogamy takes form monogamous marriage sexual monogamy defined exclusive sexual relationship female male based observations sexual interactions finally term genetic monogamy used dna analyses confirm femalemale pair reproduce exclusively combination terms indicates examples levels relationships coincide eg sociosexual sociogenetic monogamy describe corresponding social sexual social genetic monogamous relationships whatever makes pair animals socially monogamous necessarily make sexually genetically monogamous social monogamy sexual monogamy genetic monogamy occur different combinations social monogamy relatively rare animal kingdom actual incidence social monogamy varies greatly across different branches evolutionary tree avian species socially stands contrast mammals mammalian species socially monogamous although primate species social monogamy also observed reptiles fish insects sexual monogamy also rare among animals many socially monogamous species engage extrapair copulations making sexually nonmonogamous example birds socially monogamous average baby birds nest sired someone resident patricia adair gowaty estimated different species socially monogamous songbirds sexually incidence genetic monogamy determined dna fingerprinting varies widely across species rare species incidence genetic monogamy offspring genetically related socially monogamous pair genetic monogamy strikingly low species barash lipton note highest known frequency extrapair copulations found among fairywrens lovely tropical creatures technically known malurus splendens malurus cyaneus fairywren chicks fathered males outside supposed breeding low levels genetic monogamy surprised biologists zoologists forcing rethink role social monogamy evolution longer assume social monogamy determines genes distributed species lower rates genetic monogamy among socially monogamous pairs less role social monogamy plays determining genes distributed among offspring term polygamy umbrella term used refer generally nonmonogamous matings polygamous relationships polygynous polyandrous polygynandrous small number species individuals display either polygamous monogamous behaviour depending environmental conditions example social wasp apoica flavissimacitation needed species polygyny polyandry displayed sexes population polygamy sexes observed red flour beetle tribolium castaneum polygamy also seen many lepidoptera species including mythimna unipuncta true armyworm tournament species one mating tends highly polygamous involves high levels malemale aggression tournament behaviour often correlates high levels sexual dimorphism examples species including chimpanzees baboons polygamous species present high levels tournament behaviour notable exception bonoboscitation needed polygyny occurs one male gets exclusive mating rights multiple females species notably haremlike structures one males group females mate technically polygyny sociobiology zoology defined system male relationship one female females predominantly bonded single male active male driven killed otherwise removed group number species new male ensure breeding resources wasted another males new male may achieve many different ways including von haartman specifically described mating behaviour european pied flycatcher successive within system males leave home territory primary female lays first egg males create second territory presumably order attract secondary female breed even succeed acquiring second mate males typically return first female exclusively provide polygynous mating structures estimated occur mammal polygyny common form polygamy among vertebrates including humans studied far extensively polyandry polygynandry polyandry occurs one female gets exclusive mating rights multiple males species redlip blennies polygyny polyandry males deep sea anglerfishes much smaller females find female bite skin releasing enzyme digests skin mouths body fusing pair bloodvessel level male slowly atrophies losing first digestive organs brain heart eyes ending nothing pair gonads release sperm response hormones females bloodstream indicating egg release extreme sexual dimorphism ensures female ready spawn mate immediately single anglerfish female mate many males manner polygynandry occurs multiple males mate indiscriminately multiple females numbers males females need equal vertebrate species studied far usually fewer males two examples systems primates promiscuous mating chimpanzees bonobos species live social groups consisting several males several females female copulates many males vice versa bonobos amount promiscuity particularly striking bonobos use sex alleviate social conflict well mutual promiscuity approach commonly used spawning animals perhaps original fish mating common examples forage fish herrings form huge mating shoals shallow water water becomes milky sperm bottom draped millions fertilised female male sexual behaviour differ many species often males active initiating mating bear conspicuous sexual ornamentation like antlers colourful plumage result anisogamy sperm smaller much less costly energetically produce eggs difference physiological cost means males limited number mates secure females limited quality genes mates phenomenon known batemans many females also extra reproductive burdens parental care often falls mainly exclusively thus females limited potential reproductive species males take reproductive costs sea horses jacanas role reversed females larger aggressive brightly coloured males hermaphroditic animals costs parental care evenly distributed sexes eg earthworms species planarians sexual behaviour takes form penis fencing form copulation individual first penetrates penis forces female thus carrying majority cost post mating banana slugs times gnaw partners penis act sperm competition called costly must heal spend energy courting conspecifics act male female hypothesis suggests slugs may able compensate loss male function directing energy would put towards female grey slug sharing cost leads spectacular display mates suspend high ground slime thread ensuring none refrain taking cost many animal species specific mating breeding periods eg seasonal breeding offspring born hatch optimal time marine species limited mobility external fertilisation like corals sea urchins clams timing common spawning externally visible form sexual behaviour areas continuously high primary production species series breeding seasons throughout year case primates primarily tropical subtropical animals animals opportunistic breeders breed dependent upon conditions environment aside time year mating seasons often associated changes herd group structure behavioural changes including territorialism amongst individuals may annual eg wolves biannual eg dogs frequently eg horses periods females mammalian species mentally physically receptive sexual advances period scientifically described oestrus commonly described season heat sexual behaviour may occur outside acts occur necessarily mammals eg domestic cats rabbits camelids termed induced ovulators species female ovulates due external stimulus prior mating rather ovulating cyclically spontaneously stimuli causing induced ovulation include sexual behaviour coitus sperm pheromones domestic cats penile spines upon withdrawal cats penis spines rake walls females vagina may cause many amphibians annual breeding cycle applies typically regulated ambient temperature precipitation availability surface water food supply breeding season accentuated temperate regions boreal climate breeding season typically concentrated short days spring species rana clamitans green frog spend june august defending territory order protect territories use five like many coral reef dwellers clownfish spawn around time full moon wild group clownfish strict dominance hierarchy
