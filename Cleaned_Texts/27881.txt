shoulder impingement syndrome syndrome involving tendonitis inflammation tendons rotator cuff muscles pass subacromial space passage beneath acromion particularly associated tendonitis supraspinatus result pain weakness loss movement common symptoms impingement syndrome pain weakness loss movement affected pain often worsened shoulder overhead movement may occur night especially lying affected shoulder onset pain may acute due injury insidious due gradual process osteoarthritic spur pain described dull rather sharp lingers long periods time making hard fall symptoms include grinding popping sensation movement range motion shoulder may limited pain painful arc movement may present forward elevation arm passive movement shoulder appear painful downward force applied acromion pain ease force arm raised subacromial space gap anterior edge acromion head humerus narrows supraspinatus muscle tendon passes anything causes narrowing tendency impinge tendon cause inflammatory response resulting impingement syndrome causes bony structures subacromial spurs bony projections acromion osteoarthritic spurs acromioclavicular joint variations shape acromion thickening calcification coracoacromial ligament also cause impingement loss function rotator cuff muscles due injury loss strength may cause humerus move superiorly resulting impingement inflammation subsequent thickening subacromial bursa may also cause weight training exercises arms elevated shoulder height internally rotated position upright row suggested cause subacromial another common cause impingement syndrome restrictions range movement scapulothoracic surfaces commonly one ribs rib rib side impingement may jut slightly andor feel hard person springs occurs scapula raised anteverted angled forwards turn pushes acromion humeral head usual anatomical position placing pressure downwards head humerus position nerve thus causing impingement syndrome visibly demonstrated slightly raised protracted shoulder girdle note humerus anteverts position causing protrusive section humerus press upwards towards acromion scapula plays important role shoulder impingement wide flat bone lying posterior thoracic wall provides attachment three different groups muscles intrinsic muscles scapula include muscles rotator cuff subscapularis infraspinatus teres minor muscles attach surface scapula responsible internal external rotation glenohumeral joint along humeral abduction extrinsic muscles include biceps triceps deltoid muscles attach coracoid process supraglenoid tubercle scapula infraglenoid tubercle scapula spine scapula muscles responsible several actions glenohumeral joint third group mainly responsible stabilization rotation scapula consists trapezius serratus anterior levator scapulae rhomboid muscles attach medial superior inferior borders scapula muscles role shoulder function must balance others order avoid shoulder pathology abnormal scapular function called scapular dyskinesis one action scapula performs throwing serving motion elevation acromion process order avoid impingement rotator cuff scapula fails properly elevate acromion impingement may occur cocking acceleration phase overhead activity two muscles commonly inhibited first part overhead motion serratus anterior lower two muscles act force couple within glenohumeral joint properly elevate acromion process muscle imbalance exists shoulder impingement may develop scapula may also misplaced rib deep moving correctly often case shoulder impingement syndrome scapula may anteverted shoulder affected side appears protracted ribs may cause anteversion scapula include ribs impingement syndrome diagnosed targeted medical history physical also argued least medical generally xray initially andor response local anesthetic necessary workup however imaging studies unable show cause shoulder pain diagnosing example mri imaging would show rotator cuff pathology bursitis unable specify physical exam physician may twist elevate patients arm test reproducible pain neer sign hawkinskennedy test tests help localize pathology rotator cuff however specific neer sign may also seen subacromial physician may inject lidocaine usually combined steroid bursa improved range motion decrease pain considered positive impingement test supports diagnosis impingement syndrome also plain xrays shoulder used detect joint pathology variations bones including acromioclavicular arthritis variations acromion calcification however xrays allow visualization soft tissue thus hold low diagnostic ultrasonography arthrography mri used detect rotator cuff muscle pathology mri best imaging test prior arthroscopic due lack understanding pathoaetiology lack diagnostic accuracy assessment process many several opinions recommended interventioncitation needed impingement syndrome usually treated conservatively sometimes treated arthroscopic surgery open conservative treatment includes rest cessation painful activity physical therapy physical therapy treatments would typically focus maintaining range movement improving posture strengthening shoulder muscles reduction pain nsaids ice packs may used pain therapeutic exercises might favorable intervention compared passive treatment approaches electrotherapy placebo recent metaanalysis done rotator cuff tendinopathy shown nearly types active resistance training programs proven effective improving pain shoulder function significant differences among different exercise types cementing favorability active intervention passive modalities comes rotator cuff exercises may help regain scapulohumeral rhythm scapular control may reduce therapeutic injections corticosteroid local anaesthetic may used persistent impingement total number injections generally limited three due possible side effects review found corticosteroid injections give small transient pain number surgical interventions available depending nature location pathology surgery
