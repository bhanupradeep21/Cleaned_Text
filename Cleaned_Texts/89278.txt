consequence mummification caused withered nuchal amnh allowed first accurate reconstruction hand skeleton hadrosaurid barnum brown showed carpus mummy consist two complete rows ossified carpals othniel charles marsh assumed reconstruction two ossified carpals present mummy elements lie directly third metacarpal arrangement probably reflects original position living animal since hands show brown pointed first finger missing second fifth fingers consisted three phalanges marsh reconstructed first finger reduced element two phalanges fifth finger absent fingers mummy partially connected envelope skin impressions osborn suggested skin envelope represented webbing fingers forelimb would functioned paddle considered clear indication aquatic lifestyle trachodon edmontosaurus presumably representatives trachodontidae hadrosauridae webbing would connected fingers would also extended cm beyond fingertips furthermore osborn noted lack clearly pronounced hooves large fleshy foot pads expected primarily landdwelling senckenberg mummy another trachodon specimen supposed webbing discovered possible aquatic lifestyle hadrosaurids proposed particular based great depth flat sides wellpreserved tail discovered brown hypothesis appeared accordance account edward drinker cope describing hadrosaurid teeth slightly attached delicate therefore suitable feeding soft aquatic plants discovery two mummies hypothesis aquatic lifestyle became undisputed charles h sternberg wrote reluctently giving marshs copes ideas believed dinosaurs lived land feeding tender foliage trees entirely different views held duckbills lived water instead land consequently thin skin strong paddles rather webbed john h ostrom voiced doubts webbedfinger hypothesis ostrom able show hadrosaurids feed soft aquatic plants previously assumed elaborate chewing apparatus designed crush resistant plant material conifers skeletal anatomy would furthermore indicate highly specialized twolegged locomotion land ostrom noted hadrosaurids showed osteoderms similar structures defend predators found many herbivorous dinosaurs suggested webs may used allow escape water case robert bakker argued animal webs skin fingers remnant fleshy pad enveloping hand dried flattened mummification similar skin structures originating foot pads found modernday mummified camel carcasses furthermore bakker argued fingers short could hardly spread apart distinguishes fundamentally long spread toes todays paddling animals bakker concluded far best duckbills must clumsiest slowest swimmers today webbing hypothesis widely phil senter examined amnh several hadrosaurid specimens reconstruct orientation hand trackway evidence indicates palm directed inwards slightly backwards many hadrosaurid skeletons instead mounted palm hand facing backwards reconstructions radius either crosses ulna instead parallel connects inner two condyles humerus instead outer although palms mummy face backwards carcass lay back caused

tendons preserved along dorsal spine thick pencil sternberg speculated tendons served defensive structures could penetrated claws predatory dinosaurs contemporary today known tendons stiffened spine probably counteract bending forces spine walking although tail preserved mummy edmontosaurus specimens show also stiffened sternberg also reported carbonized food remains discovered stomach region analysis remains yet kräusel investigated concretion brown plant material senckenberg mummy consisted mainly branches needles conifers mummies possibility ruled plant material washed abdominal cavity death osborn observed clusters pavement tubercles numerous upper sides trunk limbs underside consequently would dominate areas would exposed sun animal alive many reptiles living today sunexposed

information principle derived skin impressions dinosaur philip manning colleagues concluded skin dinosaur mummies simply preserved impression contains original biomolecules derivatives researchers inferred presence melanin pigments skin another edmontosaurus mummy nicknamed dakota clarifying reconstruction coloration currently possible given many different factors influence coloration remarked melanin distribution may potentially allow deriving monochrome blackandwhite picture animals pigmentation pattern chemical analysis amnh would problematic however consolidating chemicals applied skin edmontosaurus specimens sides snout excavated large elongated depression circumnarial depression housed nostrils confirmed amnh fleshy nostril would occupied entire depression richard swann lull nelda wright publication suggested skin impressions preserved within depression deepening possible skin front part depression could mark position fleshy nostrils skin smooth wrinkled tubercles absent contrast rest accordingly paleoart often shows remainder depression occupied scaleless inflatable bladder however albert prietomárquez jonathan wagner found low subtle impressions polygonal scales frontmost part depression behind beak scales suggest rest skin covered depression might scaly reason authors preferred older interpretation james hopson proposed scaly bladder brightly colored skin scales became visible bladder prietomárquez wagner suggested sedimentary ridges within depression likely represent former softtissue structures rear edge bony nostril extended towards front flange probably cartilaginous structure indicating rear part bony nostril covered soft tissue forming nasal cavity covering apparently restricted rear part likely opening nasal passage skull interior would also situated ridge running diagonally across depression might cartilaginous septum supporting nasal cavity ridge ends lower front depression likely location fleshy nostril nasal cavity ridge supported would therefore main nasal air several authors discussed question animal died circumstances led exceptionally good preservation charles h sternberg charles sternberg assumed animal died water gases accumulating abdomen death would floated carcass belly pointing upwards head moving final position shoulder carcass would sunk bottom come rest back become covered sediments skin would drawn body cavity load due escape osborn suggested another scenario animal could died natural death carcass would exposed sun longer time dry riverbed unaffected scavengers muscles intestines would completely dried thus shrunk whereby hard leathery skin sank body cavity finally adhered tightly bones forming natural mummy end dry season mummy would hit sudden flood transported distance quickly covered sediments embedding site fine grain size sediment fine river sand sufficient clay content would led perfect impressions filigree skin structures hardened skin could today osborns hypothesis considered cause death specimen speculated kenneth carpenter considered starvation drought likely cause death given similarity mummy cadavers todays animals found droughts loss muscle mass due malnutrition could also partly explain mummys skin sunken around furthermore carcass affected scavengers could due drought keeping scavengers away affected area leading accumulation many carcasses could handled existing scavengers observed modern droughts furthermore carpenter noted todays large eventoed ungulates closely bound water droughts prevent overheating main cause death animals droughts starvation thirst mummy discovered river sediments therefore animal likely died near river least dry sediments discovery site deposited meandering river type river constantly migrates riverbed eroding cut bank bank outside river bends depositing sediment slipoff slope inside bends slipoff slope forms characteristic sediment sequence known point bar carpenter concluded photograph taken excavation mummy discovered within point bar suspected carcass embedded flood events end drought carcass would obstacle current resulting rapid burial water flowed around carcass velocity would increased leading removal sediment carcass would successively sunk resulting depression additional sediment led burial would originated cut banks collapsing river upstream indicated high clay content sandstones sediment load carried river would deposited current velocity thus carrying capacity diminished case end flood carcass would embedded within hours taphonomic processes affected mummy burial difficult reconstruct samples surrounding sedimentary rocks exist probably slow bacterial decay carcass initiated first carpenter emphasized excellent preservation fossil made possible minerals formed bacteria biomineralization minerals would solidified clayrich sand surrounding mummy resulting unusual threedimensional preservation time solidified sediment would preserved skin impressions contact surface sand cadaver mineralization furthermore anchored bones anatomical position thus prevented falling apart soft tissue decayed important minerals formed burial would include calcium carbonate calcite iron carbonate siderite latter oxidized limonite would responsible rusty color mummy less complete decomposition soft tissue cavity remained cemented sediment subsequently filled sand together
