description moved subfamily later elevated family nothrotheriidae sloths put new subfamily sloths moved back family megatheriidae thalassocninae may diverged megatheriinae friasian age miocene around however analysis retains thalassocninae within given two families question may position thalassocninae within either would likely fairly basal correct family placement may difficult five species seem form one direct lineage chronospecies however possible antiquus ancestor nothrotherium eremotherium megatherium antiquus natans littoralis carolomartini yaucensis thalassocnus aquatic group includes sloths anteaters ground sloth eionaletherium miocene venezuela may adapted nearshore life well ahytherium pleistocene however thalassocnus may also adapted terrestrial lifestyle based record thalassocnus time progressed increased natans complete skeleton preserved measures snout tail meters ft based femurtobodylength ratio littoralis meters ft life yuacensis specimen meters later thalassocnus species enlarged premaxillae thus elongated snout lower jaw progressively elongated became spoonshaped possibly mimicking function splayed incisor teeth ruminants later species stronger lips indicated large size infraorbital foramen supplies blood vessels like modern day grazers probably horny pads lips like grazers snout square shape opposed triangular shape browsers nostrils moved front snout top snout similar later species adapt feeding underwater soft palate mouth separating trachea esophagus developed internal nostrils nasal cavity throat farther inside head also increased size mouth however adaptations also developed terrestrial mammals could instead related chewing efficiency masseter muscle skull probably main muscle used biting later species powerful bite better grasp seagrass pterygoid muscle later species larger adapt grinding motion rather cutting motion latest species carolomartini yaucensis show evidence short trunk similar tapirs elephant thalassocnus hypsodont dentition pattern high tooth crowns tooth enamel extending beyond gums thalassocnus lacked canine teeth four upper three lower molars either side mouth similar sloths teeth outer coating durodentine bonelike version dentine softer vasodentine inside form dentine allows blood flow teeth prismshaped circular cross section teeth interlocked tightly chewing later species earlier species chewing pattern sharpened teeth earlier species rectangular teeth similar build giant ground sloth megatherium americanum whereas later species squarer larger teeth earlier species later species teeth show change function cutting food grinding thalassocnus neck vertebrae thoracic vertebrae compared megatheriid sloths lumbar vertebrae like ground sloths tail vertebrae opposed ground sloths less vertebral centra segments progressively became shorter length making spine stable probably adaptation digging later species spinous processes jut upwards vertebrae markedly taller thoracic vertebrae neck vertebrae opposed sloths around height small neck vertebrae show weak neck muscles aquatic creature need hold head neck probably faced downwards rest however atlantooccipital joint controls neck movement stronger sloths probably adaptation bottom feeding keep head fixed also evolved stiffer fused like whales head could align directly spinous process first thoracic vertebra nearly vertical unlike sloths vertebrae incline towards tail inclination increases later species littoralis carolomartini inclination opposed antiquus natans inclination inclination begins decrease ninth thoracic vertebra inclination may caused lessdeveloped back muscles would needed highpowered structure tail vertebrae indicates strong musculature similar beaver castor spp platypus ornithorhynchus anatinus use tails balance diving rather propulsion swimming length tail proportionally longer ground sloths probably diving adaptation similar modern day cormorants phalacrocorax spp use long tails provide downward lift resist indicated large fossae depressions shoulder blades elbow wrist later thalassocnus species strong arm muscles relatively shorter arms probably adaptations digging thalassocnus five decreasing width legs later species reduction iliac crests pelvis indicate less reliance animal probably preferred sit semisubmerged water legs also became flexible later species able maximum extension femora reach horizontal position parallel torso femur kneecap smaller yuacensis natans unlike ground sloths put lot stress hind limbs standing two legs leg bones thalassocnus slender bipedalism also led shorter tibiae ground sloths opposite seen thalassocnus tibiae femora earlier species like sloths bore weight sides feet pedolateral whereas later species planted feet flat plantigrade better paddle walk along seafloor digits decreased size later species third digit constantly flexed perhaps acting like crampon anchor seafloor digging like ground sloths fifth digit vestigial thick dense bones younger species pachyosteosclerosis allowed animal combat buoyancy sink seafloor similar modern day manatees antiquus bone density comparable terrestrial ground sloths later species bone grew compact medullary cavity holds bone marrow nearly absent limbs likewise limbs made heaviest contribution overall skeletal weight condition seen ancient archaeocete whales reduced limbs developed relatively short period time around million years modern pilosan sloths anteaters already denser bones mammals sloth may predisposition dense bones developed much faster thalassocnus nearshore herbivores likely became aquatic due desertification land lack terrestrial earlier species likely general grazers foraged seagrass seaweed along sandy coastline indicated scratch marks teeth caused chewing sand probably foraging areas depth less meter ft antiquus probably enter water feed instead eating plants washed ashore conversely later species carolomartini yaucensis lacking marks probably fed deeper waters manner similar manatees earlier species chewed jaws going mash food whereas later species chewed jaws going front back grind later species fed entirely seafloor similar sirenians manatees dugongs extinct desmostylians becoming specialist bottom feeders seagrasses probably fed zosteraceae seagrasses known pisco formation specifically marine eelgrass zostera tasmanica known later thalassocnus probably mainly walked across seafloor instead swimming water possessed adaptations highpowered swimming probably paddling like terrestrial mammals later species probably dug seagrasses roots claws like beaver platypus though like sirenians also used strong lips rip grasses diet may also included buried thalassocnus may used claws loosening dirt cutting vegetation grasping food anchoring seafloor may also used claws grab onto rocks strong waves tibiae fibulae remains broken healed indicating individual may thrown rocks shore storm individual may used claws drag onto thalassocnus may competed dugongine sirenians seagrasses although latter apparently rare along marine mammals bahía inglesa formation specifically cerro ballena could killed harmful algal may preyed upon macroraptorial sperm whale injured individuals vulnerable shark thalassocnus may exhibited sexual dimorphism indicated variation individual fossils littoralis two skulls carolomartini skulls show disparity general size slenderness teeth length make snout size difference premaxillae reminiscent developed upper lips proboscis males modern mammals like elephant seal

bluntnose sixgill shark hexanchus several penguin species known three formations ancient banded penguins spheniscus thalassocnus went extinct end pliocene due cooling trend followed closing central american seaway killed much seagrass pacific south american seagrass specialists later species thalassocnus evolved negative buoyancy allow feed sea floor similar modern dugongs feeding style probably involved bottomwalking like hippopotamuses extinct desmostylians digging negative buoyancy requires dense bones limited layer blubber would make thermoregulation difficult cooler water temperatures particularly view low metabolic rate thus thalassocnus would poorly adapted changing conditions even enough seagrass remained subsist httpsenwikipediaorgwikithalassocnus
