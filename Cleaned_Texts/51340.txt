rather animal behavior emerging fields evolutionary biology particular evolutionary psychology argued despite complexity human social behaviors precursors human morality traced behaviors many social animals sociobiological explanations human behavior remain controversial social scientists traditionally viewed morality construct thus culturally relative although others sam harris argue objective science morality though animals may possess humans may perceive moral behavior social animals modify restrain behaviors group living worthwhile typical examples behavioral modification found societies ants bees termites ant colonies may possess millions individuals e wilson argues single important factor leads success ant colonies existence sterile worker caste caste females subservient needs mother queen given reproduction order raise brothers sisters existence sterile castes among social insects significantly restricts competition mating process fosters cooperation within colony cooperation among ants vital solitary ant improbable chance longterm survival reproduction however part group colonies thrive decades consequence ants one successful families species planet accounting biomass rivals human basic reason social animals live groups opportunities survival reproduction much better groups living alone social behaviors mammals familiar humans highly social mammals primates elephants known exhibit traits thought uniquely human like empathy humanitys closest living relatives common chimpanzees bonobos primates share common ancestor humans lived four six million years ago

include high intelligence capacity symbolic communication sense social norms realization self concept frans de waal barbara king view human morality grown primate sociality many social animals primates dolphins whales shown exhibit michael shermer refers premoral sentiments according shermer following characteristics shared humans social animals particularly great apes shermer argues premoral sentiments evolved primate societies method restraining individual selfishness building cooperative groups social species benefits part altruistic group outweigh benefits individualism example lack group cohesion could make individuals vulnerable attack outsiders part group may also improve chances finding food evident among animals hunt packs take large dangerous prey social animals societies member knows placecitation needed social order maintained certain rules expected behavior dominant group members enforce order punishment however higher order primates also sense reciprocity chimpanzees remember favors wrongcitation needed example chimpanzees likely share food individuals previously groomed vampire bats also demonstrate sense reciprocity altruism share blood regurgitation share randomly likely share bats shared past dire need animals capuchin also display understanding fairness refusing cooperate presented unequal rewards behaviors chimpanzees live

numerical limit theorized hard coded genes since even modern humans difficulty maintaining stable social relationships people according dr de waal human morality two extra levels sophistication found primate societies humans enforce societys moral codes much rigorously rewards punishments reputation building people also apply degree judgment reason seen animal kingdomcitation needed evolutionary biologists game theorists argue since gradual evolutionary models morality require incremental evolution altruism populations egoism cruelty initially reigned sense occasional altruism otherwise egoistic cruel individuals worse consistent cruelty would made evolution morality impossible due early stages moral evolution selected sentiments causing individuals morality treated worse morality would caused low degree morality become adaptive valley would preclude early steps away morality condition precluding early necessary condition later evolution higher degrees morality scientists argue rules evolutionary explanations specific type morality feels disgust empathy rarely empathic individuals assuming psychopathic machiavellianism rule evolution types morality accept little altruism better altruism groups may benefit avoiding certain behaviors harmful behaviors effect regardless whether offending individuals aware since individuals increase reproductive success many characteristics entail impunity positively selected specifically punishing individuals aware breach rules would select ability aware precluding coevolution conscious choice sense basis moral penal
