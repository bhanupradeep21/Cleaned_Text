misleading since many factors included give meaningful answer eg definition success calculation total rates influenced age overall reproductive health patient orgasm insemination literature conflicting immobilization insemination increasing chances pregnancy previous data suggests statistically significant patient remain immobile minutes insemination another review article claims point

factors including higher risk twins triplets minor vaginal bleeding although risk factors minor generally manageable significant knowledge gap identity groups around risk factors fertility treatments general instance found lgbtq individuals significant knowledge gaps risk factors associated reproductive outcomes compared heterosexual female peers therefore imperative providers take extra care educating lgbtq patients potential risk factors artificial insemination implications knowledge gap lgtbq individuals heterosexual counterparts serious worth noting lack access proper information risk factors around procedures like may dissuade someone pursuing procedures altogether result less normalization lgbtq family making reproduction perpetuates cycle lack information among lgbtq folks countries restrict artificial insemination variety ways example countries permit ai single women countries permit use donor sperm may following european countries permit medically assisted ai single
