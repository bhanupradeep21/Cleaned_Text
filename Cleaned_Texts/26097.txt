enterohemorrhagic e coli ehec major causes foodborne illness infecting large intestine humans often cause gastroenteritis enterocolitis bloody diarrhea hence name enterohemorrhagic sometimes cause severe complication called hemolyticuremic syndrome cattle important natural reservoir ehec colonised adult ruminants asymptomatic lack vascular expression target receptor shiga group subgroups known

induce bloody diarrhea lead hus cases clinical manifestations postdiarrheal hus include acute renal failure microangiopathic hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia verocytotoxin shigalike toxin directly damage renal endothelial cells thrombocytopenia occurs platelets consumed clotting hemolytic anemia results intravascular fibrin deposition increased fragility red blood cells antibiotics questionable value shown clear clinical benefit antibiotics interfere dna synthesis fluoroquinolones shown induce stxbearing bacteriophage cause increased production attempts block toxin production antibacterials target ribosomal protein synthesis conceptually attractive plasma exchange offers controversial possibly helpful treatment use antimotility agents medications suppress diarrhea slowing bowel transit children years age elderly patients avoided increase risk hus ehec clinical presentation ranges mild uncomplicated diarrhea hemorrhagic colitis severe abdominal pain serotype may trigger infectious

least one reference holds ehec mutually exclusive vtec match common usage many publications lump latter former current microbiologybased view shigalike toxin slt verotoxin referred versions shiga

every stec would vtec line also drawn use stec strains vtec strains since closer shiga toxin practically choice words categories important understanding clinical relevance infectivity virulence ehec strain depends several factors including presence fucose medium sensing sugar activation ehec pathogenicity islandcitation needed ehec becomes pathogenic expression locus enterocyte effacement lee encoded pathogenicity island however ehec host expression waste energy resources activated molecules sensed environmentcitation needed qsec qsee bind one interacting signalling molecule autophosphorylate transfer phosphate response regulator qsec senses adrenaline noradrenaline endonuclease isceiii encoded mobile group intron within mitochondrial gene whereas qsee senses adrenaline noradrenaline signals clear indication bacteria longer free environment gutcitation needed result qsec phosphorylates qseb activates flagella kpde activates lee qsef qsee phosphorylates qsef products qsebc qseef repress expression fusk fusr fusk fusr two components system repress transcription lee genes fusk sensor kinase able sense many sugars among fucose fucose present medium fusk phosphorylates fusr represses lee expressioncitation needed thus ehec enters gut competition signals coming qsec qsef signal coming fusk first two would like activate virulence fusk stops mucous layer source fucose isolates enterocytes bacteria making synthesis virulence factors useless however fucose concentration decreases bacterial cells find unprotected area epithelium expression lee genes repressed fusr kpde strongly activate summary combined effect qsecqsef fuskr provide finetuning system lee expression saves energy allow mechanisms virulence expressed chances success highercitation needed shiga toxins major virulence factor ehec toxins interact intestinal epithelium cause systematic complications humans like hus cerebral dysfunction enter ehec shiga toxins encoded lysogenic bacteriophages toxins bind cellsurface glycolipid receptor causes cell take toxin via endocytosis shiga toxins target ribosomal rna inhibits protein synthesis causes reason ehec symptomless cattle cattle vascular expression unlike humans thus shiga toxins pass intestinal epithelium complex formed two components fusk fusr function ehec detect presence fucose environment regulate activation lee genescitation needed fucose increases activation fuskr system inhibits gene controls metabolism fucose mechanisms useful avoid competition fucose strains e coli usually efficient using fucose carbon source high concentrations fucose medium also increases repression lee genes low levels fucose environment fuskr system inactive means gene transcribed thus increasing metabolism fucose furthermore low concentration fucose indication unprotected epithelium thus repression ler genes disappear expression lee genes allow attack adjacent cellscitation needed
