understanding simple logic understand importance surprise humor hence choose slapstick humor instead correct punch line however registered surprise connect punch line body joke fully appreciate true humor behind successful jokes require juxtaposition sound meaning words used understand punchline however patients witzelsucht difficulty connecting two resulting inability appreciate additionally
