transient synovitis hip also called toxic synovitis see synonyms selflimiting condition inflammation inner lining synovium capsule hip joint term irritable hip refers syndrome acute hip pain joint stiffness limp nonweightbearing indicative underlying condition transient synovitis orthopedic infections like septic arthritis everyday clinical practice however irritable hip commonly used synonym transient synovitis confused sciatica condition describing hip lower back pain much common adults transient synovitis similar signs symptoms transient synovitis usually affects children three ten
