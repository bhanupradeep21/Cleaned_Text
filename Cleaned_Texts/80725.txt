cutaneous rabbit illusion also known cutaneous saltation sometimes cutaneous rabbit effect cre tactile illusion evoked tapping two separate regions skin rapid succession illusion readily evoked regions body surface relatively poor spatial acuity forearm rapid sequence taps delivered first near wrist near elbow creates sensation sequential taps hopping arm wrist towards elbow although physical stimulus applied two actual stimulus locations similarly stimuli delivered first near elbow near wrist evoke illusory perception taps hopping elbow towards wrist illusion discovered frank geldard carl sherrick princeton university early characterized geldard many subsequent studies geldard sherrick likened perception rabbit hopping along skin giving phenomenon name rabbit illusion extensively studied tactile domain analogous sensory saltation illusions observed word saltation refers leaping jumping nature percept moment discovery cutaneous rabbit illusion piqued curiosity researchers many experiments investigating effect conducted forearm studies consistently shown rabbit illusion occurs successive taps closely spaced time illusion disappears temporal separation taps exceeds seconds study showed attention directed one skin location reduces perceptual migration tap placed attended another study showed illusory taps associated neural activity area brains sensory map activated real taps nevertheless specific neural mechanisms underlie rabbit illusion unknown many interesting instantiations cutaneous rabbit illusion observed illusion confined subjects supported stick across index fingertips received taps via stick reported sensing illusory taps along stick suggests cutaneous rabbit effect involves intrinsic somatotopic representation also representation extended body schema results bodyobject interactions research shown illusion occur across noncontiguous body regions however subpopulation participants apparently experience effect illusion also shown occur within across arms suggesting illusion occurs perceptual stages visual flashes placed particular locations along influence cutaneous rabbit addition auditory tactile stimuli interact rabbit researchers philips electronics demonstrated jacket lined actuator motors designed evoke various tactile sensations watching movie device takes advantage cutaneous rabbit illusion reduce number actuators keeping prediction bayesian model perceptual attraction stimulus points enhanced stimuli made computational models put forward several authors effort explain origins cutaneous rabbit bayesian perceptual closely replicates cutaneous rabbit tactile spatiotemporal illusions according model brain circuitry encodes expectation acquired sensory experience tactile stimuli tend stationary move slowly bayesian model reaches optimal probabilistic inference combining uncertain spatial sensory information prior expectation lowspeed movement gaussian prior distribution velocity mean expectation stimuli tend move slowly results perceptual conclusion rapidly successive stimuli likely closer together skin bayesian model shown replicate perception humans simple eg twotap complex

greater extent made smaller becomes large l approaches l illusion models parameter tau τ time constant tactile space perception value tau determines rapidly perceived length approaches actual length time stimuli increased perceived length equals onethird actual length τ twothirds actual length goldreich tong showed tau ratio observers lowspeed expectation tactile spatial acuity estimated value tau approximately novel prediction bayesian model pointed goldreich tong amount length contraction experienced depend intensity tactile stimulus lighter taps difficult localize produce larger tau values therefore length contraction tong et al confirmed prediction illusion appears closely related rabbit illusion tau effect tau effect arises observer judges distance consecutive stimuli sequence distance one stimulus next constant time elapsed one stimulus next constant subjects tend perceive interval shorter time also shorter thus like rabbit illusion tau effect reveals stimulus timing affects perception stimulus spacing goldreich proposed cutaneous rabbit illusion tau effect result lowspeed prior expectation indeed bayesian perceptual length contraction formula another illusion plausibly related cutaneous rabbit tau effect kappa effect kappa effect perceptual time essence converse tau effect longer two spatial intervals stimuli perceived longer time goldreich showed conditions temporal well spatial uncertainty bayesian model produces kappa effect perceptual length contraction formula case still applies formula refers perceived rather actual time
