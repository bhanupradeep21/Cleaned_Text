cell culture biology confluence refers percentage surface culture dish covered adherent cells example percent confluence means roughly half surface covered percent confluence means surface completely covered cells room left cells grow cell number refers trivially number cells given region many cell lines exhibit differences growth rate gene expression depending degree confluence cells typically passaged becoming fully confluent order maintain proliferation phenotype cell types limited contact inhibition immortalized cells may continue divide form layers top parent cells achieve optimal consistent results experiments usually performed using cells particular confluence depending cell type extracellular export cell free material also dependent cell confluence comparing amount space covered cells unoccupied space using naked eye provide rough estimate confluency hemocytometer used count cells giving cell number httpsenwikipediaorgwikiconfluency
