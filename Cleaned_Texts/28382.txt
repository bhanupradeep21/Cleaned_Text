dopaminergic neurons circuit increase magnitude phasic firing response positive reward error reward exceeds expected reward neurons decrease phasic firing negative reward prediction less reward expected leading hypothesis serotonergic rather dopaminergic neurons encode reward losscitation needed dopamine phasic activity also increases cues signal negative events however dopaminergic neuron stimulation still induces place preference indicating main role evaluating positive stimulus findings two hypotheses developed role basal ganglia nigrostiatal dopamine circuits action selection first model suggests critic encodes value actor encodes responses stimuli based perceived value however second model proposes actions originate basal ganglia instead originate cortex selected basal ganglia model proposes direct pathway controls appropriate behavior indirect suppresses actions suitable situation model proposes tonic dopaminergic firing increases activity direct pathway causing bias towards executing actions models basal ganglia thought relevant study adhd tourette syndrome parkinsons disease schizophrenia addiction example parkinsons disease hypothesized result excessive
