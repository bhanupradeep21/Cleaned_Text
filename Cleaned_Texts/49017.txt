bone malrotation refers situation results bone heals rotational alignment another bone part bone often occurs result surgical complication fracture intramedullary nailing imn especially femur tibial bones also occur genetically birth severity complication often neglected due complexity detect yet left untreated bone malrotation significantly impact regular bodily functioning even lead severe arthritis detection throughout history become advanced accurate ranging clinical assessment ultrasounds ct computed tomography scans treatment include osteotomy major surgical procedure bones cut realigned correctly compensatory methods individuals learn externally internally rotate limb compensate rotation research currently examined area reduce occurrences malrotation including detailed computer navigation improve visual accuracy bone malrotation predominantly occurs injury bone fractured however malrotation genetically occur foetal development usually occurs surgery involves intramedullary nailing insertion metal rods nails stabilise bones nailing used requires minimal surgical dissection less disruption fracture hematoma allows faster functionality patient however due semiclosed nature im impossible correct direct vision less rotational control compared traditional open methods plate result many cases intramedullary nailing bone misaligned causes malrotated regrowth torsional error major problem femoral tibial fractures occurs patients receive femur fracture femoral malrotation significant bone malrotation issue errors cause cosmetic problems also cause drastic physical historically bone malrotation occurred due lack adequate treatment measures fixation methods traction casting nonlocked nails provided poor torsional stability currently utilisation locked intramedullary nailing reduced occurrence rotational malalignment fracture healing yet femoral malrotation continues remain prevalent due surgeons inability reliably restore preinjury alignment high attention detail necessary intraoperatively avoid complication locking intramedullary utilisation radiological clinical assessment techniques compare injured limb would also help prevent bone malrotation however difficult inexact methods assessment complications difficult assess diagnose rotational malalignment bone operation many methodologies developed clinical assessment observation one methodology however unreliable lead complications femoral tibial malrotation many surgeons use patients ankle patella symmetrically align injured side floor method consider position proximal fragment could moved reduction order measure femoral malalignment many doctors compare internal external rotation hips patient supine prone change patients range movement indicates malrotation however clinical assessment indicate direction malrotation often reports inaccurate measurements degree malalignment unreliable determining potential impacts necessary treatment another diagnosis methodology sometimes utilised radiographs however unreliable require difficult patient positioning quantify rotational difficulty due patients restriction movement may exhibit posttraumatic deformities severe pain determine level femoral malrotation method two radiographs pelvis upper legs must made firstly anteroposterior ap perspective shows degree difference femoral neck femur another view hips knees flexed right angle determines antetorsion radiographs utilised calculate angle anteversion femoral ultrasounds also used measure bone malrotation considered highly reliable main issue utilising ultrasound measurement relies largely skills ultrasound technician consequently widely used measuring femoral malrotation ultrasounds patients thighs fixed symmetrically degree rotation femoral shaft measured methodology requires exact positioning patient correctly measure mri scans utilised proven reliable effective determining malrotation bones however readily available ct scanners also time consuming standard bone malrotation detection practice utilised computed tomography scans able exactly quantify amount rotational also considered highly reliable utilised reproducibility femoral malrotation scan involves doctors measuring angle line axis femoral neck line tangential femoral condyles angle difference uninjured injured sides determines degree malrotation increase anteversion femoral neck injured side denotes internal rotation decrease means external rotation occurred another advantage ct scans patient positioning impact measurement accuracy femoral torsion unlike radiographs ultrasounds however inaccurate measurements malrotation still occur ct scans mostly related difficulty drawing clear accurate lines along femoral neck within image avoid inaccuracy needs improved accuracy line drawn fixed utilisation multiimage superimposed projection ct images accurate measurement whilst malrotation bone tolerated cases still cause severe impacts functional outcome patients whilst tibial fractures common long bone fractures malrotation femur cause significant impacts regular untreated femoral malrotation cause considerable gait disturbance abnormal hip joint malrotation femur setting midshaft fracture impact axis entire leg shifts centre force knee away neutral position consequently femoral malrotation significant impacts mechanical axis force vectors within knee cause pain hip knee patients may limited movement impair function especially physically demanding activities walking stairs impact persons satisfaction life may physically unable things want need laborious work leisure activities raising family significant impacts psychological health femoral malrotation also cause abnormally rotated foot angle persons foot directly related angle another significant long term consequence femoral malrotation untreated degenerative arthritis hip joint arthrosis occurs proven correlation rotational error axis deviation arthrosis knee hip joints however severity arthrosis dependent percentage whilst malrotation problems occurred surgery patients less difference malrotation compared uninjured side rarely complained however patients differences greater found noticeable issues malrotation difference resulted serious external femoral malrotation usually much better tolerated internal however older studies found external rotational deformities poorly shows need research area two main treatment methods corrective surgery fix malrotation compensatory methods patients learn compensate malrotation walking many people bone malrotation femoral malrotation able functionally tolerate learn compensatory methods externally internally adjusting limb patients compensate even considerable rotational malalignment active however femoral malrotation difficult compensate maintain nonoperative treatment patients femoral malrotation less degrees give less complaints higher amounts malalignment yet many patients able tolerate deformity extreme cases malalignment treated means derotational osteotomy major surgical conducted around existing intramedullary fixtures usually requires subtrochanteric osteotomy invasive surgical approach bone cut realigned major procedure beneficial discovered early callus set consequently patients assessed malrotation early postoperative period ct scan occur abnormalities correct measurement bone malalignment ct scan vital considering osteotomies fixing rotational deformities torsional differences degrees often easily compensated non surgical revision surgery avoided necessary implementing femoral nails second time leads higher rates problems infection nonunion nail destabilisation due overlapping holes interlocking currently limited clinical attention area bone malrotation research accurate methods likely due complexity whilst computed tomography scans useful determining degree bone malrotation surgery occurred research conducted prevent deformity occurring surgery ct scans impractical intraoperatively due high cost lack equipment portability increased exposure consequently one area researched computer navigation could utilised surgeries avoid malalignment issues computer assisted surgery cas matches patients anatomy pre intraoperatively generated fluoroscopic image data using camera detected infrared signals computer calculates positioning component creates visual position monitor result surgeon monitor real time position surgical instruments relation patients anatomy conducts procedure surgeon plan torsional adjustment control fracture reduction nail insertion touchscreen navigation module currently navigation may add extra time surgery sometimes considered unnecessary urgent surgery however without computer navigation risk bone malrotation significantly increased benefit computer navigation means surgeons able view clearly restore axial alignment also ensure injured limb matches alignment length uninjured cas provides increased surgical accuracy safety patients surgeons radiation time reduced utilises minimally invasive techniques means less tissue damage improved wound healing reduced infections scarring
