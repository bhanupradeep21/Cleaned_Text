known exclusively triassic period metres ft long shellfisheating reptile paddlelike limbs downturned rostrum occurring lower middle triassic sulphur mountain formation british columbia well upper triassic hosselkus limestone gained notoriety result studies general diapsid although originally described four distinct species merriam one proven alexandrae upon inspection anotherwhich missing type specimencitation needed currently believed include two known species thalattosaurus alexandrae borealis summer annie alexander led expedition miss edna wemple eustace furlong merriam john c wb esterly mr fs ray shasta county discovered initially thought shastasaurus one fossils found north fork squaw creek triassic united states shasta county california environment found shellyskeletal limestone horizon composed largely broken shells estimated hosselkus limestone formation carnian period dating million years ago later collected university california fossil found annie alexander much original bone preorbital area gone vomer exposed incomplete mandible two dorsal ribs centra three articulated caudal vertebrae pressed merriams studies categorized new species named thalattosarus first thalattosaurs described thalattosaurus nectosaurus upper triassic california merriam thalattosaurus alexandrae named merriam name thalattosaurus meaning sea lizard alexandrae honor annie alexander amateur paleontologist patron university california museum material later reviewed nicholls originally four subtaxa thalattosaurus classified thalattosaurus alexandrae thalattosaurus perrini thalattosaurus shastensis merriam later additional examination type shastensis suggested belong genus thalattosaurus still currently study type skull perrini located vomer figured merriam differ vomer another species named thalattosarus borealis found talus slope near wapiti lake british columbia sulphur mountain environment similar discovery alexandrae also marine shale marl specimen discovered collected royal tyrrell museum paleontology field crew thalattosaurus borealis named northern discovery location thalattosaurus meaning ocean lizard borealis coming boreas greek word βορέας meaning northern discovered elements include anterior part skull incomplete mandible centra isolated ribs left noted merriam skull holotype referred ucmp preserved four pieces originally connected calcite veinfilled cracks separated three four pieces found made rostrum aligned rostrum shape suggested dorsal curvature anterior end maxilla ventral deflection anterior end premaxilla prefrontal however came ventrally margin maxilla contacts anterior tip suborbital process line drawn preserved anterior alveolar margin maxilla lower edge prefrontal showed ventral margin maxilla straight similar rostral structure known clarazia upon examination characteristics found true fossil striated external surface bone smooth bone resembling pseudodont teeth first blunt procumbent short second pointed thinner third although tip broken thick base implied blunt tooth additional broken stump may suggest fourth phylogenetic interrelationships thalattosaurus one better known thalattosaur comparing borealis type species alexandrae apparent difference size thalattosaurus borealis much smaller distance tip snout anterior edge orbit less alexandrae however distance almost initially difference age juvenile vs adult suspected bone borealis specimen thoroughly ossified caudal vertebral neural arches fused centra concluded specimen fully formed adult vomer borealis also differs vomer alexandrae type dentition present vomer alexandrae two rows teeth closely set anteriorly divergent posteriorly ten teeth per row lowcrowned bulbous teeth set sockets vomer borealis hand six high triangular teeth fused bone alexandrae single row teeth present vomer must developed paired structure assumed must single row teeth bone split sagittally possible additional row teeth present broke away preservation however evidence paired diverging tooth row like see alexandrae wide buttonlike teeth dentary characteristic three thalattosaurus clarazia paralonectes posterior mandibular teeth borealis differ genera however set flush margin jaw alexandrae clarazia posterior bulbous teeth set slightly ventral medial jaw margin thalattosaurs found posterior end dentary bifurcates two diverging processes upper lower distinguished clarazia two process almost equal length whereas borealis ventral process much longer originally illustrated merriam reconstruction skull alexandrae portrayed rostrum straight showed six conical striated teeth premaxilla reconstruction since used various books published journals accurate corrected nicholls published subject premaxilla type specimen alexandrae distinctly curved three teeth previously illustrated teeth like bony extensions premaxillapseudodont teeth similar found borealis pseudodont dentition possibly suggests possibility beak present
