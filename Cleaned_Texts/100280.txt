sepsis cynipsea european species fly member family coprophagous fly feeds flies commonly found around freshly laid cattle dung eat reproduce due human agricultural practices involving cows flies common areas world sepsis cynipsea studied extensively due sexual selection reproductive practices exhibit sexual conflict males compete females mount females guard reproductive purposes females observed attempting shake males dung flies black color approximately mm two translucent wings contain one dark spot near tip look like ants often difficult identify without microscope due appearance sepsis cynipsea dung flies commonly found europe prefer warm temperatures easily found may october lower altitudes june september higher altitudes temperature typically higher altitudes female flies shorter lifespans smaller lay fewer clutches require fresh dung primarily cows sheep also eat nectar source sepsis cynipsea dung flies often found regions varying altitudes swiss many different sepsidae species found regions sepsis cynipsea flies prefer intermediate altitudes found altitudes species dung flies areas fly species prevalent species diversity higher higher altitude environments tend variable species found higher altitudes better adapting environmental however cynpisea flies different altitudes enter diapause time stop producing eggs time temperature larval phase development impacts growth rates final body size sepsis cynipsea grow best intermediate temperatures compared similar however colder temperatures cynipsea growth rates may increase reach adulthood cold season growth rate also increases warmer takes approximately days cynipsea flies mature eggs resource availability vary based environmental conditions competition species also impact size adult cynipsea primarily uses temperature determine enter sepsidae flies often found regions competition species like neocynipsea also prefers fresh cow dung reproduction however fly species like duplicata prefer dry old cow dung known niche sepsis cynipsea flies known mating practices involve sexual conflict mating habits extensively studied better understand sexual selection female choice reluctance sepsis cynipsea flies require fresh dung prefer dung less one hour females land fresh dung large numbers males already ingest fresh dung females lay eggs dung laying eggs male gets top female guards males selective females tend mount first female encounter however copulation eggs laying fertilized previous lays eggs fresh dung male move grass surrounds dung pile opportunity mate although pairs female successfully shakes male make genital contact mate next eggs lays probably eggs hatch larvae emerge larvae eat dung cynipsea flies evolved develop quickly avoid competition coprophagous organisms dung dries female sepsis cynipsea flies larger males male force female copulate however lot male usually far males females dung leads ability females female want mate male begins shake body either indicates males want functions shake male larger males successful mounting mating females larger females lay larger clutches populations greater mean body sizes sexual selection stronger compared populations smaller body male female move grass lays eggs pairs actually evidence suggest females get physically injured process male reproductive organ spiney females left scars higher mortality genital organ likely armored make hard females shake males male spin degrees get genital organ female shake male copulate flies find another dung site days later repeat results approximately six generations progress breeding family sepsidae clear sexual dimorphism male foreleg example differs greatly female foreleg differs sepsidae species morphology biology male foreleg evolved aid male mounting female staying characteristic body male foreleg evolved bristles indentations bumps attach wing veins cells females response female bend abdomen prevent genital contact sepsidae species without adapted forelegs males adapted abdomen bends make contact female sexually dimorphic characteristics different closely related species sexually dimorphic characteristics evolve quickly involved speciation family sepsidae family sepsidae contains species genera globally sister species neocynipsea cynipsea found different continents neocynipsea north america cynipsea europe sepsis species genera family sepsidae monophyletic many different clades including neotropical sepsids african clade higher sexually dimorphic traits moveable abdomens evolved independently multiple sepsis neocynipsea recently diverged sepsis even though species widespread overlap geographically similar mitochondrial gene sequences different behaviors neocynipsea commonly found north america also present geographic locations cynipsea found like swiss cynipsea neocynipsea crossbreeding events produce hybrid offspring offspring typically infertile low pre postzygotic barriers species still forming recently diverged cynipsea female shaking mating events visible cynipsea flies also higher rates successful matings per mating attempts neocynipsea high levels genetic variability flies
