phytophthora nicotianae black shank oomycete belonging order peronosporales family peronosporaceae phytophthora nicotianae broad host range comprising genera hosts include tobacco onion tomato ornamentals cotton pepper citrus plants pathogen cause root rot crown rot fruit rot leaf infection stem infection root rot symptoms observed tobacco poinsettia tomato pineapple watermelon well african violet fruit rots occur tomato papaya eggplant onion shows leaf stem infection tobacco black shank affects roots basal stem area parts plant become damping symptoms observed young seedlings first ground symptom observed wilting plants leads stunting roots blackened decayed final stages disease stem begins turn black hence name black shank happens tobacco leaves turn brown become marketable another symptom disklike appearance pith although definitive symptom may also result lightning onion causes disease known phytophthora neck bulb rot different stages onion may affected initially tips newly infected plants start yellow dry followed softening neck plants eventually fall infected leaves may show grey lesions roots may become necrotic late black shank polycyclic soil borne disease possibility multiple disease cycles per growing season occurring may october important structures pathogen uses disease cycle chlamydospores produced asexually serve long lived resting structures surviving four six chlamydospores primary survival structure primary inoculum usually produced spores germinate warm moist soil produce germ tube infects plants produces sporangium another asexual structure secondary inoculum appearing ovoid pear spherical shape called sporangium spores produced either germinate directly release motile zoospores within hours inoculation right conditions zoospores kidney shaped anterior tinsel flagellum posterior whip like flagellum helps navigate toward root tips infection occurs black shank needs water germination movement zoospores swim soil pores standing water splashing water rain irrigation infect healthy plant leaves leading repeating secondary zoospores move toward nutrient gradients around root tips host wounds root surface contacted zoospores encyst germ tube emerge penetrating epidermis infection leads systemic rotting root system wilting chlorosis leaves another structure called hyphae colorless transparent coenocytic colonies may yellow age also much morphological variation colony type different isolates p nicotianae growth may differ grown different media hyphae heterothallic require two mating types produce oospores sexual survival structure many fields contain one mating type zoospores rarely germinate rarely cause pathogen thrives temperatures ranging disease prominent many agricultural productive regions therefore major host many warm environment black shank needs water germination movement saturated soil optimizes disease spread water used dissemination motile zoospores sporangia lowlying areas soil remain wet prolonged periods time disease splashing water rain irrigation infect healthy plant leaves leading repeating secondary cycles soils saturated lead little disease development water management important optimum soil ph development levels calcium magnesium soils affect disease several kinds management exist prevention suppression disease cultural method effective preventing disease sanitation equipment cleaned use infested fields disease spread uninfested fields disrupt chlamydospore germination crops grown drained disease free soil also avoid transplanting without thorough knowledge transplant limit spread structures limit traffic infected fields always clean exposure disease favored ph values greater lowering ph effective method preventing germination ph management difficult tobacco survive low ph soils soil ph allow successful growth tobacco control cultural control crop rotation effective limiting disease longer infected field planted crop initial infected crop lower population become minimum threeyear rotation recommended crop rotation recommended combination resistant varieties genetic controls burley tobacco burley tobacco hybrids dark

plants less one propagule per gram soil lead pathogen causes secondary cycles disease mode zoospores zoospores interact host sensing moving toward nutrient gradients near root tip wounds plant without

pathogen interferes transport infecting roots typically hyphae seen pith cause blackening infection proceed rapidly pathogen made entrance plant established reproduction chlamydospores sporangia occur
