nasal reconstruction using paramedian forehead flap within oral maxillofacial surgery surgical technique reconstruct different kinds nasal operation reconstructive surgeon uses skin forehead eyebrow pivots vertically replace missing nasal tissue throughout history technique modified adjusted many different surgeons evolved become popular way repairing nasal defects tint forehead skin exactly matches face nose must first choice forehead crowning feature face important expression jeopardize beauty make nose first many instances forehead makes far away best nose second plastic juggling forehead defect camouflaged effectively probably first nasal reconstructions using forehead flap performed sushruta india method introduced europe century first english description indian midline forehead rhinoplasty published madras gazette later carpue english surgeon published experience two successful median forehead flaps classic median forehead flap supplied paired supratrochlear vessels popularized united states kazanjian however flap optimal long enough solve problem short median forehead flap design modified central forehead tissue could transferred unilateral paramedian blood forehead flap usually required nasal defect larger cm requires replacement support lining located within infratip defect small superficial resurfaced skin graft heal secondary limited alar defects resurfaced using nasolabial flap however amount tissue available nasolabial area limited flap thicker less vascular hair bearing nasal defects mostly result excision malignant skin tumours basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma malignant melanoma keratoacanthoma lentigo maligna lymphoma sweat gland acquired nasal defects usually caused trauma burns sepsis forehead flap known best donor site repairing nasal defects size superior vascularity skin color texture especially color texture forehead skin matches exactly skin nose forehead flap used much nasal reconstruction vascularisation scalp forehead supplied supraorbital supratrochlear superficial temporal postauricular occiptal vessels lined vertically permit safe effective transfer forehead flap multiple individual vascular pedicle anatomic part resembles stem flap perfusion paramedian forehead flap comes three sources randomly frontalis muscle supratrochlear forehead flap axial flap pedicle containing dominant vessel pedicle safely narrowed four types flap design historically described literature median forehead flap oblique forehead flap sickle flap vertical paramedian forehead however vertical paramedian forehead flap based ipsilateral contralateral supratrochlear vessels become standard low turning point making easy reach defect without using hairbearing also primary closing proximal forehead possible result narrow lateral nasal defects usually closed ipsilateral paramedian forehead flap central nasal defects reconstructed using either right leftsided forehead flap ipsilateral pedicle closer defect contralateral pedicle therefore flap made shorter using ipsilateral experts suggest contralateral flap easier rotate difference problem contralateral flap extra length needed difficulty technique foreheads least cm long measured eyebrow usually enough resurface entire nose using vertical paramedian forehead flap still short foreheads forehead called short shorter cm using forehead flap short forehead multiple ways get length first turning point flap moved base flap closer nasal defect shorter flap used reach nasal second distal end flap placed within reconstructed nose hair plucked depilated lasered aesthetic regions used describe normal features face regions forehead cheeks eyelids lips nose chin defined skin quality border outline threedimensional nose nine aesthetic subunits important reconstruction nose subunits tip dorsum alae sidewalls columella soft triangles optimal aesthetic result scars positioned nasal subunits enlarging defect make aesthetic result better normal tissue within subunit safely reconstructing nasal defect contralateral side used guide templates defect made based healthy contralateral side important defining dimension outline landmark convex nasal subunit tip ala nasi missing resurfacing entire nasal subunit better resurfacing ideally nasal reconstruction performed stable platform support shaping soft tissue sculpting accomplished pedicle concha septum rib cartilage grafts used creating enough support good shape second repair sometimes required causes recurrence cancer new cancer new trauma second flap harvested contralateral forehead prior vertical oblique angled flap used first surgery second repair becomes difficult one side pedicle destroyed side forehead another reason use unilateral paramedian forehead flap design donor defect using paramedian forehead flap limited centrallateral forehead defect closed much possible using tshaped adjoining tissues pulled together vertically horizontally often persisting defect depending size flap possible resultant defect high forehead left heal secondary eyebrow malformation occur usually avoided method used correctly two used forehead flap techniques two stage three stage forehead forehead consists multiple layers skin subcutaneous tissue frontalis muscle fascia thin areolar traditionally forehead flap transferred two stages flap thinned first stage improve aesthetic result possibly jeopardizing vascularity increasing chance flap necrosis overcome problem described threestage forehead flap initially flap transferred containing tissue layers making extremely safe technique second stage flap acts delayed flap safely thinned aggressively according aesthetic final stage pedicle severed flap thinned pedicle flap trimmed inset three stage flap especially useful reconstructing large defects complex contour deformations lining defects two stage flap used smaller superficial surgery important landmarks reference points must identified marked important landmarks hairline frown lines location supratrochlear vessels outline defect nasal lip templates made using intact side nose make precise symmetric reconstruction nose template resembling defect placed hairline vascular pedicle drawn downwards medial eyebrow pedicle based supratrochlear vessels cm way flap design made flap incised elevated distal distally frontalis muscle subcutaneous tissue excised done downwards disscection goes muscle reaching brow skin borders incised flap carefully soon flap reaches defect without tension incision flap stopped flap inset area done using single layer fine second stage three four weeks later flap well healed recipient stage pedicle divided inferior forehead reopened proximal pedicle replaces medial brow inverted v nose side pedicle elevated superiorly mm subcutaneous needed recipient site altered reach better aesthetic result scar eventually sculpted nasal subregions create satisfying aesthetic flap incised elevated periosteum distal flap consists skin subcutaneous tissue fat frontalis muscle thinned reaching brow skin borders incised flap carefully fullthickness flap sutured defect without tension three four weeks later full thickness forehead flap well healed recipient site second stage begins skin flap mm subcutaneous fat underlying excess soft tissue excised remaining healed tissue sculpted ideal nasal subunit flap resutured recipient site stage completely identical second stage two stage forehead flap optimal aesthetic result difficult nose reconstruction often followed revision different types revisions minor revisions major revisions revisions done sooner eight months completion primary forehead flap technique goal nasal reconstruction look normal possible results nasal reconstruction using paramedian forehead flap quite good although patients report functional difficulties airway passage difficulties mucosal crusts dry mucosa difficulties smelling minority patients reported snoring often spontaneous nose bleed difficulties phonation likely occur majority patients satisfied function nose ideally standardized semistructered interviews used assess aesthetic outcome nasal reconstruction studies using interviews showed generally patients satisfied result although reported aggravating nasal appearance compared patients especially satisfied flap color match shape nasal remarkably patients scored subjective aesthetic outcome significantly higher compared professional comparison two stage flap three stage flap technique shown better results lower revision rates possibilities use skin grafts likely reliable vascularisation three stage flap flaps rich perfusion flap necrosis unlikely occur happens result severe ischemia normally caused excessive tension flap misidentification past injury nearby scar formation fanatic inset recipient site exaggerated flap solve problem keep underlying cartilage infecting stop situation getting worse better excise dead tissue early stage wait watchfully allowing injury heal secondarily unlikely operation area get infected situation failure aseptic techniques necrosis lining main causes early discovery infection important complete debridement take place underlying cartilage exposed chronically infected cartilage cured reelevating flap excising infected patients new tumor develops skin injured sun old cancer redevelop cases result first reconstruction good enough takes place next step take away old flap redo reconstruction second flap taken contra lateral side instances defect created donor site usually positioned centrallateral forehead defect closed pulling different sides wound together vertical horizontal resulting defect closure situated high forehead closes secondary healing spite fact result eyebrow could distorted usually result large initial defect flap larger bigger forehead defect large resultant forehead defect logically lies closer eyebrow significant risk superior eyebrow malposition especially horizontal oblique oriented forehead flap solution close remaining defect skin graft however skin graft esthetically inferior always look like shiny irregularly pigmented mismatched piece skin alternatively secondary placement tissue expander forehead used correct eyebrow malposition excise skin graft primarily close forehead defect httpsenwikipediaorgwikinasalreconstructionusingaparamedianforeheadflap
