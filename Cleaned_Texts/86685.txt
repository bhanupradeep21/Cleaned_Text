clavicle fracture also known broken collarbone bone fracture symptoms typically include pain site break decreased ability move affected complications include collection air pleural space surrounding lung pneumothorax injury nerves blood vessels area unpleasant often caused fall onto shoulder outstretched arm direct fracture also occur baby middle section clavicle often diagnosis typically based symptoms confirmed clavicle fractures typically treated putting arm sling one two pain medication paracetamol acetaminophen may take five months strength bone return reasons surgical repair include open fracture involvement nerves blood vessels shortening clavicle cm young clavicle fractures commonly occur people age age among younger group males often affected adults make fractures children represent clavicle fractures commonly known breaking collarbone usually result injury trauma common type fracture occurs person falls vertically onto shoulder outstretched hand direct hit collarbone also cause break cases direct hit occurs joint side towards body side bone muscles involved clavicle fractures include deltoid trapezius subclavius sternocleidomastoid sternohyoid ligaments involved include conoid ligament trapezoid ligament incidents may lead clavicle fracture include automobile accidents biking accidents especially common mountain biking vertical falls shoulder joint contact sports football rugby hurling wrestlingcitation needed often fractured middle third length weakest point lateral fragment clavicle fracture depressed weight arm pulled downward strong abductor muscles shoulder joint especially deltoid part clavicle near center body tilted upwards sternocleidomastoid muscle children infants particularly prone newborns often present clavicle fractures following difficult deliverycitation needed fracture clavicle sternocleidomastoid muscle elevates medial fragment bone trapezius muscle unable hold distal fragment owing weight upper limb thus shoulder droops adductor muscles arm pectoralis major may pull distal fragment medially causing bone fragments overridecitation needed clavicle bone connects trunk body arm located directly first rib clavicle located
