constructional apraxia neurological disorder people unable perform tasks movements even though understand task willing complete physical ability perform characterized inability difficulty build assemble draw constructional apraxia may caused lesions parietal lobe following stroke may serve indicator alzheimers disease key deficit constructional apraxia patients inability correctly copy draw image qualitative differences patients left hemisphere damage right hemisphere damage alzheimers patients damage left hemisphere tend preserve items oversimplify drawing omit details drawing memory addition left hemisphere patients less likely systematically arrange parts patients damage right hemisphere trouble correctly replicating spatial relationships complex figures drawing elements often piecemeal transposed different positions orientations shown diagonally result right hemisphere patients tend produce asymmetric distorted characterized hemispatial neglect omission elements one side thought right hemisphere patients twice likely make mistakes construction tasks left hemisphere patients inaccurate conclusion attributable participant selection bias researchers excluded studies

marked difference performance left right hemisphere patients construction alzheimers disease patients constructional apraxia unique symptoms drawings contain fewer angles spatial alterations lack perspective simplifications uncharacteristic left hemisphere right hemisphere patients constructional disabilities present early disease get progressively worse however even patients advanced alzheimers disease may able constructional spontaneous drawing affected early heavily dependent upon semantic memory therefore simplifications drawing may due impaired access semantic knowledge alzheimers disease progresses patients ability copy objects becomes increasingly impaired may lose ability draw correctly simple figures due motor loss routine constructional apraxia localized specific hemisphere cerebral area drawing constructional tasks require perceptual motor linked parietal lesions left right hemisphere stroke alzheimers disease initially researchers tried isolate cause left hemisphere lesions parietal lobe similarities gerstmann syndrome however lesions dorsal stream also result visual agnosia piecemeal although constructional apraxia result lesions part brain commonly associated lesions parietaloccipital lobes constructional apraxia common right parietal stroke continues visuospatial symptoms patients posterior parietal lobe lesions tend severe alzheimers

ability highly correlated alzheimers disease study constructional apraxia impairments narrows research concentrating analyzing drawing abilities drawing abilities may decomposed three steps visual perception visual imagery graphic production according twostreams hypothesis information exits occipital lobe follows two pathways dorsal stream pathway ends parietal lobe ventral stream pathway terminates temporal damage parietal lobe highly correlated constructional apraxia since involved drawing copying parietal lobe also critical remapping spatial position across attentional subsystem responsible moving eyes head body focus different images damage various levels system could lead trouble localizing stimulus hemispatial neglect manifests perseverative errors couple theories used describe neurological mechanisms behind drawing kosslyn proposes early split information dorsal stream first pathway captures coordinate relations defining distances points space points become continuum transform points intermediate points coding points would allow space perceived qualitatively would also help pathway encodes categorical information synthesizes information shape spatial arrangement objects parts decomposes objects basic form looking boundaries lines patches categorical relations turn lead abstract spatial relations allow one perceive objects top inside beside van sommers model describes two hierarchical systems drawing one visual perception another graphic production visual perception model utilizes david marrs three stage system describe visual perception copying first stage image us represented based changes intensity foreground background distinguished second stage representation formed encodes object viewercentered coordinate system finally objectcentered representation established making possible appreciate volume visual representations familiar drawings stored memory representation sends feedback areas brain encoded spatial physical properties object feedback areas allows drawer successfully encode coordinate categorical graphic production model viewer begins making series depiction decisions dimensions amount detail include etc depiction decisions used copying drawing theyre dictated situation next production strategy formed drawing unfamiliar drawer divide rank different portions drawings drawing familiar eg sun drawer reproduce item line lie regardless pictures organization due automatic execution third component contingent planning reflects importance planning drawing contingent planning result production strategy drawing unfamiliar requires segmented approach appropriate sequence determined drawing point drawing task becomes problem solving task fourth final component model refers articulatory economic constraints placed drawer using pencil certain directions favored due orientation hand fingers etc however feel van sommers model adequately account aspects drawing memory response verbal order requires image recalled associative memory brought visual buffer successfully drawn copied memory familiar images like sun may require visual imagery draw production schemes action programming stored associative memory procedural memory may sufficient reproduce drawing construction problems usually caused visual perception deficits require normal vision ability execute series motor activities looking performance important consider perceptual executive functioning patient trouble visually recognizing patterns spatial relations may difficulty correctly building model addition problems planning organizing carrying action may impede ability solve construction modern attempts understand constructional apraxia moved away anatomical functions towards cognitive neuropsychological approach adults children alike experience difficulty reproducing oblique lines feel deficiencies may attributed planning since easier plan horizontal vertical lines oblique lines research indicates adults children able draw squares diamonds although children grow adults accurately able depict one study showed constructional apraxia patients significantly less accurate control patients producing angles vertical horizontal orientations study constructional apraxia patients drew patterns usually found children younger gregory argues ontogenetically phylogenetically earlier behavioral traits present brain inhibited inhibitory mechanisms become compromised childlike behavior patterns reemerge therefore according theory inhibitory mechanisms patients constructional apraxia failed causing draw like young children difficulty drawing oblique constructional disabilities often tested asking patient draw model assemble object researchers feel neuronal mechanisms involved drawing copying differ thus tested individually free drawing commonly used test patient asked draw named object effective tool measuring patients ability maintain spatial relations organize drawing draw complete shapes complexity task noted tasks often require lexicalsemantic abilities well imagery motor imagery explored potential therapy constructional apraxia patients motor imagery process specific action
