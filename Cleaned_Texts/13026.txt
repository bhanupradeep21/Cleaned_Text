postcranial skeleton rule striking morphological differences regarded expressions sexual dimorphism robust types mammals associated males slender ones also possible two morphotypes resulted different behaviors extinct sloths snout width important indicator regard feeding thus forms broad snouts classified grasseating pointed snouts probably specialized soft leafy mixed plant males often energetically demanding lives thus require high amounts food females prefer higherquality food provide offspring simomylodon robust broadnosed skulls males graceful narrownosed skulls females may reflect differences evidence also comes posterior portion skull due vertical position occiput male individuals held skull rather low indicating grassbased diet oblique occiput females advocates higher head posture thus leafy diet differing food preferences may also indicate divergent space use grass specialists tend larger action areas extensive migratory movements animals preferring soft plant foods also quite possible postcranial skeleton simomylodon wellof miocene mylodont date shows numerous similarities later representatives group glossotherium paramylodon compared giant forms however
