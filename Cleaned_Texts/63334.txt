thujone ˈθuːdʒoʊn ketone monoterpene occurs predominantly two diastereomeric epimeric forms though best known chemical compound spirit absinthe unlikely responsible absinthes alleged stimulant psychoactive effects due small quantities thujone acts neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid gaba antagonist opposite effects alcohol competitive antagonist gaba thujone alone considered though interfering inhibitory transmitter gaba may convey stimulating moodelevating effects low doses also found perfumery component several essential oils addition naturally occurring βthujone two forms possible αthujone found nature salvia officinalis αthujone βthujone thujone found number plants arborvitae genus thuja hence derivation name nootka cypress junipers mugwort oregano common sage tansy wormwood notably grand wormwood artemisia absinthium usually mix isomers ratio also found various species mentha mint biosynthesis thujone similar synthesis monoterpenes begins formation geranyl diphosphate gpp dimethylallyl pyrophosphate dmapp isopentenyl diphosphate ipp catalyzed enzyme geranyl diphosphate quantitative nmr spectroscopic analysis demonstrated isoprene units used form thujone plants derived methylerythritol phosphate pathway reactions generate thujone skeleton sabinene gpp mediated enzyme sabinene synthase gpp gpp first isomerizes linalyl diphosphate lpp neryl diphosphate npp lpp preferentially forms delocalized allylic cationdiphosphate ionpair intermediate cyclizes electrophilic addition yield αterpinyl tertiary cation αterpinyl cation undergoes hydride shift via rearrangement leading formation cation cation undergoes second cyclization form thujyl cation intermediate loss proton form thujone precursor sabinene sabinene proposed biosynthetic route generate thujone follows threestep pathway sabinene first oxidized isomer sabinol cytochrome enzyme followed conversion sabinone via dehydrogenase finally reductase mediates conversion αthujone βthujone isomerism sabinol intermediate varies among thujoneproducing plants instance western redcedar thuja plicata thujone derived exclusively transsabinol intermediate whereas common garden sage salvia officinalis thujone formed cissabinol intermediate based studies looked molecular shape many years thujone thought act similarly thc cannabinoid however since proven thujone gabaa receptor

became popular century dr valentin magnan studied alcoholism tested pure wormwood oil animals discovered caused seizures independent effects alcohol based absinthe contains small amount wormwood oil assumed dangerous ordinary alcohol eventually thujone isolated cause reactions magnan went study abusers alcohol noted drank absinthe seizures hallucinations seizures caused αthujone interacting gaba
