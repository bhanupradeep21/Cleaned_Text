diagnoses autism become frequent since led various controversies cause autism nature diagnoses whether autism mainly genetic developmental cause degree coincidence autism intellectual disability matters current scientific controversy well inquiry also sociopolitical debate whether autism considered disability current accepted prevalence autism spectrum disorder asd around although previous research shown far lower rates asd averages maletofemale ratio number children autism spectrum increased dramatically since least partly due changes diagnostic practice unclear whether prevalence actually asyetunidentified environmental risk factors ruled risk autism associated several prenatal factors including advanced parental age diabetes mother asd associated several genetic role genetic influence asd heavily researched past years asd considered polygenic traits since single risk factor multiple multiple twin family studies conducted order observe genetic influence diagnosing asd chance twins asd significantly higher identical twins fraternal twins concluding asd reoccurring finding de novo new mutation copy number variants cnvs primary cause asd alter synaptic functions germ line mutations produce de novo mutations passed offspring explains phenomenon occurs child symptoms asd parents symptoms history asd de novo variants differ person person ie one variant cause asd one

communication difficulties two major conceptualizations autism within autism advocacy favour pathology paradigm aligns medical model disability see autism disorder treated cured favor pathology paradigm argue atypical behaviors autistic individuals detrimental therefore reduced eliminated behavior modification therapies advocacy efforts focus primarily medical research identify genetic environmental risk factors autism favour neurodiversity paradigm aligns social model disability see autism naturallyoccurring variation brain neurodiversity advocates argue efforts eliminate autism compared example curing cancer instead antiquated notion curing lefthandedness advocacy efforts focus primarily acceptance accommodation support autistic people neurominorities two paradigms fully exclusive many people hold combination viewpointscitation needed pathology paradigm traditional view autism biomedical lens seen disorder characterized various impairments mainly communication social taking perspective believe autism generally harmful ways functioning diverge typical brain perceived harmful disordered must therefore treated atypical behaviors autistic individuals considered detriment social professional success therefore reduced eliminated advocates view include small significant minority autistic adults large majority parents autistic children contain higher percentage parents compared adopting neurodiversity needed advocates believe medical research necessary address rapid rise autism diagnoses sometimes referred autism reduce suffering provide best outcomes autistic individuals addition etiological research areas focus may include biology diagnosis treatment including medication behavioural psychological interventions treatment coexisting medical advocacy groups focus primarily medical research include autism speaks autism science foundation predecessor organizations autism coalition research education national alliance autism research cure autism former autism research institute neurodiversity paradigm view autism different way rather disease disorder must autistic people considered neurocognitive give distinct strengths weaknesses capable succeeding appropriately accommodated belief efforts eliminate autism compared example curing cancer instead antiquated notion curing leader neurodiversity movement little academic research conducted social proponents neurodiversity paradigm heterogenous consistent view autism separated autistic advocacy efforts may include accommodations schools work lobbying inclusion autistic people making decisions affect opposition therapies aim make children indistinguishable neurodiversity advocates opposed medical research cure believing lead eugenics instead support research helps autistic
