effectiveness angina certain types arrhythmias pronethalol marketed use lifethreatening situations dr james black went create another βblocker called propranolol nonselective βblocker clinical trials started summer year later propranolol launched trade name inderal two half years first turned higher potency pronethalol fewer side propranolol became first major drug treatment angina pectoris since introduction coronary vasodilators nitroglycerin almost years earlier propranolol became bestselling drug used treat wide range cardiovascular diseases arrhythmia hypertension hypertrophic time propranolol launched ici beginning experience competition companies potential threat led ongoing refinements pharmacologic structure βblockers subsequent advances drug delivery ici studied analogues
