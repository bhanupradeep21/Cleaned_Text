infant cognitive development first stage human cognitive development youngest children academic field infant cognitive development studies psychological processes involved thinking knowing develop young information acquired number ways including sight sound touch taste smell language require processing cognitive scientific investigation field origin first half century early influential theory field jean piagets theory cognitive development since piagets contribution field infant cognitive development methods investigation advanced considerably numerous psychologists investigating different areas cognitive development including memory language perception coming various example neopiagetian theories cognitive development tabula rasa idea discredited theory birth human mind blank slate without rules processing data data added rules processing formed solely ones sensory experiences modern idea theory mostly attributed john lockes essay concerning human understanding written century corollary nativism argues born certain cognitive modules allow us learn acquire certain skills language example theory universal grammar theory programming grammar hardwired brain associated recent work noam chomsky jerry fodor steven pinker one accepts nothing known learned everyone shares basic common sense appears infants specific ontological inferences world works kinds things contains procedure studied psychology validity studied philosophy acquire ordinary common sense beliefs early age take granted everyday life also selfreflective creatures turn back commonsense assumptions find puzzling problematic bargained concepts habitually employ raise kinds disturbing questions call philosophical observations children jean piaget established theory cognitive development according piagets theory cognitive development four stages cognitive infant cognitive development occurs sensorimotor stage starts birth extends infant years age sensorimotor stage made six substages lev vygotsky also influential cognitive development theory theory included zone proximal vygotsky also believed social cultural factors contributed heavily cognitive vygotsky argued development first takes place socially infants observe parents behaviour try imitate imitation occurs parents guide children correcting provide challenges play integral part cognitive development according vygotsky play children gain confidence language skills start regulating thought processes research vygotsky suggested childs performance differs depending whether solving problem alone another child adult assisting refers difference zone proximal development theory goes child learning complete task competent person able provide assistance child able move new zone development problem solving vygotsky refers movement assistance scaffolding helps bridge gap childs current cognitive abilities full erik erikson prominent developmental psychologist produced psychoanalytical theory psychosocial behaviour showing stages development infancy adulthood stage individual set potential conflict either success failure point go determine outcome psychological state person first stage development runs birth months thus covers infancy period conflict erikson identified time trust vs mistrust vulnerable point childs life faced uncertainties world therefore reliant caregiver child receives consistent care erikson claimed infant would develop sense trust however care received unreliable mistrust develop may result heightened feelings insecurity anxiety future development typically considered something progressive age move simple complex structures behaviours causes us interpret early immature forms cognition incomplete forms adult model always hold true immature forms development serve function adapts current environment infant example infants relatively poor perceptual skills protect nervous system undergoing sensory overload fact infants slow information processing prevents establishing intellectual habits early lives would cause problems later life environments significantly different could argued infants young childrens cognitive perceptual abilities might designed suited needs particular time lives rather incomplete versions sophisticated models possessed adults hanus papousek looked concept learning early stage development may beneficial infant creates overstimulation experiment conditioned infants turn heads sound buzzer training task began either birth days discovered infants took many trials days learn task learned birth infants learned later infants need stimulation stimulation great could distract infants young children tasks replace crucial activities development social development memory children becomes evident within first years childs life show considerable advances declarative memory enhancement continues adolescence major developments short term memory working memory longterm memory autobiographical research development memory indicated declarative explicit memory may exist infants even younger two years old example newborns less days old demonstrate preference mother perception causality initially studied albert michotte presented adults animated images moving manipulating direction timing moving balls spatial temporal dimensions able influence participants perception causality contradicting evidence whether causal perception innate present birth whether result perception development research young infants many studies shown support theory humans born mechanisms needed perception recent research even shown ability newborns hours however studies shown similar results received michotte infants young months studies support developmental progression abilities required perception causality object permanence understanding object continues exist even one see touch important milestone stages cognitive development infants numerous tests regarding done usually involving toy crude barrier placed front toy removed repeatedly peekaboo early sensorimotor stages infant completely unable comprehend object permanence psychologist jean piaget conducted experiments infants led conclude awareness typically achieved eight nine months age infants age young understand object permanence explains infants age cry mothers gone sight mind lack object permanence lead anotb errors children look object location first discovered rather seen placed studies also suggest three dimensionality depth perception necessarily fully intuitive must partially learned infancy using unconscious inference acquisition depth perception development infant cognitive systems researched richard walk walk found human infants discriminate depth well innate learned point view able discriminate depth age tested however visual mechanisms still maturing walk discovered infants better able discriminate depth definitive pattern separating deeper shallower areas either one indefinite depth distance must certain level distance order successfully distinguished infant according walk clear development perceptual behaviour increasing age shown children able discriminate depths accurately gauge subtle differences largely thanks innovative strategies developed renee baillargeon colleagues considerable knowledge gained young infants come understand natural physical laws much research depends carefully observing infants react events unexpected example infant sees object appears suspended midair behaves unexpected suggests infant understanding things usually fall supported baillargeon colleagues contributed evidence example infants understanding object reasoning hidden birth babies learning communicate communication begins crying begins develop cooing babbling infants develop speech mimicking around gestures facial expressions part language development first three months life babies generally use different crying types express different needs well making sounds cooing begin mimicking facial expressions smiling sight familiar faces ages months infants greater response towards different tones voices greater engagement watching speakers face childs language skills develop larger variation babbling sounds elicit responses conversation babbling months end first year babies able understand frequently heard words respond simple requests babbling becomes complex communicate making sense use babbling express desires nonverbal communication also develops actions waving goodbye produced also period babies often say first word important milestone childs common technique used research testing
