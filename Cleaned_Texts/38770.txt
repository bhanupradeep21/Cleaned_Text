ornithocheiridae ornithocheirids meaning bird hands group pterosaurs within suborder pterodactyloidea pterosaurs among last possess teeth members belong group lived early late cretaceous periods valanginian turonian stages around million years ago ornithocheirids generally infamous enormously controversial confusing taxonomy although agreements animals related therefore similar istiodactylids pteranodontians still virtual consensus exact content interrelationships ornithocheirids successful pterosaurs reign also largest pterosaurs appearance azhdarchids quetzalcoatlus ornithocheirids excellent fish hunters using various flight techniques catch prey also capable flying great distances without flapping constantly paleontologists suspect ornithocheirids ancestors pteranodontians due many shared aspects unique flying techniques capability longdistance flights diet mainly consisted fish family ornithocheiridae without doubt one wellknown pterosaur groups mostly due controversial convoluted taxonomic history ornithocheirid fossil record consists isolated teeth well fragmentary bones reaching hundreds even thousands remains first uncovered ornithocheirid remains described british paleontologist sir richard owen assigned fossil remains new species pterodactylus p british paleontologist harry govier seeley erected new generic name ornithocheirus ancient greek meaning bird hand assigned p simus type species therefore creating ornithocheirus simus later seeley created name ornithocheirae contain however year emended ornithocheiridae seeley following article owen proposed two new genera cretaceous british pterosaurs coloborhynchus meaning maimed beak criorhynchus meaning ram beak based highly distinctive jaw owen reassigned p simus type species criorhynchus creating criorhynchus simus referred three species coloborhynchus including addition new species called c clavirostris type species designated however seeley pointed criorhynchus junior synonym ornithocheirus concept followed paleontologist richard lydekker latter year lydekker acknowledged ornithocheirus simus type species ornithocheirus also distinguished simus tall rostrum species referred ornithocheirus lanceolate jaw tips therefore avoid confusion lydekker preferred use name criorhynchus simus ornithocheirus species lanceolate jaw tips concept later favored paleontologist reginald walter hooley review ornithocheirus divided family ornithocheiridae two subfamilies ornithocheirinae criorhynchinae former consisted ornithocheirus lonchodectes latter consisted amblydectes review hooley also considered species coloborhynchus clavirostris synonym criorhynchus paleontologist oskar kuhn placed criorhynchus within family criorhynchidae considered synonymous ornithocheiridae recognized ornithocheirus within family ornithocheiridae subfamily ornithocheirinae also designated species coloborhynchus clavirostris type species coloborhynchus agreed hooley synonymous criorhynchus however yuongnam lee revalidated genus coloborhynchus c clavirostris type species regarded distinct criorhynchus later paleontologist david unwin revised taxonomic history cambridge greensand pterosaurs divided ornithocheiridae three genera ornithocheirus coloborhynchus anhanguera unwin also designated ornithocheirus simus type species unwin defined family ornithocheiridae haopterus gracilis ornithocheirus simus recent common ancestor descendants included genera anhanguera brasileodactylus coloborhynchus haopterus ludodactylus ornithocheirus within family also concluded araripesaurus arthurdactylus santanadactylus may belong family well however taxonomic status precise relationships ornithocheirids upon description pterosaur mimodactylus haopterus assigned family recovered basal eupterodactyloid brian andres reassigned alexander kellner colleagues sister taxon andres colleagues defined ornithocheiridae different definition inclusive clade containing ornithocheirus simus anhanguera blittersdorffi placed genera coloborhynchus ornithocheirus tropeognathus within ornithocheiridae placing anhanguera within separate family however back unwin considered name anhangueridae junior synonym concept later followed several paleontologists mark witton phylogenetic analyses however contradict name synonymy ornithocheiridae anhangueridae classified different families therefore following analysis andres colleagues studies ones kellner colleagues used different concept classifying coloborhynchus tropeognathus well several close relatives ludodactylus caulkicephalus within anhangueridae along family hamipteridae forms larger group anhangueria assigned ornithocheirus outside anhangueria due recent studies since followed among toothed pterodactyloids

known seem relatively small gracile undeveloped claws hooklike fifth family ornithocheiridae controversial confusing taxonomic history paleontologists studied group seem different opinion composition ornithocheirid taxonomy term called anhangueridae coined diogenes de almeida campos kellner refer pterosaurs belong family however unwin argued name ornithocheiridae refers identical group nomenclatural therefore considered anhangueridae junior synonym ornithocheiridae study pterosaur phylogeny however many recent studies anhangueridae recovered separate distinct family ornithocheiridae containing different original term ornithocheirae seeley redefined least inclusive clade containing anhanguera blittersdorffi ornithocheirus therefore recovered larger group comprising families anhangueridae ornithocheiridae recent past many pterosaur genera assigned ornithocheiridae however following recent studies supposed ornithocheirids reclassified groups families pterosaur boreopterus example initially classified within ornithocheiridae however later analysis found different family called boreopteridae boreopterus sister taxon zhenyuanopterus pterosaurs recovered basal members lanceodontia several recent studies ones rodrigo pêgas adele pentland colleagues studies aetodactylus another pterosaur initially classified within ornithocheiridae later analysis found outside ornithocheiridae timothy myers nicholas longrich colleagues example two studies found aetodactylus sister taxon two species cimoliopterus c cuvieri c pêgas colleagues found aetodactylus along two pterosaurs camposipterus cimoliopterus within clade targaryendraconia specifically placed within family cimoliopteridae genus haopterus used define ornithocheiridae unwins study however andres myers argued haopterus previously referred ornithocheiridae besides note added proof unwin stated haopterus appeared small ornithocheirid phylogenetic analyses since found haopterus rogue taxon either within pterodactyloidea ornithocheiroidea pteranodontoidea istiodactylidae phylogenetic analysis andres myers haopterus recovered stable sister taxon group later analyses also recovered concept haopterus ornithocheiroidea placed within larger group another study recovered haopterus within different group called different phylogenetic analysis found ornithocheiridae comprise different genera typical ones tropeognathus coloborhynchus andres colleagues created subfamily ornithocheirinae contain coloborhynchus ornithocheirus sister taxon tropeognathus altogether formed family longrich colleagues included genus siroccopteryx phylogenetic analysis specifically member ornithocheirine subfamily sister taxon study performed adele pentland colleagues found ornithocheiridae comprise

camposipterus three formed family analysis jacobs colleagues two cimoliopterus species found sister taxa three camposipterus species c nasutus c colorhinus c segwickii altogether formed unnamed clade

ornithocheirids considered ideal reaching water grab swimming creatures rostral crests ornithocheirids would worked well stabilizers jaws tips plunged water large forwardfacing eyes welldeveloped flocculi ideal dipfeeding well permits effective spotting prey well judgement distances striking seems likely least several ornithocheirids efficient dip feeders sedate foraging methods might also used hunting examples methods reaching food alighted water surface shallow surface similar modernday albatrosses ornithocheirids used flight technique called dynamic soaring consists travelling long distances without flapping using vertical gradient wind speed near ocean surface advantage moderate flight speed several studies showed ornithocheirids sprawled limbs large degree similar crocodiles studies conclude ornithocheirids generally quadrupedal yet studies concluded ornithocheirids held limbs less vertically extended similar avian mammalian studies later genera show ornithocheirids spend
