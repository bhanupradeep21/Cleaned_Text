van der woude syndrome vdws genetic disorder characterized combination lower lip pits cleft lip without cleft palate clp cleft palate frequency orofacial clefts ranges births worldwide syndromes involve vws distinct clefting syndromes due combination cleft lip palate clp cpo within family features frequently associated vws include hypodontia cases narrow arched palate congenital heart disease heart murmur cerebral abnormalities syndactyly hands polythelia ankyloglossia adhesions upper lower gum association lower lip pits cleft lip andor palate first described anne van der woude worldwide disease incidence ranges van der woude syndrome inherited autosomal dominant disease caused mutation single gene equal distribution sexes disease high penetrance phenotypic expression varies lower lip pits cleft lip cleft palate visible approximately vws patients display lower lip pits cases lip pits visible defect reported clefting covers wide range including submucous cleft palate incomplete unilateral cl bifid uvula complete bilateral clp vws common orofacial clefting syndrome accounting clp majority vws cases caused haploinsufficiency due mutations interferon regulatory factor gene chromosome region known vws locus second less common causative locus found known vws locus recent work shown gene downstream oral epithelium suggesting common molecular pathway leading vws prior work also suggested candidate contains two noncoding seven coding exons part family nine transcription factors highly conserved helixturnhelix dna binding domain called smadinterferon regulatory factor binding domain smir mutations coding noncoding exons result van der woude due wide range expressivity also believed unidentified loci contribute disease example clear phenotypic variability monozygotic twin study conducted jobling et al two monozygotic female twins mutation however twin born bilateral cleft lip whereas twin b bilateral lip pits orofacial clefting twins diagnosed vws twins father lip pits alone family history clp cp cl andor lip pits twins diagnosed vws polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification done exons missense mutation discovered exon tyrosine normal protein position conserved across mammals frogs chickens despite fact previously unreported mutation expected deleterious study first case different phenotypes occurring monozygotic twins possible causes phenotypic variability include variations intrauterine environment epigenetic differences chance lip pits first reported demarquay thought indentations made upper incisors today known occur embryogenesis due mutations day embryonic development four growth centers lower lip divided two lateral grooves one median day normal development grooves disappeared however growth mandibular process impeded lip pit occurs lip pits begin develop day cleft lip begins develop day cleft palate emerges day three types lip pits classified according location midline upper comissural lower lip common phenotype two symmetrical lower lip pits flanking sides midline bilateral paramedial sinuses lower lip pits may also bilaterally unilaterally medially asymmetrical occurrence single lip pit considered incomplete expression typically occurs left side lower lip also three different shapes lip pits common circular oval less common forms include slitlike transverse lip pits extend orbicularis oris muscle ending blind sacs surrounded mucous glands cases mucous excreted muscles clinical diagnosis based orofacial clefts lip pits typically occurs shortly birth certain defects may difficult diagnose particularly submucous cleft palate form cp may detected except finger palpation mucosa covering palate intact muscles underneath lost proper attachments feeding problems impaired speech hearing loss symptoms submucous cleft furthermore approximately vws cases orofacial clefts absence prominent lip pits easily distinguished nonsyndromic forms orofacial therefore important closely examine patients well relatives lip pits especially family history mixed clefting order make vws dentists may also play important role diagnosing cases detected birth detect hypodontia commonly associated vws patients commonly lack upper second premolars followed lower second premolars upper lateral incisors absence teeth might play role constricting dental clinical signs seen vws similar popliteal pterygium syndrome pps also autosomal dominant disease approximately affected individuals lip pits features include genital abnormalities abnormal skin near nails syndactyly fingers toes webbed skin disease also caused mutations however occur dnabinding domain result dominant negative effect mutated transcription factor interferes ability wild type copy function case heterozygous genetic counseling vws involves discussion disease transmission autosomal dominant manner possibilities penetrance expression autosomal dominance means affected parents chance passing mutated allele child furthermore cleft patient lip pits ten times greater risk child cleft lip without cleft palate cleft patient lip types clefting parents affected children significantly associated however different types clefts may occur horizontally vertically within pedigree cases clefting symptom complete family history must taken ensure patient nonsyndromic lip pits may surgically removed either aesthetic reasons discomfort due inflammation caused bacterial infections chronic saliva excretion though spontaneous shrinkage lip pits occurred rare cases chronic inflammation also reported cause squamouscell carcinoma essential completely remove entire lip pit canal mucoid cysts develop mucous glands removed possible side effect removing lip pits loose lip muscle conditions associated vws including cl cp congenital
