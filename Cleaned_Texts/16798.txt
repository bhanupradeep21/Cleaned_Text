batoids superorder cartilaginous fish consisting skates rays fish characterized dorsoventrally flattened bodies large pectoral fins fused head distinctive morphology resulted several unique forms locomotion batoids exhibit median paired fin swimming utilizing enlarged pectoral fins batoids exhibit median paired fin swimming fall somewhere along spectrum swimming modes mobuliform rajiform based number waves present fin four orders batoidae holds truest myliobatiformes rays rajiformes skates two orders rhinopristiformes torpediniformes exhibit greater degree body caudal fin mobuliform
