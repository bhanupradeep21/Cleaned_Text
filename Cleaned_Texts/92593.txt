fisheries fishing techniques may altered minimize bycatch reduce impacts marine habitats techniques include using varied gear types depending target species habitat type example net larger holes allow undersized fish avoid capture turtle excluder device ted allows sea turtles megafauna escape shrimp trawls avoiding fishing spawning grounds may allow fish stocks rebuild giving adults chance reproduce aquaculture involves farming fish captivity approach effectively privatizes fish stocks creates incentives farmers conserve stocks also reduces environmental impact however farming carnivorous fish salmon always reduce pressure wild fisheries since carnivorous farmed fish usually fed fishmeal fish oil extracted wild forage fish various species pacific salmon atlantic salmon relatively easy raise captivity aquacultural operations existed years largescale releases salmon raised captivity supplement wild salmon runs usually increase fishing pressure much less abundant wild salmon runs aquaculture played minor role harvesting marine organisms growth aquaculture increased rapidly rate wild capture plateaued aquaculture provides approximately half harvested aquatic organisms aquaculture production rates continue grow wild harvest remains steady fish farming enclose entire breeding cycle fish fish bred captivity fish prove difficult breed captivity caught wild
