enzyme urea cycle involved biosynthesis arginine species production urea ureotelic mutations resulting low activity enzyme increase levels urea body result various side effects asl gene located

tetrameric enzyme monomer three highly conserved regions remote one another regions cluster together tetramer form four active sites therefore asl homotetramer four active sites catalyze breakdown argininosuccinate monomer asl homotetramer composed three structural domains three primarily alpha helical domains similar structure consist helixturnhelix motifs domain monomer contains amino terminus domain contains one small beta sheet nine alpha helices carboxyl terminus three nine alpha helices one monomer engaged mainly hydrophobic interactions another monomer form dimer two dimers associate way alpha helix one monomer form central core association four monomers allows catalytic activity possible active multiple copies polypeptide encoded gene often form aggregate referred multimer multimer formed polypeptides produced two different mutant alleles particular gene mixed multimer may exhibit greater functional activity unmixed multimers formed mutants alone mixed multimer displays increased functionality relative unmixed multimers phenomenon referred intragenic complementation humans asl multimer tetramer protein asl disorder humans arise mutations asl gene
