streamlined body presumed position similar part digestive tract also preserved filled midsized fish remains shape remains may outline true shape corresponding part digestive tract likely colon presence scales undigested bones colon suggests platecarpus mosasaurs processed food quickly thoroughly digest absorb food gastrointestinal tract coprolites mosasaur globidens also suggestive low digestion absorption rates contain masses crushed bivalve caudal tail vertebrae sharply downturned vertebrae bend called caudal peduncle wedgeshaped neural spines wider ends bases downturned area likely supported fluke similar modern sharks two lobes would present lower one supported downturned vertebrae upper unsupported one tail fluke probably hypocercal meaning lower lobe longer upper lobe

teeth suggesting fed smaller softer prey small fish mosasaurs traditionally thought propelled water lateral undulation similar way eels deep caudal fin platecarpus suggests swam like shark downturned caudal vertebrae platecarpus suggest crescentshaped tail fluke point tail fluke begins vertebral centra shortened disklike reduced size likely allowed greater flexibility area would experienced high stresses swimming neural spines vertebrae also grooves insertion interspinal ligaments dorsal connective tissues would aided lateral movement fluke ligaments probably made collagenous fibers acted springs move tail back resting position energy stored types ligaments work living fish conserve energy repetitive bending tail fluke back tail undulated platecarpus base tail remained stable form movement known carangiform structure scales platecarpus may another adaptation toward marine lifestyle small size similar shape scales throughout body would stiffened trunk making resistant lateral movement stiffness would improved hydrodynamic efficiency improving flow water across body early mosasauroid vallecillosaurus also preserves body scales larger varied shape suggesting animal relied undulatory movement trunk rather tail plotosaurus derived mosasaur platecarpus even smaller scales covering body indicating even efficient locomotion williston includes drawings skull platecarpus
