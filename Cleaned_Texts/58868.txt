tinnitus maskers range devices based simple white noise machines used add natural artificial sound tinnitus sufferers environment order mask cover noise supplied sound generator may reside ear placed table elsewhere environment noise usually white noise music cases may patterned sound specially tailored sound based characteristics persons tinnitus perceived loudness tinnitus called sensation level sl much louder tinnitus ambient noise environment raising ambient level noise playing white noise ear apparent loudness tinnitus reduced noise level close usually somewhat louder perceived loudness tinnitus generated noise designed calming less intrusive sound ringing hissing tinnitus depending loudness noise tinnitus may fully partially masked tinnitus masking reduce eliminate tinnitus reduce

everyone concept external sound could suppress perception internal one first realised clinically dr jack vernon reported white noise effective alleviating tinnitus suppression different related tinnitus masking acoustic neurological effect results temporary suppression tinnitus listening appropriately tailored sound short period sound withdrawn tinnitus may fully complete silence partially suppressed persons experience effect usually period complete silence followed gradual return tinnitus original level effect lasts minutes less persons rare cases hour period complete silence usually seconds minute trigger sound repeated intervals tinnitus suppressed long repetition lasts residual inhibition ri effect first noted capacity sound right frequency intensity briefly attenuate suppress tinnitus distinguish tailored sound used inhibition broadband undifferentiated sound employed tinnitus maskers usually referred trigger quieting sound trigger sound closely matched pitch spectrum

two qualities tinnitus masker need taken account effective masking intrusive distracting generated sound masking sound may various temporal spectral amplitudinal characteristics cases sound tuned pitch loudness qualities tinnitus however frequencies widely divergent tinnitus frequency may also mask tinnitus sufficient loudness minimum energy loudness mask usually one closely matched central frequency bandwidth tinnitus also discovered tinnitus mask close frequency tinnitus ineffective masker different frequency bandwidth effectively masks tinnitus indicates different origins tinnitus tinnitus maskers may use music natural sounds wide band white pink noise narrow band white noise notched soundfield frequency amplitude modulated sound intermittent pulsed sound patterned sound temporally patterned sound may effective white noise background music masking studies found bandpass maskers less annoying pure tone maskers annoyance rating bandpass maskers proportional bandwidth intermittent maskers annoying continuous ones control center frequency bandwidth important minimizing annoyance maskers addition spectrum masking sound amplitude determines degree masking achieved cases required masking amplitude high cause discomfort user sound generator tinnitus therefore considered unmaskable frequency characteristics tinnitus vary time shifts temporary permanent may also
