chromatin immunoprecipitation chip type immunoprecipitation experimental technique used investigate interaction proteins dna cell aims determine whether specific proteins associated specific genomic regions transcription factors promoters dna binding sites possibly define cistromes chip also aims determine specific location genome various histone modifications associated indicating target histone chip crucial advancements field epigenomics learning epigenetic briefly conventional method follows mainly two types chip primarily differing starting chromatin preparation first uses reversibly crosslinked chromatin sheared sonication called crosslinked chip xchip native chip nchip uses native chromatin sheared micrococcal nuclease digestioncitation needed crosslinked chip mainly suited
