allais paradox choice problem designed maurice allais show inconsistency actual observed choices predictions expected utility theory rather adhering rationality allais paradox proves individuals rarely make rational decisions consistently required immediately independence axiom expected utility theory requires preferences individual change altering two lotteries equal proportions proven violated allais paradox arises comparing participants choices two different experiments consists choice two gambles b payoffs gamble experiment follows several involving hypothetical small monetary payoffs recently involving health supported assertion presented choice people would choose likewise presented choice people would choose allais asserted reasonable choose alone alone however person chose alone alone would choose together inconsistent expected utility theorycitation needed according expected utility theory person choose either inconsistency stems fact expected utility theory equal outcomes eg million gambles added two choices effect relative desirability one gamble equal outcomes cancel experiment two gambles give outcome time starting top row moving give outcome million probability give outcome nothing probability common consequence disregarded experiment choice gambles chance million versus chance million rewriting payoffs disregarding chance winning equalising outcome left offering chance winning nothing chance winning million also left offering chance winning nothing chance winning million hence choice seen choice manner also seen choice ie allais presented paradox counterexample independence axiom independence means agent indifferent simple lotteries l displaystyle l displaystyle agent also indifferent l displaystyle mixed arbitrary simple lottery l displaystyle probability p displaystyle p l displaystyle mixed l displaystyle probability p displaystyle p violating principle known common consequence problem common consequence effect idea

results violated theories quiggin kahneman tversky others could explained configural weight theory violates property main point allais wished make independence axiom expected utility theory may valid axiom independence axiom states two identical outcomes within gamble treated irrelevant analysis gamble whole however overlooks notion complementarities fact choice one part gamble may depend possible outcome part gamble choice chance getting nothing however chance getting nothing also carries great sense disappointment pick gamble lose knowing could certainty chosen feeling disappointment however contingent outcome portion gamble ie feeling certainty hence allais argues possible evaluate portions gambles choices independently choices presented independence axiom requires thus poor judge rational action valued independently independence sure thing principle requires us dont act irrationally choosing rather expected utility theory robust enough capture bounded rationality choices case arise complementarities common explanation allais paradox individuals prefer certainty risky outcome even defies expected utility axiom certainty effect popularised kahneman tversky discussed wakker certainty effect highlights appeal zerovariance lottery recent indicated alternate explanation certainty effect called zero effect zero effect slight adjustment certainty effect states individuals appeal lottery doesnt possibility winning nothing aversion zero prior allais style tasks involve two experiments four lotteries lottery without possible outcome zero zerovariance lottery making impossible differentiate impact effects decision making running two additional lotteries allowed two effects distinguished hence statistical significance twostage experiment individual selected lottery selected lottery conform paradox violate expected utility axiom third experiment choices participants already violated expected utility theoryin first two experiments highlighted underlying effect causing allais paradox participants chose provided evidence certainty effect chose showed evidence zero effect participants chose deviated rational choice presented zerovariance lottery participants chose deviated rational lottery choice avoid risk winning nothing aversion findings sixlottery experiment indicated zero effect statistically significant pvalue certainty effect found statistically insignificant intuitive explanation individuals deviating expected utility using values utility function uw w wealth demonstrate exactly paradox manifests typical individual prefers conclude expected utilities preferred greater expected utilities second choices rewrite latter equation experiment contradicts first bet experiment shows player prefers sure thing gamble allais
