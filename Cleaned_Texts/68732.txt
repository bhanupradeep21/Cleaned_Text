assessment lesion load brain atrophy patients multiple sclerosis clinical trials known one valuable sources data evidencebased medicine pharmaceutical device procedure approved regular use us must rigorously tested clinical trials demonstrate sufficient efficacy unfortunately clinical trials also extremely expensive time consuming endpoints morbidity mortality used measures compare groups within clinical trial basic endpoint used clinical trials mortality requires years sometimes decades followup sufficiently assess morbidity although potentially faster measure mortality also difficult endpoint measure clinically often subjective reasons biomarkers increasingly used clinical trials detect subtle changes physiology pathology detected clinically biomarkers act surrogate endpoints use surrogate endpoints shown significantly decrease time resources used clinical trials surrogate endpoints allow researchers assess marker rather patient allows participants act control many cases allows easier blinding addition surrogate endpoints imaging biomarkers used predictive classifiers assist selecting appropriate candidates particular treatment predictive classifiers frequently used molecular imaging order ensure enzymatic response treatment united states congress food drug administration acknowledged value imaging biomarkers evidenced recent actions encourage use fda modernization act instituted improve regulatory process medical products section act gives explicit authority give expedited approval drugs treat serious conditions long shown effect surrogate endpoint reasonably indicates clinical benefit provisions enables monitoring products following market approval ensure efficacy surrogate endpoints requires fda establish program promotes development use surrogate endpoints serious diseases although act specifically mention use surrogate endpoints medical devices section requires least burdensome means necessary used wording much general provision pharmaceuticals generally accepted surrogate endpoints often qualify least burdensome means developing understanding clinical significance specific biomarkers difficult process two steps certification surrogate endpoint fully established qualification validation biomarker become qualified must go somewhat formal qualification process request must submitted iprg qualify imaging biomarker specific

ultimately make decision accept reject qualification biomarker may limited use surrogate endpoint may used phase ii clinical trials used phase iii trials early futility analyses two steps validation probable validation known validation probable validation requires widespread agreement medical scientific community efficacy known validation requires scientific framework body evidence appears elucidate marker full validation biomarker must demonstrate treatment versus control differences similar treatment versus control differences clinical outcome sufficient simply demonstrate biomarker
