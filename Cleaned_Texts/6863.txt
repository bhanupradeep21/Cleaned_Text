sandhoff disease lysosomal genetic lipid storage disorder caused inherited deficiency create functional betahexosaminidases catabolic enzymes needed degrade neuronal membrane components ganglioside derivative glycolipid globoside visceral oligosaccharides accumulation metabolites leads progressive destruction central nervous system eventually rare autosomal neurodegenerative disorder clinically almost indistinguishable disease another genetic disorder disrupts betahexosaminidases three subsets sandhoff disease based first symptoms appear classic infantile juvenile adult late onsetcitation needed sandhoff disease symptoms clinically indeterminable disease classic infantile form disease severe symptoms incredibly hard diagnose early first signs symptoms begin months age parents notice child begins regressing development children ability sit crawl lose ability caused slow deterioration muscles childs body buildup gangliosides since body unable create enzymes needs within central nervous system unable attach gangliosides break apart make nontoxic buildup several symptoms begin appear musclemotor weakness sharp reaction loud noises blindness deafness inability react stimulants respiratory problems infections mental retardation seizures cherry red spots retina enlarged liver spleen hepatosplenomegaly pneumonia two forms sandhoff disease similar symptoms lesser extent adult juvenile forms sandhoff disease rare infantile cases victims suffer cognitive impairment retardation loss muscle coordination impairs eventually destroys ability walk characteristic red spots retina also develop adult form disease however sometimes milder may lead muscle weakness impairs walking ability get two parents carrying mutated gene passing offspring cause disease even parents carrying

showing symptoms infantile juvenile form mutation exon father base pair deletion mother located many five exons exons articles regarding sandhoff disease frequencies among distinct groups people contain discrepancies one another mutations reported novel one article says sandhoff disease found commonly individuals nonjewish others say commonly discovery several mutations ashkenazi jews may reflect ascertainment bias rather high population frequency ashkenazi jews targeted population mass screening program taysachs disease several rare sd mutations discovered researchers resolved cases enzyme deficiency among suspected tsd carriers cases disease however since autosomal recessive disease likely found ethnic group passing generation generation carriers without expressed offspring even though family may history sandhoff disease possible two individuals child disease since sandhoff disease discovered years disease gone undetected misdiagnosescitation needed biallelic pathogenic variants hexb gene cause sandhoff disease gene provides instructions making protein crucial enzymes betahexosaminidase betahexosaminidase function nerve cells break fatty substances complex sugars molecules linked sugars particular betahexosaminidase breaks fatty compound called ganglioside mutations hexb gene disrupt activity enzymes preventing breakdown ganglioside moleculescitation needed result progressive damage caused resulting buildup ganglioside leads destruction nerve cells causing signs symptoms associated sandhoff diseasecitation needed sandhoff disease detected following procedures apparent physical examination biopsy removing sample tissue liver genetic testing molecular analysis cells tissues determine presence genetic metabolic disorder enzyme assay occasionally urinalysis determine abovenoted compounds abnormally stored within body child suffer disease parents must carriers must transmit mutation child thus even case parents mutation percent chance child inherit condition frequently parents given opportunity dna screening high risk determine carrier status children however also highly recommended undergo testing even parents family history sandhoff disease families children sandhoff disease known prior family history condition mutation hexb gene cause clinical symptoms one copy present often passed undetected one generation naturally individual carries mutation risk transmitting unborn child genetic counseling recommended mutationcitation needed possible parents child child sandhoff disease pgd pegd pegd preembryonic genetic diagnosis

recommended genome sequenced ensure carriers sequence genome three types sandhoff disease classic infantile juvenile adult late form classified severity symptoms well age patient shows juvenile adult onset forms sandhoff disease rare signs symptoms begin childhood adolescence adulthood usually milder seen infantile form sandhoff disease infantile form mental abilities coordination affected characteristic features include muscle weakness loss muscle coordination ataxia problems movement speech problems mental illness signs symptoms vary widely among people lateonset forms sandhoff diseasecitation needed currently sandhoff disease standard treatment cure however person suffering disease needs proper nutrition hydration maintenance clear airways reduce symptoms may occur sandhoff disease patient may take anticonvulsants manage seizures medications treat respiratory infections consume precise diet consisting puree foods due difficulties swallowing infants disease usually die age due respiratory infections patient must constant surveillance suffer aspiration lack ability change passageway lungs versus stomach spit travels lungs causing bronchopneumonia patient also lacks ability cough therefore must undergo treatment shake body remove mucus lining lungs medication also given patients lessen symptoms including seizurescitation needed currently government testing several treatments including nbutyldeoxynojirimycin mice well stem cell treatment humans medical treatments recruiting test sandhoff disease study showing proof principle gene therapy human model system using crispr virus gene correction gives chance clinical trials cure disease ultrarare occurrence main hurdle overcome clinical sandhoff disease one several forms formerly known amaurotic
