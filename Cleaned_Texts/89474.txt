demyelinating disease refers disease affecting nervous system myelin sheath surrounding neurons damage disrupts transmission signals affected nerves resulting decrease conduction ability consequently reduction conduction lead deficiencies sensation movement cognition functions depending nerves affected various factors contribute development demyelinating diseases including genetic predisposition infectious agents autoimmune reactions unknown factors proposed causes demyelination include genetic predisposition environmental factors viral infections exposure certain chemicals additionally exposure commercial insecticides like sheep dip weed killers flea treatment preparations pets contain organophosphates also lead nerve chronic exposure neuroleptic medications may also cause furthermore deficiencies vitamin result demyelinating diseases traditionally classified two types demyelinating myelinoclastic diseases demyelinating leukodystrophic diseases first group healthy normal myelin destroyed toxic substances chemicals autoimmune reactions second group myelin inherently abnormal undergoes poser criteria named second group dysmyelinating wellknown demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis evidence suggests bodys immune system plays significant role acquired immune system cells specifically tcells found site lesions immune system cells macrophages possibly mast cells also contribute symptoms signs present demyelinating diseases different condition symptoms signs present person demyelinating role prolonged cortical myelination human evolution implicated contributing factor cases demyelinating disease unlike primates humans exhibit unique pattern postpubertal myelination may contribute development psychiatric disorders neurodegenerative diseases present early adulthood beyond extended period cortical myelination humans may allow greater opportunities disruption myelination resulting onset demyelinating furthermore humans significantly greater prefrontal white matter volume primate species implies greater myelin increased myelin density humans result prolonged myelination may therefore structure risk myelin degeneration dysfunction evolutionary considerations role prolonged cortical myelination risk factor demyelinating disease particularly pertinent given genetics autoimmune deficiency hypotheses fail explain many cases demyelinating disease argued diseases multiple sclerosis accounted autoimmune deficiency alone strongly imply influence flawed developmental processes disease therefore role humanspecific prolonged
