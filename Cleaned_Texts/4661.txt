sexual conflict sexual antagonism occurs two sexes conflicting optimal fitness strategies concerning reproduction particularly mode frequency mating potentially leading evolutionary arms race males one example males may benefit multiple matings multiple matings may harm endanger females due anatomical differences sexual conflict underlies evolutionary distinction male development evolutionary arms race also seen chaseaway sexual selection places intersexual conflicts context secondary sexual characteristic evolution sensory exploitation female according chaseaway selection continuous sexual conflict creates environment mating frequency male secondary sexual trait development somewhat step females degree primarily studied animals though principle apply sexually reproducing organism plants fungi evidence sexual conflict sexual conflict takes two major forms sexual conflict may lead antagonistic coevolution one sex usually male evolves favorable trait offset countering trait sex similarly interlocus sexual conflict result called perpetual cycle perpetual cycle begins traits favor male reproductive competition eventually manifests male persistence favorable traits cause reduction fitness females due persistence following event females may develop counteradaptation favorable trait reduces direct costs implemented males known female resistance event females fitness depression decreases cycle starts interlocus sexual conflict reflects interactions among mates achieve optimal fitness strategies explained evolutionary concepts sensory exploitation males one mechanism involves males attempting overcome female reluctance result chaseaway selection leads coevolutionary arms race also mechanisms involved sexual conflict traumatic insemination forced copulation penis fencing love darts others female resistance traditionally includes reducing negative effects mechanisms implemented males outside norm may include sexual cannibalism increased fitness females offspring increased aggression males regard sexual conflict subset sexual selection traditionally regarded mutualistic others suggest separate evolutionary differences male female general

example neotropical spider paratrechalea ornata displays nuptial giftgiving behaviors courtship part male mating efforts nuptials gifts allow male control copulation duration increase speed female

paired males benefit high female fidelity unpaired males benefit low female fidelity order increase mating frequencies toxicity seminal fluid females benefit low seminal fluid toxicity males benefit high toxicity level increases competitive female fecundity males benefit high female fecundity means females produce offspring higher potential reproduction important note females also benefit high fecundity thus trait probably affected classical natural selection maternal investment many species males benefit high maternal investment allows preserve energy time additional matings rather investing resources one offspring females expected invest certain amount time resources also detrimental female much maternal investment expected natural andor sexual selection traits influence

allele population interlocus sexual retention antagonistic alleles population could also explained terms increase net fitness maternal line example locus male sexual orientation humans identified subtelomeric regions x chromosomes studies conducted families homosexual men sex orientation found higher maternal uncles male cousins gay evolutionary model explained finding terms increased

interspecies divergence found higher intraspecific polymorphism non synonymous sites malebiased genes elucidated role positive selection showed malebiased genes undergo frequent adaptive although positive evolution associated male femalebiased genes difficult isolate genes shown bias solely due sexual conflictantagonism nevertheless since sexually antagonistic genes give rise biased expression

numerous evolutionary concepts applied wide range species order provide explanations interactions sexes conflict interactions male females described ongoing evolutionary arms race according darwin sexual selection occurs individuals favored others sex context reproduction sexual selection sexual conflict related males usually mate multiple females females typically mate fewer males hypothesized chase away selection sexual conflict may result males use sensory exploitation males able exploit females sensory biases due existence female choice example females may behave ways considerably biased

describes mechanism different males compete fertilize females sperm competition selects offensive defensive traits offensive sperm competition consists males displacing sperm previous male well use toxic sperm destroy rival conversely defensive sperm competition consists males preventing females remating prolonging duration mating restricting females interest males sperm competition exhibited throughout behavioral morphological physiological male adaptations examples behavioral adaptations mate guarding forced copulation morphological adaptations may include male claspers altered genitalia eg spiky genitals copulatory plugs ie mating plugs physiological adaptations may consist toxic sperm chemicals seminal fluid delays females ability sexual conflict exhibited males target males sperm

mating ritual involves penis fencing try stab inseminate time avoid stabbed inseminated represents cost striking hypodermic insemination cause considerable injury result conflict lies adapting adept

infanticide behavior occurs many species adult kills younger individuals including eggs sexual conflict one common causes although exceptions demonstrated male bass eating juvenile although males usually exhibit behavior females also behave way infanticide extensively studied vertebrates hanuman langurs big cats house sparrows mice however behavior also occurs invertebrates example spider stegodyphus lineatus males invade female nests toss egg females one clutch lifetime experience reduced reproductive success clutch lost results vicious battles injury even death occur jacana jacana tropical wading bird provides example infanticide female females guard territory males care young males limited resource females commonly displace kill young males mate care young new female behavior

stiletto created males love darts shot females courtship single love dart shot time due lengthy process snails genus helix model organisms study love darts observed snails rub mates forcefully place love dart mate shown though darts may aid mating necessarily ensure mating however love darts fact aid mating success hermaphroditic snails selectively take female male role snails transmitted darts females would store sperm twice much compared males males successfully hit females love darts higher paternity assurance many snails inflicted love darts suffer open wounds sometimes forced copulation sexual coercion males occurs wide range species may elicit behaviors aggression harassment grasping time prior copulation females suffer detrimental effects due forceful male mating tactics ultimately females forced copulate aka rape harassment behavior displayed prior forced copulation male may follow female distance preparation attack malabar ricefish horaichthys setnai beloniformes males harass

achieved mating success males genital structures particular shape aid female water striders g gracilicornis behavioral mechanism grasping structures allowing grasping male water striders use called intimidating courtship mechanism involves males using signal vibration attract predators order manipulate females mate females face risks captured predators since idle waters surface long periods time male attached female would less likely male harmed predators would resting top female therefore males tap legs order create ripples water attract predators female become fearful causing less resistant

processes able restrain females longer males shorter abdominal diving beetles dytiscidae males approach females water grasping mechanism copulation occurs females repeatedly resist males evolved anatomical advantage towards grasping males particular structure located tarsae enhances grasping female anatomical structures pronotum elytra located dorsal sepsis cynipsea another example sexual conflict via grasping males force copulation however females lay eggs fertilized previous mating new male mounts female guards males although females larger males males still able grasp onto female
