sperm competition competitive process spermatozoa two different males fertilize sexual reproduction competition occur females multiple potential mating partners greater choice variety mates increases females chance produce viable however multiple mates female means individual male decreased chances producing offspring sperm competition evolutionary pressure males led development adaptations increase males chance reproductive sperm competition results sexual conflict males males evolved several defensive tactics including mateguarding mating plugs releasing toxic seminal substances reduce female remating tendencies cope sperm offensive tactics sperm competition involve direct interference one male reproductive success another male instance physically removing another males sperm prior mating example see gryllus bimaculatus sperm competition often compared tickets raffle male better chance winning ie fathering offspring tickets ie sperm inseminates female however sperm free males predicted produce sperm size number maximize success sperm competition making many spermatozoa males buy raffle tickets thought selection numerous sperm contributed evolution anisogamy small sperm energy tradeoff sperm size alternatively male may evolve faster sperm enable sperm reach fertilize females ovum first dozens adaptations documented males help succeed sperm competition mateguarding defensive behavioral trait occurs response sperm competition males try prevent males approaching female andor vice versa thus preventing mate engaging precopulatory postcopulatory mateguarding occurs insects lizards birds primates mateguarding also exists fish species neolamprologus pulcher males try sneak matings females territory males instances males guard female keeping close enough proximity opponent male shows territory able fight rival male prevent female engaging extrapair copulation rival organisms polygynous mating systems controlled one dominant male type mating system male able mate one female dominant males reign community another suitor steps overthrows current dominant male defend title dominant male also defending females mates offspring sires elephant seal falls category since participate bloody violent matches order protect community defend title alpha alpha male somehow overthrown newcomer children likely killed new alpha male start females group lineage passed strategic mateguarding occurs male guards female fertile periods strategy effective may allow male engage extrapair paternity withinpair also energetically efficient male guard mate time lot energy expended male guarding mate instance polygynous mateguarding systems energetic costs males defending title alpha male fighting costly regards amount energy used guard mate bouts happen takes toll physical wellbeing male another cost mateguarding type mating system potential increase spread one male std pass females hes copulating potentially resulting depletion harem would energetic cost towards sexes reason instead using energy reproduction redirecting towards ridding illness females also benefit polygyny extra pair copulations females increase genetic diversity community occurs male able watch females become promiscuous eventually male proper nutrition makes male unable produce instance male amphipods deplete reserves glycogen triglycerides replenished male done guarding also amount energy intake equal energy expended could potentially fatal male males may even travel long distances breeding season order find female absolutely drain energy supply studies conducted compare cost foraging fish migrate animals residential studies concluded fish residential fuller stomachs containing higher quality prey compared migrant energy costs go along guarding mate timing crucial male use minimal amount energy efficient males choose mate fertile also males likely guard mate high density males sometimes organisms put time planning courting mate order copulate may even interested risk cuckoldry sort since rival male successfully court female male originally courting could however benefits associated mateguarding mating guarding system parties male female able directly indirectly benefit instance females indirectly benefit protected females appreciate decrease predation harassment males able observe male allow recognize particular traits finds ideal shell able find another male emulates qualities polygynous relationships dominant male community benefits best fertilization communities include females compared males greatly increase chances mating males successfully courted potential mate attempt keep sight males copulation one way organisms accomplish move female new location certain butterflies enticing female pick fly away vicinity potential insects males release pheromone order make mate unattractive males pheromone masks scent certain crickets participate loud courtship female accepts gesture suddenly becomes insects prior mating assume tandem positions mate position way prevent males attempting mate male checkerspot butterfly developed clever method order attract guard mate situate near area possesses valuable resources female needs drive away males come near greatly increase chances copulation female comes postcopulatory mateguarding males trying prevent males mating female mated already example male millipedes costa rica ride back mate letting males know shes japanese beetles assume tandem position female last several hours allowing ward rival males giving sperm high chance fertilize females egg types methods male playing defense protecting mate elephant seals known engage bloody battles order retain title dominant male able mate females copulatory plugs frequently observed insects reptiles mammals copulatory plugs inserted immediately male copulates female reduce possibility fertilization subsequent copulations another male physically blocking transfer bumblebee mating plugs addition providing physical barrier copulations contain linoleic acid reduces remating tendencies species sonoran desert drosophila drosophila mettleri uses copulatory plugs enable males control sperm reserve space females available behavior ensures males higher mating success expense female control sperm sperm selection similarly drosophila melanogaster males release toxic seminal fluids known acps accessory gland proteins accessory glands impede female participating future substances act antiaphrodisiac causing dejection subsequent copulations also stimulate ovulation seminal proteins strong influence reproduction sufficient manipulate female behavior another strategy known sperm partitioning occurs males conserve limited supply sperm reducing quantity sperm drosophila ejaculation amount sequential copulations reduced results half filled female sperm reserves following single copulatory event allows male mate larger number females without exhausting supply facilitate sperm partitioning males developed complex ways store deliver blue headed wrasse thalassoma bifasciatum sperm duct sectioned several small chambers surrounded muscle allows male regulate much sperm released one copulatory strategy common among insects males participate prolonged copulations engaging prolonged copulations male increased opportunity place sperm within females reproductive tract prevent female copulating found male mollies poecilia developed deceptive social cues combat sperm competition focal males direct sexual attention toward typically nonpreferred females audience males present encourages males watching attempt mate nonpreferred female done attempt decrease mating attempts female focal male prefers hence decreasing sperm offensive adaptation behavior differs defensive behavior involves attempt ruin chances another males opportunity succeeding copulation engaging act tries terminate fertilization success previous offensive behavior facilitated presence certain traits called example armament antlers presence offensive trait sometimes serves status signal mere display armament suffice drive away competition without engaging fight hence saving male offensive side mateguarding may terminate guarding males chances successful insemination brawling guarding male gain access drosophila males release seminal fluids contain additional toxins like pheromones modified enzymes secreted accessory glands intended destroy sperm already made way females reproductive tract recent however proved wrong drosophila melanogaster seminal fluid actually protect sperm males based last male

invest ejaculation competitors immediate environment female evidence exists illustrates ability genetically similar spermatozoa cooperate ensure survival counterparts thereby ensuring implementation genotypes towards fertilization cooperation confers competitive advantage several means include incapacitation competing sperm aggregation genetically similar spermatozoa structures promote effective navigation female reproductive tract hence improve fertilization ability characteristics lead morphological adaptations suit purposes cooperative methods competition example spermatozoa possessed wood mouse apodemus sylvaticus possess apical hook used attach spermatozoa form mobile trains enhance motility female reproductive spermatozoa fail incorporate mobile trains less likely engage fertilization evidence suggests link sperm competition sperm hook selection produce sperm also select evolution larger testes relationships across species frequency multiple mating females male testis size well documented across many groups animals example among primates female gorillas relatively monogamous gorillas smaller testes humans turn smaller testes highly promiscuous male chimpanzees live structured multimale multifemale community large testicles produce sperm therefore giving better odds fertilize female whereas community gorillas consist one alpha male two three females female gorillas ready mate normally alpha male partner regarding sexual dimorphism among primates humans falls intermediate group moderate sex differences body size relatively large testes typical pattern primates several males females live together group male faces intermediate number challenges males compared exclusive polygyny monogamy frequent sperm means sperm competition could include improving
