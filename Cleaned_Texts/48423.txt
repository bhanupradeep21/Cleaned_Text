california midsummer crop northern great plains united minimum length growing season days summer winter cultivars plant performance highly dependent different planting dates terms temperature day winter hard varieties form rosette late fall elongates early stages safflower tolerates humidity bud stage danger botrytis blight infestation safflower drought tap root makes moisture deep soil layers additionally tolerance also explained higher water use efficiency compared oil crops linseed shortly maximum flowering water requirements beside drought tolerance parts plant sensitive moisture terms case excessive water supply susceptible root therefore many varieties suitable irrigated agriculture especially soils danger safflower tolerates wind hail better stays erect retain seeds safflower prefers welldrained neutral fertile deep adapt well soil ph ph tolerates safflower well grown different soil types water supply main driving factor suitability depending climate irrigation resulting different water regimes different soil therefore cultivation shallow soils especially soils danger waterlogging deep rooting promotes water air movement improves soil quality subsequent crops nutrient requirements compared wheat barley except nitrogen amendment increased therefore soils adequate nitrogen supply safflower frequently grown crop rotation small grains fallow annual close rotation crops susceptible sclerotinia sclerotiorum avoided eg sunflower canola mustard plant pea fouryear rotation recommended reduce disease seeds sown spring early soil temperature exceeded take advantage full growing season wireworms problem field previous seasons respective seed treatment recommended planting depth cm optimal shallow seeding promotes uniform emergence resulting better stand seeding rate recommendations around kgha lbacre live lower seeding rates promote branching longer flowering period later maturity higher rates promote thicker stands higher disease incidence sufficient moisture necessary germination usually row spacing cm chosen using similar drill settings recommended total n recommendation kgha lbacre include credits based previous crops soil available n latter deeper
