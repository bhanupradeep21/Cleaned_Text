alvinella pompejana pompeii worm species deepsea polychaete worm commonly referred bristle worms extremophile found hydrothermal vents pacific ocean discovered early gal√°pagos islands french marine biologists daniel desbruy√®res lucien laubier years discovery first hydrothermal vent system identified one heattolerant animals earth alvinella pompejana pompeii described deepsea polychaete resides tubes near hydrothermal vents along seafloor marine biologist craig cary colleagues found worms new section pacific ocean near costa rica also attached hydrothermal vents new discovery subsequent work led important progress scientific knowledge special reach cm length pale gray red tentaclelike gills heads perhaps fascinating tail ends often resting temperatures high featherlike heads stick tubes water much cooler scientists attempting understand pompeii worms withstand extreme temperatures studying bacteria form fleecelike covering backs bacteria also discovered chemolithotrophic contributing ecology vent community recent research suggests bacteria might play important role feeding attaching black smokers worms found thrive sustained temperatures even short making pompeii worm heattolerant complex animal known science tardigrades water bears able survive temperatures reaching length cm pompeii worms hairy backs hairs actually colonies bacteria nautilia profundicola thought afford worm degree insulation glands worms back secrete mucus bacteria feed form symbiosis pompeii worms form large aggregate colonies enclosed long tubes alvinella pompejana relatively simple organ systems centering around rodlike heart outermost organ gills along feathershaped head four external gills present leaflike red colour due hemoglobin heart provides blood organs using contractions pushing blood along dorsal ventral vessels beneath heart lies animals stomach connects oesophagus used consume food finally surrounding organs coelom filled coelomocytes type phagocyte acts immune system pompeii worm feeds upon chemosynthetic bacteria using retractable ciliated feeding tentacles scoop absorbing organic matter within hydrothermal vent tentacles coated types secretory cells along entire epidermis tentacle muscle cells seem filled homogenous blood cells individual hatshaped cells hatshaped cells condensed nucleus hypothesised heavily modified sperm gills pompejana pinnate many thin outgrowths organ ultrastructurally similar gills terebellidae epidermis irregularly folded inwards gives blood access space close skin pompejana thus allowing effective oxygen diffusion secretory cells goblet type also observed along hairlike receptor cells known bipolar ciliary receptor cells important note pompeii worm epibiotic bacteria absent gills alvinella pompejana blood abnormally cool due bloods high positive cooperativity temperatures thus haemoglobin likely gain oxygen essential feature environment sparse oxygen levels additionally pompejanas gills highest specific surface area polychaete small diffusion distances circulatory system external seawater assist alvinellidae exceptionally high congenital oxygen affinity addition high heat requirement oxygenation ùö´h therefore allow adequate release oxygen within body pompeii worm acidic blood ph range lower ph decreases energy required unbind oxygen haemoglobin utilising bohr effect effect gradually compounds haemoglobin binding sites emptied maximal haemoglobin fully deoxygenated result release possible oxygen without expending excessive energy compound pompejana vascular haemoglobin lower oxygen affinity compared coelomic haemoglobin time rebind oxygen haemoglobin blood must cooled regain optimal cooperativity however hydrothermal vents reach much higher temperatures makes low blood temperature strange seemingly hard current hypothesis polychaete worm maintains external microenvironment exceed limit possibly cold water pulled tube worms repeated exit entry addition bacteria circulating water around worms supported evidence pompejana mitochondrion break exceeded despite worm still manages live vents exceed furthermore inverse relationship drawn ùö´h value temperature range environment higher ùö´h means habitat smaller range temperatures fewer fluctuations pompejana high ùö´h reasonable theorise habitable temperature range quite small alvinella pompejana gonochoric species distinct differences male female genital pores located base males pair tentacles near mouth absent females however females possess genital tract consisting oviducts spermathecae exact method reproduction unknown believed complex multistep process however known pompeii worms habitat rapidly changes extremely unstable thus reproduction adapted accordingly size female oocytes suggests embryo lecithotrophic meaning nutrition within yolk egg prior fertilisation oocytes flattened spheres undulating membrane slightly centre germinal vesicle less dense surrounding cytoplasm upon dilution seawater become spherical gv disappears point whole oocyte appears homogeneous process require current hypothesis egg synthesis spawning follows first yolk formed long process within animals coelom next mature eggs stored finally eggs spawned either environmental biological change occurs eg sperm method transfer spermatozoa likely achieved pseudocopulatory behaviour worms observed diving headfirst tubes display may deemed appropriate fertilise eggs seemingly selected based upon size individually passed spermathecae method fertilisation efficient eggs passed minutes several hours fertilisation achieved fertilisation envelope progressively elevates begins single point along periphery oocyte prior first cleavage polar lobe forms thus resulting asymmetrical cleavages diameter ratio asymmetrical blastomeres remains fairly constant cell embryos typically possessing cell bigger similar pattern observed although situ observations yet made alvinella pompejana early development experiments conducted order hypothesise embryonic early stages polychaetes embryos pompeii worm unable tolerate low high temperatures developing temperatures higher lower temperature abyssal sea embryos enter state arrested development embryos die thus must develop hydrothermal vent colonies temperatures much higher achieved vitro situ incubation supported hypothesis embryonic development within adult colony impossible test theory researchers placed embryos areas base chimney riftia pachyptila colony adult colony results presented table highest survival development rate coming placements also important note although max temperature directly next incubator temperatures high recorded cm considering results well prior studies concluded likely hypotheses follows however new evidence ecosystem underneath hydrothermal vents suggested worm larvae may instead travel underground colonise new vent pompeii worm known tubes inhabits research uncovered tubes unusually stable glycoprotein structures high sulfur levels construction originally unknown hypothesised structure made secretion epidermis alvinella pompejana fibril layers tubing layered similar manner plywood layer

known precisely pompeii worm survives severe vent conditions scientists suspect answer lies fleecelike bacteria worms back layer may cm thick bacteria may possess special proteins eurythermal enzymes providing extension wide range studies hampered difficulties sampling currently quite difficult pompeii worms survive decompression bacteria known live mutualistic relationship pompejana making symbiotrophs main nutrition pompeii worm derived chemosynthetic bacteria chooses live intense environments due toxic metal levels hydrothermal vent fluid factor chemosynthetic bacteria require unfortunately low ph low oxygen levels aforementioned metals within fluid create environment fit extremophiles pompejana physiological traits assist combating enough result developed strong relationship bacteria bacteria detoxify fluid allows worm feed live worm lives respires thus giving bacteria carbon source feed upon additional benefit bacteria gain shelter surfaces multiply upon due worm study pompeii worms seemingly lifesustaining bacteria could lead significant advances biochemical pharmaceutical textile paper detergent industries pompeii worms simultaneously keep heads
