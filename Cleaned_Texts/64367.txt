bladder hollow organ humans vertebrates stores urine kidneys disposal urination humans bladder distensible organ sits pelvic floor urine enters bladder via ureters exits via urethra typical adult human bladder hold ml fl oz urge empty occurs hold considerably latin phrase urinary bladder vesica urinaria term vesical prefix vesico appear connection associated structures vesical veins modern latin word bladder cystis appears associated terms cystitis inflammation bladder humans bladder hollow muscular organ situated base pelvis gross anatomy bladder divided broad fundus base body apex

cystitis refers infection inflammation bladder commonly occurs part urinary tract adults common women men owing shorter urethra common males childhood older men enlarged prostate may cause urinary risk factors include causes blockage narrowing prostate cancer presence vesicoureteric reflux presence outside structures urinary tract urinary catheters neurologic problems make passing urine infections involve bladder cause pain lower abdomen pubic symphysis called suprapubic pain particularly passing urine desire pass urine frequently little warning urinary infections usually due bacteria common e urinary tract infection cystitis suspected medical practitioner may request urine sample dipstick placed urine may used see urine white blood cells presence nitrates may indicate
