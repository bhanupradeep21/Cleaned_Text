taste receptor member protein humans encoded gene bitter taste receptor varying genotypes influence ability taste phenylthiocarbamide though often proposed varying taste receptor genotypes could influence tasting ability one taste receptors shown proteins utilizes gprotein gustducin primary method signal transduction α βγsubunits crucial transmission taste see taste receptor date total distinct ligands identified bitter taste receptor ligands extensively cataloged documented comprehensive database known bitterdb within repository bitter taste information notable ligands ptc phenylthiocarbamide prop extensively studied widely recognized additionally found interact intriguing ligands including limonin compound commonly found citrus fruits cyclamate artificial sweetener chlorpheniramine antihistamine employed management allergic conditions diverse range ligands recognized receptor adds understanding complex molecular interactions involved perception bitter taste

cells airway smooth muscle monocytes macrophages heart arteries thyroid skin differential ability taste bitter compound phenylthiocarbamide ptc discovered years since ptc tasting ability mapped chromosome several years later shown directly related three common polymorphisms combine form two common haplotypes several rare haplotypes two common haplotypes avi often called nontaster pav often called taster varying combinations haplotypes yield genotypes account variation ptc tasting ability people possessing two copies pav polymorphism report ptc bitter heterozygotes people possessing two copies aviavi polymorphism often report ptc essentially tasteless polymorphisms hypothesized affect taste altering gproteinbinding bitter substances usually toxic presence nontaster geno phenotype seems evolutionarily undesirable several studies suggested however avi polymorphism may code entirely new receptor processes different asyet undiscovered bitter furthermore presence nontaster allele may reflect desirability maintaining mostly heterozygous population group people may possess flexibility bitter taste perception enabling avoid greater number toxins either homozygotic studies however
