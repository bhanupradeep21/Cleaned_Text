birds studied parque nacional de la macarena colombia free blood burrowing owls often nest roost burrows made ground squirrels strategy also used rattlesnakes threatened owl retreats burrow produces rattling hissing sounds similar rattlesnake behavior suggested example acoustic batesian mimicry observed effective strategy animals familiar dangers posed nesting season begins late march april north america burrowing owls usually one mate occasionally male two pairs owls sometimes nest loose colonies typical breeding habitat open grassland prairie occasionally adapt open areas like airports golf courses agricultural fields burrowing owls slightly tolerant human presence often nesting near roads farms homes regularly maintained irrigation canals owls nest burrow hence name burrowing owl burrows unavailable soil hard rocky owls may excavate burrowing owls also nest shallow underground manmade structures easy access surface nesting season burrowing owls collect wide variety materials line nest left around entrance burrow common material mammal dung usually cattle one time thought dung helped mask scent juvenile owls researchers believe dung helps control microclimate inside burrow attract insects owls may female lays egg every one two days completed clutch consist four eggs usually incubates eggs weeks male brings food eggs hatch parents feed chicks four weeks hatching chicks make short flights begin leaving nest burrow parents still help feed chicks months site fidelity rates appear vary among populations locations owls frequently reuse nest several years row owls migratory northern populations less likely return burrow every year also many birds female owls likely disperse different site male hunting wait perch spot prey swoop prey fly catch insects flight sometimes chase prey foot across ground highly variable diet includes invertebrates small vertebrates make roughly one third two thirds diet respectively burrowing owls mainly eat large insects small rodents although burrowing owls often live close ground squirrels marmotini rarely prey upon also hunt analysis burrowing owl diets dominican republic found owls consumed invertebrates birds reptiles amphibians rodent prey usually dominated locally superabundant species like delicate vesper mouse calomys tener southern brazil among squamates amphibians small lizards like tropical house gecko hemidactylus mabouia snakes frogs toads generally vertebrate prey weight class several grams per individual largest prey usually birds eared doves zenaida auriculata may weigh almost much burrowing

food perhaps due vigorous defense large species put earthworms also preyed burrowing owls also known place fecal matter large herbivorous mammals around outside burrows attract dung beetles used provide steady source food burrowing owls also predate invertebrates attracted artificial night unlike owls also eat fruits seeds especially fruit tasajillo cylindropuntia leptocaulis prickly pear

western burrowing owls example nest burrows made blacktailed prairie dogs since unable dig however prairie dog populations experienced decline one causes prairie dog eradication prairie dogs dig burrows uproot plants common agricultural areas burrows cause damage existing crops creating problem local nebraska montana eradication programs already put place manage population prairie eradication programs ground squirrels also put california california ground squirrels known feed crop seedlings well grasses meant cattle prevents crop growth decreases food supply however burrowing animal populations decrease burrowing owls become vulnerable exposure fewer burrows available burrowing owl populations concentrated owls occupying fewer burrows result predators easily detect owl populations capable eliminating larger broods owls prairie dogs ground squirrels also act buffer owls predators since become target prey rather another benefit prairie dogs particular provide burrowing owls takes form alarm calls alert burrowing owls predators nearby therefore giving owls ample time hide without burrowing animals almost every aspect contributing suitable safe living burrowing owls longer available organizations tried contributing conservation burrowing owls digging artificial burrows owls occupy areas active colony burrowing however creating artificial burrows
