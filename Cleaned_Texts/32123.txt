introduced idea psychophysical numbing diminished sensitivity value life inability appreciate words according slovic die less researchers proposed human mind large groups almost staggering therefore rather participate regulating emotions limit overwhelming levels emotions due experiences individuals tend draw emotion regulation compared compassion fade contradicts traditional model valuing life assumes lives valued equally empirical data charitable giving found donations linearly related number victims rather decrease number victims increase concept termed psychophysical psychic psychophysical numbing function depicts number lives risk function value life saving accordance theory compassion fade function illustrates decreasing marginal increase number lives risk increase example one life risk value ten lives risk value decreases fifty lives risk value decreases compassion fade explains peoples perception number lives need aid increases individuality decreases thus value life effects compassion fade valuation victim numbers seen singularity effect research showed information group size provided negatively affects valuation studies investigated compassion fade smaller victim numbers effective using prototype difficult picture comprehensive images victims smaller number compassion fade conceptually measured number lives function emotional response traditional model valuing human lives would assume emotional reactions number lives positively correlated however research found people cognitive emotional response number victims need increasing marginal decrease emotional response number lives risk foundation theory compassion fade research paul slovic found loss single identifiable appears elicits greater emotional response people grow apathetic number lives risk increase emotionally distressing comprehend similar research suggests compassion fade occurs soon number victims increases one negative relationship emotional response valuation human lives explains life valued equally conceptually explains compassion fade fails initiate emotional processes lead helping behaviour effects relationship seen singularity effect common explanation compassion fade use mental shortcut called affect heuristic causes people make decisions based emotional attachments past view humans make decisions line expected utility hypothesis current theories suggest people make decisions via two different thinking mechanisms outlined dual process theory accordingly compassion fade irrational phenomenon carried thinking mechanisms system characterised fast automatic effortless associative thinking patterns often driven emotions contrast system effortful slower process whereby initial thoughts challenged known knowledge leading rational considered emotional element system leads people see effects compassion fade humans make decisions based upon affect feelings emotion facts situation explanations compassion fade include affective bias empathy greatest one able visualise victim motivated emotion regulation people suppress feelings avoid emotionally collapse compassion happens people actively perhaps subconsciously regulate emotions withhold compassion feel groups people compassion experienced greatest individual able pay attention vividly picture victim psychological research choice theory found vivid mental stimuli plays large part processing information given human ability feel compassion limited vivid mental images closely related greater empathy single individual victims tend easier mentally depict greater detail large number victims difficult picture becomes depersonalised causing individual feel apathetic empathy stretch studies cognitive biases categorise tendency heuristic explain people make decisions based easily information process easier process information single target ie one victim versus abstract target ie multiple victims effect loses emotional meaning attached similar studies demonstrated individual presented number single victims group tend experience less empathetic concern towards member recognise victim individually person must focus specifically individual features individual unable develop cohesive image features images generate compassionate behaviourcitation needed compassion fade considered attempt moderate ones emotions faced mass research supports individuals tune feelings avoid becoming emotionally overwhelmed distressed experiment conducted vastfjall slovic found people regulate emotions experienced decreased effect compassion similar research charitable showed individuals able effectively process information experienced stronger emotional responses led higher compassion fade caused exposure seemingly incessant stream fundraisers beggars never enough well knowledge fact fraudsters money donated likely misappropriatedcitation needed compassion fade greatly influenced individual factors responsible cognitive mechanisms affect emotional responses compassion fade believed correlated intelligence however studies shown numerical literacy ability think rationally influential individuals empathetic compassion fade concerns

compassion fade heightened number people need aid increases perceived burden responsibility individual cognitive biases contribute compassion fade include identifiable victim effect prominence effects show compassion fade irrational thought process driven much emotion one feels certain cause understanding effects used charities help maximise donations understanding thought process behind people identifiable victim effect aka singularity effect refers concept people willing help single identifiable victim multiple nonidentified singularity effect found work even circumstance individual victim contrasted pair victims charity presents two victims singular victim results show significantly larger amount donations made towards singular victim less effect also found felt paired finding provides evidence compassion fade caused emotional reaction stimulus people feel less affect less likely donate provide help towards cause researchers also measured level participants believed donation would make difference childrens lives comparisons singular child condition paired children condition show significant difference perceived probability donation improve shows perceived utility causing effect compassion fade instead making rational judgments line expected utility theory singularity effect shows compassion fade result making decisions via affect heuristiccitation needed also proposed

evidence compassion fade effect compassion fade engage system two occurs reliant system needed pseudoinefficacy means people less willing provide aid one person become aware larger scope people unable comes result peoples willingness help motivated perceived efficacy pseudoinefficacy influenced selfefficacy ie perceived ability help response efficacy ie expected effect help evidence shows increasing selfefficacy increases perceived response efficacy thus increasing charitable prominence effect situation individual favour option superior based upon important circumstances socially desired attributes given priority decision easily accepted proportion dominance effect explains people motivated save maximum number lives motivated help causes highest proportion lives early research behavioural economist daniel kahneman found people different emotional cognitive reactions numerical similar research slovic demonstrated peoples emotional responses decreased number lives increase led development compassion economic theorists argued emotions helping behaviour track number people need help people respond strongly people suffering whatever yet psychologists measure actual emotion helping behaviour observed result rather people tend experience strong emotion response one individual need aid translates strong desire help many individuals people actually feel less emotion act less news events presented affects viewers frame events according mark hay massacre carried boko haram january received almost immediate media attention however january satirists charlie hebdo

bias also points towards understated failure peoples natural human ability gather empathy number victims rise following mass killing see past fact numbers people people book european foreign conflict reporting comparative analysis public news emma heywood outlined ways mass tragedies presented determine amount compassionate responses techniques could raise compassion amongst viewers prevail new ten disregarded allowing victims remain unfamiliar dissociated viewer approach encourage viewers engage sufferers rather releases responsibility participate emotionally instead compassion values sidelined potential opportunities dwell victim coverage replaced images fighting violence compassion fade illustrated reluctance respond crises global scale affecting large numbers people evidence shows compassionate behaviour ie financial donations acts service diminish number need research charitable donations indicates donations negatively related number people need example ebola outbreak

measure similarity compassion toward ethiopian children tam found reading shared experiences drew compassion toward single victim multiple victims explained saying people actively suppress compassion think might overwhelming means humans respond suffering others based compassion fade collapse compassion may linked concept compassion fatigue compassion fatigue happens positions significant amount
