gambierol marine polycyclic ether toxin produced dinoflagellate gambierdiscus gambierol collected sea rangiroa peninsula french polynesia toxins accumulated fish food chain therefore cause human intoxication symptoms toxicity resemble ciguatoxins extremely potent neurotoxins bind voltagesensitive sodium channels alter function ciguatoxins cause ciguatera fish poisoning resemblance possibility gambierol also responsible ciguatera fish poisoning natural source gambierol limited biological studies hampered therefore chemical synthesis gambierol laddershaped polyether composed eight ether rings stereocenters two challenging pyranyl rings methyl groups orientation one different structural analogues synthesized determine groups side chains attached gambierol essential toxicity fused polycyclic ether core essential also triene side chain double bond indispensable triene side chain double bond essential hydroxy groups essential enhance activity conjugate diene triene side chain also enhances synthesis gambierol consists two tetracyclic precursor molecules one alcohol one acetic acid fuse together whole synthesis gambierol depicted figure obtaining octacyclic backbone tail added via stille coupling acetic acid compound alcohol compound converted compound reaction compound titanium alkylidene dibromide provides cyclic enol ether compound oxidation alcohols gives majorly compound also compound ketones stereochemistry compound converted back compound reactant c thereby moving equilibrium towards compound ketone converted produce reactive gambierol reductive cyclization ring octacyclic core structure compound made oxidation compound aldehyde followed formation diiodolefin stereoselective reduction global deprotection stille coupling compound dienyl stannane compound provide gambierol acts lowefficacy partial agonist voltagegated sodium channels vgsc high affinity inhibitor voltagegated potassium reduces current potassium channels irreversibly stabilizing closed acts intermembrane anchor displaces lipids prohibits voltage sensor domain channel moving physiologically important changes causes channel remain closed state lowers gambierol also decreases amplitude inward sodium currents hyperpolarizes inward sodium current activation gambierol high affinity especially channels channel channels responsible repolarization membrane potential channel however additional functions regulating signaling cells blocked cells site inflammation paralyse channels responsible high frequency firing action kv channels closed depolarized membrane repolarize resting state causing permanent action potential leads paralysis example respiratory system therefore suffocation organism neurons gambierol reported induce oscillations blockage voltagegated potassium channels oscillations involve glutamate release activation nmdars glutamate receptors however secondary blockade potassium oscillations reduce cytoplasmic threshold activation ras ras stimulates mapks phosphorylate induce outgrowth neurites however dependent intracellular concentrations interaction nmdar receptors work increase intracellular calcium concentration also activates nitric oxide synthase produce nitric combination superoxide nitric oxide forms peroxynitrite causes oxidative stress different sorts tissues explains toxic symptoms derived intake metabolism gambierol known yet expectation gambierol acts almost ciguatoxins ciguatoxins polycyclic polyether compounds molecular weight dalton gambierol structurally similar ciguatoxins synthesized together excretion ciguatoxins largely via feces smaller amounts via compounds lipophilic therefore diffuse multiple organs tissues example liver fat brain highest concentration found brain muscles contained highest total amount days gambierol lipophilic easily persist accumulate fish food chain detoxification pathways still unknown possible eliminate gambierol take several months membrane potential calcium signaling lymphocytes controlled ion channels cells activated membrane potential calcium signaling altered coupled signal transduction pathways signal transduction pathways disrupted prevent cells responding antigens called immune suppression gambierol potent blocker potassium channels part determine membrane potential gambierol therefore good option development drug used immunotherapy example used diseases like multiple sclerosis diabetes mellitus type rheumatoid treatment gambierol used yet compound toxic also blocks channels thereby disrupts important processes intake gambierol also cause pain channels blocked increases excitability central circuits also causes illness several weeks explained fact gambierol lipophilic lipophilic compounds high affinity lipid bilayer cell membranes likely gambierol remains cell membrane days weeks explains long term illness associated gambierol treatment also symptoms already explained mechanism action gambierol example difficulties respiration gambierol also interesting compound research treatments pathologies like alzheimer disease caused increased expression βamyloid andor tau hyperphosphorylation increases βamyloid accumulation andor tau phosphorylation affects neurons neurons degenerated therefore process effects nervous system however gambierol reduce overexpression βamyloid andor tau hyperphosphorylation vitro gambierols function inducing outgrowth neurites bidirectional manner potentially used neural injury example trauma stroke gambierol used change structural plasticity possibility gambierol cross barrier important poisoning gambierol normally caused eating contaminated fish gambierol exhibits potent toxicity mice μgkg intraperitoneal injection μgkg consumed symptoms resemble ciguatera poisoning symptoms
