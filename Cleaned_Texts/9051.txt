participant coughed took breath got startled noise leta hollingworth study motor ability also sought study mental ability well done using two specific tests color naming saying opposites color naming observed card face laid front participant name color card quickly possible opposites test used list words test mental ability well words presented individual two columns words typed participants went list quickly possible naming opposite word lastly decided one experiment involving females study observe steadiness tapping opposites test study ages ranged years old extensive experiment much
