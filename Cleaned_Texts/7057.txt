optic neuropathy damage optic nerve cause optic nerve bundle millions fibers retina sends visual signals brain damage death nerve cells neurons leads characteristic features optic neuropathy main symptom loss vision colors appearing subtly washed affected eye pale disc characteristic longstanding optic neuropathy many cases one eye affected patients may aware loss color vision doctor asks cover healthy eye optic neuropathy often called optic atrophy describe loss fibers optic nerve ischemic optic neuropathies insufficient blood flow ischemia optic nerve anterior optic nerve supplied short posterior ciliary artery choroidal circulation retrobulbar optic nerve supplied intraorbitally pial plexus arises ophthalmic artery internal carotid artery anterior cerebral artery anterior communicating arteries ischemic optic neuropathies classified based location damage cause reduced blood flow optic neuritis inflammation optic nerve associated swelling destruction myelin sheath covering optic nerve young adults usually females commonly affected symptoms optic neuritis affected eye include pain eye movement sudden loss vision decrease color vision especially reds optic neuritis combined presence multiple demyelinating white matter brain lesions mri suspicious multiple sclerosis several causes clinical courses possible optic neuritis classified medical examination optic nerve ophthalmoscope may reveal swollen optic nerve nerve may also appear normal presence afferent pupillary defect decreased color vision visual field loss often central suggestive optic neuritis recovery visual function expected within weeks however attacks may lead permanent axonal loss thinning retinal nerve fiber layer tumors infections inflammatory processes cause lesions within orbit less commonly optic canal lesions may compress optic nerve resulting optic disc swelling progressive visual loss implicated orbital disorders include optic gliomas meningiomas hemangiomas lymphangiomas dermoid cysts carcinoma lymphoma multiple myeloma inflammatory orbital pseudotumor thyroid ophthalmopathy patients often bulging eye proptosis mild color deficits almost normal vision

individuals gastric bypass surgery may also cause vitamin deficiency poor absorption patients nutritional optic neuropathy may notice colors vivid bright color red washed normally occurs eyes time associated eye pain might initially notice blur fog followed drop vision vision loss may rapid progression blindness unusual patients tend blind spots center vision preserved peripheral vision cases pupils continue respond normally light recognized cause toxic optic neuropathy methanol poisoning lifethreatening event normally accidentally occurs person mistook substituted methanol ethyl alcohol
