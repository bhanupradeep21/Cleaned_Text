frogs toads produce rich variety sounds calls songs courtship mating rituals callers usually males make stereotyped sounds order advertise location mating readiness willingness defend territory listeners respond calls return calling approach going silent responses shown important species recognition mate assessment localization beginning pioneering experiments robert capranica using playback techniques normal synthetic calls behavioral biologists neurobiologists teamed use frogs toads model system understanding auditory function evolution considered important example neural basis animal behavior simplicity sounds relative ease neurophysiological recordings made auditory nerve reliability localization behavior acoustic communication essential frogs survival territorial defense localization attraction mates sounds frogs travel air water substrate frogs toads largely ignore sounds conspecific calls louder noises startling animals even unless major vibration included usually take action unless source visually identified neural basis communication audition gives insights science sound applied human communication frogs often heard seen frogs researchers rely calls identify depending region frog lives certain times year better breeding others frogs may live away best breeding grounds species mating season breeding season congregate best breeding site compete call time recognition species narrow mating season due ponds dry vigorous many frog species males call species distinct call though even among species different dialects found different regions although humans detect differences dialects frogs distinguish regional dialects example male bullfrogs recognize calls direct territorial neighbors ignoring calls neighbors save energy vocalize aggressively response intruders call way calls establish territories also attract males may solitary call times competition uses less energy times frog must compete hundreds thousands frogs heard together perform chorus call frog calls turn successively important feature chorus shared pattern pattern individuals calls drowned one frogs call may dominant trigger calls responding frogs symphony calling linked physical size females may attracted vigorous frogs region chorus within species different species frogs species retune frequency distinct frogs species different species frogs living region dramatically different call frequency durations different species calls vary similarly preference species females neural circuitry females different species varies frog demonstrates vocalizations malemale competition lithobates clamitans aka green frog typically four types calls warning different level urgency distinct first two calls types advertisement calls establish dominance among challengers two calls directed towards agonistic encounters like males females distinguish minute differences individual frogs however males females attuned different parts advertisement call example males onomatopoeically named coqui species attuned low frequency co part call whereas females attuned high frequency fact order parts matter similarly females tungara species female basilar papilla biased towards lowerthanaverage chuck portion male experiments measure vocal responses approaches shows attenuations calls often sent air mediums discovered species call underwater sound travels water adaptive region many species competing air time narins found female frog species use solid surfaces blades grass logs upon tap rhythmically attract mates also feng narins colleagues found species frogs use ultrasound smallest frogs expend much energy produce calls order vocalizations produced respiratory airflow goes lungs passing larynx oral cavity vocal cords oscillate addition vocalizing muscles make male spring peepers body mass muscles females frogs produce sound air sac mouth outside seen inflate deflate air lungs channeled air sac resonates make sound louder larynx larger developed males though significantly different frogs produce two types calls experiments tend focus release calling mating calling male frogs able produce mating calls attract gravid female frogs male nongravid female frogs clasped sexually active male frogs produce release call leopard frog three movements sound production first body wall contradictions serve way intrapulmonary pressure increase second order air flow pass larynx glottis must open third last larynx vocal cords must oppose midline air flow cause addition release calls movements throats sides correlated laryngeal calling concaveeared torrent frog amolops tormotus produce sounds ultrasonic three areas highly involved frog calls preoptic area medullamidbrain junction medullaspinal cord junction preoptic area important order frog initiate mate calling medullamidbrain junction responsible producing calling motor pattern medullaspinal cord junction contains hypoglossal vagus nuclei vital organize calling breathing motor biologistswho believed frogs ears placed close together localize sound accurately frogs hear short high frequency sounds sound localized time difference sound reaches ear vibration spot near lungs vibrates response sound may used additional measure localize dr fengs work applies neuroethology frog communication medicine recent project hearing aids based female frogs find mates females must recognize male choose call localizing call coming find additional challenge localizing call listening many frogs chorus noise stream insects breeding pond noisy place females must distinguish males calls noise recognize sound pattern male pursuing surrounding noise similar intelligent hearing aids help people hear certain sounds cancel others underlying neural mechanisms fast neural oscillations synaptic inhibition cancel noise timing frequency sound also play part frog communication may used fengs work also studies bat echolocation create intelligent hearing aids also working
