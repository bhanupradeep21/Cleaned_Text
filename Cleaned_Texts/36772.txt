chromosome segregation process eukaryotes two sister chromatids formed consequence dna replication paired homologous chromosomes separate migrate opposite poles nucleus segregation process occurs mitosis meiosis chromosome segregation also occurs prokaryotes however contrast eukaryotic chromosome segregation replication segregation temporally separated instead segregation occurs progressively following mitosis chromosome segregation occurs routinely step cell division see mitosis diagram indicated mitosis diagram mitosis preceded round dna replication chromosome forms two copies called chromatids chromatids separate opposite poles process facilitated protein complex referred cohesin upon proper segregation complete set chromatids ends two nuclei cell division completed dna copy previously referred chromatid called chromosome chromosome segregation occurs two separate stages meiosis called anaphase anaphase ii see meiosis diagram diploid cell two sets homologous chromosomes different parental origin eg paternal maternal set phase meiosis labeled interphase meiosis diagram round dna replication chromosomes initially present composed two copies called chromatids chromosomes paired chromatids pair homologous chromosome also paired chromatids present nucleus see prophase meiosis diagram process alignment paired homologous chromosomes called synapsis see synapsis synapsis genetic recombination usually occurs recombination events occur crossing involving physical exchange two chromatids recombination events involve information exchange physical exchange two chromatids see synthesisdependent strand annealing sdsa following recombination chromosome segregation occurs indicated stages metaphase anaphase meiosis diagram different pairs chromosomes segregate independently process termed independent assortment nonhomologous chromosomes process results gamete usually containing mixture chromosomes original parents improper chromosome segregation see nondisjunction disomy result aneuploid gametes either many chromosomes second stage segregation occurs meiosis prophase ii see meiosis diagram stage segregation occurs process similar mitosis except case prophase ii preceded round dna replication thus two chromatids comprising chromosome separate different nuclei nucleus gets single set chromatids called chromosomes nucleus becomes included haploid gamete see stages following prophase ii meiosis diagram segregation process also facilitated cohesin failure proper segregation prophase ii also lead aneuploid gametes aneuploid gametes undergo fertilization form aneuploid zygotes hence serious adverse consequences progeny meiotic chromosomal crossover co recombination facilitates proper segregation homologous chromosomes end meiotic prophase co recombination provides physical link holds homologous chromosome pairs together linkages established chiasmata cytological manifestations co recombination together cohesion linkage sister chromatids co recombination may help ensure orderly segregation paired homologous chromosomes opposite poles support study aneuploidy single spermatozoa whole genome sequencing found average human sperm cells aneuploid autosomes exhibit significantly fewer crossovers normal first chromosome segregation meiosis complete chromosome segregation second equational division meiosis ii proper
