within different taxa article currently focuses primarily mating habits airbreathing terrestrial slugs land slugs thought land snails evolutionary time either lost shell completely reduced external shell retained internal remnants shell land slugs highly polyphyletic group means many land slug families closely related one another majority land slugs simultaneous hermaphrodites meaning possess male female reproductive organs functional time species regularly selffertilise uniparental reproduction may also occur apomixis asexual part however land slugs mate find partners engage elaborate

opisthobranch sea snails opisthobranch sea slugs question sexual role roles individual adopt mating individuals involved preference sexual role mating interests inherently incompatible conflicts arise hermaphroditic individual may necessarily use received sperm may use another partners selffertilise according riskaverse models case would prudent individual invest however alternative views state male role preferred males benefit multiple matings females neither strategy evolutionarily stable sex roles required successful reproduction sperm digestion land slugs reduces likelihood given set sperm fertilising partners eggs increased sperm investment selected lead coevolutionary cycle amount sperm digested male allocation increase eventually male female gametes equally invested larger costly ejaculates become reciprocal sperm transfer favoured slug receives compensation investment reciprocity either simultaneous serial appears alleviate sexual role conflict feature slug matings land gastropods land snails land slugs sense hearing limited rely heavily chemoception primarily olfaction tactile perception mate location also greatly mediated airborne slugs often raise head detection pheromones air turn orient crawl towards perceived source many slugs also exhibit degree mucustrailfollowing order locate trail following may alternative complementary strategy airborne cues constitute major part precourtship behaviour using mucus trails find mate involves discrimination conspecific heterospecific therefore advantageous incorporate species specific cues trails facilitate mate finding species banana slugs ariolimax pheromones secreted together mucus attract mates may even possible follower perform quality assessment potential mate based mucus trail mucus may reveal information body size parasite infection giving insight fecundity larger size suggests slug highly whereas parasitism could mean suffers decreased egg production even trail following complex behavioural pattern usually involves active participation slugs follower keeps close leader species pronounced trail following deroceras panormitanum leader flattens tail laterally waves side side front follower yet known whether tail waving visual cue whether wafts chemical attractants direction follower sometimes tail waved followers tentacles occasionally makes contact contributing recognition slugs leading slug seemingly pauses wait follower tail waving follower falls far behind mate found land slugs undergo prolonged courtship phase prior copulation courtship usually last several hours two individuals get position along periphery imaginary circle heads towards others tail circle one slugs crawl clockwise direction right sides containing genital pores continually face circling may serve assess whether ready mate speed circling generally decreases courtship progresses slugs lie close together remaining antiparallel configuration protrudes genital pore sarcobelum highly manoeuvrable penile structure strokes secretions presumably glandular part penis wall probably transferred sarcobela mutual secretions several possible functions including physiological stimulation partner labelling may benefit donor helping avoid mating individuals already mated alternatively additionally labelling may serve indication conspecifics individual recently mated therefore avoided either sperm reserves possibly depleted likely sperm competition latter case secretion transferrers risk subjected sperm competition also reduced besides labelling another possibility secretion absorbed partner acts manipulative allohormone substance transferred one member species another induces direct behavioural physiological secretion may cause recipient refrain mating additional partners uptake donors sperm digest less increase egg fertilisation laying using donated information one use kind hormone see article love dart species differ way stroking occurs

assembled packages spermatophores final stages courtship species land slugs land snails shoot calcareous chitinous love darts others bodies subset species mate face face simultaneous reciprocal manner bear slugs mating shoot unless dart unavailable example regenerated recent mating research love darts performed common garden snail shown dart shooting increases paternal reproductive delivery promotes sperm storage rather digestion dart control sperm movement achieved reconfiguration recipients copulatory canal prior sperm dart shooting actual mating takes place mating refers phase sperm transfer lasts beginning penis eversion moment genitalia lose contact duration varies considerably slug species sudden eversions brief transfers common sperm transfer simultaneously reciprocal unilateral external deroceras internal ariolimax received sperm either digested used fertilisation eggs simultaneous reciprocal mating slugs act males females time manner mating requires pair genitalia exactly opposed prior copulation task made difficult slugs sense hearing limited hence rely heavily chemoception contact sensation usually exchange sperm oneway sperm transfer occur certain unilateral mating individual defined sexual role one acts male donates sperm acts female receives slugs often switch roles sperm transfer second round hence simultaneous reciprocal mating mutual exchange sperm usually always occurs external sperm exchange penis donor slug everted along ejaculate everted penis several fold larger usual size appears bulbous transparent ejaculate amorphous soft mass transferred onto surface receiver slugs everted penis least one species grey field slug deroceras reticulatum shows primitive degree sperm packaging retraction receivers penis takes ejaculate cases partners donate receive simultaneously via intertwined penises unilateral sperm transfer occasional occurrence entwinement allowed curvature present slug penises close entwinement aids successful sperm exchange occurs peak penis eversion individual species external sperm transfer lacks penis still reproduce uniparenterally selffertilisation provided possesses components normal reproductive uniparental reproduction observed marsh slug deroceras laeve appending penial gland accessory structure part male reproductive system present also briefly everted large enough spread partners body occur along sperm exchange penial gland filled early courtship secretions transferred onto skin partner slug secretions like sarcobelum courtship several possible functions including acting allohormone manipulates partner increase chances may achieved inhibiting additional mating changing sperm transport storage increasing egg laying partner penis retraction usually fast process although much slower common slugs retract penises simultaneously pumping rocking anterior parts body separate crawl away soon genitals untangled common one slugs engage mucus consumption may return mating site lick mucus ground lick body surface however much intraspecific variation extraordinary example external sperm transfer given great grey slug limax maximus pair slugs climb tree wall overhang suspend together head cm long mucus strand everting penises exchanging sperm mid evolutionary explanations behaviour unclear cases sperm transfer internal takes place inserting everted penis partner slug sperm conveyed via sperm packets spermatophores recipients spermatheca released tail small percentage escape higher regions female reproductive system storage spermatheca later fertilisation intromission simultaneously reciprocal species ariolimax dolichophallus unilateral others ariolimax sperm transfer process termed apophallation penis amputation may take place lengthy process whereby penis one slugs chewed using radula case one penis chewed usually done slug replacement penis grow back apophallation widely found ariolimax internal sperm exchange slugs apophallation occasional occurrence follows period struggle pulling owner suggests last resort penis becomes stuck genital tract partner slug penis severed usually eaten reason penis gets eaten unclear although could simply source nutrients apophallation may made necessary order separation occur partner tightly gripping penis via special muscle female reproductive apophallation may benefit amputator prevents amputee mating near future would result sperm competition amputee least prevented mating future male could divert resources producing eggs amputators sperm addition ariolimax species autoapophallation selfamputation documented deroceras regular part mating although penis get trapped slug external sperm transfer may occur amputees penis retraction ability inhibited partner transfer secretion result individuals longer mate able reproduce aphallic individuals ariolimax species still able mate females intromission internal sperm exchange freshwater snail physa acuta selffertile organism exposed
