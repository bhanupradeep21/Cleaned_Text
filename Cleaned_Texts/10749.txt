nigrostriatal pathway bilateral dopaminergic pathway brain connects substantia nigra pars compacta snc midbrain dorsal striatum ie caudate nucleus putamen forebrain one four major dopamine pathways brain critical production movement part system called basal ganglia motor loop dopaminergic neurons pathway release dopamine axon terminals synapse onto gabaergic medium spiny neurons msns also known

parkinsons disease including hypokinesia tremors rigidity postural imbalance connection substantia nigra pars compacta dorsal striatum mediated via dopaminergic axons substantia nigra located ventral midbrain hemisphere two distinct parts pars compacta snc pars reticulata snr pars compacta contains dopaminergic neurons cell group forms nigrostriatal pathway supplying dopamine striatum relays information basal ganglia contrast pars reticulata contains mostly gabaergic neurons snc composed thin band cells overlies snr situated laterally group dopaminergic neurons ventral tegmental area vta forms mesolimbic dopamine pathway snc easily visualized human brain sections dopamine neurons contain black pigment called neuromelanin known accumulate dopaminergic cell bodies snc densely packed

inside cell becomes high toxic dopamine cells lower layer ventral tier lack protein vulnerable effects neurotoxins eg mptp cause parkinson diseaselike dorsal tier dopamine cells dendrites radiate horizontally across pars compacta whereas ventral tier dopamine cells dendrites extend ventrally pars axons dopamine neurons emanate primary dendrite project ipsilaterally side via medial forebrain

mammals divided anterior limb white matter tract called internal two parts caudate nucleus rodents internal capsule poorly developed caudate putamen separated form one large entity called caudate putamen majority cells dorsal striatum gabaergic medium spiny neurons msns also known spiny projection neurons spns approximately half msns contain dopamine receptors project directly substantia nigra

interneurons either cholinergic one several types gabaergic axons dendrites interneurons stay within striatum caudate nucleus putamen receive excitatory information areas cerebral glutamatergic inputs generally topographically arranged putamen takes information largely sensorimotor cortex whereas caudate nucleus obtains information largely association addition dorsal striatum receives excitatory
