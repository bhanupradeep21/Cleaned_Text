spider behavior refers range behaviors activities performed spiders spiders airbreathing arthropods eight legs chelicerae fangs inject venom largest order arachnids rank seventh total species diversity among groups reflected large diversity behavior almost known spider species predators mostly preying insects spiders although species also take vertebrates frogs lizards fish even birds spiders guts narrow take solids liquidize food flooding digestive enzymes grinding bases pedipalps true jaws though known spiders almost exclusively carnivorous species primarily jumping spiders supplement diet plant matter sap nectar however spiders still need mostly carnivorous diet survive lab studies shown become unhealthy fed one exception species jumping spider called bagheera kiplingi largely herbivorous feeding mainly sugar rich beltian bodies produced acacia many spiders build webs spiders use wide variety methods capture prey web several recognised types spider web netcasting spider weaves small net attaches front legs lurks wait potential prey prey arrives lunges forward wrap victim net bite paralyze hence spider expends less energy catching prey primitive hunter also avoids energy loss weaving large orb web bolas bolas spiders unusual orbweaver spiders spin webs instead hunt using sticky capture blob silk end line known bolas swinging bolas flying male moths moth flies nearby spider may snag prey rather like fisherman snagging fish hook also called angling fishing spider prey lured spider production three pheromone hunting land jumping spiders wolf spiders many types spiders hunt freely enhanced eyesight sometimes approaching pigeon although much smaller field vision generally robust agile opportunistic hunters pouncing upon prey find even chasing short distances wait passing prey near mouth burrow hunting water dolomedes spiders hunt waiting edge pool stream hold shore back legs rest body lies water legs stretched detect ripples prey run across surface subdue using foremost legs tipped small claws like spiders inject venom hollow jaws kill digest prey mainly eat insects larger species able catch small female water spiders argyroneta aquatica build underwater diving bell webs fill air use digesting prey molting mating raising offspring live almost entirely within bells darting catch prey animals touch bell threads anchor deception spiders hunt spiders using deception jumping spider portia mimics movement captured insect prey webs spiders attracts owner web whereupon portia pounces overwhelms owner australian crab spider thomisus spectabilis manipulates uv signals attract bees flowers hiding trapdoor trapdoor spiders construct burrows corklike trapdoor made soil vegetation silk trapdoor difficult see closed plant soil materials effectively camouflage trapdoor hinged one side silk spiders typically wait prey holding underside door prey captured insects arthropods small vertebrates disturb trip lines spider lays around trapdoor alerting spider meal within reach spider detects prey vibrations comes close enough leaps burrow make capture conothele species build burrow construct silken tube trapdoor bark basket kaira spider uses pheromone attract moths catches insects basket formed spiders perform cannibalism range circumstances females eating males perhaps widely known example cannibalism spiders females cannibalise males copulation example male australian redback spider latrodectus hasselti killed female inserts second palpus females genital opening matings female eats male however theory sacrificial male may become greater truth believe form cannibalism occurs exceptional males eating females male water spiders argyroneta aquatica show predilection mating larger females cannibalizing females smaller sacrificial mothers offspring species stegodyphus lineatus eat mother females segestria florentina sometimes die guarding eggs hatched spiders later eat nonreproductive cannibalism spiders pholcus phalangioides prey kind food death feigning used reproductive behavior spiders nursery web spider male sometimes feigns death avoid getting eaten females spiders also well known morphological sexual spiders exhibit varying levels sociality whereas spiders solitary even aggressive toward members species hundreds species several families show tendency live groups often referred colonies form relatively longlasting aggregations aggregations contain many individuals case anelosimus eximius family level sociality often varies species interspecies vary within species intraspecies well many social spiders show cooperative brood care use nest web amount generational species anelosimus eximius exhibit reproductive division labor biologists argue classifies species fully eusocial nonreproductives considered nonsterile worker caste reproductive division labor result resource availability monopolization although arthropods use muscles attached inside exoskeleton flex limbs spiders groups still use hydraulic pressure extend spiders generate pressures eight times resting level extend jumping spiders jump times length suddenly increasing blood pressure third fourth pair unlike smaller jumping spiders though larger spiders use hydraulics straighten legs depend flexor muscles generate propulsive force ballooning term used mechanical kiting spiders use disperse air spider spiderling hatching climb high spider stands raised legs abdomen pointed upwards starts releasing several silk threads abdomen air automatically form triangular shaped parachute spider let carried away updrafts winds even slightest breeze spiders used studies indicate invertebrates may experience pain natural conditions orbweaving spiders argiope spp undergo autotomy selfamputation stung leg wasps bees experimental conditions spiders injected leg bee wasp venom shed appendage injected saline rarely autotomize leg indicating physical insult ingress fluid per se causes autotomy spiders injected venom components cause injected humans report pain serotonin histamine phospholipase melittin autotomize leg injections contain venom components cause pain humans autotomy
