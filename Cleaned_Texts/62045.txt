doctors confirmation required determine child language delay although milestones typical milestones child followed strictly mere guidelines early developmental language delay characterized slow language development language development children language delay takes longer general timeline provided slower also presents different forms example child language delay could weaker language skills ability produce phrases may find producing language different language norms developing children language delay commonly divided receptive expressive categories categories essential developing effective communication receptive language refers process understanding language verbal spoken nonverbal written may involve gaining information sounds words visual information surrounding environment written information expressive language refers use sentences made words signs communicate messages others enables children express needs wants people around interact others develop language skills

status children families low educational level likely delays difficulties expressive language development directly affected socioeconomic level family conditions associated socioeconomic level affects process language development certain childs early vocabulary development influenced socioeconomic status via maternal speech varies according socioeconomic status mothers higher education levels likely use rich vocabulary speak longer utterances interacting children helps develop productive vocabulary children lower socioeconomic poverty also high risk factor language delay results lack access appropriate therapies likelihood requiring early intervention language delays actually receiving help extremely low compared dont actually need hearing loss process children acquiring language skills involves hearing sounds words caregivers surroundings hearing loss causes lack sound inputs causing children difficulties learning use understand language eventually lead delayed speech

together fact respond less often children shows parents late talkers follow childs instead parents likely adapt childs communication results idiosyncratic feedback cycle worsens childs language difficulties rather help language birth order firstborn children grow environment provides possibilities communicative interaction adults differs experienced younger younger siblings likely less

development children watched television alone times likely language delay compared children interacted caregivers television educational television shows blues clues found enhance childs language recommended american academy pediatrics children age watch television age watch one two hours quality programming day therefore exposing young children television programs discouraged especially television shows educational parents engage children conversational activities avoid televisionrelated delays children language development could impair intellectual performance however study conducted dr birken hospital sick children found watching television interacting parent caregiver actually beneficial children bilingual study spanned four years based parent report clinician observation four years found bilingual child interaction adult watching television experience language delay fact helped develop english second studies failed find clear evidence language delay prevented training educating health care professionals subject overall reviews show positive results regarding interventions language delay treat already existing language delay child would need
