scar free healing process significant injuries heal without permanent damage tissue injury affected healing scars form due fibrosis wound contraction however scar free healing tissue completely regenerated published research subject increased relatively recent term literature scar free healing occurs foetal life ability progressively diminishes adulthood animals amphibians however tissue regeneration occurs example skin regeneration adult scarring takes place response damaged missing tissue following injury due biological processes wounding process occurs order replace lost process scarring complex involves inflammatory response remodelling amongst cell activities many growth factors cytokines also involved process well extracellular matrix scarring healing create physical psychological problems significant clinical burden collagen instance abnormally organised scar tissue collagen scars arranged parallel bundles collagen fibers whilst healthy scar free tissue basket weave structure figure difference collagen arrangement along lack difference dermal tissue healing taken place without scarring indicative regenerative failure normal severe scarring resulting collagen deposits known hypertrophic scarring great concern worldwide incidence ranging unlike limited regeneration seen adult humans many animal groups possess ability completely regenerate damaged full limb regeneration seen invertebrates eg starfish flatworms regenerate fully functioning appendages vertebrates however latter almost always confined immature members species example tadpoles regrow tails various body parts ability seen mature exception much studied urodele species amphibians also known salamanders carry ability complete regeneration vertebrates possess exceptional ability allow regeneration entire limbs tails well multitude internal organs well including spinal process known blastema involves covering wound layer epithelial cells known wound cap subsequent innervation area nerves give signals revert local differentiated cells muscle cartilage connective tissue back undifferentiated cell lineage also known mesenchymal area known blastema potential differentiate proliferate allowing regrowth limb similar occurs woundhealing urodeles quick response antiinflammatory macrophages shown key regeneration capabilities one study found limbs would regenerate urodeles depleted macrophages instead would scar permanent loss knowing regeneration occurs animals may great implications woundhealing tackled medicine research aimed area result reparation tissue mammalian fetus radically different healing mechanisms observed healthy adult early gestation fetal skin wounds remarkable ability heal rapidly without scar formation wound healing particularly complex process mechanisms scarring occurs involves inflammation fibroplasia formation granulation tissue finally scar maturation since observation scar free healing first reported early fetus three decades ago research focused intently underlying mechanisms separate scarless fetal wound repair normal adult wound healing scar free healing documented fetuses across animal kingdom including mice rats monkeys pigs humans important note ability fetuses heal without scarring wound size dependent also agedependent whereby specific gestational age usually weeks humans typical scar formation occur exact
