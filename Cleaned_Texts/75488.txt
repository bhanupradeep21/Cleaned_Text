manubrantlia genus lapillopsid early triassic panchet formation india genus known single holotype left jaw given designation isi despite paucity remains jaw still identifiable belonging relative lapillopsis example three coronoid bones possessed teeth articular bone partially visible lateral outer view postsplenial contact posterior meckelian foramen however jaw also possesses certain unique features justify erection new genus separate lapillopsis example mandible twice size jaws referred lapillopsids notable unique feature enlarged pumphandle shaped arcadian process back jaw structure responsible generic name genus manubrantlia translates latin english expression pumphandle type known species genus manubrantlia khaki specific name refers greenishbrown mudstones panchet formation color described khaki first british geologists studied lapillopsids lapillopsis manubrantlia part temnospondyli diverse order tetrapods may include ancestors modern amphibians different authors disagree precise placement lapillopsids among temnospondyls place near within dissorophoids group terrestrial insectivorous however authors consider lapilopsids unusual stereospondyls typically large crocodilianlike mesozoic temnospondyls flattened skulls semiaquatic habits lapillopsids differ body plan closely resemble dissorophoids least mandible approximately centimeters inches long twice size lapillopsis would made manubrantlia largest lapillopsid wide margin construed primitive feature falls line size temnospondyls rather derived minute size advanced like lapillopsids manubrantlia two rows teeth lower jaw teeth outer row also known marginal teeth attached dentary bone sharp curved also slightly flattened anteroposterior fronttoback direction although extent seen capitosaurs mastodonsaurus front jaw dentary tooth row also twists slightly outwards front jaw also possesses enlarged tooth known parasymphyseal tusk although tooth less twice wide rest marginal teeth deep longitudinal groove known oral sulcus visible marginal tooth inner row conical teeth form three coronoid bones lie inwards dentary feature practically unique lapillopsids among early triassic temnospondyls groups much reduced coronoid teeth lydekkerinids example patch small denticles last coronoid stereospondyls continuous row teeth three coronoid bones plagiosaurids last coronoid also extends outwards visible outer side mandible rear tip seen lateral labial view aka outside large portion mandible formed angular bone back thinner portion dentary formed splenial front postsplenial middle hand splenial postsplenial much exposed inner portion jaw seen lingual medial view aka inside angular less prominent ridges grooves radiate middle angular bone seen outside jaw similar condition temnospondyls unlike large portion inner part jaw also formed prearticular bone rear half mandible hole known posterior meckelian foramen also visible inner part jaw unlike temnospondyls common lapillopsis taxa archegosauroids eryops hole contact postsplenial instead surrounded solely prearticular prominent unique features manubrantlia lie rear part jaw general area jaw joint jaw joint formed articular bone visible medial view also wraps around visible lateral view rear lower tip outer side bone lateral exposure articular also known lapillopsis believed unique lapillopsids upper rear portion lateral face mandible formed surangular bone rear tip surangular forms bony projection known arcadian process temnospondyls projection small blunt similar size adjacent retroarticular process articular bone projects inwards backwards however manubrantlia arcadian process enlarged greatly turning elongated extension described resembling arcadian process lapillopsis also elongated although much slender temnospondyls arcadian processes near size manubrantlia rhytidosteid lydekkerinids however also possess enlarged retroarticular processes contrasts condition manubrantlia thus large size arcadian process believed example convergent evolution lapillopsids lydekkerinids many factors separate two fauna flora panchet formation practically identical south african lystrosaurus assemblage zone karoo supergroup biozone dated beginning triassic period million years ago life still recovering severity permiantriassic extinction event assumed panchet formation due similarities lystrosaurus zone equivalent time continents would formed one supercontinent known pangaea indian tectonic plate situated far southern hemisphere near south africa point time plate tectonics moved india towards modern position southern asia yet activated proximity explains similarity south african indian ecosystems largest common animal within panchet formation herbivorous dicynodont lystrosaurus several different species lystrosaurus reported formation past analysis concluded referable single species lystrosaurus recently lystrosaurus declivis species close lystrosaurus curvatus also found lower portions genus cynodont panchetocynodon also present formation fossils thrinaxodon cynodont common karoo supergroup also reported panchet formation although claims remain amniote remains also known formation including dubious proterosuchid ankistrodon may synonymous south african fragmentary procolophonid apart lystrosaurus common animals panchet formation diverse assortment stereospondyls among manubrantlia include indobenthosuchus lydekkerinid indobrachyops rhytidosteid various trematosaurids gonioglyptus panchetosaurus indolyrocephalus glyptognathus many species remain poorly described may qualify nomina dubia dubious stereospondyls formation pachygonia diagnostic yet aberrant placed specific fish scales also known basal stereospondyl capulomala also found plant life includes remains seed ferns glossopteris lepidopteris however coal seams present formation unlike case many permian triassic formations india abundance cryptogams sporebearing plants suggests india warm humid climate early triassic however many studies instead suggest climate geological analyses indicated sandstones mudstones panchet formation mainly formed fluvial environment meaning formation dominated large rivers time manubrantlia sand grains recovered panchet sandstones preserve geological signatures complex interactions water sand interactions include formation natural levees tidal inlets beaches dominated sand dunes indicates large lakes also present earthquakes also affected area shown deformation
