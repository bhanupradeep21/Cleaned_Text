prokaryotic dna replication process prokaryote duplicates dna another copy passed daughter although often studied model organism e coli bacteria show many replication bidirectional originates single origin replication consists three steps initiation elongation cells must finish dna replication proceed cell division media conditions support fast growth bacteria also couples shorter interinitiation time ie doubling time fast growing cells less compared slow words possible fast growth conditions grandmother cells starts replicating dna grand daughter cell reason initiation dna replication highly regulated bacterial origins regulate orisome assembly nucleiprotein complex assembled origin responsible unwinding origin loading replication machinery e coli direction orisome assembly built short

catalytic mechanism dna polymerase iii involves use two metal ions active site region active site discriminate deoxyribonucleotides ribonucleotides metal ions general divalent cations help oh initiate nucleophilic attack onto alpha phosphate deoxyribonucleotide orient stabilize negatively charged triphosphate deoxyribonucleotide nucleophilic attack oh alpha phosphate releases pyrophosphate subsequently hydrolyzed inorganic phosphatase two phosphates hydrolysis drives dna synthesis completion furthermore dna polymerase iii must able distinguish correctly paired bases incorrectly paired bases accomplished distinguishing watsoncrick base pairs use active site pocket complementary shape structure correctly paired nucleotides pocket tyrosine residue able form van der waals interactions correctly paired nucleotide addition dsdna double stranded dna active site wider major groove shallower minor groove permits formation hydrogen bonds third nitrogen purine bases second oxygen pyrimidine bases finally active site makes extensive hydrogen bonds dna backbone interactions result dna polymerase iii closing around correctly paired base base inserted incorrectly paired interactions could occur due disruptions hydrogen bonding van der waals interactions dna read direction therefore nucleotides synthesized attached template strand direction however one parent strands
