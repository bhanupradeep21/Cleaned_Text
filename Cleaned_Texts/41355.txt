antimigraine drugs medications intended reduce effects intensity migraine headache include drugs treatment acute migraine symptoms well drugs prevention migraine examples specific antimigraine drug classes include triptans first line option ergot alkaloids ditans gepants migraines also treated unspecific analgesics nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids acetaminophen opioids recommended treatment migraines triptan drug class includes generation sumatriptan poor bioavailability second generation due safety efficacy selectivity triptans considered first line agents abortion medications selective receptor agonists activity produce antimigraine effect vasoconstriction vessels brain well inhibiting trigeminal cgrp release pain normally well tolerated vasoconstrictor effects lead problematic side effects nausea dizziness chest discomfort therefore require caution patients cardiovascular also increased risk gastrointestinal adverse triptans use limited less ten times per month order reduce medication overuse headache ergot alkaloids include ergotamine dihydroergotamine medication class targets gcrp receptor pathway due likeness serotonin dopamine noradrenaline show activity serotonin dopamine lack selectivity leads adverse effects making second line compared however shown prevent recurrence better adverse effects include nausea vomiting paresthesia use limited less ten times per month order reduce medication overuse headaches mohs oral dosage administrative form considered less effective nasal parenteral forms discontinued ergotamine contraindicated ditans eg lasmiditan new group anti migraine drugs developed due concerns line triptans eg adverse effects concern use cardiovascular disease use less per month reduce moh ditans receptors lasmiditan suggested less pain relief compared triptans hour mark post taking medication lasmitan shown higher adverse events dizziness fatigue nausea triptans another novel medication class gcrp however could option patients cardiovascular risks due lack vasoconstriction due risk dizziness take lasmiditan avoid driving hours gepants eg rimegepant ubrogepant atogepant also new group anti migraine drugs along ditans calcitonin generelated peptide cgrp receptor gepants suggested less pain relief hours compared triptans similar ditans offer another therapy option include vasoconstriction thus may suitable cardiovascular risk well tolerated fewer adverse effects compared triptans nsaids nonspecific medication used abortion migraines due analgesic properties used mild moderate migraines less effective severe similar triptans ergots alkaloids use limited less per month reduce moh acetaminophen analgesic also used nsaids tried first due antiinflammatory properties however acetaminophen would considered first line pregnant combination therapy nsaid triptan used either medication insufficient alone migraine relief recurrence long term nsaid use risks including nephrotoxicity cardiotoxicity long term acetaminophen use associated warranted antiemetic used combination opioids recommended treatment acute migraines due significant side effect profile including twice risk moh headache compared nsaids acetaminophen addition strength efficacy showed low insufficient pain relief importantly also risk addiction opioid use patients require preventive therapy symptoms migraines per month migraines lasting longer hours firstline drugs prevention migraine attacks include beta blockers antidepressants anti convulsants beta blockers deemed effective options prevention migraines particular metoprolol timolol propranolol strength timeframe effectiveness generally within patients cardiovascular risk factors avoid use beta blockers migraine antidepressants suggested efficacious tolerable treatment migraine prevention migraine frequency migraine exact mechanism action unknown seems related serotonins impact particular amitryptyline tricyclic antidepressant evidence suggest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors well serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors likely effective well studies required order provide adverse events antidepressants include fatigue nausea drowsiness dizziness dry mouth gi upset sedation also sodium valproate divalproex sodium established efficacious migraine well tolerated short term monitored long term therapy risks pancreatitis liver failure valproate used females childbearing age studies suggest children exposed valproate prenatal period associated lower iq topiramate another anticonvulsant therapeutic efficacy migraine safe medication used caution females childbearing ages suggested cause birth cgrp antagonists used acute migraine treatment well cgrp neuropeptide thought induce migraines via vasodilation cranial cgrp also release inflammatory agents cause nervous system theorized antagonizing cgrp receptor trigeminal ganglia lowered cgrp released less migraine erenumab highly selective human monoclonal antibody promising new development migraine low risk hepatoxicity like gepants due mostly eliminated via studies suggesting benefit using melatonin prophylaxis migraine however lack strength evidence due low number studies well conflicting melatonin good safety profile rare instances serious side studies needed order suggest therapeutic use melatonin prophylaxis strong degree evidence use anti migraine drugs prophylactically children highly important consider risk vs benefit considering use paediatric httpsenwikipediaorgwikiantimigrainedrug
