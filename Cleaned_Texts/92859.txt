pachycephalosaurinae related animals pachycephalosaurus prenocephale geologic context species historically unclear currently thought originate rocks belonging ulansuhai formation early century swedish palaeontological expeditions conducted china one expedition sometime specimen discovered would become recognized first evidence pachycephalosauria asia consisted parietal bone largely complete along midline right side missing part left discovered tsondolienkhuduk geologic locality inner mongolia specimen among others brought sweden study specimen named described palaeontologist birger bohlin new species genus troodon specific name bexelli honour gerhard bexel discovered genus troodon historically considered pachycephalosaur rather theropod recognized time paper published specimen already returned chinas institute vertebrate paleontology paleoanthropology sometime subsequent return specimen among many others decade later oskar kuhn reassigned bexelli genus stegoceras species bohlins

pachycephalosaurs noting based data bohlins description species clearly differs definite stegoceras material casting doubt assignment genus considered material clearly indeterminate unidentifiable valid taxon family robert sullivan would agree sentiment later papers noting likely belonged asian genus like prenocephale considered undiagnostic nomen chapter pachycephalosaurs book dinosauria

ulansuhai formation age formation constrained confidence definitely younger cenomanian likely turonian age makes sinocephale oldest known pachycephalosaurid genus making older acrotholus least million years pachycephalosaurs small bipedal animals bearing thickened skulls dome shape among pachycephalosaurs distinctive anatomical trait sole autapomorphy trait unique specific species sinocephale prominent embayment back parietal fused left right parietals would given skull roughly heartshaped profile seen beyond unique combination traits variously found species also contributes distinguishing taxon parietal widely exposed back head differing taxa like stegoceras prenocephale large squamosals enclosing parietal similar condition seen foraminacephale species sphaerotholus unlike taxa sharing condition however lacking prominent ornamentation along parietosquamosal shelf instead ornamentation back skull seems restricted smooth small irregular bumps rugosities common among pachycephalosaurs parietal anatomy overall intermediate halfstep straight morphology seen stegoceras kin opposed derived genera like sphaerotholus rounded shapes front margin parietal connection frontal bone also documented thick undulating line contact two bones though apex skull preserved thickness preserved portion indicates presence dome similar pachycephalosaurs temporal chamber large noticeably arched viewed side known specimen hypothesized constitute subadult adult plaster casts study conclusion taxon recognized member pachycephalosauridae ever since initial description group still known redescription first time sinocephale tested phylogenetic analysis analysis modified woodruff et al derived evans et al bexelli able coded anatomical traits considered analysis found species belonged
