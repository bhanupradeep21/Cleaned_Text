embryos develop genital ridge forms tail end eventually forms basis urinary system reproductive tracts either side front tract around sixth week develops duct called paramesonephric duct also called müllerian second duct mesonephric duct develops adjacent ducts become longer next two weeks paramesonephric ducts around eighth week cross meet midline one duct regresses depending whether embryo
