collective behaviors social caterpillars falls five general categories collective cooperative foraging group defense predators parasitoids shelter building thermoregulation substrate silking enhance steadfastness behaviorally sophisticated insect societies found among ants termites bees wasps insects technically classified eusocial insects commonly referred simply social insects scheme classification noneusocial gregarious species insects referred presocial subsocial quasisocial manner unfortunate consequence suggesting quite social yet significant number insect species possess defining criteria eusociality standard classification clearly social sense term employed zoologists general larval aggregates moths butterflies sawflies considered social insects sibling societies caterpillars exhibit collective behaviors vary simple interactions complex forms cooperation social caterpillars exhibit three basic foraging patterns patchrestricted foragers obtain food required social phase larval development leaves found single contiguous patch several closely spaced patches foraging arena typically well defined protective silk envelope leaves bound together large trees
