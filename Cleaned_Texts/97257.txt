gunther disease congenital form erythropoietic porphyria word porphyria originated greek word porphura porphura actually means purple pigment suggestion color body fluid changes person gunthers rare autosomal metabolic disorder affecting heme caused deficiency enzyme uroporphyrinogen extremely rare prevalence estimated times prior birth fetus gunthers disease shown lead anemia milder cases patients presented symptoms reached adulthood gunthers disease porphyrins accumulated teeth bones increased amount seen plasma bone marrow feces red blood cells though expressivity varied depending mutation responsible decrease enzyme function severe cutaneous sensitivity present cases porphyria estimated cases due mutation decreases stability enzyme results exposure longwave ultraviolet light causes affected skin thicken produce vesicles prone rupture infection secondary infections along bone resorption lead disfigurement sunexposed face enzyme dysfunction prevents normal production heme hemolytic anemia another common symptom though lack hemolysis disease possible porphyrins additionally accumulate bone teeth resulting unexpected attacks occur abdominal pain well vomiting constipation commonly follow attacks exposure sunlight cause discomfort result blistering consciousness heat swelling redness photomutilation transfusiondependent anemia common liver disease also observed reported early childhoodonset haematological manifestations poor prognosis gunther disease caused mutations gene encodes enzyme uroporphyrinogen iii synthase uros located human chromosome disorder inherited autosomal recessive means defective gene responsible disorder located autosome two copies defective gene one inherited parent required order born disorder parents individual autosomal recessive disorder carry one copy defective gene usually experience signs symptoms disorder homozygous mutation causes uroporphyrinogen iii synthase uroporphyrinogen cosynthase defect enzyme uroporphyrinogen iii synthase reacting normally results making isomer iii porphyrinogen used form heme isomer iii porphyrinogen produced poor production uroporphyrinogen iii synthase isomer porphyrinogen made oxidize give reddish tint diagnosing congenital erythroipoetic porphyria gunther disease one must exclude forms porphyria include hepatoerythropoietic porphyria rare homozygous variants variegate porphyria hereditary coproporphyria stingassociated vasculopathy onset infancy savi mild variants may present similarly porphyria cutanea tardacitation needed four steps establishing diagnosis porphyria first thorough history particularly family history physical exam performed special attention paid sunexposed skin biochemical measurements porphyrins precursors urine feces blood necessary specialized labs helpful measuring activity specific enzymes heme synthesis pathway andor dna mutational analyses cep activity uroporphyrinogen iii synthase fourth enzyme heme biosynthetic pathway markedly decreasedcitation needed congenital erythropoietic porphyria urine aminolavulanic acid porphobilinogen typically normal however uroporphyrin coproporphyrin tend markedly elevated moderately elevated respectively urine feces additionally fecal protoporphyrin typically mildly elevatedcitation needed red blood cells uroporphyrin coproporphyrin protoporphyrin elevated distinguishing form porphyria others finally plasma analysis demonstrate elevated uroporphyrin coproporphyrincitation needed nonspecific helpful diagnostic clues history cutaneous photosensitivity blistering erosions crusts ulcerations leading extensive scarring deformation hands loss eyebrows eyelashes severe mutilation cartilaginous structures like nose erythrodontia variable degree hematologic involvement ranging mild hemolytic anemia intrauterine hydrops fetalis early clues red violet staining diaperscitation needed multiple ways treat gunthers diseases one crucial things person disease limit sun exposure eliminate sun exposure altogether sunscreens undesirable effects tropical sunscreens sunscreens containing zinc oxide titanium dioxide shown provide protection due lightreflective agents block ultraviolet visible light wavelengths get protection patients gunthers disease require physical barriers needed also advised patients wear protective clothing block sun skin plastic films attached car windows homes filter wavelengths could cause harm someones skin disease incandescent bulbs replace normal fluorescent lamps bulbs release less light prevents porphyrinexciting wavelengths fluorescent lights less beneficial treatments used help treat gunthers disease include oral betacarotene treatments activated charcoal cholestyramine used interrupt stop porphyrins reabsorbed body reason oral treatments unreasonable require extremely large dose medicine therefore erythrocyte transfusions shown successful measure decreasing appearance disease trying lower erythropoiesis circulating porphyrin levels unfortunately chronic erythrocyte transfusions extremely harmful body cause severe help dry eye symptoms visual function topical lubrication used invasive way help treat gunthers disease would surgery numerous studies stated bone marrow transplantation recently new development gunthers disease longterm effects still unresourced patient lifethreatening infectious complication bone marrow transplantation longer relevant also reports stem cell transplantation successful limited number disorder named german physician discovered hans
