male warrior hypothesis mwh evolutionary psychology hypothesis professor mark van vugt argues human psychology shaped betweengroup competition conflict specifically evolutionary history coalitional aggression groups men may resulted sexspecific differences way outgroups perceived creating ingroup vs outgroup tendencies still observable violence aggression universal across human societies likely features human behavior since prehistory archaeologists found mass graves dating late pleistocene early holocene contain primarily male skeletons showing signs blunt force trauma indicating cause death weapons used violence among humans occurs distinct patterns differing obviously sex ethnographic findings modern crime data indicate majority violence perpetrated targeted males males likely victims violence malemale pattern violence observed repeatedly many cultures may qualify human humans social species long history living tribal groups psychological mechanisms evolved handle complexities group living also created heuristics quickly categorizing others ingroup outgroup members different behavioral strategies treat ingroup members one group favorably react outgroup members belong different group fear aggression tendencies arise little motivation provoked superficial groups lab example showing paintings participants creating groups based painting participants male warrior hypothesis suggests ease individuals discriminate others adaptation resulting long history threatened outgroup males competition mwh argues sex differences attitudes towards outgroup members may result different reproductive strategies used males greater competition among males mates mammals males females distinct reproductive strategies based physiology reproduction females gestate birth feed invest overall resources offspring selective mates greater certainty able males contrast mate low energetic cost found partner able attract female physical social characteristics converted territory food resources status power strength alliances coerce females result typically much greater variability reproductive success males within species higher competition among males mates strongest best adapted powerful males may harem less fit males never details topic see trivers theory parental investment male warrior hypothesis predicts males may historically remained groups born rather moving away adulthood see patrilocality higher overall relatedness group female members would moved new husbands group upon males may stronger interest defending group likely act aggressively towards outgroup males encounter may attempting steal resources weaken group violence men risk never finding mate fitness benefit engaging aggressive violent behavior could outweigh potential costs fightings especially fighting alongside coalition furthermore groups individuals formed coalitions acted altruistically ingroup members aggressively outgroup members would see multilevel selection consistent expectations male warrior hypothesis several studies shown ethnocentric beliefs behaviors among men compared women including frequent use dehumanizing speech describe outgroup stronger identification greater cooperation faced competition another greater desire engage war presented images attractive unattractive members opposite greater overall rates malemale competition violence

example dangers frequently encountered findings suggest outgroup males may threat physical safety outgroup women ingroup members supporting male warrior hypothesized sport began way men develop skills

chimpanzee pan troglodytes males demonstrate similar violent behavior groups males form coalitions patrol borders territory attack neighboring bands chimpanzees also patrilocal living patterns aid
