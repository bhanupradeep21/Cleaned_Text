ovulatory shift hypothesis holds women experience evolutionarily adaptive changes subconscious thoughts behaviors related mating different parts ovulatory suggests women want terms men changes throughout menstrual cycle two metaanalyses published reached opposing conclusions whether existing evidence robust enough support prediction womens mate preferences change across newer review show women changing type men desire different times fertility theory proposes womens behavior may change fertile time ovulatory cycle high fertility theory holds women may become physically active avoid male hypothesis separately proposes hormonal changes across cycle cause women likely get pregnant attracted traits potential shortterm male sexual partners indicate high genetic quality leading greater reproductive proposed genetic traits like compatible major histocompatibility complex gene profiles considered newer studies support female changes desired reproductive partners female mammals experience reproductive fertility cycles typically consist long period low fertility brief period high fertility prior including ovulation humans called ovulatory cycle menstrual cycle period high fertility also called fertile window time cycle sex result needed females mammalian species display hormonallyinduced physical behavioral signals fertility fertile window sexual swellings increased motivation needed species sex outside needed phase sexual receptivity proceptivity estrus often referred heat human females however engage sex throughout ovulatory cycles even beyond reproductive years additionally show obvious physical signals high fertility led many researchers conclude humans lost estrus needed hypothesized could due adaptive benefits concealed ovulation extended needed however research shown human females may fact experience subtle distinct physiological behavioral cognitive changes highfertility phase ovulatory men women detect signals indicate highfertility may indicate humans retained estruslike estrus evolved facilitate reproduction maximize reproductive success success passing ones genes producing offspring likely survive reproduce ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes motivation desire mate increase fertile window females seek attract best possible mate highest ideal mate could many qualities resources care offspring physical ability social status protect mate offspring compatible personality longterm pair bond etc evolutionary theory sexual selection theory suggest organism top priority maximize survival reproductive needed thus ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes women possess dual sexuality fertile window woman prioritize attracting choosing mate best genetic quality good genes since time become pregnant pass heritable genetic qualities offspring however lowfertility woman prioritize mate good parenting traits willingness ability invest parenting resources devote offspring compatibility longterm differing traits sometimes referred sexy cad vs good also hypothesized highfertility preferences strongest evaluating shortterm sexual partner lowfertility preferences strongest evaluating longterm relationship woman gain benefits good genes single sexual encounter good dad traits relevant longterm pair bond researchers suggested evolutionary time women may maximized reproductive success seeking good genes extrapair high fertility also maintaining longterm pair bond partner provides parenting resources offspring sometimes called dual strategy needed course optimal partner one sexy cad good dad traits man statistically unlikely common thus natural selection may designed ancestral women opportunistic successful woman could gain benefits highquality genetics highquality parenting give offspring best chance survival however natural selection would favored men desire provide offspring share genes would risky ovulatory cycle shifts hypothesized regulated sex hormones primarily estradiol progesterone become elevated different times across cycle particular high levels estradiol low levels progesterone peak high fertility prior ovulation shown correlated several matingrelated psychological however studies found correlations changes wellestablished estradiol act brain produce psychological behavioral animal studies tend show link sexual behavior estrogen hormones testosterone folliclestimulating hormone fsh luteinizing hormone lh prolactin studied possible correlates produced little numerous studies demonstrated ovulatory cycle shifts women matingrelated motivations preferences thoughts ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes shifts designed natural selection evolutionary adaptations selecting attracting specific types mates high genetic quality woman likely get pregnant earliest studies human ovulatory shifts explored whether women engage instances sexual activity high fertility could indicate human estruslike state studies found increases frequency sexual activity high larger studies concluded generally difference frequency sexual activity across ovulatory possibly due multitude factors affect ability engage sex eg access partner partner desire time engaging etc researchers subsequently explored whether sexual desire rather frequency sexual activity changes across ovulatory cycle would affected practical barriers engaging sex several studies area shown women sexual desire masturbation behaviors increase fertile although results depend type sexual desire measured example desire uncommitted sex appear track studies shown fertilephase women might attracted flirt initiate sex often men newer studies support hypothesis females change consider desirable reproductive partners women relationships may tend assertive independent fertile ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes women high fertility attracted shortterm sexual partners physical behavioral features likely signal genetic fitness good genes symmetrical features may indicate individual possesses highquality genes related health developed stable environment little disease studies found women rate faces symmetrical men attractive high fertility especially evaluating shortterm also demonstrated women high fertility attracted body odors men facial bodily although many studies one metaanalysis shown fertilitymoderated shifts attraction facial bodily symmetry occur reviews concluded effect small many species masculine dominant males experience greater reproductive masculine traits produced puberty increasing amounts testosterone testosterone known immunosuppressant thus traits reflect high levels testosterone may indicate man possesses highquality genes allowed develop masculine features without experiencing deleterious effects high testosterone masculine traits include facial features like strong bodily features like height muscularity body vocal features like deeper many studies shown women tend attracted masculine characteristics high results two metaanalyses concluded effect charles darwin first proposed music lacking functional evolutionary explanation natural selection may instrument sexual selection like male peacocks extravagant feathers serve attract needed similarly humans may use artistic expressions display good genetic qualities like creativity needed major histocompatibility complex mhc suite genes responsible adaptive immune response histocompatibility organisms cells animals including mammals primates mhc shown play role mhc sexual selection organisms mate selectively individuals possess mhc alleles dissimilar mhc shown responsible changing pheromone compositions mice causing mice dissimilar mhc genes attractive body hypothesized mechanism creating genetic diversity avoiding inbreeding creating offspring resistant pathogens studies shown humans tend form longterm partnerships individuals dissimilar find scent mhcdissimilar individuals attractive especially high however studies found little effect mhc mate preferences even shown reverse effect people prefer partners similar mhc several reviews one metaanalysis human primate literature regarding mhc concluded effects mhc similarity attraction humans reliably attracted individuals heterozygous diverse mhc genotypes regardless whether similar however unclear whether attraction mhc heterozygosity changes across ovulatory cycle ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes womens behavior fertile phase also reflect evolutionary adaptations reproductive success fertilephase women also spend time appearance tend wear accessories like jewelry makeup hairstyles perceived trying look additionally several studies demonstrated women tend purchase products related enhancing appearance attractive clothing shoes accessories fertile one earliest studies ovulatory shifts found female lab rats tend run exercise wheels fertile needed subsequent research showed variety species experience increase frequency spontaneous activity motor behavior studies humans shown similar pattern women walk steps counted pedometer highfertility phase however research found difference locomotion patterns across ovulatory cycle many studies activity across cycle small sample sizes substantially differing methodologies making difficult draw definitive despite possible increase activity many studies found women consume fewer calories fertile researchers suggested changes activity food consumption may indicate estrus women motivated focus energy matingrelated behaviors like going meet new potential mates instead survivalrelated behaviors like seeking parental investment theory posits idea natural selection designed sex different mating strategies based much investment sex required devote offspring needed sex invests offspring intersexually selective picky choosing sexual partner time resources lose make poor choice sex intrasexually competitive competitive members sex order access attract selective needed humans mammals females sex invests parenting simply lengthy taxing process pregnancy lactation whereas males need contribute one act sexual intercourse pass genes thus females expected selective sex males expected competitive however unlike many species males contribute parenting humans highly dependent offspring complex social structure allows males make significant important investments parenting effort according parental investment theory indicates natural selection may designed women somewhat competitive women access best mates potential fathers studies indicated women engage competitive behaviors women high fertility fertile window women using hormonal contraceptives selfreport increased feelings intrasexual competitiveness describe women less attractive use dehumanizing terms talking women womens choices purchase attractive revealing clothing high fertility also increased first shown photograph attractive woman photographs men unattractive women suggesting clothing may chosen attract men rather competitive display additionally studies used economic games show women less likely share resources engage cooperative bargaining women fertile researchers noted reason women competitive fertile window ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes women seeking shortterm sexual partners peak fertility men effectively multiple sexual partners competition one highquality man necessary women competing longterm partner reason competitive fertile window time cyclemedical citation needed hassleton gildersleeve wrote men women subconsciously detect cues womens fertility change across

studies found fertile phase women speak slightly higher vocal one study reported recordings womens voices fertile phase rated men women attractive recordings women low however effect sizes relatively small compared cues several studies found men relationship tend protective possessive partner peak fertility well jealous advances partner might make one study found interacting partner fertile phase men shown photograph attractive man exhibit increased testosterone may competitive since proposed changes hormone levels across ovulatory cycle primary mechanisms causes cycle shifts studies explored effects hormonal contraception like pill womens cycle shifts peoples ability detect cycle shiftsoriginal research studies reported hormonal contraceptives weaken eliminate cycle shifts proposed synthetic hormones present hormonal contraception suppress ovulation also suppress subsequent cognitive behavioral changes found naturallycycling women studies stated changes synthetic hormones produce cycle shifts similar effects produced real hormonal changes naturallycycling ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes adaptive changes matingrelated cognition behavior occur within ovulatory cycle researchers posited betweencycle shift theory many women experience regular anovulatory cycles nonfertile cycles ovulation occur therefore hormonal changes ovulatory cycles may reliable indicator true fertility higher levels estradiol likely produce fertile ovulatory needed thus researchers proposed hormonal changes cycles primarily elevated estradiol levels responsible changes matingrelated cognition withincycle shifts may simply byproduct betweencycle shifts caused elevated one metaanalysis review literature conducted published unpublished data support claim ovulatory shift hypothesis women experience changes attraction preferences high however another metaanalysis subsequent commentary concluded effect actually significant may result studies using imprecise measurements women fertile window well publication review subsequently published also show women changing type men desire different times fertility another study found correlation current fertility status sociosexual
