lorenz also found geese could imprint inanimate objects one notable experiment followed box placed model train circles around filial imprinting restricted nonhuman animals able follow parents however filial imprinting birds primary technique used create movie winged migration le peuple migrateur contains great deal footage migratory birds flight birds imprinted handlers wore yellow jackets honked horns constantly birds trained fly along variety aircraft primarily ultralights italian hangglider pilot angelo darrigo extended technique darrigo noted flight nonmotorised hangglider similar flight patterns migratory birds use updrafts hot air thermal currents gain altitude permits soaring flight distance used reintroduce threatened species birds hatched captivity mentor birds teach traditional migratory routes darrigo hatched chicks wing glider imprinted taught fledglings fly hunt young birds followed ground lorenz also air took path various migratory routes flew across sahara mediterranean

become desensitized later close sexual attraction phenomenon known westermarck effect first formally described finnish anthropologist edvard westermarck book history human marriage westermarck effect

communally peer groups based age biological relation study marriage patterns children later life revealed nearly marriages occurred across kibbutz system fourteen children peer group fourteen none reared together first six years life result provides evidence westermarck effect demonstrable operates period birth age however eran shor dalit simchai claimed case kibbutzim actually provides little support westermarck proximity critical period example brother sister brought separately never meeting one may find one another highly sexually attractive meet phenomenon known genetic sexual
