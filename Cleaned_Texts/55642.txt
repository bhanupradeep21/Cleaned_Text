cognitive psychology missing letter effect refers finding people asked consciously detect target letters reading text miss letters frequent function words eg letter h less frequent content understanding effect arises becomes useful explaining range cognitive processes associated reading missing letter effect also referred reverse word superiority effect since describes phenomenon letters frequent words fail identified instead letter identification benefitting increased word frequency method researchers utilise measure effect termed letter detection task involves paperandpencil procedure readers asked circle target letter every time come across reading prose passage researchers measure number letter detection errors missed circled target letters texts missing letter effect likely appear reading words part normal sequence words embedded mixedup sequence eg readers asked read despite missing letter effect common phenomenon different factors influence magnitude effect age development language proficiency position target letters words testing missing letter effect prose passages used incorporate mix common function words rare content common function words words used seen frequently regularly every day words connector words content words consist pronouns articles prepositions conjunctions auxiliary common examples function words include majority words short length consisting usually around frequency commonness words seldom paid attention consciously content words usually consist nouns regular verbs rare frequent function word types usually given paid attention word ant example rare content word comparison structurally similar looking frequent function word like letter detection tasks ones set used prove measure missing letter effect participants task given prose passages continuous texts read told circle every occurrence target missing letter effect determined target letters missed circled omissions letter detection errors occur reading frequent function words rare content saintaubin reported experiment higher accounts letter detection omissions word word presented definite article word pronoun two primary hypotheses tried explain missing letter effect healy emphasized identification processes playing crucial role almost entirely focusing word hypothesis primarily referred unitization relates familiar visual model readers finished processing text higher level units like words move continue reading different section text interferes completion processing lowerlevel units like common words processed read terms units larger letter eg syllables whole words whereas rare words tend read smaller units eg letters result letter detection errors occurring insufficient processing lowerlevel processing time hypothesis also proposed provides explanation missing letter effect amount time readers participants letter detection tasks take process word dictates occurrence letter detection errors missing letter increase processing time denotes decrease letter detection errors decrease processing time follows result increase word familiarity word missing letter effect occurs due faster processing common function words higher level rare content words result higher familiarity visual patterns koriat greenberg give another explanation missing letter effect viewing structural role word within sentence ie function words vs content words termed alternative structural hypothesis within hypothesis rather putting focus familiarity determinant effect word role syntactic structure sentence encompasses common function words receding allow meaningful content words brought foreground sense structural organization texts overrules perceptional organization like unitization model occurrence missing letter early stages processing text structural frame speculatively formulated readers constructed fast insufficient processing function words missing letter effect unfolds difficult detect target letters within function words pushed background following structural analysis detect letters content words stand foreground uncover meaning accounts thoroughly investigated neither could completely explain new model called guidanceorganization go model recently proposed potentially explain missing letter effect combination two models proposed healy koriat greenberg illuminates idea word frequency function together influence rate letter detection errors unitization structural processes occur reading unitization processing takes place structural processing assists lexical identification particularly common function words establish basis phrase sentences structural organisation sentence structure proceeds guide attention higherlevel units less frequent content words understanding greenberg et al explain time spent processing highfrequency function words wholeword level relatively short thereby enabling fast early use words build tentative structural short go model account readers coordinate text elements achieve online integration analysis meaning although hypothesis models missing letter effect limitation difficult relate models klein proposed attentionaldisengagement model similarly includes aspects two earlier models emphasizes role attention reading comprehension model letter detection errors increase magnitude missing letter effect increases rapid attentional disengagement word target letter saintaubin et al propose likelihood identifying target letter within word andor text contingent upon much information possible presence target letter available timing attentional disengagement targetcontaining word essentially produces missing letter effect attention disengages faster functional words content developmental change grade level generally reading skills increase age factors influence missing letter number letter detection errors size missing letter effect increases testing primary elementary school children grades one four missing letter effect higher children better reading skills tend make letter detection errors function words rare content testing primary school children second graders college students effect found older students miss target letters function words frequently younger students comparing adults second graders missing letter effect gets larger age observing differences letter detection errors function words word researchers greenberg koriat vellutino give reasoning findings write missing letter effect arises early reading first second grade magnitude increases grade level reading skills ability improve developmental changes younger readers gain greater ability process understand texts configuration texts words influence missing letter effect letter detection errors younger readers yet developed enough conscious text structure affected greatly older readers structural function words analysing conclusions magnitude missing letter effect increases age development grade level consistent go model ad hypotheses

function older developed better readers better using information probable location function words sentence missing letter effect influenced proficiency language proficiency differs across two languages one experiment bovee raney recruited people speak english proficiently low proficiency level spanish take part letter detection task comprehension questions results show letter detection

word identification results less omissions target letters smaller sized missing letter position letters words position suffix morphemes influence word identification letter detection missing letter effect letters start end words first last letter word contribute people read recognize readers take part letter detection task given connected text read less letter detection errors target letter example situated initial letter word eg tree compared embedded words eg drewnowski healy account initial letter word separable rest word easier detect processed individually letters transposed words within text last letter words important assisting target letter pace reading reduced letters transposed words allows comprehensive processing provides reason last letter word identified drewnowski
