plates bones sclerotic orbitonasal fenestra positioned middle head shield leaning towards anterior end usually eyes enclosed within sclerotic capsule nasal cavities open directly head visceral surface sclerotic ring smooth bears small pores pits sclerotic ring open wide ventrally sclerotic capsule consists three fine plates sclerotic bones one three anterior medial lode quarry latvia two specimens

sclerotic ring tail covered ganoid scales like armour modified cosmoid scales consisting bony basal layer layer dentine outer layer since tail doesnt high degree mineralization comparison scales
