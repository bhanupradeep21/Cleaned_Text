factor ix gene located x chromosome xlinked recessive trait explains males affected greater george brownlee merlin crossley showed two sets genetic mutations preventing two key proteins attaching dna people rare unusual form haemophilia b haemophilia b leyden patients experience episodes excessive bleeding childhood bleeding problems lack protein attachment dna thereby turning gene produces clotting factor ix prevents excessive factor ix deficiency leads increased propensity haemorrhage either spontaneously response mild factor ix deficiency cause interference coagulation cascade thereby causing spontaneous haemorrhage trauma factor ix activated activates factor x helps fibrinogen fibrin factor ix becomes active eventually coagulation cofactor factor viii specifically ixa platelets
