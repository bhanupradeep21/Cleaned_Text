olduvai domain demonstrates largest hls increase copy number proteincoding region living species additional copies compared chimpanzees increase number copies present connection olduvai seems direct correlation several phenotypes brain including increase brain size seen human genome sequences located primarily chromosome region several copies also found approximately amino acids length encoded twoexon doublet sequences encoding domains show rhythmicity resonance signs positive selection especially primates expressed several human tissues including brain expression restricted various hls domains show interactions suggested nuclear magnetic resonance backbone chemical shift research found olduvai domain role development neurons specifically appears function increase number neural stem cells prolonging developmental period neurons olduvai copy number reduced neurons appear mature faster divide less conversely olduvai copy number increased neurons appear mature longer divide higher copy number variation recently investigated autism disorder associated deletions duplications yet causative loci within regions previously identified research found copy number subtype linearly associated increasing severity social impairment evidence relevant current theories proposing autism psychosis fundamentally related precise nature relationship currently debate alternative lines argument suggesting two diametrically opposed diseases exist continuum exhibit nuanced schizophrenia neurological condition issues brain contrast autism copy number increase subtypes associated

additional support involvement olduvai genomic tradeoff model involving human brain key genes major contributors evolutionary expansion human brain human cognitive capacity may also different combinations underlie psychiatric disorders autism olduvai domains one many genetic elements located region high number repeated elements therefore high tendency towards deletions duplications led several conditions involve region identified including tar syndrome general classifications deletion syndrome duplication syndrome studies deletions duplications region consistently revealed microcephaly association deletions macrocephaly association genome sequences indicate olduvai protein domain first appears part myomegalin gene chromosome mammals least million years myomegalin
