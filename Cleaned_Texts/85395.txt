core feature amyotrophic lateral usual cell inclusions often temporary inclusions accumulated proteins fats secretory granules insoluble inclusion bodies found bacteria particles aggregated protein higher density many cell components typically represent sites viral multiplication bacterium eukaryotic cell usually consist viral capsid proteins inclusion bodies contain little host protein ribosomal components dnarna fragments often almost exclusively contain overexpressed protein aggregation reported reversible suggested inclusion bodies dynamic structures formed unbalanced equilibrium aggregated soluble proteins escherichia coli growing body information indicating formation inclusion bodies occurs result intracellular accumulation partially folded expressed proteins aggregate noncovalent hydrophobic ionic interactions combination bothcitation needed inclusion bodies nonunit single lipid membranecitation needed protein inclusion bodies classically thought contain misfolded protein however contested green fluorescent protein sometimes fluoresce inclusion bodies indicates resemblance native structure researchers recovered folded protein inclusion genes one organism expressed another organism resulting protein sometimes forms inclusion bodies often true large evolutionary distances crossed cdna isolated eukarya example expressed recombinant gene prokaryote risks formation inactive aggregates protein known inclusion bodies cdna may properly code translatable mrna protein results emerge foreign microenvironment often fatal effects especially intent cloning produce biologically active protein example eukaryotic systems carbohydrate modification membrane transport found prokaryotes internal microenvironment prokaryotic cell ph osmolarity may differ original source gene mechanisms folding protein may also absent hydrophobic residues normally would remain buried may exposed available interaction similar exposed sites ectopic proteins processing systems cleavage removal internal peptides would also absent bacteria initial attempts clone insulin bacterium suffered deficits addition fine controls may keep concentration protein low also missing

followed solubilisation purified inclusion bodies solubilisation inclusions bodies often involves treatment denaturing agents urea guanidine chloride high concentrations deaggregate collapsed proteins renaturation follows treatment denaturing agents often consists dialysis andor use molecules promote refolding denatured proteins including chaotopic pseudoinclusions invaginations cytoplasm cell
