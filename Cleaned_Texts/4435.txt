haptens derived greek haptein meaning fasten small molecules elicit immune response attached large carrier protein carrier may one also elicit immune response mechanisms absence immune response may vary involve complex immunological interactions include absent insufficient costimulatory signals antigenpresenting cells haptens used study allergic contact dermatitis acd mechanisms inflammatory bowel disease ibd induce autoimmunelike concept haptens emerged work austrian immunologist karl also pioneered use synthetic haptens study immunochemical haptens applied skin conjugate carrier could induce contact hypersensitivity type iv delayed hypersensitivity reaction mediated cells dendritic cells consists two phases sensitization elicitation sensitization phase hapten applied skin first time characterized activation innate immune responses including migration dendritic cells lymph nodes priming antigenspecific naive cells generation antigenspecific effector memory cells b cells antibodysecreting plasma cells second elicitation phase hapten applied different skin area starts activation effector cells followed cellmediated tissue damage antibodymediated immune responses haptens initially activate innate immune responses complex mechanisms involving inflammatory cytokines damageassociated molecular patterns damp body generated antibodies haptencarrier adduct smallmolecule hapten may also able bind antibody usually initiate immune response usually haptencarrier adduct sometimes smallmolecule hapten even block immune response haptencarrier adduct preventing adduct binding antibody process called hapten inhibition wellknown example hapten urushiol toxin found poison ivy absorbed skin poison ivy plant urushiol undergoes oxidation skin cells generate actual hapten reactive quinonetype molecule reacts skin proteins form hapten adducts second exposure proliferated tcells become activated generating immune reaction produces typical blisters urushiolinduced contact example haptenmediated contact dermatitis nickel allergy caused nickel metal ions penetrating skin binding skin proteins lot haptens comprised different kinds drugs pesticides hormones food toxins etc important factor molecular mass first researched haptens aniline carboxyl derivatives paminobenzoic haptens induce autoimmune disease example hydralazine blood pressurelowering drug occasionally produce druginduced lupus erythematosus certain individuals also appears mechanism anesthetic gas halothane cause lifethreatening hepatitis well mechanism penicillinclass drugs cause autoimmune hemolytic haptens commonly used molecular biology applications include fluorescein biotin digoxigenin dinitrophenol antibodies successfully raised endogenous unreactive small molecules neurotransmitters eg serotonin glutamate dopamine gaba tryptamine glycine noradrenaline amino acids eg tryptophan using glutaraldehyde crosslink molecules carrier proteins suitable immune recognition

acting detoxification mechanism although proteins mostly employed hapten conjugation synthetic polypeptides polylglutamic acid polysaccharides liposomes could also common reaction mechanisms forming covalent bonds predicted involved sensitization nucleophilic substitution saturated centre nucleophilic substitution unsaturated centre nucleophilic addition reactions also possible electrophilic substitution diazonium salts radical reactions ionic selecting suitable method hapten conjugation functional groups hapten carrier must identified depending groups present one two main strategies could employed hapten inhibition semihapten inhibition type iii hypersensitivity response inhibition free hapten molecules bind antibodies toward molecule without causing immune response leaving fewer antibodies left bind immunogenic haptenprotein adduct example hapten inhibitor dextran small fraction kilodalton entire dextran complex enough bind antidextran antibodies insufficient result formation
