layer makes egg chamber insects arthropods lay large variety styles shapes eggs gelatinous skinlike coverings others hard eggshells softer shells mostly protein may fibrous quite liquid arthropod eggs actually shells rather outer covering actually outermost embryonic membrane choroid protects inner layers complex structure may different layers including outermost layer called exochorion eggs must survive dry conditions usually hard eggshells made mostly dehydrated mineralized proteins pore systems allow respiration arthropod eggs extensive ornamentation outer surfacescitation needed fish amphibians generally lay eggs surrounded extraembryonic membranes develop shell hard soft around membranes fish amphibian eggs thick leathery coats especially must withstand physical force desiccation
