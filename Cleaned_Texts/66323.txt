art integrating selection systems falls human resource professionals united states america members society industrial organizational psychology siop conduct much research selection primary research topics include validity interviews describes useful interviews predicting job performance one comprehensive metaanalytic summary date weisner cronshaw authors investigated interview validity function interview format individual vs board degree structure structure vs unstructured results study showed structured interviews yielded much higher mean corrected validities unstructured interviews vs structured board interviews using consensus ratings highest corrected validity mcdaniel whetzel schmidt maurers comprehensive review meta analysis validity interviews paper authors go step include examination validity three different types interview contentsituational jobrelated psychologicaltheir goal explore possibility validity function type content collected define three kinds content follows situational content described interview questions get information interviewee would behave specific situations presented interviewer example question asks whether interviewee would choose report coworker behaving unethical way let go job related questions hand assess interviewees past behavior jobrelated information psychological interviews include questions intended assess interviewees personality traits work ethic dependability honesty etc authors conducted metaanalysis previous studies validity interviews across three types content mentioned results show jobperformance criteria situational interviews yield higher mean jobrelated yield higher mean validity psychology means interview used predict job performance best conduct situational interviews rather jobrelated psychological interviews hand interviews used predict applicants training performance mean validity jobrelated somewhat lower mean validity psychological going beyond content interview authors analysis interview validity extended include assessment interview conducted two questions emerged structured interviews valid unstructured interviews board interviews one interviewer valid individual interviews answer first question structured interviews valid unstructured interviews structured interviews regardless content unstructured predicting job performance criteria however training performance criteria validity structured unstructured interviews similar validity board interviews versus individual interviews researchers conducted another metaanalyses comparing validity board interviews individual interviews job performance criteria results show individual interviews valid board interviews vs true regardless whether individual interview structured unstructured exploring variance interview validity job performance training performance tenure criteria researchers found interviews similar predictive accuracy jobperformance training performance vs less predictive tenure based metaanalysis results cognitive ability tests appear among valid psychological tests valid occupations however tests tend better predicting training criteria long term job performance cognitive ability tests general provide benefit generalizable hence used across organizations jobs shown produce large economic gains companies use gatewood feild heneman et al despite high validity cognitive testing less frequently used selection tools one main reason cognitive ability testing demonstrated produce adverse impact general groups including hispanics africanamericans score lower general population groups including asian americans score higher heneman et al lubenski legal issues cognitive ability testing amplified supreme courts ruling famous griggs v duke power case case supreme court ruled selection test produces adverse impact protected group members company must able defend showing use test business necessity operation business courts held narrow interpretations business necessity require companies show acceptable selection alternative exists sovereign result many companies abandoned cognitive ability testing steven l thomas wesley scroggins utility cognitive ability testing selection broadly accepted utility personality testing relatively recently historically research documenting low predictive validity potential invasion privacy based item content made application selection instruments questionable hogan hogan roberts due legal challenges associated cognitive ability interest personality instruments recently revived schmidt ones hunter suggested pairing personality testing cognitive ability testing may one means enhance validity reducing adverse impact ryan ployhart friedel likely aspects personality enhance individual ability apply intellectual capacity personality traits limit application kaufman lichtenberger hence adding personality ability test enhance validity reducing adverse impact selection system recent research studies prove assumption false showing addition predictor producing smaller group differences ie personality test predictor producing higher group differences ie cognitive ability test reduce potential adverse impact degree often expected bobko roth potosky schmitt rogers chan sheppard jennings although use personality tests measures cognitive ability may desired effects reducing adverse impact appears addition personality measures measures cognitive ability composite predictor results significant incremental validity bobko et al schmitt et studies found validity predictor composites highest alternative predictors used combination cognitive ability though combination predictors resulted highest predictive validity inclusion cognitive ability alternative predictors increased potential adverse impact steven l thomas wesley scroggins summary cognitive ability testing shown high levels validity comes issues relating adverse impact personality tests hand historically proven low validity due lack common understanding constitutes personality nonstandardized measures available growing number research studies show best way organizations achieve close optimal validity job performance prediction create predictor composite includes measure cognitive ability additional measure personality test two major factors determine quality newly hired employees predictor validity aka predictive validity selection predictor cutoff test score differentiating passing selection measure people score hired considered test accurately differentiates successful unsuccessful workers using test score cutoff high predictor validity selection ratio sr hand number job openings n divided number job applicants n value range reflecting selectivity organizations hiring practices sr equal

appropriate positions vary measurements use level standardization employ though subject predictors selection always less perfect validity scatter plots well forecasting methods judgmental bootstrapping index models help us refine prediction model well identify criterion cutoff point separating successful unsuccessful performers according standard set hiring organization true positives applied thought succeed job result passed selection test fact performed satisfactorily true negatives describe correctly rejected based measure would successful employees false negatives occur people rejected result selection test failure would performed well job finally false positives applied individuals selected passed selection measure make successful employees selection errors minimized increasing validity predictor test standards determination cutoff score vary widely set consistent expectations relevant adjusting cutoff either direction automatically increase error thus important determine type error harmful casebycase basis banding another method setting cutoff differences test scores ignored applicants whose scores fall band range selected basis individual scores another factor spas reduce adverse impact width band function test reliability two negatively correlated banding allows employers ignore test scores altogether using random selection many criticized technique reason metaanalysis selection methods personnel psychology found general mental ability best overall predictor job performance training regarding interview procedures data put question tools selecting aim job interview ostensibly choose candidate perform well job role methods selection provide greater predictive validity often entail lower costs unstructured interviews commonly used structured interviews tend yield better outcomes considered better interview structure defined reduction procedural variance across applicants translate degree discretion interviewer allowed conducting structure interview compared typical paper pencil test would think fair every test taker given different questions different number questions exam answers graded differently yet exactly occurs unstructured interview thus structured interview attempts standardize popular selection tool multiple studies metaanalyses also conducted look relationship organizational citizenship behavior ocb organizational
