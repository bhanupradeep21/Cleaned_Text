periodontal disease stop progressive loss supportive structures regrow bone make teeth stable cases periapical pathology present teeth also may increased mobility severe infection apex tooth result bone loss turn cause depending extent damage mobility may reduce following endodontic treatment mobility severe caused combination reasons mobility may permanent osteonecrosis condition lack blood supply causes bone die mainly presents following radiotherapy jaw complication patients taking specific antiangiogenic result necrosis patient might experience several symptoms including tooth oral cancer malignant abnormal excessive growth cells within oral cavity arises premalignant lesions multistep carcinogenesis oral cancers involve lips lateral border tongue floor mouth area behind third molars ie retromolar symptoms oral cancer include velvety red patches white patches loose teeth nonhealing mouth risk factors oral cancer may include caries prevalence oral hygiene status dental trauma dental visit stress family history cancer body mass index bmi habits tobacco chewingsmoking alcohol major causative agents although human papillomavirus also recently implicated one note alcohol carcinogenic potentiates effects carcinogens increasing permeability oral oral cancers range symptoms including red white patches ulcer nonhealing sockets another symptom patients might experience loose teeth apparent loss attachment bruxism abnormal repetitive movement disorder characterised jaw clenching tooth also causative factor development dental issues including tooth although cause periodontium damage bruxism known able worsen attachment loss tooth mobility periodontal disease already moreover severity tooth mobility caused bruxism also varies depending teeth grinding pattern intensity however tooth mobility typically reversible tooth returns normal level mobility bruxism controlled dental trauma refers traumatic injuries dentition supporting structures common examples include injury periodontal tissues crown fractures especially central traumas may also isolated associated facial trauma luxation injury root fractures teeth cause sudden increase mobility blow however depends type dental trauma clinical findings show types trauma may affect mobility example subluxation alveolar fracture would cause increased mobility enamel fracture enameldentin fracture would still show normal physiological tooth mobility tooth movement occurs moderate force applied tooth intact causes tooth mobility pathological reasons listed hormones play vital role homeostasis within periodontal advocated number years pregnancy hormones oral contraceptive pill menstruation alter host response invading bacteria especially within periodontium leading increase tooth mobility presumed result physiological change within structures surrounding teeth study conducted mishra et al link female sex hormones particularly pregnancy tooth mobility confirmed found substantial change mobility occurred final month excessive occlusal stresses refer forces exceed limits tissue adaptation therefore causing occlusal tooth contact may also cause occlusal stress following circumstances occlusal interferences dental treatment periodontal disease although occlusal trauma excessive occlusal forces initiate periodontitis cause loss connective tissue attachment alone certain cases occlusal trauma exacerbate moreover preexisting plaqueinduced periodontitis also cause occlusal trauma increase rate connective tissue turn may increase tooth mobility primary teeth near exfoliation shedding primary teeth inevitably increase mobility exfoliation usually occurs ages six thirteen years usually starts lower anterior teeth incisors however exfoliation times primary dentition vary timing depends permanent tooth underneath common scenario dental treatment causing aggravation tooth mobility new filling crown fraction millimetre prominent bite days causes periodontal pain tooth andor opposing orthodontic treatment cause increased tooth mobility well one risks orthodontic treatment result inadequate access cleaning gingival likely seen patients fixed appliances loss connective tissue attachment alveolar bone loss normal twoyear course orthodontic treatment usually cause problems slight resolve treatment however oral hygiene inadequate patient genetic susceptibility periodontal disease effect another risk orthodontic treatment lead increase mobility root resorption risk thought greater following factors present treatment tooth mobility depends aetiology grade mobility cause mobility addressed obtain optimal treatment outcome example tooth mobility associated periodontitis periodontal treatment carried presence periapical pathology treatment options include drainage abscess endodontic treatment occlusal adjustment occlusal adjustment process selectively modifying occlusal surfaces teeth grinding eliminate disharmonious occlusion upper lower occlusal adjustment indicated mobility associated periodontal ligament widening occlusal adjustments unsuccessful mobility caused aetiology loss periodontal support splinting procedure increasing resistance tooth applied force fixing neighbouring tooth teeth splinting done aetiologies addressed periodontal disease traumatic occlusion treatments difficult due lack tooth stabilization splinting allows healing functions tissue healing main disadvantage splinting makes removal plaque difficult increased plaque retention margins splint cause periodontal disease loss periodontal support dental splint works evening pressure across patients jaw splint used protect teeth damage creates physical barrier lower upper teeth order treat mobility teeth joined splinted together order
