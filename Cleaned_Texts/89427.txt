plant cells amino acids except sulfurcontaining ones like cysteine cysteine made chloroplast proplastid also synthesized cytosol mitochondria probably trouble crossing membranes get chloroplast known

make amino acids plastid site diverse complex lipid synthesis carbon used form majority lipid acetylcoa decarboxylation product pyruvate may enter plastid cytosol passive diffusion membrane production pyruvate also made plastid phosphoenolpyruvate metabolite made cytosol pyruvate acetate cytosol unavailable lipid biosynthesis typical length fatty acids produced plastid carbons cis double biosynthesis fatty acids acetylcoa primarily requires two enzymes acetylcoa carboxylase creates malonylcoa used first step extension steps synthesis fatty acid synthase fas large complex enzymes cofactors including acyl carrier protein acp holds acyl chain synthesized initiation synthesis begins condensation malonylacp acetylcoa produce ketobutyrylacp reductions involving use nadph one dehydration creates butyrylacp extension fatty acid comes repeated cycles malonylacp condensation reduction lipids derived methylerythritol phosphate mep pathway consist gibberelins sterols abscisic acid phytol innumerable secondary chloroplasts special type plant cell organelle called plastid though two terms sometimes used interchangeably many types plastids carry various functions chloroplasts plant descended undifferentiated proplastids found fertilized egg proplastids commonly found adult plants apical meristems chloroplasts normally develop proplastids root tip formation starchstoring amyloplasts shoots proplastids shoot apical meristems gradually develop chloroplasts photosynthetic leaf tissues leaf matures exposed required process involves invaginations inner plastid membrane forming sheets membrane project internal stroma membrane sheets fold form thylakoids angiosperm shoots exposed required light chloroplast formation proplastids may develop etioplast stage becoming chloroplasts etioplast plastid lacks chlorophyll inner membrane invaginations form lattice tubes stroma called prolamellar body etioplasts lack chlorophyll yellow chlorophyll precursor within minutes light exposure prolamellar body begins reorganize stacks thylakoids chlorophyll starts produced process etioplast becomes chloroplast takes several gymnosperms require light form light however guarantee proplastid develop chloroplast whether proplastid develops chloroplast kind plastid mostly controlled largely influenced kind cell resides plastid differentiation permanent fact many interconversions possible chloroplasts may converted chromoplasts pigmentfilled plastids responsible bright colors seen flowers ripe fruit starch storing amyloplasts also converted chromoplasts possible proplastids develop straight chromoplasts chromoplasts amyloplasts also become chloroplasts like happens carrot potato illuminated plant injured something else causes plant cell revert meristematic state chloroplasts plastids turn back proplastids chloroplast amyloplast chromoplast proplastid absolute forms chloroplasts photosynthetic cell develop directly proplastids etioplasts fact typical shoot meristematic plant cell contains proplastids proplastids differentiate chloroplasts divide create chloroplasts found mature photosynthetic plant cell cell divides chloroplast division provides additional chloroplasts partition two daughter singlecelled algae chloroplast division way new chloroplasts formed proplastid algal cell divides chloroplast divides along daughter cell receives mature almost chloroplasts cell divide rather small group rapidly dividing chloroplasts definite dna replication synchronized limited host much know chloroplast division comes studying organisms like arabidopsis red alga cyanidioschyzon division process starts proteins assemble filaments help protein form structure called zring within chloroplasts min system manages placement zring ensuring chloroplast cleaved less evenly protein mind prevents ftsz linking forming filaments another protein may also involved well understood proteins active poles chloroplast preventing zring formation near center chloroplast mine inhibits allowing zring next two plastiddividing rings pd rings form inner plastiddividing ring located inner side chloroplasts inner membrane formed outer plastiddividing ring found wrapped around outer chloroplast membrane consists filaments nanometers arranged rows nanometers apart shrinks squeeze chloroplast chloroplast constriction species like cyanidioschyzon merolæ chloroplasts third plastiddividing ring located chloroplasts intermembrane late constriction phase dynamin proteins assemble around outer plastiddividing helping provide force squeeze meanwhile zring inner plastiddividing ring break stage many chloroplast dna plasmids floating around stroma partitioned distributed two forming daughter later dynamins migrate outer plastid dividing ring direct contact chloroplasts outer cleave chloroplast two daughter remnant outer plastid dividing ring remains floating two daughter chloroplasts remnant dynamin ring remains attached one daughter five six rings involved chloroplast division outer plastiddividing ring present entire constriction division zring forms first constriction begin outer plastiddividing ring species algae contain single chloroplast regulation chloroplast division extremely important ensure daughter cell receives cant made organisms like plants whose cells contain multiple chloroplasts coordination looser less important likely chloroplast cell division somewhat synchronized though mechanisms mostly light shown requirement chloroplast division chloroplasts grow progress constriction stages poor quality green light slow complete require exposure bright white light complete division spinach leaves grown green light observed contain many large dumbbellshaped chloroplasts exposure white light stimulate chloroplasts divide reduce population dumbbellshaped like mitochondria chloroplasts usually inherited single parent biparental chloroplast plastid genes inherited parent low levels flowering many mechanisms prevent biparental chloroplast dna inheritance including selective destruction chloroplasts genes within gamete zygote chloroplasts one parent excluded embryo parental chloroplasts sorted one type present gymnosperms pine trees mostly pass chloroplasts flowering plants often inherit chloroplasts flowering plants thought inherit chloroplasts maternally however many documented cases angiosperms inheriting chloroplasts angiosperms pass chloroplasts maternally many ways prevent paternal inheritance produce sperm cells contain plastids many documented mechanisms prevent paternal inheritance flowering plants different rates chloroplast replication within among angiosperms paternal chloroplast inheritance observed often hybrids offspring parents species suggests incompatible hybrid genes might interfere mechanisms prevent paternal recently chloroplasts caught attention developers genetically modified crops since flowering plants chloroplasts inherited male parent transgenes plastids disseminated pollen makes plastid transformation valuable tool creation cultivation genetically modified plants biologically contained thus posing significantly lower environmental risks biological containment strategy therefore suitable establishing coexistence conventional organic agriculture reliability mechanism yet studied relevant crop species recent results
