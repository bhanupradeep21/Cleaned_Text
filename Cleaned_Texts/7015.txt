glucose clamp technique method quantifying insulin secretion resistance used measure either well individual metabolizes glucose sensitive individual two types clamp quite commonly used hyperglycemic clamp requires maintaining high blood sugar level perfusion infusion glucose way quantify fast betacells respond glucose hyperinsulinemic clamp requires maintaining high insulin level perfusion infusion insulin way quantify sensitive tissue insulin hyperinsulinemic clamp also called euglycemic clamp meaning normal blood sugar level maintainedcitation needed hyperglycemic clamp technique plasma glucose concentration acutely raised mgdl basal levels continuous infusion glucose hyperglycemic plateau maintained adjustment variable glucose infusion based rate insulin secretion glucose metabolism plasma glucose concentration held constant glucose infusion rate index insulin secretion glucose metabolism hyperglycemic clamps often used assess insulin secretion capacity hyperinsulinemiceuglycemic clamp technique plasma insulin concentration acutely raised maintained Î¼uml continuous infusion insulin meanwhile plasma glucose concentration held constant basal levels variable glucose infusion steadystate achieved glucose infusion rate equals glucose uptake tissues body therefore measure tissue insulin sensitivity hyperinsulinemic clamps often used measure insulin resistance glucose clamp technique developed university texas ut school medicine professors defronzo andres tobin since gold standard pharmacodynamic studies diabetes drug development diagnostics human clinical trials manual glucose clamps well modern method automated glucose clamp find common httpsenwikipediaorgwikiglucoseclamptechnique
