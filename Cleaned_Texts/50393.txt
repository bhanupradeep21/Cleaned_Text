major advantage cytof ability investigate larger number parameters per panel cytometry methods allows greater understanding complex heterogeneous cell populations without need many complex overlapping panels panels include antibodies opposed done conventional flow cytometry require great expertise however development spectral flow cytometry closed gap flow mass cytometry terms maximum number antibodies used antibodies per panel saves time allows understanding larger picture requires fewer numbers cells per experiment particularly advantageous samples limited tumour use heavy metal isotopes also lowers background compared using fluorescent antibodies cell types myeloid cells high rates autofluorescence create lot background noise flow however rare heavy metal isotopes used present biological systems therefore little background seen overall sensitivity detection overlap different heavy metals also low compared overlap seen fluorescent cytometry makes much simpler design
