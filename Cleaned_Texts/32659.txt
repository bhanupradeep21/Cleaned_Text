response prompting procedures systematic strategies used increase probability correct responding opportunities positive reinforcement learners providing systematically removing prompts response prompting sometimes called errorless learning teaching using procedures usually results errors learner goal response prompting transfer stimulus control prompt desired discriminative stimulus several response prompting procedures commonly used special education research system least prompts b least prompting c progressive constant time delay simultaneous prompting slp prompting procedure uses removes prompts moving hierarchy less restrictive student emits correct behavior point instructional trial without prompts reinforcement provided system least prompts gives learner opportunity exhibit correct response least restrictive level prompting needed teachers required use multiple types prompts eg verbal physical prompts slp prompting procedure may complicated use typical may similar nonsystematic teaching procedures typically used teachers involve giving learners opportunity exhibit behavior independently providing prompt slp widely used variety learners skills widely used format individual instruction chained recently used conjunction new technology like portable dvd players video ipods selfhelp skills young adults intellectual improve transition skills elementary school students autism spectrum mtl prompting procedure cuvo leaf borakove removes prompts moving hierarchy restrictive less mtl prompting procedure begins restrictive prompt usually physical prompt learner received reinforcement completing task physical prompts less restrictive prompt given eg partial physical prompt even less restrictive prompt eg verbal prompt usually specific criterion set prompt change eg three days correct performance behavior use partial physical prompt verbal prompt used individual fails perform behavior correctly less intrusive prompt instructor would return intrusive prompt specified number eventually discriminative stimulus behavior typically occurring stimulus eg lunch finished student independently goes sink wash hands direction eg teacher says class time sit desks student sits desk mtl prompting procedures often used teach chained tasks eg hand washing learners intellectual used teach learners mild profound disabilities infants wolery suggest mtl prompting procedures used nonimitative learners may initially respond lessrestrictive prompts like models may efficient imitative learners mild disabilities ctd ptd procedures prompt used throughout prompt ensure learner give correct response controlling prompt time delay prompt procedures different slp mtl procedures instead removing prompts progressing hierarchy prompts removed delaying time progressive time delay procedure developed constant time delay procedure developed parsimonious procedure teaching students ctd ptd systematic procedures use teaching strategy waiting learners response likely used haphazardly using time delay procedures prompt initially given immediately desired discriminative stimulus example immediately teacher says showing picture dog gives student correct answer dog prespecified number trials teaching discrete tasks usually session comprising least trials prompt delayed previous example teacher would ask question would wait seconds giving controlling prompt dog ptd delays prompt time gradually teacher would first wait second seconds etc ctd delays prompt time usually seconds initial sessions learner given opportunity respond independently prompt given immediately delay however subsequent sessions learner given opportunity respond independently prompt delayed time learner accesses reinforcement quickly answers independently still reinforced prompted responses ptd ctd similar except delay gradual ptd immediate ctd students able wait prompt unable independently perform skill ptd may better choice prompting strategy decrease example delay session ptd ctd ctd ptd extensively used found effective variety students without disabilities across discrete chained skills individual small group settings learners toddlers adults like slp ctd used conjunction new technologies like smart boards teach children modification time delay procedures presented schuster colleagues procedure prompt given every session controlling prompt similar ctd ptd however prompt delayed time every instructional session prompt immediately given student stimulus presented see second delay sessions learner chance emit unprompted response sessions however immediately session probe session conducted test whether child emit unprompted correct response using example similar one teacher might present picture ask immediately give prompt dog instructional sessions day prior instructional sessions teacher would ask provide prompts probe session done test whether student acquired material instruction ends learner reaches criterion level eg correct consecutive days probe sessions primary advantage simultaneous prompting compared time delay procedures learner need prerequisite skill waiting prompt independently emit behavior also less complicated procedure teachers use fewer response variations eg unprompted corrects unprompted incorrects possible fewer prompt variations eg need vary prompt intrusiveness delay simultaneous prompting used learners three years age adulthood learners learning disabilities intellectual disabilities developmental delays learners without recent study suggests may necessary conduct probes every research needed determine frequency probe sessions affects efficiency procedure discussed response prompting procedures considered evidence based practices using criteria suggested horner colleagues studies shown response prompting effective learners preschool adulthood variety instructional contexts eg embedded large group activities small group direct instruction addition studies shown variety instructional agents including teachers assistants peers without disabilities accurately use prompting procedures little known use prompting procedures procedural fidelity low may typical instructional contexts though errors steps procedure may impede additional studies regarding typical errors made instructors effects errors acquisition skills learners needed addition prompting procedures primarily used teach specific responses rather response classes eg conversational skills social play skills relative effectiveness response prompting procedures teach
