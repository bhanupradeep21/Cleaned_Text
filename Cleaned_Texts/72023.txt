parabolic microphone microphone uses parabolic reflector collect focus sound waves onto transducer much way parabolic antenna eg satellite dish radio waves though lack high fidelity parabolic microphones great sensitivity sounds coming one direction along axis dish pick distant sounds parabolic microphones generally used high fidelity applications dishes small enough portable poor lowfrequency response rayleigh criterion parabolic dishes focus waves wavelength much smaller diameter aperture wavelength sound waves low end human hearing hz metres ft focusing would require dish much larger typical parabolic microphone dish diameter one metre little directivity sound waves longer cm corresponding frequencies khz higher frequencies gain db expected wavelength sound becomes comparable diameter parabolic dish response falls shotgun microphone phased array microphones may used alternative applications requiring directional selectivity high fidelity typical uses microphone include nature sound recording recording bird calls field audio sports broadcasting eavesdropping conversations example espionage law enforcement parabolic microphones used many parts world early world war ii especially japanese parabolic microphones also used search rescue teams locate lost people wilderness environments application supported study comparing parabolic microphones unaided hearing detecting comprehending calling subjects distances httpsenwikipediaorgwikiparabolicmicrophone
