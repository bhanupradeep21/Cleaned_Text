factitious airs term used synthetic gases emerged around robert boyle coined term upon isolating understood factitious means artificial term means manmade gases robert boyle coined term factitious air upon isolating hydrogen henry cavendish used term factitious air refer kind air contained bodies unelastic state produced thence archaic definition production factitious air defined caused flow degrees putrefactions fermentations kinds expeditiously sorts chymical dissolutions bodies lastly almost instantaneously explosion gunpowder mixture kinds bodies thus paste dough leaven placed exhausted receiver time fermentation produce considerable quantity air appear plainly sinking quicksilver gage thus also animal vegetable substance putrifying vacuo produce significant inconsistencies archaic nomenclature due limited knowledge chemistry primitive analytical technology era ie based chemistry clear terms mistakenly assigned one gas different investigators furthermore cases gases pure names used factitious airs may includedcitation needed fixed air fixible air ancient term carbon joseph priestley credited joseph black discovering coining fixed air thought exist fixed state alkaline salts chalk calcareous substances black considered substances containing fixed air mild upon expulsion gas heating resulting state caustic corroding burning plants animals eg released chalk upon decomposition calcium oxide words fixed air also known fixible air thought fixated within corrosive molecule priestley likewise credited discovery fixed air contributions several scientists including david macbride john pringle william brownrigg regarded carbonated water acidulous taste stephen hales many henry cavendish provided definition fixed air mean particular species factitious air separated alkaline substances solution acids cavendish essentially defined potassium oxide calcium oxide base contain fixated air within composition setting stage historical definition carbonate according claude louis berthollet long called fixed fixible air really acid state gas late received several new denominations called aerial acid existing readily state air properly gas plentifully atmosphere chalky acid procurable large quantities chalk mild calcareous substances name given essay derived knowledge composition lately ascertained french chemists consist elementary part charcoal named charbone char united oxygen acidifying principle hence called strict propriety carbonic acid general carbonic acid gas aerial form carbonic acid liquor combined dissolved french chemists berthollet generally referring laviosiers oxidation name oxygen derived greek oxy meaning acid gene mean formingexpression therefore carbonic acid simply union carbon oxygen laviosiers original degrees oxidation could fit concept carbon monoxide based diamond graphite coal carbonic carbonate defined compound formed union carbonic acid earth alkali metallic oxide distinguished property effervescing addition definition expands upon fixed air fixated within carbonate suggest carbonic acid constituent carbonate therefore ancient language suffix ic acid ate interchangeable modern definition similar although equipped molecular knowledge carbonates structure reassignment meaning carbonic acid molecule carbonates salts carbonic acids form positively charged metal ion comes contact oxygen atoms carbonate bicarbonate originally known bicarbonate potash coined william hyde wollaston based hydrocarbonates potential release two molar equivalents carbon dioxide referred carbonic acid time released potassium hydrocarbonate initially known carbonate potash suggested become bicarbonate potassium carbonate vaguely known subcarbonate suggested become carbonate upon formation potash potassium bicarbonates historically defined combinations bases carbonic acid two atoms latter united one words potash potassium oxide wellunderstood caustic base essentially core molecule subsequent chemical nomenclature built upon carbonate potash potassium carbonate must contain carbonic acid species fixated within potashs alternative composition see fixed air since bicarbonate potash liberates double dose carbonic acid distinguish similar substances prefix bi indicates bicarbonate potash potassium hydrocarbonate contains twice much fixated form potashs composition relative carbonate potash ancient logic prior understanding molecular formulas reaction stoichiometry applied soda carbonate soda bicarbonate soda word saleratus latin sal Ã¦ratus meaning aerated salt widely used beginning carbonic acid gas ancient term specify gaseous state carbonic acid synonymous carbonic acid listed alternative name carbon dioxide externally applied carbonic acid gas epidermis reported treat breast cancer inhalation treated tuberculosis hydrogen initially thought toxic based experiments lavoisier however purity hydrogen taken question later experiments discovered hydrogen effectively treat measles blood understood absorb deliver oxygen since study airs interfaced phlogiston theory therapeutic potential factitious airs widely investigated significant

pneumatic played pivotal role advancing study factitious airs partnering thomas beddoes establish pneumatic tuberculosis primary disease physicians attempted treat factitious airs particularly since james watts daughter died john carmichael reported successfully treating patient suffering tuberculosis using application factitious air pioneering research relevant modern era carbon monoxide
