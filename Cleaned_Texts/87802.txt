ethylene iupac name ethene hydrocarbon formula colourless flammable gas faint sweet musky odour simplest alkene hydrocarbon double bonds ethylene widely used chemical industry worldwide production million tonnes exceeds organic much production goes toward creating polyethylene widely used plastic containing polymer chains ethylene units various chain lengths ethylene also important natural plant hormone used agriculture force ripening hydrate ethylene ethanol hydrocarbon four hydrogen atoms bound pair carbon atoms connected double bond six atoms comprise ethylene coplanar hch angle close ideal hybridized carbon molecule also relatively weak rotation cc bond low energy process requires breaking πbond supplying heat needed πbond ethylene molecule responsible useful reactivity double bond region high electron density thus susceptible attack electrophiles many reactions ethylene catalyzed transition metals bind transiently ethylene using π π orbitalscitation needed simple molecule ethylene spectroscopically simple uvvis spectrum still used test theoretical major industrial reactions ethylene include order scale polymerization oxidation halogenation hydrohalogenation alkylation hydration oligomerization hydroformylation united states europe approximately ethylene used produce ethylene oxide ethylene dichloride ethylbenzene reactions ethylene electrophilic additioncitation needed polyethylene consumes half worlds ethylene supply polyethylene also called polyethene polythene worlds widely used plastic primarily used make films packaging carrier bags trash liners linear alphaolefins produced oligomerization formation short polymers used precursors detergents plasticisers synthetic lubricants additives also comonomers production ethylene oxidized produce ethylene oxide key raw material production surfactants detergents ethoxylation ethylene oxide also hydrolyzed produce ethylene glycol widely used automotive antifreeze well higher molecular weight glycols glycol ethers polyethylene ethylene undergoes oxidation palladium give acetaldehyde conversion remains major industrial process process proceeds via initial complexation ethylene pdii

major nonfermentative precursor ethanol original method entailed conversion diethyl sulfate followed hydrolysis main method practiced since direct hydration ethylene catalyzed solid acid ethylene dimerized hydrovinylation give nbutenes using processes licensed lummus ifp lummus process produces mixed nbutenes primarily ifp process produces used comonomer production certain kinds ethylene hormone affects ripening flowering many plants widely used control freshness horticulture scrubbing naturally occurring ethylene delays example niche use anesthetic agent oxygen another use welding also used refrigerant gas low temperature application name global ethylene production million tonnes million tonnes million tonnes million tonnes ethylene produced least companies countries meet everincreasing demand ethylene sharp increases production facilities added globally particularly mideast production releases significant greenhouse gas ethylene produced several methods petrochemical industry primary method steam cracking sc hydrocarbons steam heated process converts large hydrocarbons smaller ones introduces unsaturation ethane feedstock ethylene product ethylene separated resulting mixture repeated compression europe asia ethylene obtained mainly cracking naphtha gasoil condensates coproduction propylene olefins aromatics pyrolysis technologies employed production ethylene include oxidative coupling methane fischertropsch synthesis methanoltoolefins mto catalytic although great value industrially ethylene rarely synthesized laboratory ordinarily produced via dehydration ethanol sulfuric acid gas phase aluminium oxide activated ethylene produced methionine nature immediate precursor ethylene fundamental ligand transition metal alkene complexes one first organometallic compounds zeises salt complex ethylene useful reagents containing ethylene include rhcatalysed hydroformylation ethylene conducted industrial scale provide geologists scholars believe famous greek oracle delphi pythia went trancelike state effect ethylene rising ground ethylene appears discovered johann joachim becher obtained heating ethanol sulfuric mentioned gas physica subterranea joseph priestley also mentions gas experiments observations relating various branches natural philosophy continuation observations air reports jan ingenhousz saw ethylene synthesized way mr enée amsterdam ingenhousz subsequently produced gas properties ethylene studied four dutch chemists johann rudolph deimann adrien paets van troostwyck anthoni lauwerenburgh nicolas bondt found differed hydrogen gas contained carbon group also discovered ethylene could combined chlorine produce oil dutch chemists discovery gave ethylene name used time olefiant gas oilmaking term olefiant gas turn etymological origin modern word olefin class hydrocarbons ethylene first membercitation needed century suffix ene ancient greek root added end female names meaning daughter widely used refer molecule part thereof contained one fewer hydrogen atoms molecule modified thus ethylene daughter ethyl name ethylene used sense early german chemist august wilhelm von hofmann proposed system hydrocarbon nomenclature suffixes ane ene ine one une used denote hydrocarbons fewer hydrogens parent system ethylene became ethene hofmanns system eventually became basis geneva nomenclature approved international congress chemists remains core iupac nomenclature however time name ethylene deeply entrenched remains wide use today especially chemical industry following experimentation luckhardt crocker carter university ethylene used remained use use even chloroform phased pungent odor explosive nature limit use iupac nomenclature rules made exception retaining nonsystematic name however decision reversed remains unchanged newest iupac name ethene iupac system name ethylene reserved divalent group hence names like ethylene oxide ethylene dibromide permitted use name ethylene twocarbon alkene nevertheless use name ethylene propylene still prevalent among chemists north like hydrocarbons ethylene combustible asphyxiant listed iarc class carcinogen since current evidence causes cancer
