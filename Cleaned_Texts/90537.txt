paranthodon pəˈrænθədɒn genus stegosaurian dinosaur lived south africa early cretaceous million years ago discovered one first stegosaurians found remains partial skull isolated teeth fragments vertebrae found kirkwood formation british paleontologist richard owen initially identified fragments pareiasaur anthodon remaining untouched years british museum natural history partial skull identified south african paleontologist robert broom belonging different genus named specimen palaeoscincus africanus several years later hungarian paleontologist franz nopcsa unaware brooms new name similarly concluded represented new taxon named paranthodon owenii since nopcsas species name assigned brooms broom assign new genus names synonyms current binomial paranthodon africanus genus name combines ancient greek para near genus name anthodon represent initial referral remains identifying remains palaeoscincus broom initially classified paranthodon ankylosaurian statement backed research coombs nopcsa identified taxon stegosaurid modern studies agree genus reviewed modern taxonomic techniques found valid genus stegosaurid review paranthodon could identify one distinguishing feature study still referred stegosauria based similarity multiple phylogenetic analyses diagnostic features group could identified paranthodon amateur geologists william guybon atherstone andrew geddes bain discovered several fossils near dassieklip cape province bushmans river first dinosaur find africa southern bain sent fossils palaeontologist richard owen identification among upper jaw bain referred

stegosauridae based bmnh richard lydekker found although anthodon pareiasaur teeth similar lydekker also corrected mistake owen incorrectly summarised material coming single locality whereas separate material two clearly distinct robert broom visited collection british museum natural history concluded owen mixed partial distorted skull teeth mandible pareiasaur partial upper jaw dinosaur bmnh two different broom kept name anthodon pareiasaur identified fossil member genus palaeoscincus naming new species palaeoscincus africanus found anatomy teeth quite different even though resembled well franz nopcsa unaware brooms previous publication provided second novel name watson believed jaw differentiated nopcsa named species paranthodon owenii generic name derived latin para meaning similar near beside anthodon specific name honouring following modern conventions specific name later emended names brought current nomenclature walter p coombs dissertation new combination paranthodon africanus name paranthodon first new generic name fossils africanus first new specific makes paranthodon africanus proper name taxon previously known palaeoscincus africanus paranthodon holotype paranthodon bmnh found layer kirkwood formation dated berriasian early valanginian ages consists back snout containing maxilla teeth posterior caudodorsal ramus premaxilla part nasals isolated teeth probably lower jaw one additional specimen assigned based dentition bmnh nhmuk including isolated teeth sharing morphology bones unidentified galton coombs described fragment vertebra raven teeth bear autapomorphies paranthodon referred indeterminate stegosaurid teeth identified also lacking distinct stegosaurian features thus designated thyreophora mugher mudstone ethiopia screened university california museum paleontology discovered multiple dinosaur teeth pertaining many groups taxa locality described largest complete record dinosaur fossils late jurassic african locality outside tendaguru two partial teeth discovered referred paranthodon lee hall mark goodwin reasons referral paranthodon paranthodon small relative larger stegosaurids stegosaurus thomas r holtz jr estimated animal ft long weighed kg snout elongated though extremely convex top back premaxilla long broad external nares large teeth prominent primary ridge fossilised nasal maxillary bones relatively complete incomplete premaxilla also preserved partial snout resembles stegosaurus large posterior premaxillary process extension palate stegosaurus stegosaurid known adequate cranial material compare paranthodon review taxon even though resemblance great tooth morphology distinguishing among stegosaurians example cranial material known stegosaurus paranthodon kentrosaurus tuojiangosaurus tooth morphology differs premaxilla paranthodon incomplete anterior process sinuous curves ventrally similar miragaia huayangosaurus ankylosaur silvisaurus heterodontosaurus unlike chungkingosaurus stegosaurus edmontonia lesothosaurus premaxilla also lacks teeth like every stegosaur except huayangosaurus premaxilla preserved like huayangosaurus stegosaurus hesperosaurus nasal fenestra faces anterolaterally visible front sides naris longer wide like stegosaurs also smooth internal surface likely simple maxilla roughly triangular thyreophorans tooth row horizontal lateral view ventral view sinuous stegosaurus huayangosaurus possess straight tooth row ventral view although scelidosaurus jiangjunosaurus maxilla paranthodon preserves tooth row shows little overhang differs ankylosaurians large overhang stegosaurus silvisaurus diastema gap tooth row maxilla front tooth row posterior maxilla incomplete information known jugal lacrimal paranthodon elongate dorsally convex nasal like stegosaurs thickened ridges along sides nasals preserved portion nasal contact premaxilla thirteen teeth preserved paranthodon extend back maxilla possibly life teeth symmetrical stegosaurs except chungkingosaurus along base tooth crown swelling cingulum seen known stegosaurid teeth except teeth middle ridge five fewer prominent ridges either side similar size ridges seen like stegosaurians denticles teeth rounded tips contrast ankylosaurians also like huayangosaurus unlike kentrosaurus stegosaurus paranthodon possesses prominent buccal margination ridge beside tooth row paranthodon teeth preserve wear wear absent teeth similar huayangosaurus meaning likely paranthodon lacked occlusion two fragments vertebra known anatomical details observed right transverse process prezygapophysis preserved vertebra possibly middle dorsal based angle transverse process orientation prezygapophysis similar stegosaurus chungkingosaurus middorsals transverse process angled dorsally unlike stegosaurs except stegosaurus prezygapophysis faces currently paranthodon classified stegosaur related stegosaurus tuojiangosaurus loricatosaurus initially broom assigned name palaeoscincus africanus paranthodon fossils classified ankylosaurian classification later changed nopcsa found paranthodon best resembled stegosaurid group truly coombs follow nopcsas classification keeping paranthodon ankylosaurian like broom although classified ankylosauria incertae subsequent review galton coombs instead confirmed nopcsas interpretation redescribing paranthodon stegosaurid lower paranthodon distinguished stegosaurs long wide posterior process premaxilla teeth maxilla large cingulum large ridges tooth features considered valid review stegosauria autapomorphy found possession partial second bony palate multiple phylogenetic analyses placed paranthodon stegosauria often stegosauridae analysis including nearly species stegosaurians found paranthodon outside stegosauridae polytomy tuojiangosaurus huayangosaurus chungkingosaurus jiangjunosaurus gigantspinosaurus latter two genera removed paranthodon grouped tuojiangosaurus outside stegosauridae huayangosaurus grouped chungkingosaurus elaboration upon analysis published susannah maidment thomas raven resolved relationships within stegosauria much taxa remained included paranthodon grouped tuojiangosaurus huayangosaurus chunkingosaurus basal true stegosaurians position alcovasaurus uncertain work could change result lesothosaurus diagnosticus laquintasaura venezuelae scutellosaurus lawleri emausaurus
