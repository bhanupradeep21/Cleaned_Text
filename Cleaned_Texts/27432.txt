habits avitomyrmex species may similar extant myrmeciinae ants ants may nested soil trees possibly arboreal nesting genus may case one myrmecia species known inhabit trees exclusively workers likely preyed arthropods killing sting fed nectar workers would found foraging onto trees low vegetation without leaving pheromone trails food sources recruit nestmates solitary foragers avitomyrmex ants
