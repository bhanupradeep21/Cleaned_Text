discovery hmgcoa reductase inhibitors called statins breakthrough prevention hypercholesterolemia related diseases hypercholesterolemia considered one major risk factors atherosclerosis often leads cardiovascular cerebrovascular peripheral vascular statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis body leads reduction blood cholesterol levels thought reduce risk atherosclerosis diseases caused century german pathologist named rudolf virchow discovered cholesterol found artery walls people died occlusive vascular diseases like myocardial infarction cholesterol found responsible thickening arterial walls thus decreasing radius arteries leads cases hypertension increased risk occlusive vascular framingham heart study led dawber revealed correlation high blood cholesterol levels coronary heart diseases following study researchers explored novel way lower blood cholesterol levels without modifying diet lifestyle subjects suffering elevated blood cholesterol levels primary goal inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis body hence hmgcoa reductase hmgr became natural target hmgr found ratelimiting enzyme cholesterol biosynthetic pathway buildup potentially toxic precursors hmgr inhibited hydroxymethylglutarate watersoluble alternative metabolic pathways japanese microbiologist akira endo first discovered natural products powerful inhibitory effect hmgr fermentation broth penicillium citrinum search antimicrobial agents first product named compactin mevastatin animal trials showed good inhibitory effect clinical trials however long term toxicity study dogs resulted toxic effects higher doses result believed toxic given humans alfred alberts colleagues merck research laboratories discovered new natural product fermentation broth aspergillus terreus product showed good hmgr inhibition named product mevinolin later became known cholesterol controversy began early promotion statins competitive antagonists hmg coa directly compete endogenous substrate active site cavity hmgr statins also noncompetitive cosubstrate nadph nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide blocking hmgr enzyme inhibit synthesis cholesterol via mevalonate pathway end result lower ldl low density
