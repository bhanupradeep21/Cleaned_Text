aspergillus genus consists common molds found throughout environment within soil water vegetation fecal matter decomposing matter suspended species within genus often grow quickly sporulate within days combination characteristics unique niger makes microbe invaluable production many acids proteins bioactive compounds characteristics including extensive metabolic diversity high production yield secretion capability ability conduct posttranslational modifications responsible nigers robust production secondary nigers capability withstand extremely acidic conditions makes especially important industrial production citric niger causes disease known black mold certain fruits vegetables grapes apricots onions peanuts common contaminant food ubiquitous soil commonly found indoor environments black colonies confused stachybotrys species also called black niger classified generally recognized safe gras us food drug administration use food although microbe capable producing toxins affect human aspergillus niger included aspergillus subgenus circumdati section nigri section nigri includes related blackspored species may confused niger including tubingensis foetidus carbonarius number morphologically similar species described samson et strain atcc aspergillus niger reclassified aspergillus brasiliensis refer publication varga et required update us pharmacopoeia european pharmacopoeia commonly use strain throughout pharmaceutical industrycitation needed niger strict aerobe therefore requires oxygen fungus grow range environmental conditions grow temperatures ranging optimal temperature range tolerate ph ranging niger xerophilic meaning grow reproduce environments little water also grow humid conditions even tolerating environments relative fungus commonly grown potato dextrose agar pda grow many different types growth media including czapekdox agar lignocellulose agar several otherscitation needed aspergillus niger genome consisting roughly megabases mb organized eight dna contains genes transcribed translated two strains niger sequenced strain cbs produces enzymes used industrial applications strain atcc wildtype strain atcc used produce industrial citric acid niger atcc genome sequenced joint genome institute collaboration completed sequences used uncover orthologous genes pathways involved fungal metabolism specifically catabolism ability niger change metabolism depending carbon sources nutrients present environment enabled microorganism survive found almost ecosystems research done study mechanisms fungi using complete sequenced genome two ways aspergillus niger grown industrial purposes solid state fermentation ssf submerged fermentation ssf uses solid substrate nutrients minimal moisture grow microorganisms nutrients nitrogen carbon come agricultural byproducts wheat bran sugar pulp rice husks corn ssf gives better yield microbe products cost effective smf due using agricultural ssf predominantly used smf microbes grown liquid medium inside large aseptic fermentation vessels expensive pieces equipment provide water growth allow tight control environmental factors temperature ph affects microbial aspergillus niger cultured facilitate industrial production many various strains niger used industrial preparation citric acid gluconic acid therefore deemed acceptable daily intake world health niger fermentation generally recognized safe gras united states food drug administration federal food drug cosmetic niger also considered potential new source natural food grade production citric acid ca achieved growing strains niger nutrient rich medium includes high concentrations sugar mineral salts acidic ph many microorganisms produce ca aspergillus niger produces million metric tons ca annually via fungal fermentation ca high demand applications control microorganism growth food beverage flavor enhancement acidity manipulation pharmaceuticals niger produces many useful enzymes catabolism biopolymers order obtain nutrients production specific enzymes increased industrial example niger glucoamylase used production highfructose corn syrup pectinases used cider wine clarification alphagalactosidase enzyme breaks certain complex sugars component beano several products decrease another use niger within biotechnology industry production magnetic isotopecontaining variants biological macromolecules nmr aspergillus niger also cultured extraction enzyme glucose oxidase used design glucose biosensors due high affinity food industry niger also cultured isolate enzyme fructosyltransferase produce fructooligosaccharides fos used manufacture lowcalorie functional foods due fos characteristic ability slow growth pathogenic microorganisms foods prebiotic fiber among health promoting properties niger organism produce enzyme fructosyltransferase found produce enzyme rates conducive industrial specific use niger within food industry capability produce enzymes like carbohydrase cellulase commonly used seafood industry removing bellies clams processing removing tough external skin shrimp edible internal aspergillus niger grow goldmining solutions containing cyanometal complexes gold silver copper iron zinc fungus also plays role solubilization heavymetal niger also shown remediate acid mine drainage biosorption copper niger produces wide variety secondary mycotoxins called ochratoxin contamination filamentous fungi niger occurs frequently grapes grape based products resulting contamination ochratoxin ota ota clinically relevant mycotoxin accumulate human tissue cause variety serious health potential consequences ota poisoning include kidney damage kidney failure cancer united states food drug administration fda set maximum permissible levels ota food unlike eu set maximum permissible levels variety food aspergillus niger cause black mold infections certain legumes fruits vegetables peanuts grapes onions leading fungus common food contaminant filamentous ascomycete tolerance changes ph humidity heat thriving temperature range characteristics make infections niger common cause postharvest decay fruits vegetables lead significant economic loss food niger infection plants cause reduction seed germination seedling emergence root elongation shoot elongation causing plant perish specifically aspergillus niger causes sooty mold onions ornamental plantscitation needed niger pathogenic aspergillosis fungal infection caused spores indoor outdoor aspergillus mold due ubiquitous nature niger spores commonly inhaled humans surrounding aspergillosis infection customarily occurs people compromised immune systems preexisting lung conditions like asthma cystic types aspergillosis include allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis abpa allergic aspergillus sinusitis azoleresistant aspergillus fumigatus cutaneous skin aspergillosis chronic pulmonary approximated species aspergillus molds roughly species found cause health concern immunocompromised aspergillosis particularly frequent among horticultural workers often inhale peat dust rich aspergillus niger spores fungus also found ancient egyptian mummies inhaled otomycosis superficial fungal infection ear canal another disorder caused overgrowth aspergillus molds like otomycosis caused niger frequently associated mechanical damage ear canals external skin
