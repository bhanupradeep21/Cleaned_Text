conchologist gene rosenberg spoke favourably changes made since world size records namely lowering minimum size inclusion listing sizes millimetres ordering species alphabetically within families irrespective genus adding reference field identification purposes also welcomed inclusion separate entries infraspecific taxa subspecies varieties forms noting might someday prove full species maximum sizes might provide evidence rosenberg identified minor inconsistency grouping cephalopods argonautidae nautilidae scaphopods dentaliidae gastropods listing bivalves separately opining single alphabetic sequence would rosenberg also found unusual number typographical errors attributed rush work ready coa convention issues identified rosenberg included listing synonyms eg oliva sericea
