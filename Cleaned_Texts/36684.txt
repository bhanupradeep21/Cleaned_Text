electroneuronography electroneurography enog neurological noninvasive test used study facial nerve cases muscle weakness one side face bells palsy technique electroneuronography first used esslen fisch describe technique examines integrity conductivity peripheral nerves modern use enog used describe study facial nerve term nerve conduction study employed nerves consists brief electrical stimulation nerve one point underneath skin time recording electrical activity compound action potentials another point nerves trajectory body response displayed cathode ray tube crt video monitor computer stimulation well recording carried disc electrodes taped skin technician may use electrically conducting gel paste bolster signals input output alternatively recording electrodes may also used pick electrical activity muscle innervated nerve instances electroneuronography closely related electromyography performed audiologist carries tests compare two sides face stimulation electrode located stylomastoid foramen recording electrode located near nasolabial fold enog test objective measure facial nerve integrity human body twelve pairs cranial nerves electroneuronography typically concerned amount degradation facial nerves consists thousands fibers motor sensory fibers typically found ratio proposed half motor units need functional normal nerve conduction take place facial nerves originate brainstem cross auditory canal exit skull stylomastoid foramen terminate face main branches side face control muscle contractions facial expressionscitation needed facial nerve paralysis impact several aspects persons life ranging emotional psychological effects actual physical limitations people affected conditions often difficulty speaking drinking eating showing simplest facial expressions combine limit socialization active involvement public domain proper assessment facial nerve integrity therefore vital detection treatment disorders electroneuronography used basis physicians course action managing disease doctor may opt continued observation patient following initial testing may recommend surgery deal damagecitation needed facial nerve disorders may stem myriad contributing factors bells palsy injury resulting surgical error trauma temporal bone otitis media multiple sclerosis mumps chicken pox conditionscitation needed electroneuronography tests performed audiologists typically system calculates difference compound muscle action potentials generated near nose nasolabial fold response supramaximal electrical stimulation near ear stylomastoid foramen thus electrical stimulus travels along facial nerve allowing specifically pinpointed increasing sensitivity specificity recordings constant goal believed variability arises location pressure electrodes stimulating current skin resistance esslen fisch placed electrodes nasolabial fold become standard may hughes experimented electrodes placed nasal ala citing better waveforms two positions compared respect supramaximal threshold waveform shapeamplitude repeatability regard supramaximal threshold nasal alae demonstrated superior biphasic waveform requiring less input stimulation yield adequate results categories however statistical difference taking measurements nasolabial fold compared nasal alaecitation needed common general feeling discomfort accompany electrical stimulation

foramen recording electrodes attached terminal ends nerve near nose ground electrode placed center patients forehead sufficiently far facial nerve give output reading variety stimulation locations may also employed get best possible results audiologists aim get efficient readings possible optimizing results minimal input stimulus amount damage calculated ratio much nerve conduction retained affected side compared healthy value massive amounts clinical experience may required accurately interpret data received testing misreading results may put patient serious risk developing damage creating problem otherwise healthy facial nervescitation needed amplitude key component interpretation electroneuronography tests resulting waveforms analyzed reported percentage using following

either method clinically accepted provided terminology consistent interchanged responsive level regarded able spontaneously recover typically require surgical intervention anything beneath threshold usually requires active invasive means correct ensure accurate results consequently appropriate course action readings may need taken every days fairly constant values recorded several alternative procedures exist testing facial nerve integrity electromyography acoustic reflex testing formerly gold standard mri ct scanning transcranial magnetic stimulation blink reflex tests maximalminimal stimulation tests may also used assess viability nerves currently however electroneuronography serves objective test compared options test preferentially performed others housebrackmann hb scale
