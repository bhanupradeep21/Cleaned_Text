chirostenotes leptorhynchos apatoraptor elmisaurus xu team suggested gigantoraptor might partially naked times heavy feathered species like caudipteryx large animals tend rely body mass temperature regulation leading loss insulating coverings found smaller relatives however suggested least arm feathers probably still present gigantoraptor since primary functions display behaviour covering eggs brooding related regulation body histological analysis performed holotype fibula xu colleagues showed specimen lines arrested growth lags growth rings preserved several lags missing team used inverse calculations determine resulting total amount lags indicate holotype around years old time death average growth kg lb per year performed histology also suggests individual adult extensive development secondary osteons tightly packed lags close periphery bone poorly vascularized layer lamellar bone outer circumferential layer indicates relatively sloppy growth rate however given fourth seventh sets lags tightly packed xu colleagues inferred individual reached young adulthood age moreover specimen found still relatively young adult thereby would grown larger reached adult stage indicates gigantoraptor growth rate much faster large nonavian theropods another unusual development gigantoraptor elongated hindlimbs xu colleagues pointed larger theropod becomes shorter stockier legs become order withstand increasing mass contrasted gigantoraptor femur tibia ft combination usually found theropods size elongation limbs indicates one animal adapted run maintain certain speed large amount theropods furthermore gigantoraptor extensively pneumatized vertebral column may aided waisum colleagues reexamined preserved jaws gigantoraptor found deepest beak among caenagnathids relatively different diet oviraptorosaurs instance articular region jaws gigantoraptor show convergence modern tuatara articular region reptile enables propalinal jaw movement forward backward movement feeding based similarities jaws colleagues suggested gigantoraptor could employed propalinal jaw movement well movement aided sharp shelves dentary may indicate shearing bite capable cutting plants potentially meat comparable caenagnathids contrasting jaws oviraptorids whose jaws seem better suited crushing food depth lower jaw indicates presence large tongue could assisted animal food proccesing possibly improving feeding shape size rostrum large herbivores related dietary habits strongly ushaped dentary gigantoraptor may suggest oviraptorosaur highly nonselective feeder adaptation could useful variable environmental settings iren dabasu formation team based hypothesis comparisons several herbivorous animals including dinosaurs whereas sharply developed narrow rostra correlated selective diet case ceratopsians wide rounded rostra linked generalist diet seen morphology gigantoraptor euoplocephalus hadrosaurids colleagues also pointed large size therefore greater energy requirements could influenced dietary habits larger animals tend consume lower quality food since available larger amounts surroundings stable supply however known whether gut gigantoraptor specialized process greater ingestion team could disregard occasional carnivorous diet strong beak together propalinal jaw movement may allowed meat existence giant oviraptorosaurians gigantoraptor explains several earlier asian finds large cm long oviraptorosaurian eggs assigned oospecies macroelongatoolithus carlylensis laid enormous rings diameter three metres presence macroelongatoolithus north america indicates gigantic oviraptorosaurs present well though fossil skeletal remains description naming embryonic individual associated supports macroelongatoolithus eggs nests belong colossal caenagnathid oviraptorosaurs kohei tanaka team examined egg clutches numerous oviraptorosaur specimens including egg clutches macroelongatoolithus order correlate nest configuration body size incubation behaviour results showed eggshell porosity indicates eggs almost certainly oviraptorosaurs exposed nest without external covering though oviraptorosaur nests eggs arranged circular fashion morphology nest different smaller larger species center nest highly reduced former species becomes significantly larger latter species nest configuration suggest whereas smallest oviraptorosaurs probably sat directly eggs large gigantoraptorsized animal likely sat area devoid eggs tanaka colleagues pointed adaption beneficial avoid eggcrushing could allowed bodycontact incubation giant
