syndrome rts rare genetic condition characterized short stature moderate severe learning difficulties distinctive facial features broad thumbs first features disorder vary among affected individuals characteristics caused mutation deletion crebbp gene located chromosome andor gene located chromosome people condition increased risk developing noncancerous cancerous tumors leukemia lymphoma condition sometimes inherited autosomal dominant pattern uncommon many times occurs de novo inherited occurrence occurs estimated births syndrome presents birth usually hallmarked delayed physical cognitive growthcitation needed typical features disorder include study found children rts likely overweight short attention span motor stereotypies poor coordination study hypothesized identified crebbp gene impaired motor skills research shown link longterm memory ltm diagnosed heterozygous pathogenic variant crebbp gene identified individual exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance pattern documented cases show heterozygous individuals exhibiting germline mosaicism condition affects men women equally often misdiagnosed diseases disabilities result delayed mental developmentcitation needed syndrome many cases microdeletion syndrome involving chromosomal segment characterized mutations crebbp varying amounts material deleted section chromosome account spectrum physiological crebbp gene makes protein helps control activity many genes protein called crebbinding protein plays important role regulating cell growth division essential normal fetal development one copy crebbp gene deleted mutated cells make half normal amount creb binding protein reduction amount protein disrupts normal development birth leading signs symptoms mutations gene located chromosome responsible small percentage cases mutations result loss one copy gene cell reduces amount protein half mutations lead production short nonfunctional version protein others prevent one copy gene making protein although researchers know reduction amount protein leads specific features syndrome clear loss one copy gene disrupts normal developmentcitation needed crebbp respective protein products paralogous genes crebbp related proteins prototypical members coactivator family bromodomain histone acetyltransferase domain able bind various genespecific transcription factors well general transcription cell lines derived rts patients exhibit diminished acetylation multiple histone proteins particularly histone histone suggesting disease origins problems regulatory mechanisms functions crebbp broadly overlap effects gene proteins may also facilitate transcriptional mouse model identified order perform experimental research procedures model exhibited clinical symptoms seen humans become foundation future unfortunately approximately one third cases neither gene crebbp implicated cause existing treatment reverses cures rts however ways manage reduce symptoms patients patients rts suffer diverse breadth symptoms include cognitivedevelopmental impairment heart abnormalities delayed bone growth skeletal abnormalities auditory impairment urinary tract abnormalities including kidney problems dental speech problems every patient suffer multiple symptoms every patient experience symptoms meaning differ patient patient due wide range symptoms rts patients referred specialists focus specific symptom specialist rts example patients go orthopedic surgeon physical therapy skeletal growth abnormalities like scoliosis go cardiologist suffer heart abnormalities dentist suffer dental abnormalities individuals suffering cognitive developments usually part special education programs speech therapy specialists individuals go match symptoms individuals regular checkups monitoring needed cardiac dental auditory renal abnormalities genetic counseling also recommended affected individuals syndrome first unofficially mentioned french orthopedic medical journal greek physicians doctors michail matsoukas theodorou medical journal reported case concerning sevenyearold boy radically deviatedarched thumbs long nose muscular hypotonia along physical mental underdevelopment point time case study mentioned greek physicians considered anomaly due fact hadnt reported cases children specific physical mental characteristics doctors accredited discovering syndrome therefore bear namesake unaware journal time discovery however acknowledged case reported french journal orthopedic medicine likely first reported case rtscitation needed dr jack herbert rubinstein american pediatrician reported assessing threeyearold girl unusual facial digital findings similarly year rubinstein evaluated another child similar characteristics time sevenyearold boy sensed striking similarity two unrelated cases rubinstein tried distributing photos information concerning two cases clinics us rubinstein graduated harvard medical school worked director hamilton county diagnostic clinic mentally retarded worked behavioral developmental pediatrics many years prior discovery new syndromecitation needed dr hooshang taybi iranianamerican pediatric radiologist reported assessed threeyearold boy appeared syndrome described rubinstein summer dr taybi reported evaluated seven children characteristics broad thumbs great toes unusual facial features intellectual disabilities findings went appear american journal diseases children documenting characteristics syndrome dr hooshang taybi graduated tehran university school medicine worked ministry health later career taught practiced pediatric radiology oklahoma indiana identified three new syndromes colleagues among syndromecitation needed first genetic abnormalities act markers rubinsteintaybi syndrome identified abnormalities said affect either
