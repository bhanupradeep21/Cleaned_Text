stands imaging solventcleared organs histological method make biological samples transparent called cleared using series organic solvents matching refractive index ri tissue surrounding medium structures transparent tissues examined fluorescence microscopy without need timeconsuming physical sectioning following reconstruction silico method developed team around ali ert√ºrk hansulrich dodt maxplanckinstitute primarily clearing imaging unsectioned mouse brain spinal cord later method modifications successfully used many fields biological research image investigate whole body structure function mouse stem tumor developmental whole human use organic solvents clearing making transparent tissue first mentioned century ago german anatomist werner exceptions reviewed clearing techniques whole century almost forgotten renaissance came last decade probably thank spread advanced techniques fluorescence microscopy allow optical sectioning specimen confocal multiphoton light sheet actual clearing techniques first used organic solvent mixture benzyl alcohol benzyl benzoate babb authors used solution clear mouse brain mouse embryos whole body main drawback solution bleaching gfp signal insufficient clearing highly myelinated tissue adult therefore many reagents tested aim find gfp compatible sufficient clearing results tetrahydrofuran thf dibenzyl ether dbe chosen best regents based findings protocol published protocol consists three steps biological samples tissues heterogeneous structures consist compounds differ refractive indexes example water ri lipids proteins around result light scattered path tissue leads decrease resolution even disappearance signal samples thicker tens micrometers series steps including dehydration delipidation tissue subsequent incubation imaging medium ri similar imaged structures therefore decrease scattering light leads transparent fixation usually paraformaldehyde eventually labeling dyes samples dehydrated via incubation solutions growing concentration water tetrahydrofurane thf lack reactive alcohol aldehyde ketone groups thf less reactive preserve fluorescence better dehydrating dehydration sample rinsed first dichlormethane dcm finally dibenzyl ether dbe match refractive index tissue surrounding medium leading transparent sample dbe samples stored imaged protocol best suited fixed tissues labeled strong fluorophores ideally transgenic models expressing fluorescent proteins gfp alternatively staining synthetic dyes possible antibody labeling method optimized published name idisco see modifications whole process relatively easy perform require changes given solutions need customized laboratory equipment process clearing subsequent imaging fast hours days depending sample size especially comparison physical sectioning whole organ imaging parts reconstruction subsequent image analysis could easily take several works many types tissues lung spleen lymph nodes mammary gland main drawbacks method partial delipidation tissue clearing discriminating use lipophilic dyes shrinkage tissue partial degradation complete degradation fluorescence long term toxicity used reagents potential damage microscopy objectives leak

sample methanol hydrogen peroxide detergents dimethyl sulfoxide dmso together antibody labeling clearing preprocess overcome two drawbacks antibody labeling large samples first lowering autofluorescence samples enhance signaltonoise ratio second make tissue penetrable antibodies result samples large mouse embryos whole mouse organs successfully dyed fluorescent labeled antibodies thereafter cleared authors udisco ultimate imaging solventcleared organs enhance shrinkage tissue common bystander effect dehydration sample first step clearing used tertbutanol instead thf dehydration also different solution imaging preserve fluorescence better dbe thank shrinkage tissue observe large samples size whole mouse worth mention udisco highlighted media worldwide including
