though virus present genital secretions like hiv predominantly infects viral rna packed icosahedral capsid contained inside protein inner envelope lipid outer envelope host cell origin contains viral transmembrane surface proteins virion spherical shape diameter genetically classified seven subtypes defined unique geographic distribution influenced population migration globally widespread cosmopolitan subtype branches several subgroups transcontinental japanese west african north african senegalese subtypes b e f g localized distinct regions africa subtype c predominant australia believed originated simian tlymphotropic virus type retrovirus prevalent among numerous nonhuman primates intertropical africa theory supported significant genetic diversity subtypes africa potentially arising repeated zoonotic transmissions human interactions endemic nonhuman primates correlation reinforced observation individuals bitten nonhuman primates exhibit strains sequences remarkably homologous found local primate global distribution htlvi highly heterogeneous focal occurrence diverse regions within areas htlvi found occurrence varies considerably endemic clusters often situated near populations lower prevalence pattern might influenced founder effect suggesting prolonged viral transmission within isolated groups theory warrants investigation consistent findings reveal prevalence increases age usually higher adult females males areas broadly regarded endemic regions include japan iran americas caribbean melanesia central west africa australia globally remains lack robust data populous countries like india nigeria north east africa current global prevalence estimates based known endemic regions likely underestimate true global australia htlvi notably high prevalence among aboriginal communities central australia communitybased crosssectional studies central australia report prevalences exceeding representing highest reported prevalence population taiwan iran fujian chinese province near taiwan prevalence infection rate papua new guinea solomon islands vanuatu genotype c predominates europe uncommon although present populations generally people migrated known endemic regions americas found indigenous populations descendants african ancestry thought originated prevalence ranges africa prevalence well known countries citation htlvi infection united states appears half prevalent among iv drug users onetenth prevalent population large hiv infection citation needed although little serologic data exist prevalence infection thought highest among blacks living southeast citation needed prevalence rate found among black intravenous drug users new jersey rate found similar group new citation neededreasonprevalence rate additionally citation references old study discriminate substantially different pathologic transmission characteristics dateoctober also high among inuit northern canada japan northeastern peru pacific coast colombia ecuador caribbeancitation needed three main routes transmission vertical transmission common infected mother transmits virus child citation neededreasonsexual transmission common hence increasing prevalence agedateoctober interestingly risk fetus inside womb minimal given virtual absence viral particles human plasma vertical infection occurs breastfeeding infants breastfed infected mothers infected less children born breastfed infected mothers infected sexual transmission secondmost common whereby individual infects another exchange bodily fluids evidence suggested maletofemale transmission efficient femaletomale transmission example one study japan found transmission rate males females vs less rate females males least common parenteral transmission blood transfusion infection rate estimated one study needle sharing among intravenous drug users proper prophylaxis eg breastfeeding counseling mothers condom use donor blood screening rates transmission effectively importance various routes transmission believed vary geographically research discordant couples showed probability sexual transmission per term viral tropism refers cell types htlvi infects although primarily found cells cell types peripheral blood infected individuals found contain including cells dendritic cells b cells htlvi entry mediated interaction surface unit virion envelope glycoprotein su cellular receptor glucose transporter target also associated adult tcell leukemialymphoma quite well studied japan time infection onset cancer also varies geographically believed sixty years japan less forty years caribbean cancer thought due prooncogenic effect viral rna incorporated host lymphocyte dna chronic stimulation lymphocytes cytokine level may play role development malignancy lymphoma ranges indolent slowly progressive type aggressive nearly uniformly lethal proliferative typecitation needed evidence causative agent cutaneous tcell also associated progressive demyelinating upper motor neuron disease known associated myelopathytropical spastic paraparesis hamtsp characterized sensory motor deficits particularly lower extremities incontinence infected individuals develop hamtsp vary one geographic location signs symptoms htlv myelopathy include neurologic findings may found htlv include associated rheumatoidlike arthropathy although evidence contradictory cases patients negative rheumatoid studies japan demonstrated infection may associated intermediate uveitis onset patients present blurred vision floaters prognosis condition usually resolves within individuals infected risk opportunistic caused virus alterations hosts immune unlike distantly related retrovirus hiv immunostimulating effect actually becomes immunosuppressive virus activates subset thelper cells called cells result proliferation cells overproduction related cytokines mainly ifnγ tnfα feedback mechanisms cytokines cause suppression lymphocytes reduction cytokine production mainly result reduction ability infected host mount adequate immune response invading organisms require predominantly dependent response include parasitic infections production mucosal humoral antibodiescitation needed central australian aboriginal population thought related extremely high rate death sepsis also particularly associated bronchiectasis chronic lung condition predisposing recurrent pneumonia also associated chronic infected dermatitis often superinfected staphylococcus aureus severe form strongyloides stercoralis infection called hyperinfestation may lead death polymicrobial sepsis infection also associated treatment opportunistic infections varies depending type disease ranges careful observation aggressive chemotherapy antiretroviral agentscitation needed adult cell lymphoma common complication htlv infection requires aggressive chemotherapy typically rchop treatments atl htlv infected patients include interferon alpha zidovudine interferon alpha chop arsenic trioxide treatments htlv myelopathy even limited focus mainly symptomatic therapy therapies studied include corticosteroids plasmapheresis cyclophosphamide interferon may produce temporary symptomatic improvement myelopathy valproic acid studied determine might slow progression htlv disease reducing viral load although one human study effective reducing viral load appear clinical benefit recently however study valproic acid combined zidovudine showed major decrease viral load baboons infected important monitor htlv patients opportunistic infections cytomegalovirus histoplasmosis scabies pneumocystis pneumonia staphylococcal infections hiv testing also performed patients may coinfected virusescitation needed allogenic bone marrow transplantation investigated treatment disease varied results one case report describes infected woman developed chronic refractory eczema corneal injury adult cell leukemia subsequently treated allogenic stem cell transplantation complete resolution symptoms one year posttransplant recurrence symptoms furthermore decrease proviral loadcitation needed aggressive sézary disease
