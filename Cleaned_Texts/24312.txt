pusztai affair controversy began protein scientist árpád pusztai went public initial results unpublished research conducting rowett institute aberdeen scotland investigating possible effects genetically modified potatoes upon rats pusztai claimed genetically modified potatoes stunted growth repressed rats immune systems thickening gut mucosa initially supported rowett institute comments british television programme caused storm controversy rowett institute withdrew support pusztai suspended misconduct procedures used seize data ban speaking publicly institute renew annual contract pusztai criticized royal society scientists making announcement experiment complete peerreviewed experiments design methodology analysis data study eventually published lancet five six peer reviewers approved triggering controversy peerreviewed studies published investigating safety genetically modified food using human animal feeding scottish agriculture environment fisheries department commissioned million threeyear research study assess safety genetically engineered desiree red potatoes developed john gatehouse cambridge agricultural genetics later renamed axis genetics recently completed two years field trials rothamsted experimental gna gene galanthus snowdrop plant inserted potato allowing gna lectin protein lectin shown toxic research along lines inserting antifeedantproducing genes performed next years work durhamaxis team university durham gatehouse wife angharad others axis twentyeight studies proposed eight selected peer review biotechnology biological sciences research council eight rowett research institutes proposal chosen combined team academics scottish crop research institute durham university department biology rowett institute assembled coordinated although tested potatoes commercial variety intended human contract signed cambridge agricultural genetics included profitsharing agreement potatoes developed using technology approved released earlier tenday feeding trials gnafed rats pusztai concluded significantly affect growth despite hypertrophy small intestine slight decrease gut enzyme experimental potatoes transformed galanthus nivalis agglutinin gna gene galanthus snowdrop plant allowing gna lectin protein synthesised lectin toxic insects rats fed raw cooked genetically modified potatoes using unmodified desiree red potatoes controls one control group ate unmodified desiree red potato spiked gna snowdrop twelve feeding experiments conducted ten shortterm days two longterm experiment pusztai team said expected differences rats fed modified potatoes rats fed nonmodified potatoes chosen deemed substantially equivalent nongenetically modified desiree red study used two transgenic lines potato gna gene inserted grown conditions nongenetically modified parent according pusztai potatoes substantially equivalent one transgenic lines contained percent less protein starch sugar contents varied percent among three pusztai claimed differences reason enough discontinue experiment showed statistically significant difference thickness stomach mucosa mucosa rats fed raw cooked potato modified gna gene thicker rats fed unmodified crypt length jejunum greater rats fed raw modified potato although statistical difference observed rats fed cooked effects observed rats fed control potatoes spiked gna pusztai concluded differences result transformation procedure rather presence pusztais collaborator stanley ewen said cauliflower mosaic virus used promoter could likely cause observed june pusztai revealed research findings interview granada televisions current affairs programme world titled eat given permission interview rowett institute director philip james rowetts press officer present start filming interview pusztai said concerns testing techniques thought necessary therefore asked felt concerned said done experiments made us feel concerned discussed results general pusztai later said time interview sure reveal results experiments completed think programme would hostile toward genetically modified food estimated experiments percent complete interview said rats experiments suffered stunted growth suppressed immune systems safety research also said gave choice wouldnt eat unfair use fellow citizens guinea world action issued press release day stimulating numerous phone calls pusztai institute government industrial nongovernmental media organisations james says dismayed unpublished data released withdrew pusztai media commitments eventually suspended pusztai used misconduct procedures seize data banned speaking publicly renew annual confusion reigned experiments conducted pusztai mentioned two lines genetically modified potatoes meaning two gna lines reported media rowett institute mistakenly assumed media talking second line transformed concanavalin cona jack bean lectin toxic mammals transgenic cona potatoes developed never two press releases issued rowett institute praised pusztais supported increased safety tests genetically modified press releases also said potatoes modified cona adding confusion pusztai claimed seen press releases went opportunity correct mistake james says drafted pusztai rewrote one section see final mistaken belief cona gene inserted potato led scientist sir robert may agricultural minister jack cunningham release statements media saying findings surprising known poison added scientists still dismiss pusztais work rowett institute audited pusztais work october concluded data support february scientists countries organised friends published memo responding stated independent examination supported pusztais conclusions concerned findings february royal society publicly announced committee would review work world action reporters laurie flynn michael sean gillard claimed unusual step royal society normally conduct peer data sent six anonymous resulting review published june stated pusztais experiments poorly designed contained uncertainties composition diets tested rats used incorrect statistical methods lacked consistency within experiments pusztai responded saying reviewers reviewed internal rowett reports include design methodology editors lancet published editorial may denounced parties involved criticizing pusztai unwisely announcing results television stating scientists publish results scientific press popular media editorial also denounced royal societys review breathtaking data published letter lancet october coauthored reported significant differences thickness gut epithelium rats fed genetically modified potatoes compared fed control diet differences growth immune system function suggested letter reviewed six reviewers three times lancets usual number four reviewers found acceptable revisions fifth thought flawed wanted published avoid suspicions conspiracy pusztai give colleagues chance see data sixth john pickett institute arable crops research also said consulting royal society pickett publicly criticised lancet agreeing publish study study used data held subject veto pusztais reported significant differences thickness gut epithelium control test subjects mention growth immunity published work criticised grounds unmodified potatoes fair control diet rats fed potatoes would suffer protein pusztai responded criticisms saying experimental diets protein energy content food intake rats interview pickett later said lancet editor richard horton must political motive publishing paper referees rejected according pusztai claim repeated academic critics assumed picketts use plural suggested study failed peer horton claimed received aggressive phone call calling immoral threatening published paper would implications personal position peter lachmann former vicepresident biological secretary royal society president academy medical sciences acknowledged making call denies threatened horton says call discuss error judgment publishing letter discuss moral difficulties publishing bad ewen retired following publication claiming career options blocked high survey european food safety authority gmo panel working group animal feeding trials concluded results obtained testing gm food feed rodents indicate large least safety margins exist animal exposure levels without observed adverse effects estimated human daily intake studies show biologically relevant differences parameters tested control test pusztai given whistleblower award federation german httpsenwikipediaorgwikipusztaiaffair
