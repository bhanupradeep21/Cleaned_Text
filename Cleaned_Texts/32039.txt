tracheoesophageal puncture tracheoesophageal puncture surgically created hole trachea windpipe esophagus tubal pathway throat stomach person total laryngectomy surgery larynx voice box removed purpose puncture restore person ability speak vocal cords removed involves creation fistula trachea oesophagus puncturing short segment tissue common wall typically separates two structures voice prosthesis inserted puncture prosthesis keeps food trachea lets air esophagus oesophageal speech laryngectomized person required breathe permanent breathing hole neck called tracheostoma laryngectomized person occludes tracheostoma completely blocking exhaled air leave body pathway exhaled air directed voice prosthesis air enters esophagus escapes mouth process air passes upper tissues esophagus lower throat allows vibration tissues pharyngoesophageal segment also called pesegment neoglottis pseudoglottis vibration creates sound serves replace sound vocal cords previously produced methods alaryngeal speech speech without vocal cords esophageal speech artificial larynx speech studies show tracheoesophageal speech found closer normal speech esophageal often reported better terms naturalness well well understood compared esophageal electrolarynx first report tracheoesophageal puncture dates back laryngectomized patient said use hot ice pick create tracheoesophageal puncture enabled speak forcing air puncture closing tracheostoma finger two tracheoesophageal puncture procedure types primary secondary puncture initially procedure described secondary later also primary procedure performed total laryngectomy surgery removal larynx creation tracheostoma puncture made back wall trachea front wall esophagus main advantages primary puncture second surgery create puncture avoided including related costs risks patient able speak within weeks total cases primary procedure performed example procedure used complete separation tracheoesophageal wall puncture would otherwise placed example case portion esophagus removed requiring anastomosis reconnection structures region case sufficient period recovery wound healing would required secondary puncture could placedcitation needed procedure refers puncture placed anytime total laryngectomy surgery decision use primary secondary puncture vary greatly secondary puncture performed primary puncture possible repuncture closure previous tracheoesophageal puncture physician patient preference case failure esophageal electrolarynx speech chosen initial speech optioncitation needed two different methods used place voice prosthesis primary placement voice prosthesis placed immediately created immediate postoperative period patient fed feeding tube either inserted directly stomach temporary version extends nose stomach tube removed patient able eat enough mouth maintain nutritional needs early second day following speech production voice prosthesis initiated surgical area healed clearance surgeon advantages method voice prosthesis stabilizes te wall flanges device protect puncture leakage fluids stomach acids stomach contents irritation pressure stenting catheter used maintain puncture opening voice prosthesis placed patients become quickly familiar prosthesis care receive instructions hospitalized patient undergo outpatient procedure voice prosthesis needs fitted many patients learn speak start postoperative radiation therapy indicated patient focus voice production immediately wound healing another advantage generally voice prosthesis placed time surgery lasts relatively long requires early frequent disadvantage patient need use feeding tube days delayed placement instead voice prosthesis catheter red rubber silastic foley catheter ryles tube introduced puncture tube sometimes utilized feeding patient immediate post operative period patient standard feeding tube feeding voice prosthesis placed patient able eat sufficiently mouth speech production initiated healing completed clearance surgeon advantage method patient may fed catheter requiring standard tube feeding primary disadvantage patient undergo outpatient procedure voice prosthesis placed another disadvantage need frequent replacements early fitting voice prosthesis due changes length indications include voice rehabilitation patients undergoing total laryngectomy primary puncture patients total laryngectomy past secondary puncture contraindications mainly related use voice prosthesis puncture procedure important healthy tissue puncture site help ensure voice prosthesis properly supported poor tissue condition puncture site contraindication te puncture also important patient candidacy taken account patients must able understand manage proper prosthesis maintenance monitor complications device problems bleeding disorders anxiety disorders dementia poor vision poor manual dexterity factors may negatively interfere successful voice restoration using tracheoesophageal techniques discussed
