renal vein thrombosis rvt formation clot vein drains blood kidneys ultimately leading reduction drainage one kidneys possible migration clot parts first described german pathologist friedrich daniel von recklinghausen rvt commonly affects two subpopulations newly born infants blood clotting abnormalities dehydration adults nephrotic nephrotic syndrome kidney disorder causes excessive loss protein urine low levels albumin blood high level cholesterol blood swelling triggering hypercoagulable state increasing chances clot formation less common causes include hypercoagulable state cancer kidney transplantation behcet syndrome antiphospholipid antibody syndrome blunt trauma back treatment rvt mainly focuses preventing blood clots kidneys maintaining stable kidney function use anticoagulants become standard treatment treating membranous glomerulonephritis common cause nephrotic syndrome adults peaks people ages years old twice likely occur men women since nephrotic syndrome common cause rvt people years old men risk develop renal vein aside occasional flank lower back pain caused sudden clot major veins kidneys rvt produces symptoms patients may display symptoms patients may experience bloody urine decrease urine output edema worsening proteinuria usually diagnoses rvt first made nephrotic syndrome patient experiences pulmonary embolism sudden decrease kidney function kidney failure symptoms may vary duration since blood clot resolve precautions taken prevent migration clot parts body severe complication rvt pulmonary embolism caused clot also called thrombus originates renal vein vein body migrates pulmonary artery pulmonary embolism serious condition damage lungs due pulmonary hypertension cause low blood oxygen damaging organs body condition cause death left untreated percent patients pulmonary embolism die usually within one infants young children experiencing dehydration induced rvt may experience dehydration symptoms dry mouth low urine output loss skin turgidity vomiting nausea fever usual rvt symptoms like flank pain blood urine anaemia edema enlarged kidneys kidney mechanism behind rvt different types blood clots parts body rudolf virchow first describe physiological mechanism behind venous thrombosis blood clots using three related factors known virchows triad damage blood vessel endothelial damage decrease blood flow stasis increased coagulability blood thrombophilia hypercoagulability possible one factors alone cause blood clot cases combination factors induce formation blood clot decreased urine output kidney function may observable symptoms caused blood clot renal vein less common causes include hypercoagulable state invasion renal cell carcinoma kidney transplantation behcet syndrome antiphospholipid antibody syndrome blunt trauma back damage endothelial tissue vein caused blunt damage trauma venography renal transplant tumors acute rejection vasculitis spontaneous microtrauma endothelium due cystathionine beta synthase deficiency also known homocystinuria autosomal recessive inherited disorder body able process certain building blocks proteins correctly due mutation cbs gene mutation causes amino acid homocystine used properly thus high levels build blood damaging endothelial tissue increasing likelihood common cause rvt infants dehydration dehydration may caused reduction volume circulatory blood volume due water depleting abnormalities like diarrhea vomiting decrease blood volume due dehydration cause blood flow diverted away kidneys organs resulting slower blood flow kidneys increasing chances blood clot occurrence rvt known occur absence clinically obvious shock eg following neonatal distress placement central venous catheters rvt also induced post transplant distortion physical distortion compression renal vein depending shape distortion affect rate flow hypercoagulability abnormality blood increases risk formation blood clots nephrotic syndrome patients higher risk rvt development due hypercoagulability caused proteinuria increased loss proteins urine caused nephrotic syndrome results lower osmotic pressure reduced osmotic pressure trigger liver produce proteins like fibrinogen betathromboglobulin promote blood clotting nephrotic syndrome many factors promote hypercoagulability hypercoagulability promoted increased platelet count enhanced platelet aggregation increased protein count decrease coagulation inhibiters like hypercoagulability inherited andor acquired hyperhomocysteinemia condition known promote clots caused combination genetic factors vitamin vitamin folic acid factor v leiden mutations prothrombin gene two common genetic causes hypercoagulability general population heterozygous mutations thrombophilic population incidence rvt people nephrotic syndrome ranges nephrotic syndrome caused membranous minimal change disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosiscitation needed laboratory tests used diagnose rvtcitation needed observing patients symptoms medical history imaging remain fundamental source diagnosing rvt imaging used detect presence blood clot abnormal kidney rvt blood clot present renal vein cases renal vein suddenly andor fully blocked kidneys enlarge reaching maximum size within week ultrasound imaging used observe track size kidneys rvt patients ultrasound efficient use detecting blood flow renal veins artery instead color doppler ultrasound may used detect renal blood flow commonly used detect rvt patients undergone renal transplantation ct angiography currently top choice diagnosing rvt noninvasive relatively cheap fast high accuracy ct scanning used detect renal enlargement renal tumors blood flow renal pathologies alternative magnetic resonance angiography mra noninvasive fast avoids radiation unlike ct scan relatively expensive mra produces detailed images renal blood flow vesicle walls kidneys surrounding tissue inferior venocavography selective venography used rule diagnoses surgery remove clot possible rarely performed past surgical removal renal vein clot primary treatment invasive many complications occur past decades treatment shifted focus surgical intervention medical treatments include intravenous oral anticoagulants use anticoagulants may improve kidney function rvt cases removing clot vein preventing clots occurring patients already nephrotic syndrome may need take anticoagulants case patients keep eye maintain reduced level proteinuria reducing salt excess protein intaking diuretics statins depending severity rvt patients may anticoagulants year lifetime long albumin levels bloodstream recommended rvt patients continue taking anticoagulants main anticoagulants used treat rvt include warfarin low molecular weight heparin heparin become popular low risk complications availability easily administered warfarin known interact many drugs careful monitoring nephrotic syndrome patient experiences rvt symptoms flank back pain blood urine decreased kidney function immediately see doctor avoid complicationscitation needed main side effect anticoagulants risk excessive bleeding side effects include blood urine feces severe bruising prolonged nosebleeds lasting longer minutes bleeding gum blood vomit coughing blood unusual headaches sudden severe back pain difficulty breathing chest pain women heavy increased bleeding period bleeding vagina warfarin cause rashes diarrhea nausea feeling sick vomiting hair loss heparin cause hair loss alopecia thrombocytopenia sudden drop number platelets reported case study patients nephrotic syndrome caused rvt mortality rate mostly due hemorrhagic complications sepsis remaining surviving patients rvt resolved kidney function returned normal concluded age factor survival rvt patients although older patient older likely develop kidney failure heparin crucial returning normal kidney function patients take heparin long term kidney damage observed patients take heparin kidney damage observed quickly treating receiving correct medications patients increase chances survival reduce risk renal vein clot migrating another part known diabetes causes changes factors associated coagulation clotting
