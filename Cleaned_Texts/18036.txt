large molecules cross typically metabolized liver little direct impact metabolism conventional smallmolecule also tend relatively long halflives body must given parenterally preferably injection due poor absorption digestive proved effective people experience migraine headaches without aura episodic chronic cluster headache first class preventive medications originally designed approved people
