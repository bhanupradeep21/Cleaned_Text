social norms approach social norms environmental strategy gaining ground health conducting research two researchers hw perkins ad reported students small us college held exaggerated beliefs normal frequency consumption habits students regard alcohol inflated perceptions found many educational institutions varying populations despite fact college drinking elevated levels perceived amount almost always exceeds actual social norms approach shown signs countering misperceptions however research changes behavior resulting changed perceptions varies mixed conclusively social norms approach founded upon set assumptions individuals incorrectly perceive attitudes behaviors others different reality similar phenomenon known pluralistic largely individuals assume memorable salient often extreme behavior representative behavior majority may lead individuals adjust behavior presumed majority adhering pseudonorms created observing memorable behavior exaggerated perceptions rather misperceptions peer behavior continue influence habits majority means individuals may likely enact problem behaviors suppress healthier practices making support healthy behaviors much less visible aggregate level effect documented alcohol illegal drug use smoking health behaviors attitudes phenomenon known false consensus closely related idea pluralistic ignorance refers incorrect belief others similar reality example heavy drinkers think others consume much use belief justify behavior independent consultant works fulltime promote ideas describes false consensus pluralistic ignorance mutually reinforcing selfperpetuatingthe majority silent thinks minority minority vocal believes represents majority p phenomena potential addressed social norms intervention describes possibility relation reducing alcohol use norms interventions found effective changing behavior moderate occasionaldrinking majority pluralistic ignorance well confronting changing behavior heavy drinking minority false consensus p thus social norms approach predicts intervention aims correct misperceptions exposing actual norms benefit society well individuals lead people reduce problem behaviors increase participation healthy multiple studies indeed shown social norms campaigns positive effects target populations one study particular utilized different colleges threeyear period found social norms campaigns associated lower perceptions student drinking lower consumption oddly results study reported conference alcohol educators dejong reported alcohol consumption increased among control participants among experimental group got social norms marketing treatment discrepancy reported findings conference paper published journal paper difficult reconcile another intervention designed reduce drinking amongst student athletes similar results reducing misperceptions alcohol consumption also within time period intervention declines personal consumption high risk drinking alcoholrelated critiquing study one ask many dependent variables assessed group researchers often assesses many outcome variables finds change calls program successful recent trial live interactive normative feedback program students used keypads input information positive effects terms reducing misperceptions drinking many examples successful social norms campaigns cover various topics population sizes media normative messages conveyed two types norms relevant social norms approach injunctive norms descriptive norms words injunctive norms represent think people approve disapprove descriptive norms represent people actually behave regardless whether behavior approved disapproved example injunctive norm almost people share littering wrong however still plenty cases people litter kinds norms motivate human action people tend socially approved well popular put together norms counterproductive effect example campaign focuses individuals frequent occurrences offense environment potential increase occurrence two norms constructed three sources observable behavior directindirect communication selfknowledge miller prentice borsari studies showed people misperceive injunctive norms descriptive norms injunctive norms likely predict drinking behavior negative consequences drinking however use social norms campaigns shown unclear type norm likely change seven assumptions social norms since study berkowitz perkins reported misperceptions alcohol consumption amongst college students use study social norms approach grown used prevention technique variety levels prevention universal large populations like entire college campuses selective targeted subpopulations indicated first social norms intervention implemented michael haines northern illinois university targeted universal campus population years shown significant success terms increasing healthy research northern illinois university done grant usdepartment education fund improvement post secondary education fipse many universities since followed suit similar success reduction highrisk drinking behaviors hobart william smith university university north name since achievements become wellknown social norms approach used successfully reduce drinking hiv risk increase seat belt also gained widespread use targeting adolescents high school students used attempt reduce drinking smoking behaviors amongst recently interventions tested reduce sexual assault results reported social norms approach accepted scholars effective campaign method criticize approach saying underlying assumptions false one study found perceived degree alcohol use predictive alcohol abuse normative influences another study found misperceptions drinking problems unrelated personal alcohol findings studies present opposition first assumption social norms approach actions often based misinformation misperceptions others attitudes andor behavior scholars challenge legitimacy social norms interventions deemed successful say many interventions methodological problems could influence validity effectiveness eg control variables comparison groups another common criticism simply ineffective nationwide study compared colleges social norms interventions found schools interventions showed decreases measures alcohol use actually found increased measures terms alcohol consumed monthly total amount also handful studies document failed social norms campaigns specific social norms approach determines exaggerated actual norms population formative research informs population actual norms message campaign next step determining effectiveness messages summative evaluation finally results evaluative research also used craft new messages revise message campaign thus campaign cyclical following provides indepth description steps involved social norms campaign formative evaluation first step social norms campaign consists surveying population well message creation based survey results formative evaluation phase time information regarding perceived norms actual behaviors garnered audience order social norms approach appropriate means intervention two conditions must first satisfied effective way establish baseline levels behavior perceptions use surveys internet surveys example oftenused method generating substantial response rate especially suited college students familiarity technology containment population ie part specific community ability students take survey pace time works best web surveys ideal students also highly advantageous researchers provide quick turnaround data analysis higher response rates less missing data eliminate interviewer effects possible methods administering survey pencil paper surveys phone surveys personal interviews following describes typical thorough process used survey population completing data collection researchers analyze data search patterns looking inconsistencies actual behavior attitudes perceived norms differences consistent campaign majority students adhere beneficial idea used next round message creation example data could show college students report consumed drinks last time partied believe average student consumed drinks discovering statistic researcher may craft message like students drink drinks party correct misperceived descriptive norm important descriptive researchers look data greater statistic items ie population adheres beneficial behavior statistics could occur injunctive norms ie students believe passing drinking much wrong protectivehealthy behaviors ie students use designated driver even one two drinks numerous behaviors different message components varied experimented pretesting example researchers test different vocabulary eg vs vs majority using different behaviors find ones easiest acceptable perform eg eating drinking vs keeping track drinking using varying degrees citations eg large citations vs small citations data source preliminary messages pretested small groups order refine presented entire population aspects examined pretesting include messages socially acceptable believed effective messages highest believability believability necessary sufficient condition effective campaign believability messages low change probably occur persuasive messages falling audiences latitude rejection words audience reject message without even considering also important note however believability extremely high eg change also unlikely occur message challenging enough words serves reinforcement rather element change thus specific guidelines ideal aim believability assessment believability social norms campaign polonec major found students drinking experiences experiences friends contributed disbelief message students campus choose drinks party another study found disbelief may due preconceived notions drinking students develop even arrive implementing campaign researchers perform summative evaluation measures success campaign step consists examining evaluating progress made intervention assessing outcome impact cost benefits cost effectiveness program typical researchers use surveys similar used formative evaluation following questions summative evaluation answer especially important part summative evaluation assessment market saturation reach clearly social norms campaign reach much intended audience potential effectiveness decreases researchers demonstrate campaign high reach strengthens connection intervention positive outcomes also lets researchers know methods effective distributing necessary audience exposed campaign messages frequently change misperceptions however overexposure possible leading loss credibility thus important determine proper dosage campaign order achieve maximum effectiveness silk et provide comprehensive evaluation socials norms campaign related mental health among college students revealing positive outcomes students exposed social norms campaign eg greater likelihood visit universitys counseling center evaluation complete potential help intervention summative evaluation tells whether program working also feed new messages new campaigns providing new updated data following key terms
