instinct inherent inclination living organism towards particular complex behaviour containing innate inborn elements simplest example instinctive behaviour fixed action pattern fap short medium length sequence actions without variation carried response corresponding clearly defined stimulus behaviour instinctive performed without based upon prior experience absence learning therefore expression innate biological factors sea turtles newly hatched beach instinctively move toward ocean marsupial climbs mothers pouch upon born examples include animal fighting animal courtship behaviour internal escape functions building nests though instinct defined invariant innate characteristics details performance changed experience example dog improve listening skills practice instincts inborn complex patterns behaviour exist members species distinguished reflexes simple responses organism specific stimulus contraction pupil response bright light spasmodic movement lower leg knee tapped absence volitional capacity must confused inability modify fixed action patterns example people may able modify stimulated fixed action pattern consciously recognizing point activation simply stop whereas animals without sufficiently strong volitional capacity may able disengage fixed action patterns instinctual behaviour humans studied jean henri fabre said first person study small animals werent birds insects specifically specialized instincts fabre considered instinct linked set behaviours organism undergoes unconsciously response external fabre concluded significant difference humans animals animals came conclusion observing insects wild birds continued repeat certain behaviour response novel instinctive behaviours appeared complex insects animals adjust behaviour despite helping novel following insect animal behaviours fabre observed labelled involve reasoning fabre believed instincts fixed patterns meaning linked sets behaviours change response novel environmental one

desires called early century recognized union instinct william mcdougall held many instincts respective associated specific research became rigorous terms better defined instinct explanation human behaviour became less common mcdougall argued word instinct suitable describing animal behaviour recommended word propensity goaldirected combinations many innate human abilities loosely variably linked way shows strong psychologist abraham maslow argued humans longer instincts ability override certain situations felt called instinct often imprecisely defined really amounts strong drives
