cervical effacement cervical ripening refers thinning shortening cervix process occurs labor prepare cervix dilation allow fetus pass vagina normal physiological process occurs later end pregnancy also induced medications gestation cervix maintains pregnancy increasing synthesis various proteins proteins defined interactions allow formation matrix proteins help fortify uterine toward end pregnancy series hormonemediated biochemical process takes place degrade collagen fiber network cause cervix ripen labor failure ripen cervix labor may delay onset cause current efforts induce labor include pharmacologic nonpharmacologic mechanical surgical methods cervical ripening primarily performed inpatient setting due variety reasons cost patient preference capacity undergo outpatient cervical ripening prior effacement cervix like long bottleneck usually four centimeters length throughout pregnancy cervix tightly closed protected plug mucus effacement accompanied cervical dilation cervix effaces mucus plug loosened passes vagina mucus may tinged blood passage mucus plug called bloody show simply show effacement takes place cervix shortens effaces pulling uterus becoming part lower uterine wall information signaling pathways regulating human cervical ripening preterm term histologically cervix undergoes significant changes towards end gestation allowing ripening cervix passage birth delivery first increase cervical synthesis glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan ha increases tissue hydration thereby catalyzing degradation collagen elastinfibers second increase secretion matrix metalloproteinases also act digest components extracellular matrix including proteoglycans laminin fibronectin found cervical stroma third due nature cervical effacement process enzymes mediators regulate allergic inflammatory responses also one immunomodulating factors mast cells known secrete inflammatory mediators modulate process cervical ripening mast cell histamine one allergenic mediators released mast cells shown causative relationship cervical smooth muscle contractility however research bishop score common method assessing need induction labor scoring based digital cervical exam takes consideration cervical dilation position effacement consistency cervix fetal station cervical dilation effacement station scored cervical consistency position scored total score ranges minimum maximum bishop score indicates induction favorable method induction highly effective cases cervical ripening agents may used score indicates induction labor favorable possibility vaginal delivery induction similar spontaneous labor cervical effacement important component bishop score reported percentage indicates cervix normal length indicates cervix half expected length effaced means cervix paper thin bishop score modified current medical practice modified scoring method takes consideration parameters dilation effacement fetal station scored range score favorable induction labor given cervical effacement measured percentage method requires consensus standard uneffaced cervix length however vary among physicians requirement presents opportunity error miscommunication inappropriate care process assessing cervical effacement methods used assessing measuring cervical effacement may accurate bishop score metric system measuring cervix integrating metric system measurement cervix may reduce eliminate risk error assumptions cervical length imaging methods also considered measure cervical effacement elastography measures stiffness ability soft tissue used assess cervical tissue deforms pressure assessed manually useful parameter predicting preterm full term delivery two methods elastography static elastography measures tissue displacement response manual compression movement dynamic elastography measures speed shear wave propagation methods provide useful information stiffness cervix considering induction labor cervical ripening contraindicated pregnancies presenting following contraindications cervical ripening also include vaginal absolute contraindications result lifethreatening events relative contraindications considered caution absolute relative contraindications vaginal birth include limited following absolute relative labor induction poses different risks pregnant person fetus risks complications relating cervical effacement classified risk pregnant person fetus cervical ripening via transcervical balloon catheter increase risk infection pregnant person approximately pregnant people develop intrapartum infection postpartum infection neonatal infection intrapartum infection deemed clinically significant risk risk uterine hyperstimulation relates labor induction higher dinoprostone vaginally administered misoprostol oxytocin mechanical oxytocin dysregulation linked autism autism spectrum disorder oxytocin one methods used cervical ripening committee obstetric practice american college obstetricians gynecologists conducted review existing research regarding link concluded insufficient evidence causal link cervical effacement via oxytocin autismasd low dose oral misoprostol purpose labor induction associated lower risk fetal distress vaginally administered misoprostol vaginally administered dinoprostone associated increased risk fetal hyperstimulation without fetal heart rate abnormalities inpatient outpatient cervical ripening done via vaginally administered dinoprostone balloon catheters low risk pregnancies different rates cesarean cervical ripening using dinoprostone vaginal inserts rates neonatal morbidity cesarean section labor onset used outpatient setting inpatient oxytocin one commonly used medications cervical effacement given infusion either start increase uterine contractions epidurals often used together pain oxytocin may also used setting amniotomy well balloon catheters contractions conjunction procedures misoprostol medication cause contractions cervical effacement used balloon catheters vaginal delivery likely occur within next hours initiation known type prostaglandin available worldwide also used early termination pregnancy also class prostaglandins dinoprostone increases contractions available gel vaginal insert form safe efficacious one study found bishop score less equal vaginal insert seemed effective spontaneous vaginal delivery red raspberry leaf tea herbal option cervical effacement retrospective observational study conducted significant difference time second third stage labour mean time first stage labour also substantially lower raspberry leaf group data however proven statistically significant warm bath common method used midwives ease labor pain also induce labor study conducted cervical dilation increased groups well number uterine contractions increased mainly group used combined bath ball also showed shorter labor time safety precautions taken make sure water temperature high lead fetal distress balloon catheters catheters inserted cervix setting pregnancy induce labor saline used inflate balloon causing increased pressure cervix imitate pressure fetal head would pressing cervix labor turn speeds process hygroscopic dilator dilator inserted cervix expands size absorbs genital tract moisture also used early termination pregnancy according study conducted japan rate delivery term seemed equivalent group used balloon catheter hygroscopic amniotomy procedure hook inserted amniotic membranes puncture causing amniotic fluid drain amniotic sac holds fetus reason surgical procedure could either cervical effacement look fetal status device inserted amniotic sac monitoring sign successful procedure amniotic fluid immediately comes membrane punctured certain amniotic fluid colors indicate fetal distress important obstetrician midwife check color membrane stripping otherwise known membrane sweeping procedure obstetrician inserts finger cervix moves sweeping motion
