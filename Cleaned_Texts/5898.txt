ltyrosine tyrosine symbol tyr one standard amino acids used cells synthesize proteins nonessential amino acid polar side group word tyrosine greek tyrós meaning cheese first discovered german chemist justus von liebig protein casein called tyrosyl referred functional group side chain tyrosine generally classified hydrophobic amino acid hydrophilic encoded codons uac uau messenger rna aside proteinogenic amino acid tyrosine special role virtue phenol functionality occurs proteins part signal transduction processes functions receiver phosphate groups transferred way protein kinases phosphorylation hydroxyl group change activity target protein may form part signaling cascade via domain binding tyrosine residue also plays important role photosynthesis chloroplasts photosystem ii acts electron donor reduction oxidized chlorophyll process loses hydrogen atom phenolic ohgroup radical subsequently reduced photosystem ii four core manganese clusterscitation needed dietary reference intake tyrosine usually estimated together phenylalanine varies depending estimate method however ideal proportion two amino acids considered phenylalaninetyrosine human body tyrosine also synthesized body phenylalanine found many highprotein food products chicken turkey fish milk yogurt cottage cheese cheese peanuts almonds pumpkin seeds sesame seeds soy protein lima example white egg

retention hydroxyl group give phydroxyphenylpyruvate transaminated using glutamate nitrogen source give tyrosine αketoglutarate mammals synthesize tyrosine essential amino acid phenylalanine phe derived food conversion phe tyr catalyzed enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase monooxygenase enzyme catalyzes reaction causing addition hydroxyl group end aromatic ring phenylalanine becomes tyrosine tyrosine residues tagged hydroxyl group phosphate group phosphorylated protein kinases phosphorylated form tyrosine called phosphotyrosine tyrosine phosphorylation considered one key steps signal

increases plasma neurotransmitter levels particularly dopamine little effect mood normal number studies found tyrosine useful stress cold fatigue prolonged work sleep reductions stress hormone

tyrosine may benefit healthy individuals exposed demanding situational ltyrosine used pharmaceuticals dietary supplements food additives two methods formerly used manufacture ltyrosine first involves
