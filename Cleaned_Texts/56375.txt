hypernasal speech disorder causes abnormal resonance humans voice due increased airflow nose speech caused open nasal cavity resulting incomplete closure soft palate andor velopharyngeal sphinctercitation needed normal speech nasality referred nasalization linguistic category apply vowels consonants specific language primary underlying physical variable determining degree nasality normal speech opening closing velopharyngeal passage way oral vocal tract nasal vocal tract normal vocal tract anatomy opening controlled lowering raising velum soft palate open close respectively velopharyngeal passageway palate comprises two parts hard palate palatum durum soft palate palatum molle connected uvula movements soft palate uvula made possible velopharyngeal sphincterclarification needed speech swallowing soft palate lifts back throat wall close nasal cavity producing nasal consonants n ng soft palate remains relaxed thereby enabling air go nose eustachian tube opens near velopharyngeal sphincter connects middle ear nasal pharynx normally tube ensures aeration drainage secretions middle ear narrow closed rest opens swallowing yawning controlled tensor veli palatini levator veli palatini muscles soft palate children cleft palate difficulties controlling muscles thus unable open eustachian tube secretions accumulate middle ear tube remains dysfunctional long period time cause hearing loss middle ear infections ultimately hearing loss lead impaired speech language general term disorders velopharyngeal valve velopharyngeal dysfunction vpd includes three subterms velopharyngeal insufficiency velopharyngeal inadequacy velopharyngeal mislearning several methods diagnosing hypernasality hypernasality generally segmented socalled resonance effects vowels voiced sonorant consonants effects excess nasal airflow consonants requiring buildup oral air pressure stop consonants p sibilants latter nasal airflow problem termed nasal acts prevent buildup air pressure thus prevent normal production consonant testing resonance effects without aid technology speech pathologists asked rate speech listening recorded sentence paragraph though much variability subjective ratings least two reasons first acoustic effect given velopharyngeal opening varies greatly depending degree occlusion nasal passageways reason stuffy nose allergy cold sound nasal nose clear secondly many persons hypernasal speech especially hearing impaired also mispronunciations articulation vowels extremely difficult separate acoustic effects hypernasality acoustic effects mispronounced vowels examples course speech training hearing impaired little possibility making nasality judgments aurally holding finger side nose feel voice frequency vibration sometimes cases muscle weakness cleft palate special exercises help strengthen soft palate muscles ultimate aim decreasing airflow nose thereby increasing intelligibility intelligibility requires ability close nasal cavity english sounds except nasal sounds n n ng Å‹ airflow mouth normally age three child raise muscles soft palate close nasal cavity without use technological aid nasal emission sometimes judged listening turbulence may produced nasal airflow small velopharyngeal opening degree mucous opening directly methods recommended include looking fogging mirror held near nares listening tube end held near nares many attempts use technological augmentation mirror tube aid speech pathologist provide meaningful feedback person attempting correct hypernasality among successful attempts incompleteness velopharyngeal closure vowels sonorants causes nasal resonance estimated displayed evaluation biofeedback speech training nasalance voice nasalance defined ratio acoustic energy nostrils mouth form acoustic separation present mouth child finds difficult blow pinching nose help regulate airflow child practice speech sounds without pinching nose exercises work treatments hypernasality small severe deviations treated insufficient evidence support use traditional nonspeech oral motor exercises reduce hypernasality velopharyngeal closure patterns underlying neuromotor control may differ speech nonspeech activities therefore increase velar movement blowing sucking swallowing may transfer speech tasks thus hypernasality remains individual speak kuehn proposed new way treatment using cpap machine speech tasks positive pressure provided cpap machine provides resistance strengthen velopharyngeal muscles nasal mask place individual asked produce vncv syllables short sentences believed cpap therapy increase muscle endurance well strength overloads levator veli palatini muscle involves regimen large number repetitions velar elevation research findings proved patients hypernasality due flaccid dysarthria tbi cleft palate eliminate hypernasality receiving training two main surgical techniques correcting aberrations soft palate present hypernasality posterior pharyngeal flap sphincter pharyngoplasty surgical interventions speech therapy necessary learn control newly constructed posterior pharyngeal flap surgery mostly used vertical clefts soft palate surgeon cuts upper layers back throat creating small square tissue flap remains attached one side usually top side attached parts soft palate ensures nasal cavity partially separated oral cavity child speaks remaining openings close side due narrowing throat caused muscle movements necessary speech relaxed state openings allow breathing sphincter pharyngoplasty mostly used horizontal clefts soft palate two small flaps made left right side entrance nasal cavity attached back throat good results patient must good palatal motion occlusion nasal cavity mainly carried muscles already existing common complications posterior pharyngeal wall flap hyponasality nasal obstruction snoring sleep apnea rarer complications include flap separation sinusitis postoperative bleeding aspiration pneumonia possible complications sphincter pharyngoplasty snoring nasal obstruction difficulty blowing nose researches suggest sphincter pharyngoplasty introduces less hyponasality obstructive sleep symptoms posterior
