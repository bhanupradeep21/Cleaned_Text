information object perceptual grouping process determines pieces perceptual field gestaltists first psychologists systematically study perceptual according gestalt psychologists fundamental principle perceptual grouping law law prägnanz also known law good gestalt prägnanz german word directly translates pithiness implies salience conciseness law prägnanz says tend experience things regular orderly symmetrical simple koffka put several geometrically possible organizations one actually occur possesses best simplest stable law prägnanz implies individuals perceive world eliminate complexity unfamiliarity observe reality simplistic form eliminating extraneous stimuli helps mind create meaning meaning created perception implies global regularity often mentally prioritized spatial relations law good gestalt focuses idea conciseness gestalt theory based major aspect gestalt psychology implies mind understands external stimuli wholes rather sums parts wholes structured organized using grouping laws gestalt psychologists attempted discover refinements law prägnanz involved writing laws hypothetically allow us predict interpretation sensation often called gestalt wertheimer defined principles explain ways humans perceive objects principles based similarity proximity gestalt concept based perceiving reality simplest various laws called laws principles depending paper simplicitys sake article uses term laws laws took several forms grouping similar proximate objects together within global process laws deal sensory modality vision however analogous laws sensory modalities including auditory tactile gustatory olfactory bregman gp visual gestalt principles grouping introduced wertheimer wertheimer kohler koffka formulated many laws grouping study visual perception law proximity states individual perceives assortment objects perceive objects close forming group example figure illustrating law proximity circles perceive collection circles groups specifically perceive group circles left side image three groups circles right side image law often used advertising logos emphasize aspects events law similarity states elements within assortment objects perceptually grouped together similar similarity occur form shape colour shading qualities example figure illustrating law similarity portrays circles equal distance apart one another forming square depiction circles shaded dark circles shaded light perceive dark circles grouped together light circles grouped together forming six horizontal lines within square circles perception lines due law gestalt psychologists believed humans tend perceive objects complete rather focusing gaps object might example circle good gestalt terms completeness however also perceive incomplete circle complete tendency complete shapes figures called law closure states individuals perceive objects shapes letters pictures etc whole complete specifically parts whole picture missing perception fills visual gap research shows reason mind completes regular figure perceived sensation increase regularity surrounding stimuli example figure depicts law closure portrays perceive circle left side image rectangle right side image however gaps present shapes law closure exist image would depict assortment different lines different lengths rotations law closure perceptually combine lines whole law symmetry states mind perceives objects symmetrical forming around center point perceptually pleasing divide objects even number symmetrical parts therefore two symmetrical elements unconnected mind perceptually connects form coherent shape similarities symmetrical objects increase likelihood objects grouped form combined symmetrical object example figure depicting law symmetry shows configuration square curled brackets image perceived tend observe three pairs symmetrical brackets rather six individual law common fate states objects perceived lines move along smoothest path experiments using visual sensory modality found movement elements object produces paths individuals perceive objects perceive elements objects trends motion indicate path object law continuity implies grouping together objects trend motion therefore path example array dots half dots moving upward half moving downward would perceive upward moving dots downward moving dots two distinct law continuity also known law good continuation states elements objects tend grouped together therefore integrated perceptual wholes aligned within object cases intersection objects individuals tend perceive two objects two single uninterrupted entities stimuli remain distinct even overlap less likely group elements sharp abrupt directional changes one object example figure depicting law continuity shows configuration two crossed keys image perceived tend perceive key background single uninterrupted key instead two separate halves law past experience implies circumstances visual stimuli categorized according past experience objects tend observed within close proximity small temporal intervals objects likely perceived together example english language contains letters grouped form words using set rules individual reads english word never seen use law past experience interpret letters l two letters beside rather using law closure combine letters interpret object uppercase example gestalt
