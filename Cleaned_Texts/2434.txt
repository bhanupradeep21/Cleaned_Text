nystatin sold brandname mycostatin among others antifungal used treat candida infections skin including diaper rash thrush esophageal candidiasis vaginal yeast may also used prevent candidiasis high nystatin may used mouth vagina applied common side effects applied skin include burning itching common side effects taken mouth include vomiting pregnancy use vagina safe formulations studied works disrupting cell membrane fungal nystatin discovered rachel fuller brown elizabeth lee first polyene macrolide world health organizations list essential available generic made bacterium streptomyces commonly prescribed medication united states million skin vaginal mouth esophageal candida infections usually respond well treatment nystatin infections nails hyperkeratinized skin respond available many forms given parenterally activity reduced due presence oral nystatin often used preventive treatment people risk fungal infections aids patients low count people receiving chemotherapy investigated use patients liver transplantation fluconazole found much effective preventing colonization invasive infection effective treating oral candidiasis elderly people wear also used low birthweight less g lb infants prevent invasive fungal infections although fluconazole preferred treatment found reduce rate invasive fungal infections also reduce deaths used liposomal nystatin commercially available investigational use shown greater vitro activity colloidal formulations amphotericin b demonstrated effectiveness amphotericin bresistant forms offers intriguing possibility difficulttotreat systemic infections invasive aspergillosis infections demonstrate resistance amphotericin b cryptococcus also sensitive nystatin additionally liposomal nystatin appears cause fewer
