thyroid nodules nodules raised areas tissue fluid commonly arise within otherwise normal thyroid may hyperplastic tumorous small percentage thyroid tumors malignant small asymptomatic nodules common often go nodules grow larger produce symptoms may eventually need medical care goitre may one nodule uninodular multiple nodules multinodular diffuse often abnormal growths thyroid tissue located edge thyroid gland felt lump throat large sometimes seen lump front neckcitation needed sometimes thyroid nodule presents fluidfilled cavity called thyroid cyst often solid components mixed fluid thyroid cysts commonly result degenerating thyroid adenomas benign occasionally contain malignant solid nodule found physical examination referral endocrinologist thyroidologist otolaryngologist may occur
