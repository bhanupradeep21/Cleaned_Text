discovered team research chemists british laboratory eli lilly company laboratory assigned explore new antiarthritic compounds lilly applied patents named new drug benoxaprofen seven years later also filed permission us food drug administration start testing benoxaprofen humans undergo threestep clinical testing procedure required united states federal lilly began phase benoxaprofen clinical trials testing selection healthy human volunteers tests prove new drug posed clear immediate safety hazards phase ii larger number human subjects including minor illnesses tested drugs effectiveness safety major target tests phase iii largest test began arthritis patients administered benoxaprofen physicians physicians reported results lilly lilly formally requested begin marketing benoxaprofen january us fda document consisted pages test results patients records however benoxaprofen first marketed abroad released marketing united kingdom subsequently came market may benoxaprofen market oraflex usa first sign trouble came lilly company british medical journal reported may physicians united kingdom believed drug responsible least twelve deaths mainly caused kidney liver failure petition filed oraflex removed august british government temporarily suspended sales drug uk grounds safety british committee safety medicines declared telegram fda received reports adverse side effects among patients used oraflex also deaths elderly people almost simultaneously fda said reports deaths usa among oraflex users caused kidney liver eli lilly company suspended sales benoxaprofen molecular formula benoxaprofen systematic iupac name acid molecule molecular mass benoxaprofen essentially planar molecule due coplanarity benzoxazole phenyl rings molecule also nonplanar side chain consisting propanoic acid moiety acts carrier group findings obtained xray crystallographic measurements made lilly research benoxaprofen highly phototoxic free radical decarboxylated derivative drug toxic agent presence oxygen yields singlet oxygen superoxide anion irradiation benoxaprofen aqueous solution causes photochemical decarboxylation via radical mechanism singlestrand breaks dna also happens ketoprofen naproxen nsaids even active respect benoxaprofen racemic mixture acid two enantiomers r inversion r enantiomer glucuronide conjugation metabolise benoxaprofen however benoxaprofen readily undergo oxidative however possible cytochrome catalyst oxygenation ring occurs enantiomer likely oxygenation aromatic ring acid moiety occurs also cytochrome benoxaprofen absorbed well oral intake doses ranging mgkg unchanged drug detected plasma mostly bound plasma proteins plasma levels benoxaprofen eleven subjects accurately predicted based twocompartment open model mean halflife absorption hours means within minutes half dose absorbed system mean halflife distribution hours means within hours half dose distributed throughout entire system mean halflife elimination hours means

foetus big difference species route excretion man rhesus monkey rabbit mostly excreted via urine rat dog excreted via biliaryfaecal excretion man dog compound excreted ester glucuronide species unchanged compound means major metabolic transformation benoxaprofen takes unlike nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs benoxaprofen acts directly mononuclear cells inhibits chemotactic response inhibiting lipoxygenase benoxaprofen analgesic antipyretic antiinflammatory benoxaprofen given patients rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis antiinflammatory effect patients pagets disease psoriatic

types side effects cutaneous gastrointestinal side effects appear rarely central nervous system miscellaneous side effects often observed study shows side effects appear patients rheumatoid cutaneous side effects benoxaprofen photosensitivity onycholysis rash milia increased nail growth pruritus itch photosensitivity leads burning itching redness patients exposed study shows benoxaprofen lipoxygenaseinhibiting agents might helpful treatment psoriasis migration inhibition inflammatory cells leukocytes gastrointestinal side effects benoxaprofen bleeding diarrhoea abdominal pain anorexia mouth ulcers taste according study appearing gastric side effects vomiting heartburn epigastric small number people taking benoxaprofen might result depression lethargy feeling faintness dizziness headache palpitations epistaxis blurred vision urinary urgency gynaecomastia rarely appear patients take benoxaprofen also cause hepatotoxicity led death elderly main reason benoxaprofen withdrawn market suspension sales toxic effects benoxaprofen could humans looked deeply fairly planar compound benoxaprofen seems hepa phototoxic human benoxaprofen rather long halflife man hours undergoes biliary excretion enterohepatic circulation also known slow plasma clearance cl millilitre per minute halflife may increased elderly patients years age patients already renal impairment increasing figures high fetal hepatotoxicity benoxaprofen attributed accumulation drug repeated dosage also associated slow plasma clearance hepatic accumulation drug presumably cause increase activity hepatic cytochrome oxygenate benaxoprofen produce reactive intermediates benoxaprofen likely substrate weak inducer cytochrome enzyme family normally metabolised oxidative reactions enantiomer benoxaprofen cytochrome catalyst oxygenation ring aromatic ring propionic acid seems possible therefore induction minor metabolic pathway leads formation toxic metabolites considerable amounts toxic metabolites may bind vital intracellular macromolecules may generate reactive oxygens redox cycling quinone could also lead depletion protective glutathione responsible detoxification reactive observed skin phototoxicity patients treated benoxaprofen explained look structure compound significant structural similarities benzoxazole ring benoxaprofen benzofuran ring psoralen compound known phototoxic free decarboxylated derivate drug produce singlet oxygen superoxide anions presence oxygen furthermore possible explanations photochemical decarboxylation oxygen radical formation may accumulation repeated dosage induction cytochrome emergence reactive intermediates covalent binding photochemical character compound cause inflammation severe tissue animals peroxisomal proliferation also observed seem significant effects benoxaprofen animals tested series benoxaprofen considerable antiinflammatory analgesic also antipyretic activity six animals tested included rats dogs rhesus monkeys rabbits guinea pigs mice drug well absorbed orally three six species benoxaprofen effectively taken gastrointestinal tract oral doses plasma halflife found different less hours dog rabbit monkey notable longer mice furthermore species differences found rate route excretion compound whereas benoxaprofen excreted urine rabbit guinea pig biliary excretion way clearance found rats dogs species unchanged benoxaprofen found plasma mostly extensively bound excretion unchanged compound bile occur slowly rats interpreted authors evidence enterohepatic circulation takes another research rats showed plasma membrane hepatocytes begun form blebs administration benoxaprofen suggested due disturbances calcium concentration possibly result altered cellular redox state effect mitochondrial function therefore cause disturbances calcium none species significant levels metabolism benoxaprofen found happened dogs glucuronide could found bile sure sign metabolism species also differences distribution compound normal pregnant rats found shown rats benoxaprofen distributed foetus notable lower concentration maternal sandmeyer reaction diazotisation followed acid hydrolysis leads phenol undergoes nitration
