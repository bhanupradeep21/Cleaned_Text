krabbe disease kd also known globoid cell galactosylceramide lipidosis rare often fatal lysosomal storage disease results progressive damage nervous system kd involves dysfunctional metabolism sphingolipids inherited autosomal recessive pattern disease named danish neurologist knud krabbe symptoms asymptomatic infantileonset months birth lateronset krabbe disease present differently individuals infantileonset krabbe disease display progressive neurologic deterioration infancy death age symptoms include irritability fevers limb stiffness seizures feeding difficulties like gerd vomiting staring episodes slowing mental motor development first stages disease doctors often mistake symptoms cerebral palsy symptoms include muscle weakness spasticity deafness optic atrophy optic nerve blindness paralysis difficulty swallowing prolonged weight loss may also occurcitation needed individuals lateronset krabbe disease much slower disease progression individuals may also display symptoms esotropia slurred speech slow development loss motor krabbe disease caused mutations galc gene located chromosome inherited autosomal recessive manner mutations galc gene cause deficiency enzyme called rare cases may caused lack active saposin derivative buildup unmetabolized lipids adversely affects growth nerves protective myelin sheath covering insulates many nerves resulting demyelination severe progressive degeneration motor skills part group disorders known leukodystrophies krabbe disease results imperfect growth development myelincitation needed galactosylceramidase deficiency also results buildup glycosphingolipid called psychosine toxic oligodendrocytes type nonneuronal cell found nervous system collectively termed ways help pinpoint presence krabbe disease newborn screening krabbe disease includes assaying dried blood cells galc enzyme activity molecular analysis evidence galc enzyme mutations infants displaying low enzyme activity andor enzyme mutations referred additional diagnostic testing neurological galc enzyme activity observed symptomatic individuals krabbe high concentration psychosine dried blood spots may also identified marker krabbe study discovered individuals krabbe disease lateronset individuals tend abnormal increase csf protein disease may diagnosed characteristic grouping certain cells multinucleated globoid cells nerve demyelination degeneration destruction brain cells special stains myelin eg luxol fast blue may used aid diagnosiscitation needed new missouri include krabbe newborn screening indiana started screening although known cure krabbe disease bone marrow transplantation hematopoietic stem cell transplantation hsct shown benefit cases early course disease generally treatment disorder symptomatic supportive physical therapy may help maintain increase muscle tone circulationcitation needed study developmental outcomes children krabbe disease underwent hsct first seven weeks birth found patients better prognosis lifespan functionality slower progression even symptomatic individuals lateronset krabbe disease may benefit hsct diagnosed early umbilicalcord blood typically used source transplant stem clinical trials gene therapy currently enrolling symptom management particularly difficult individuals infantile onset symptoms tend progress treatment krabbe disease management condition typically supportive aimed alleviating symptoms frequent evaluation encouraged order anticipate onset preparation certain physical therapy help alleviate motor difficulties increase strength mobility gastrostomy tubes used circumvent feeding difficulties prevent aspiration simultaneous gastrostomy tube insertion nissen fundoplication procedure commonly performed prevent need secondary surgical individuals krabbe disease severe motor deficits tend susceptible overfeeding require less calorie consumption thus consume fewer calories caretakers may also evidence routine vaccines may accelerate disease progression many individuals krabbe disease tend follow traditional vaccination infantile krabbe disease death usually occurs early childhood study found one two threeyear survival rates respectively surviving longer patients lateonset krabbe disease tend slower progression disease live significantly disease impact humans animals monkeys mice dogs observed develop krabbe disease well certain gene deletions frequent others novel mutations resulting krabbe disease discovered worldwide commonly underlying cause disease deletion galc gene causes deficiency galc enzyme circumstance patients european mexican mortality rate early infantile krabbe disease age two later onset symptoms associated longer life expectancy older children generally surviving two seven years initial krabbe disease occurs one disease genetic incidence rates vary widely population incidence rate extremely low japan cases per live births united states krabbe disease occurs approximately every live scandinavian countries report incidence rates one certain communities krabbe disease much frequent druze community israel incidence rate every live higher rate thought due part high frequency consanguineous marriages almost druze marriages found firstcousin familial reported cases krabbe disease among jewish time onset also varies frequency location early infantile krabbe disease common
