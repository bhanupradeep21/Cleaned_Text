cerebral angiography form angiography provides images blood vessels around brain thereby allowing detection abnormalities arteriovenous malformations pioneered portuguese neurologist egas moniz university lisbon also helped develop thorotrast use typically catheter inserted large artery femoral artery threaded circulatory system carotid artery contrast agent injected series radiographs taken contrast agent spreads brains arterial system second series reaches venous system applicationscitation needed cerebral angiography may yield better images less invasive methods computed tomography angiography magnetic resonance angiography addition cerebral angiography allows certain treatments performed immediately based findings recent decades cerebral angiography assumed therapeutic
