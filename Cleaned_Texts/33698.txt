nervous system endocrine system collaborate digestive system control gastric secretions motility associated movement food throughout gastrointestinal tract including peristalsis segmentation contractions gastric activity involved digestion divided three phases digestion known cephalic phase gastric phase intestinal phase phases overlap three occur fourth phase acid secretion known basal state occurs times meals interdigestive phase level acid secretion times regulated body weight individual number parietal cells time day acid secretion lowest morning awakening highest cephalic phase digestion stage stomach responds mere sight smell taste thought food total acid secretion occurs food enters stomach sensory mental inputs converge hypothalamus induce responses needed preparing gastrointestinal tract food processing relays signals medulla vagus nerve fibers medulla stimulate parasympathetic nervous system stomach turn stimulates gastric secretion via parietal g enhanced secretory activity brought thought sight food conditioned reflex occurs food desired appetite depressed part cephalic reflex inhibited sensory stimuli food activate dorsal motor nucleus vagus nerve medulla activating parasympathetic nervous system insulin induced hypoglycemia also stimulates vagus nerve results four distinct physiological events body stomach vagal postganglionic muscarinic nerves release acetylcholineach stimulates parietal cell h secretion lamina propria body stomach ach released vagal endings triggers histamine secretion ecl cells histamine also stimulates h secretion parietal cells antrum peptidergic postganglionic parasympathetic vagal neurons enteric nervous system neurons release grp stimulates antral g cells produce release gastrin gastrin stimulates gastric acid secretion directly stimulating parietal cells well promoting histamine secretion ecl cells antrum corpus vagus nerve inhibits cells thus reducing release somatostatin reducing background inhibition gastrin gastric chief cells primarily activated ach however decrease ph caused activation parietal cells activates gastric chief cells alternatively acid duodenum stimulate cells secrete secretin acts endocrine path deactivate gastric chief cells total gastric acid secretion occurs phase gastric phase period swallowed food semidigested protein peptides amino acids activate gastric activity ingested food stimulates gastric activity two ways stretching stomach gastric contents stimulating receptors stretch activates two reflexes short reflex mediated myenteric nerve plexus long reflex mediated vagus nerves vagovagal reflex distention stretching activates afferent pathway turn stimulates efferent response dorsal nucleus vagus nerve stimulation acid secretion occurs cephalic phase local ens pathway activated ens releases ach stimulating parietal cells secrete dietary protein digested breaks smaller peptides amino acids directly stimulate g cells secrete even gastrin positive feedback loop accelerates protein digestion discussed earlier gastrin stimulates activating parietal cells stimulating ecl produce histamine histamine stimulates parietal cells produce small peptides also buffer stomach acid ph fall excessively low gastric secretion stimulated chiefly three chemicals acetylcholine ach histamine gastrin ach secreted parasympathetic nerve fibers short long reflex ml pathways histamine paracrine secretion enteroendocrine cells gastric glands gastrin hormone produced enteroendocrine g cells pyloric three stimulate parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid intrinsic factor chief cells secrete pepsinogen response gastrin especially ach ach also stimulates mucus low intragastric ph stimulates antral cells release somatostatin somatostatin inhibits gastrin release g cells reduced gastrin secretion reduces acid gastric secretion occurs intestinal phase stage duodenum responds arriving chyme moderates gastric activity hormones nervous reflexes duodenum initially enhances gastric secretion soon inhibits presence partially digested proteins amino acids duodenum stimulates acid secretion stomach four methods peptones stimulate duodenal g cells secrete gastrin peptones stimulate unknown endocrine cell release additional humoral signal enterooxytonin amino acids absorbed duodenum stimulate acid secretion unknown mechanisms osmolarity due products digestion stimulate acid secretion acid semidigested fats duodenum trigger enterogastric reflex duodenum sends inhibitory signals stomach way enteric nervous system sends signals medulla inhibit vagal nuclei thus reducing vagal stimulation stomach stimulate sympathetic neurons send inhibitory signals stomach chyme also stimulates duodenal enteroendocrine cells release secretin cholecystokinin primarily stimulate pancreas gall bladder also suppress gastric secretion motility effect gastrin secretion declines pyloric sphincter contracts tightly limit admission chyme duodenum gives duodenum time work chyme already received loaded enteroendocrine cells also secrete glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide originally called gastricinhibitory peptide longer thought significant effect stomach concerned stimulating insulin secretion preparation processing nutrients absorbed small small continuous basal secretion gastric acid meals usually less basal electrical rhythm controls smooth
