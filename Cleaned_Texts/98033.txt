cabarzia extinct genus varanopid early permian germany contains single species cabarzia trostheidei based wellpreserved skeleton found red beds goldlauter formation cabarzia shared many similarities mesenosaurus romeri varanopid russia although retain differences curved claws wide ulnare muscle scars sacral ribs long slender hindlimbs narrow body elongated tail short thick forelimbs cabarzia likely capable running bipedally escape predators behavior shared modern lizards oldest animal known adaptations bipedal locomotion predating eudibamus bipedal bolosaurid parareptile slightly younger

small permian amniotes basal synapsids parareptiles eureptiles argued likely varanopid closely related mesenosaurus part subfamily mesenosaurinae named previous year specimen assigned name cabarzia trostheidei honor locale collection dorsal vertebrae long centra widely spaced zygapophyses giving hourglass shape seen neural spines low rectangular bladelike cabarzias vertebrae relatively simple varanopid standards distinct lateral excavations mammillary processes mesenosaurus also lacks characteristics seemingly holocephalous singleheaded ribs already short begin diminished towards hip likely two sacral vertebrae based number sacral ribs sacral ribs apparently flared extent contacted pelvis like mesenosaurus although cabarzia additionally possessed knoblike scars upper surface sacral ribs caudal tail vertebrae fairly elongated thick hookshaped caudal ribs proportionally similar apsisaurus preserved portions shoulder girdle indicate cabarzia thin scapula convex front edge pelvis included ilium long low dorsal blade pubis small forelimb short robust relative long slender hindlimb humerus particular thick large entepicondyle cabarzias entepicondylar foramen located near elbow far position otherwise seen mesenosaurus among basal synapsids radius relatively short slightly longer humerus straight unlike twisted radius mesenosaurus cabarzias carpals wrist bones proportionally similar mesenosaurus broad intermedium fairly large proximal carpals centralecentralia however also differs due characteristically wide ulnare retention two centralia tiny pisiform bone also preserved much smaller varanodontines hand relative metacarpal proportions cabarzia close femur neither particularly robust slender thin angular internal trochanter like varanopids diapsids tibia fibula relatively long length femur ratio tibia longest toe foot fourth toe like mesenosaurus astragalus large simple calcaneum abutted along slightly concave edge surrounding narrow hole fourth distal tarsal large unfused fifth distal tarsal mesenosaurus elongated fourth metatarsal proximal projection contacted short fifth metatarsal position fossil suggests cabarzia fifth toe angled relative rest foot one clear differences cabarzia mesenosaurus fact mesenosaurus long rather straight unguals cabarzia shorter deeper sharply curved characteristic also known hands fused neural spines wellossified joints indicate holotype specimen cabarzia adult animal curved claws cabarzia tambacarnifex likely adapted predation contrast straight claws mesenosaurus varanops may useful digging broad ulnare adaptation also seen aquatic animals although evidence aquatic habits cabarzias proportions short forelimbs thin body long hindlimbs tail similar modern lizards capable bipedalism also match tambach bolosaurid eudibamus although sprawling ankle foot cabarzia specialized bipedal habits may indicate cabarzia engage active bipedalism slow methodical walking hindlimbs rather passive bipedalism shift bipedal posture running high speeds due center weight behind hindlimbs advantage passive bipedalism fully understood even living reptiles though may involved increased coordination assistance capture flying insects mesenosaurines mesenosaurus shared cabarzias adaptations bipedalism may increased hip musculature habituate lifestyle information mesenosaurine foot proportions afforded description cabarzia indicates good candidates trackmakers dromopus common permian reptile footprint ichnogenus traditionally assumed created araeoscelidian diapsids although known dromopus fossils seem correspond bipedal animals likely due bipedalism mesenosaurines restricted rare circumstances forced escape predators cabarzia oldest known mesenosaurine predates previously oldest known
