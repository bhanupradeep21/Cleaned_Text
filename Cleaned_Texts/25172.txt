partial leg dromaeosaurid within abdominal cavity comprising complete lower leg foot toes claws natural articulated leg part one foot long large relation abdominal cavity clearly situated within lying ribs ji colleagues suggested could indicate preyed upon smaller birdlike dinosaur discovery indicated sinocalliopteryx may agile active fierce predator especially since compsognathids found presumably fastmoving lizards small mammals abdominal dromaeosaurid tentatively identified individual sinornithosaurus length metres ft study also reported newly discovered remains prey animals dromaeosaurid leg

portions skeleton embedded surrounding rock authors interpreted gastroliths gizzard stones similar found nqwebasaurus baryonyx theropods caudipteryx mongolian ornithomimid also found gastroliths though cases stones much numerous smaller size ji colleagues speculated since later two dinosaurs probably primarily herbivores number size gastroliths may correspond diet herbivores ingested many small stones carnivores ingested larger stones aid however study could find gastroliths second specimen therefore concluded stones holotype swallowed accident case special gizzard would second
