sexual arousal also known sexual excitement describes physiological psychological responses preparation sexual intercourse exposed sexual stimuli number physiological responses occur body mind preparation sexual intercourse continue intercourse male arousal lead erection female arousal bodys response engorged sexual tissues nipples vulva clitoris vaginal walls vaginal lubrication mental stimuli physical stimuli touch internal fluctuation hormones influence sexual arousal sexual arousal several stages may lead actual sexual activity beyond mental arousal physiological changes accompany given sufficient sexual stimulation sexual arousal reaches climax orgasm may also pursued sake even absence orgasm depending situation person sexually aroused variety factors physical mental person may sexually aroused another person particular aspects person nonhuman object physical stimulation erogenous zone acts foreplay result arousal especially accompanied anticipation imminent sexual activity sexual arousal may assisted romantic setting music soothing situation sexual arousal come porn sexual material potential stimuli sexual arousal vary person person one time another level arousal stimuli classified according sense involved somatosensory touch visual olfactory scent auditory stimuli also possible though generally considered secondary role threecitation needed erotic stimuli result sexual arousal include conversation reading films images smell setting generate erotic thoughts memories person given right context may lead person desiring physical contact including kissing cuddling petting erogenous zone may turn make person desire direct sexual stimulation breasts nipples buttocks andor genitals sexual activity erotic stimuli may originate source unrelated object subsequent sexual interest example many people may find nudity erotica pornography sexually may generate general sexual interest satisfied sexual activity sexual arousal achieved dependent use objects referred sexual fetishism instances paraphilia common belief women need time achieve arousal however recent scientific research shown considerable difference time men women require become fully aroused scientists mcgill university health centre montreal canada used method thermal imaging record baseline temperature change genital area define time necessary sexual arousal researchers studied time required individual reach peak sexual arousal watching sexually explicit movies pictures came conclusion average women men took almost time sexual arousal around time needed foreplay strongly individual varies one occasion next depending unlike many animals humans mating season sexes potentially capable sexual arousal throughout year sexual arousal people positive experience aspect sexuality often sought person normally control respond arousal normally know things situations potentially stimulating may leisure decide either create avoid situations similarly persons sexual partner normally also know partners erotic stimuli turnoffs people feel embarrassed sexual arousal sexually inhibited people feel aroused every occasion exposed erotic stimuli act sexual way every arousal person take active part sexual activity without sexual arousal situations considered normal depend maturity age culture factors influencing person however person fails aroused situation would normally produce arousal lack arousal persistent may due sexual arousal disorder hypoactive sexual desire disorder many reasons person fails aroused including mental disorder depression drug use medical physical condition lack sexual arousal may due general lack sexual desire due lack sexual desire current partner person may always low sexual desire lack desire may acquired persons life hand person may hypersexual desire engage sexual activities considered abnormally high relation normal development culture suffering persistent genital arousal disorder spontaneous persistent uncontrollable arousal physiological changes associated arousal sexual arousal causes various physical responses significantly sex organs genital organs sexual arousal man usually indicated swelling erection penis blood fills corpus cavernosum usually prominent reliable sign sexual arousal males woman sexual arousal leads increased blood flow clitoris vulva well vaginal transudation seeping moisture vaginal walls serves lubrication males normal correlate erection penis male sexual arousal physical psychological stimulation leads vasodilation increased blood flow engorges three spongy areas run along length penis two corpora cavernosa corpus spongiosum penis grows enlarged firm skin scrotum pulled tighter testes pulled however relationship erection arousal onetoone arousal midforties men report always erection sexually equally male erection occur sleep nocturnal penile tumescence without conscious sexual arousal due mechanical stimulation eg rubbing bed sheet alone young one strong experience enough sexual arousal erection result passing thought sight passerby erect penis may gain enough stimulation contact inside clothing maintain encourage sexual arousal stimulation continues likely glans head erect penis swell wider genitals become engorged blood color deepens testicles grow larger testicles continue rise feeling warmth may develop around perineum sexual stimulation heart rate increases blood pressure rises breathing becomes increase blood flow genital regions may lead sex flush sexual stimulation continues orgasm begins muscles pelvic

stimulation lead vaginal wetness engorgement swelling clitoris labia along increased redness darkening skin areas blood flow increases changes internal organs also occur including internal shape vagina position uterus within changes include increase heart rate well blood pressure feeling hot flushed perhaps experiencing sex flush may extend chest upper body sexual stimulation continues sexual arousal may peak orgasm orgasm women want stimulation sexual arousal quickly dissipates suggestions published continuing sexual excitement moving one orgasm stimulation maintaining regaining state sexual arousal lead second subsequent women experienced multiple orgasms quite spontaneously young women may become sexually aroused quite easily reach orgasm relatively quickly right stimulation right circumstances physical psychological changes womens sexual arousal responses age older women produce less vaginal lubrication studies investigated changes degrees satisfaction frequency sexual

physiological measurements sexual arousal studies found temperature change specific genitals sexual arousal supports validity categoryspecificity refers person showing sexual arousal categories people prefer sex sexual arousal studies involving categoryspecificity look genital responses physiological changes well subjective responses people report arousal levels categoryspecific sexual arousal commonly found amongst men heterosexual men experience much higher genital subjective arousal women men pattern reversed homosexual studies found women noncategoryspecific genital response pattern sexual arousal meaning genital responses modestly related preferred hand female subjective responses categoryspecific typically report highest level arousal preferred stimulus although reported difference levels arousal typically much smaller possible explanation noncategory specific genital arousal women also accounts high individual variation preparation hypothesis hypothesis suggests

ability perceive internal versus external genital engorgement subjectively measured vaginal photoplethysmography vpg thermography respectively chivers found mens womens concordance similar thermography used measure genital sexual arousal vpg used however studies using thermography conducted research required determine whether gender difference concordance measurement artifact true phenomenon several hormones affect sexual arousal including testosterone cortisol estradiol however specific roles hormones testosterone commonly studied hormone involved sexuality plays key role sexual arousal males strong effects central arousal connection testosterone sexual arousal complex females research found testosterone levels increase result sexual cognitions females use hormonal also women participate polyandrous relationships higher levels testosterone however unclear whether higher levels testosterone cause increased arousal turn multiple partners whether sexual activity multiple partners cause increase inconsistent study results point idea testosterone may play role sexuality women effects obscured coexistence psychological affective factors human sexuality well
