necrotizing vasculitis also called systemic necrotizing category comprising vasculitides present examples include giant cell microscopic polyangiitis granulomatosis polyangiitis uses variant necrotizing vasculopathy classifying conditions together use dedicated phrase instead calling polyarteritis nodosa allied conditions using influential classification known chapel hill consensus conference terms systemic vasculitis primary systemic vasculitides commonly although word necrotizing omitted conditions described largely giantcell arteritis takayasus arteritis much usually affect patients different takayasus arteritis affecting younger people giantcell arteritis later age onset aortitis also considered largevessel takayasu arteritis primarily affects aorta main branches least three six criteria yields sensitivity specificity giant cell temporal arteritis chronic vasculitis large medium vessels primarily affecting cranial branches arteries arising aortic arch least three

leptomeningeal biopsy several vasculitides affect small granulomatosis polyangiitis gpa systemic vasculitis medium small arteries including venules arterioles produces granulomatous inflammation

cryoglobulinemic vasculitis often due hepatitis c infection immune complexes cryoglobulins proteins consists immunoglobulins complement precipitate cold dissolving upon rewarming deposited walls

erythematosus sle rheumatoid arthritis ra relapsing polychondritis beh√ßets disease connective tissue disorders vasculitis secondary viral infection usually due hepatitis b c human immunodeficiency virus cytomegalovirus virus parvovirus patients usually present systemic symptoms single multiorgan dysfunction common nonspecific complaints include fatigue weakness fever joint pains abdominal pain hypertension chronic kidney disease neurologic dysfunction following symptoms raise strong suspicion vasculitis detailed history important elicit recent medications risk hepatitis infection recent diagnosis connective tissue disorder systemic lupus erythematosus sle thorough physical exam needed usual treatment targeted underlying cause however vasculitis general treated steroids eg methylprednisolone underlying cause vasculitis due hyperactive immunological damage immunosuppressants cyclophosphamide azathioprine may also given systematic review antineutrophil cytoplasmic
