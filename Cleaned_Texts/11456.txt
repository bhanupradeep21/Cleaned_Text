paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis pkc also called paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia pkd hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized attacks involuntary movements triggered sudden voluntary movements number attacks increase puberty decrease persons involuntary movements take many forms ballism chorea dystonia usually affect one side body one limb particular rare disorder affects pkd accounting types paroxysmal occurs often males females two types pkd primary secondary primary pkd broken familial sporadic familial pkd means individual family history disorder common sporadic cases also secondary pkd caused many medical conditions multiple sclerosis ms stroke hypocalcemia hypoglycemia central nervous system trauma peripheral nervous system pkd also linked infantile convulsions choreoathetosis icca syndrome patients afebrile seizures infancy benign familial infantile epilepsy develop paroxysmal choreoathetosis later phenomenon actually quite common individuals pkd reporting history afebrile seizures paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias often inherited autosomal dominant fashion several genes identified mutations cause disease genes typically code proteins known involved synaptic transmission ion channels ion first gene identified gene chromosome found cause disease mutations gene included nonsense mutation identified genome one family insertion mutation identified genome another researchers found mutations sporadic cases affected pkd thus suggests gene mutated subset pkd pkd genetically later reports identified genes causes pathophysiology pkd fully explained mechanisms suggested thus far multiple methods used study potential brain abnormalities individuals pkd compared normal individuals methods include spect studies fmri studies diffusion tensor imaging main problem many studies concerned pathophysiology disorder small sample size studies normally include patients pkd results generalized entire population patients however studies bring possibilities study study joo et al researchers performed interictal studies meaning scanned patients brain attacks find underlying abnormality rather ictal scans look abnormalities present researchers found interictally decreased cerebral blood flow posterior parts bilateral caudate however literature state although could cause pkd could also result another spect study showed increase cerebral blood flow left posterior thalamus pkd patient researchers also subtracted ictal postictal scans saw increased blood flow thalamus ultimately suggested hyperactive blood flow area could causing pathophysiology pkd study however performed one patient would need replicated many times order generalized population pkd patients spect studies cited showing hyperactivity basal study zhou et researchers performed fmri studies pkd patients analyzed differences amplitude low frequency fluctuations alff patients found left postcentral gyrus bilateral putamen increased alff pkd researchers concluded hyperactivity regions suggested dysfunction basal gangliathalamocortical circuit pkd circuit part motor control circuit brain making reasonable place abnormality movement disorder researchers still unsure role differences found play disease pathology diffusion tensor imaging dti displays physical alterations brain may seen regular one study researchers found patients abnormalities thalamus however prove patients abnormalities thalamus cases cited including patient developed similar paroxysmal dyskinesia thalamic implicating abnormality thalamus individuals could contribute pkd fully known however role thalamic abnormality plays disease pathophysiology paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia diagnosed using strict set guidelines criteria studied confirmed bruno et al study individuals age onset years old attacks involuntary movements last less one minute known trigger usually sudden voluntary movement example pkd patient stands begins walking sedentary period time person goes walk run trigger attack persons pkd lose consciousness attacks full memory entire attack lastly people disorder good response medication usually prescribed anticonvulsants study also found patients familial pkd exhibit symptoms follow diagnostic criteria closely sporadic pkd individuals may deviate prior criteria diagnosis set many patients pkd often diagnosed form epilepsy many patients also experience aura similar experienced epilepsy preceding attacks patients describe tingling sensation affected limb butterflies stomach individuals also precipitants stress anxiety make likely attacks occur diagnostic criteria also set pkd apart paroxysmal dyskinesias include paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia pnkd paroxysmal exerciseinduced dyskinesia ped pkd attacks last less one minute pnkd attacks last minutes hours name suggests attacks occur sudden voluntary movement like additionally pkd almost always managed drug therapy pnkd responsive anticonvulsants ped hand separates pkd caused prolonged exercise attacks ped cease soon exercise almost patients respond positively antiepileptic anticonvulsant drugs one drugs often mentioned literature carbamazepine widely used drug treating pkd anticonvulsants like valproic acid phenytoin clonazepam common alternatives categories drugs also used dopamine affecting drugs like levodopa individuals disorder also modify behavior lessen attacks without influence drug therapy example decreasing stress avoid precipitants help patients decrease number attacks addition avoiding sudden movements also prevent attack order prevent attack individuals use auras warning others purposefully perform slow gestures movements prior triggering many individuals end growing attacks age even without medicinal therapy patients go back attacks period regards secondary pkd treatment primary condition lessen pkd attacks movement disorder similar pkd first mentioned research literature mount reback described disorder consisting attacks involuntary movements unlike pkd attacks lasted minutes hours found caused alcohol caffeine named paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis kertesz later described another new movement disorder described disorder induced sudden movements responded anticonvulsants naming paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis finally review demirkiran jankovic stated disease called paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia instead pointing attacks could manifest form dyskinesia httpsenwikipediaorgwikiparoxysmalkinesigenicchoreoathetosis
