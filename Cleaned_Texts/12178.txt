brain injury known posttraumatic seizures pts however everyone posttraumatic seizures continue posttraumatic epilepsy latter chronic condition however terms pts pte used interchangeably medical seizures due posttraumatic epilepsy differentiated nonepileptic posttraumatic seizures based cause timing trauma person pte late seizures occurring week initial late seizures considered unprovoked early seizures occurring within week trauma thought result direct effects injury provoked seizure one results exceptional nonrecurring cause immediate effects trauma rather defect brain indication thus diagnosis pte seizures must unprovoked disagreement exists whether define pte occurrence one late unprovoked seizures whether condition diagnosed people two medical sources usually consider pte

injury necessarily due epilepsy even head like anyone else tbi survivors may seizures due factors including imbalances fluid electrolytes epilepsy causes hypoxia insufficient oxygen ischemia insufficient blood flow withdrawal alcohol another potential cause thus factors must ruled causes seizures people head injury diagnosis pte made prevention pte involves preventing brain trauma general protective measures include bicycle helmets child safety specific treatment exists prevent development epilepsy tbi past antiepileptic drugs used intent preventing development however antiepileptic drugs prevent early pts clinical studies failed show prophylactic use antiepileptic drugs prevents development antiepileptic drugs clinical trials failed stop pte developing clear several explanations drugs may simply capable preventing epilepsy drug trials may set way allow benefit drugs found eg drugs may given late inadequate animal studies similarly failed show much protective effect commonly used seizure medications pte trials phenytoin antiepileptic drugs recommended prevent late seizures people pte already diagnosed preventative basis aforementioned studies treatment widely accepted prevent development however proposed narrow window one hour tbi may exist administration antiepileptics could prevent epileptogenesis development evidence support went usage antiepileptic drugs
