icahn genomics institute biomedical genomics research institute within icahn school medicine mount sinai new york city aim establish new generation medicines better treat diseases afflicting world including cancer heart disease infectious pathogens institute doctors scientists developing employing new types treatments utilize dna rna based therapies crispr sirna rna vaccines car cells searching novel drug targets use functional genomics data science institute led brian brown leading expert gene therapy genetic engineering molecular institute primary goal improve patient care use gene cell nucleotide therapies achieve goal institute formed crossdisciplinary mix clinicians scientists include physicians treating patients novel gene therapies mount sinai health system biologists developing testing new drugs drug platforms data scientists working identify causative agents disease targeted therapy building predictive models better characterize disease models constructed multiple layers biological data including gene expression metabolite dna protein information combined phenotypic clinical data predictive modeling probabilistic analysis try elucidate complex mechanisms research institute falls six scientists institute published paper nature genetics demonstrating ability derive enough information nondna sources identify individuals whose supposedly anonymized biological data stored large research authors reported measuring rna levels tissue allowed infer genetic barcode could used match materials individual noteworthy validation existing concerns among genomics scientists may possible prevent identification individual genetic data even data meant anonymous plos biology paper institute founding director eric schadt led research team utilized six different types data metabolite concentration gene expression dna variation dnaprotein binding proteinmetabolite interaction proteinprotein interaction reconstruct networks involved cell institute scientists published paper journal cell reporting findings networkbased study lateonset alzheimers disease researchers constructed gene regulatory networks discovered neural structure involved pathway associated onset january scientists institute division psychiatric genomics including pamela sklar published two papers journal nature explored genetic complexity exome sequencing studies populations bulgaria sweden revealed disorder likely caused lot rare genetic mutations rather common projects also established world largest database schizophrenia may institute faculty published proofofconcept findings support clinical development rna interference therapy acute hepatic porphyria led development givosiran first therapy acute hepatic porphyria approved fda institute researchers clinicians also led phase clinical trials institute director brian brown developed new crispr imaging technology called perturbmap capable identifying regulators tumor findings published cell perturbmap used study identify cytokine interferon gamma ifng tumor growth factor beta receptor tgfbr regulators two pathways significantly affecting tumor growth architecture immune cell institute faculty member samir parekh published results clinical trial blood advances focused secondline treatments relapsed multiple myeloma study reported response rate patients treated tcell redirection therapy chimeric antigen receptor cart cells bispecific antibodies biabs secondline treatment firstline immunotherapy treatment also brian browns research published results study targeting solid tumors chimeric antigen receptor cart cell therapy previously successful blood researchers engineered car cells target destroy macrophages immune cell supporting tumor growth ovarian lung pancreatic tumors mice models successfully shrunk tumors prolonged institute faculty member ivan marazzis research team published nature paper identifying immune systems role amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als study found immune system dysfunction patients mice als showed high concentration cells spinal cord blood study among first publications describe immune systems involvement institute formed institute genomics multiscale biology part mount sinais department genetics genomic sciences eric schadt named founding institute renamed philanthropist carl icahn pledged million parent organization icahn school medicine mount institute received certification first cliaapproved nextgeneration sequencing lab new york institute faculty andrew kasarskis michael linderman george diaz ali bashir randi zinberg taught first class mount sinai medical students able fully sequence analyze former institute member joel dudley named one creative people business list compiled fast magazine said chose dudley splicing information quality medical care institute collaboration sage bionetworks announced new project aiming genotype million people goal identifying rare biological mechanisms keep people healthy genetic variants cause resilience project aimed scan genomes healthy people age older contribute dna effort initial focus diseases scientists anticipated finding protective mechanisms mendelian diseases would straightforward finding ones complex multifactorial based analysis publicly available data human genomes scientists involved resilience project estimated one person mechanism protecting diseasecausing
