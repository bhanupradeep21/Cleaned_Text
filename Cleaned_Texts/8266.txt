neurofibromatosis type von recklinghausen syndrome complex multisystem human disorder caused mutation neurofibromin gene chromosome responsible production protein neurofibromin needed normal function many human cell types causes tumors along nervous system grow anywhere body one common genetic disorders limited persons race sex autosomal dominant disorder means mutation deletion one copy allele gene sufficient development although presentation varies widely often different even relatives affected least people us people uk diagnosed nf common symptoms include brownishred spots colored part
