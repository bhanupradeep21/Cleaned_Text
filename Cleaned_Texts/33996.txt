compartment syndrome condition increased pressure within one bodys anatomical compartments results insufficient blood supply tissue within two main types acute compartments leg arm commonly symptoms acute compartment syndrome acs include severe pain poor pulses decreased ability move numbness pale color affected commonly due physical trauma bone fracture cases crush injury also caused acute exertion also occur blood flow returns following period poor blood diagnosis generally based upon persons may supported measurement intracompartmental pressure activity normal compartment pressure
