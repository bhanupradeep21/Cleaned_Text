coelom main body cavity many positioned inside body surround contain digestive tract organs animals lined mesothelium animals molluscs remains undifferentiated past practical purposes coelom characteristics used classify bilaterian animal phyla informal groups term coelom derives ancient greek word κοιλία koilía meaning coelom mesodermally lined cavity gut outer body wall development embryo coelom formation begins gastrulation stage developing digestive tube embryo forms blind pouch called archenteron protostomes coelom forms process known archenteron initially forms mesoderm splits two layers first attaches body wall ectoderm forming parietal layer second surrounds endoderm alimentary canal forming visceral layer space parietal layer visceral layer known coelom body cavity deuterostomes coelom forms archenteron wall produces buds mesoderm mesodermal diverticula hollow become coelomic cavities deuterostomes therefore known enterocoelomates examples deuterostome coelomates belong three major clades chordates vertebrates tunicates lancelets echinoderms starfish sea urchins sea cucumbers hemichordates acorn worms graptolites evolutionary origin coelom uncertain oldest known animal body cavity vernanimalcula current hypothesis includecitation coelom absorb shock provide hydrostatic skeleton also support immune system form coelomocytes may either attached wall coelom may float freely coelom allows muscles grow independently body wall feature seen digestive tract tardigrades water bears suspended within body mesentery derived mesodermlined coelom fluid inside coelom known coelomic fluid circulated mesothelial cilia contraction muscles body wallclarification coelomic fluid serves several functions acts hydroskeleton allows free movement growth internal organs serves transport gases nutrients waste products around body allows storage sperm eggs maturation acts reservoir past zoologists grouped bilaterian animal phyla based characteristics related coelom practical purposes knowing explicitly stating groups phylogenetically related animals classified three informal groups according type body cavity possess nontaxonomic utilitarian way acoelomata pseudocoelomata coelomata groups never intended represent related animals sequence evolutionary traits however although scheme followed number college textbooks general classifications almost totally abandoned formal classification indeed late one author molecular phylogeny study mistakenly called classification scheme traditional morphologybased coelomate animals coelomata also known eucoelomates true coelom body cavity called coelom complete lining called peritoneum derived mesoderm one three primary tissue layers complete mesoderm lining allows organs attached suspended particular order still able move freely within cavity bilateral animals including vertebrates coelomates pseudocoelomate animals pseudocoelom literally false cavity fluid filled body cavity tissue derived mesoderm partly lines fluid filled body cavity animals thus although organs held place loosely well organized coelomate pseudocoelomates protostomes however protostomes pseudocoelomates example pseudocoelomate roundworm pseudocoelomate animals also referred blastocoelomate acoelomate animals like flatworms body cavity semisolid mesodermal tissues gut body wall hold organs place coeloms developed triploblasts subsequently lost several lineages lack coelom correlated reduction body size coelom sometimes incorrectly used refer developed digestive tract organisms may possess coelom may false coelom pseudocoelom animals coeloms called coelomates without called acoelomates also subtypes coelomcitation needed according brusca following bilaterian phyla possess coelom protostomes embryonic blastocoele persists body cavity protostomes fluid filled main body cavity unlined partially lined tissue derived mesoderm fluidfilled space surrounding internal organs serves several functions like distribution nutrients removal waste supporting body hydrostatic skeleton pseudocoelomate blastocoelomate invertebrate animal threelayered body pseudocoel coelom apparently lost reduced result mutations certain types genes affected early development thus pseudocoelomates evolved pseudocoelomate longer considered valid taxonomic group since monophyletic however still used descriptive term important characteristics according brusca bilaterian pseudocoelomate phyla include authors list following phyla pseudocoelomatescitation needed ecdysozoan pseudocoelomates spiralian pseudocoelomates acoelomates lack fluidfilled body cavity body wall digestive tract cause serious disadvantages fluid compression negligible tissue surrounding organs animals compress therefore acoelomate organs protected crushing forces applied animal outer surface coelom used diffusion gases metabolites etc creatures need surface area volume ratio large enough allow absorption nutrients gas exchange diffusion alone due dorsoventral flattening according others acoelomates include cnidarians jellyfish allies ctenophores comb jellies platyhelminthes flatworms including tapeworms etc
