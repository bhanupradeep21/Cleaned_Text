blastulation stage early animal embryonic development produces blastula mammalian development blastula develops blastocyst differentiated inner cell mass outer trophectoderm blastula greek βλαστός blastos meaning sprout hollow sphere cells known blastomeres surrounding inner fluidfilled cavity called embryonic development begins sperm fertilizing egg cell become zygote undergoes many cleavages develop ball cells called morula blastocoel formed early embryo become blastula blastula precedes formation gastrula germ layers embryo common feature vertebrate blastula consists layer blastomeres known blastoderm surrounds mammals blastocyst contains embryoblast inner cell mass eventually give rise definitive structures fetus trophoblast goes form extraembryonic blastulation significant amount

blastula blastocyst mammals sphere cells surrounding fluidfilled cavity called blastocoel blastocoel contains amino acids proteins growth factors sugars ions components necessary cellular differentiation blastocoel also allows blastomeres move process xenopus embryos blastula composed three different regions animal cap forms roof blastocoel goes primarily form ectodermal derivatives equatorial marginal zone compose walls blastocoel differentiate primarily mesodermal tissue vegetal mass composed blastocoel floor primarily develops endodermal mammalian blastocyst three lineages give rise later tissue development epiblast gives rise fetus trophoblast develops part placenta primitive endoderm becomes yolk mouse embryo blastocoel formation begins stage process water enters
