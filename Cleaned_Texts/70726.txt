tarsal tunnel syndrome tts nerve entrapment syndrome causing painful foot condition tibial nerve compressed travels tarsal tunnel found along inner leg behind medial malleolus bump inside ankle posterior tibial artery tibial nerve tendons tibialis posterior flexor digitorum longus flexor hallucis longus muscles travel bundle tarsal tunnel inside tunnel nerve splits three segments one nerve calcaneal continues heel two medial lateral plantar nerves continue bottom foot tarsal tunnel delineated bone inside flexor retinaculum outside patients tts typically complain numbness foot radiating big toe first three toes pain burning electrical sensations tingling base foot depending area entrapment areas affected entrapment high entire foot affected varying branches tibial nerve become involved ankle pain also present patients high level entrapments inflammation swelling occur within tunnel number reasons flexor retinaculum limited ability stretch increased pressure eventually cause compression nerve within tunnel pressure increases nerves blood flow nerves respond altered sensations like tingling numbness fluid collects foot standing walking makes condition worse small muscles lose nerve supply create cramping feeling symptoms tinels sign tingling electric shock sensation occurs tap affected nerve sensation usually travels foot also travel inner leg well difficult determine exact cause tarsal tunnel syndrome important attempt determine source problem treatment potential outcome treatment may depend cause anything creates pressure tarsal tunnel cause tts would include benign tumors cysts bone spurs inflammation tendon sheath nerve ganglions swelling broken sprained ankle varicose veins may may visible also cause compression nerve tts common athletes active people people put stress tarsal tunnel area flat feet may cause increase pressure tunnel region cause nerve compression lower back problems may symptoms back problems regions suspect might suggest double crush issue one crush nerve pinch entrapment lower back second tunnel area cases tts simply rheumatoid arthritis also associated neurofibromatosis also cause tts disease results formation pigmented cutaneous neurofibromas masses specific case shown ability invade tarsal tunnel causing pressure therefore resulting diabetes makes peripheral nerve susceptible nerve compression part double crush contrast carpal tunnel syndrome due one tunnel wrist median nerve four tunnels medial ankle tarsal tunnels positive tinel sign tap inside ankle tingling felt foot chance decompressing tarsal tunnel

role needle electromyography remains less tarsal tunnel syndrome tts closely related carpal tunnel syndrome cts much less common studies found patients rheumatoid arthritis ra show signs distal limb neuropathy posterior tibial nerve serves victim peripheral neuropathy often show signs tts amongst ra patients therefore tts common discovery found autoimmune disorder rheumatoid exact cause tarsal tunnel syndrome tts vary patient patient however result true patients compression posterior tibial nerve branches travels around medial malleolus causes pain irritation many possible causes compression tibial nerve therefore variety prevention strategies one immobilization placing foot neutral position brace pressure relieved tibial nerve thus reducing patients eversion inversion plantarflexion cause compression tibial nerve therefore neutral position tibial nerve less agitated typically recommended patient sleeping another common problem improper footwear shoes deforming foot due tight lead increased pressure tibial footwear tightens foot extended periods time even lead tts therefore simply properly fitted shoes tts prevented treatments typically include rest manipulation strengthening tibialis anterior tibialis posterior peroneus short toe flexors casting walker boot corticosteroid anesthetic injections hot wax baths wrapping compression hose orthotics medications may include various antiinflammatories anaprox medications ultracet neurontin lyrica lidocaine patches also treatment helps patients multiple ways tarsal tunnel treated pain reduced initial treatment whether conservative surgical depends severity tarsal tunnel much pain patient study done treated patients diagnosed tarsal tunnel syndrome conservative approach meaning program patients participated consisted physiotherapy exercises orthopedic shoe inserts addition program fourteen patients supplementary tibial nerve mobilization exercises instructed sit edge table slumped position ankle taken dorsiflexion ankle eversion knee extended flexed obtain optimal tibial nerve mobilization patients groups showed positive progress medial calcaneal medial plantar lateral plantar nerve areas reduction pain successful nonoperative conservative also option localized steroid cortisone injection may reduce inflammation area therefore relieving pain simple reduction patients weight reduce pressure noninvasive treatment measures fail tarsal tunnel release surgery may recommended decompress area incision made behind ankle bone towards far bottom foot posterior tibial nerve identified ankle separated accompanying artery vein followed tunnel nerves released cysts spaceoccupying problems may corrected time scarring within nerve branches relieved internal neurolysis neurolysis outer layer nerve wrapping opened scar tissue removed within nerve following surgery large bulky cotton wrapping immobilizes ankle joint without plaster dressing may removed oneweek point sutures three weeks complications may include bleeding infection unpredictable healing incision may open swelling may considerable pain cramping regenerating nerve fibers may create shooting pains patients may hot cold sensations may feel worse surgery crutches usually recommended first two weeks well elevation minimize swelling nerve grow one inch per month one expect continue healing process course one year many patients report good results however experience improvement worsening symptoms pfeiffer article los angeles citation needed fewer patients reported improvement complication rate tarsal tunnel greatly impact patients quality life depending severity ability walk distances people normally take granted grocery shopping may become compromised proper pain management counseling often required results
