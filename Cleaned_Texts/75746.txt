marine habitats species like blue whale humpback whale migratory ranges comprise nearly entire ocean whales typically migrate seasonal basis moving warmer waters give birth raise young travelling cooler waters optimal feeding cetacean species smaller ranges concentrated around either tropical subtropical waters cetaceans live exclusively within single marine body narwhal whose range limited arctic comparison modern hippopotamuses confined entirely african continent despite widespread across europe africa hippos considered vulnerable limited lakes rivers wetlands southern whales hippos must surface order breathe pose problems sleeping whippomorphs cetaceans overcome problem exhibiting unihemispheric sleep meaning rest one side brain time allowing swim surface rest hippopotamuses surface breathe every three five minutes process partially subconscious allowing hippopotamuses surface breathe whilst whales hippos exhibit symbiotic relationships smaller fish use cleaning stations allowing smaller organisms feed parasites enter creatures hippos herbivores normally diet consists entirely short grasses graze hippos observed consuming animals zebra even hippo hippo normally spends

birds seals whippomorphs placental mammals meaning embryos fed placenta draws nutrients mothers body kselected organisms producing limited number offspring high rate hippos reach sexual maturity six years age gestation period approximately eight months mating typically occurs water female hippopotamuses isolate two weeks prior giving birth birthing process also takes place underwater meaning
