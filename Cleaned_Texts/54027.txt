bilateral cingulotomy form psychosurgery introduced alternative lobotomy today mainly used treatment obsessivecompulsive disorder early years twentyfirst century used russia treat also used treatment chronic objective procedure severing supracallosal fibres cingulum bundle pass anterior cingulate cingulotomy introduced alternative standard prefrontal leucotomylobotomy hope alleviating symptoms mental illness whilst reducing undesirable effects standard operation personality changes etc suggested american physiologist john farquhar fulton meeting society british neurosurgeons said feasible cingulectomy man would seem appropriate place limited leucotomy derived hypothesis james papez thought cingulum major component anatomic circuit believed play significant role first reports use cingulotomy psychiatric patients came j le beau paris hugh cairns oxford kenneth livingston bilateral cingulotomy targets anterior cingulate cortex part limbic system system responsible integration feelings emotion human cortex consists cingulate gyrus parahippocampal gyrus amygdala hippocampal studies patients subject bilateral cingulotomy involving fmri analyses showed anterior cingulate cortex key role cognitive control highly likely involved control attentional response whereas dorsal part region brain identified involved process although still function dorsal part cingulate cortex connected sorting processing conflicting information signals addition neuroimaging studies also indicated anterior cingulate cortex participates modulation cortical regions higher order well sensory processing findings also confirmed stereotactic microelectrode analysis single cortical neurons study involved nine patients undergoing bilateral study investigated effect performing attention demanding tasks activity neurons located anterior cingulate cortex upon analyzing results study concluded anterior cingulate cortex indeed involved modification cognitive tasks require attention based fact change basal firing rate neurons region simulation neuroimaging also uncovered different subregions anterior cingulate cortex based function studies showed caudal part anterior cingulate cortex plays important function cognitive activities involve attention salience interference response results combined electrophysiological investigation function neurons anterior cingulate cortex provided insights used improvement cingulotomy performed patients treated ocd basis behind idea fact variation certain tasks emotional stroop tasks es particularly identified exerting effects ocd patients activate neurons rostral part anterior cingulate cortex thus theoretically bilateral cingulotomy performed patient rostral anterior cingulate cortex better results moreover ocd associated malformation basal function part human brain mapped composed fiber tracks associated numerous parallel corticostriatothalamocortical circuits cstc involved sensorimotor motor oculomotor well cognitive processes manifested limbic pathway involves gabaergic inhibitory projections serve one means communication different structures hypothesized forms ocd result disinhibition one several circuits operate also indicated finding showed significant decrease intracortical inhibition ocd thus lesions anterior cingulate cortex might contribute lessening disinhibition effect hypothesis confirmed another study assessed cortical inhibitory excitatory mechanisms study measured excitability motor cortex well intracortical inhibition ocd patients control group healthy results showed significant decrease intracortical inhibition resulted slowdown interstimulus intervals addition proximity association limbic system amygdala particular plays key role emotional experience anterior cingulate cortex shares afferent efferent pathways number thalamic nuclei well posterior cingulate part parietal frontal supplementary motor underline high likelihood anterior cingulate cortex must involvement ocd functional mri analyses anterior cingulate cortex also led introduction bilateral cingulotomy treatment chronic pain application introduced since anterior cingulate cortex found related processing nociceptive information input particular role anterior cingulate cortex interpretation stimulus affects person rather actual physical book published described operation carried time cases procedure started medical team taking number ct scan xray images brain patient step ensured exact target cingulate cortex mapped surgeon could identify burr holes created patients skull using drill lesions targeted tissue made help fine electrodes inserted right angle subjects brain based plotting charts making sure important arteries blood vessels intact electrode placed probe holder tip projecting upon correct insertion holder brain tissue air injected scan images taken medical team made sure right track tip electrode advanced plane cingulate heated first lesion created served center around several lesions created order confirm whether lesions made right place scan images taken postoperatively recent technological advances however made bilateral cingulotomy precise operation example nowadays neurosurgical team performs procedure use mri identify location anterior posterior commissures approach allows neurosurgeons obtain number coronal images used calculate stereotactic coordinates target anterior cingulate cortex lesions need made moreover mri enables precise differentiation cell composition thus easily permits identification grey matter region confirmed help microelectrode patients usually recover operation period four days however cases subjects released hospital hours operation mild shorter postoperative complications commonly related bilateral cingulotomy typical head interventions include limited nausea vomiting headaches however cases patients exhibit seizures sometimes appear two months surgical intervention questioned whether relevant attributed cingulotomy seizures observed patients already history study conducted massachusetts general hospital analyzed outcome bilateral cingulotomy patients treatment ocd period patients followed long term evaluated based several criteria many respondersa period six months many cingulotomies patient undergone examination effectiveness procedure whether patient showed significant change recent procedure side effects related procedure followup patients produced contradictory results indicated bilateral cingulotomy optimal treatment patients fit responder criteria showed significant improvement compared subjects another exhibited signs improvement multiple cingulotomies correlated higher likelihood continuing respond followup inquiries often fit full responder criteria often fit partial responder criteria however side effects associated procedure numerous among complaints patients surgery apathy deficits memory although rarely reported addition subjects complained form urinary disturbance ranging urinary retention incontinence hydrocephalus seizures also bilateral cingulotomy also used treatment chronic refractory pain systematic review studies encompassing patients found anterior cingulotomy led significant pain relief greater patients postoperatively well one year following included studies one clinical study investigated effect bilateral cingulotomy treatment refractory chronic case patients subject cingulotomies total followed analyses aimed determining much pain individual affected procedure help questionnaire addition examiners tried evaluate impacts social family relations participants study based data obtained cingulotomy treatment chronic pain showed promising results reported improvement level pain experienced indicated longer required painkillers cingulotomy half patients also claimed surgical procedure beneficial contributed improvement social httpsenwikipediaorgwikibilateralcingulotomy
