system cells part inflammatory tnf signaling occurs two receptors constituitively expressed cell types whereas restricted primarily endothelial epithelial subsets immune signaling tends proinflammatory apoptotic whereas signaling antiinflammatory promotes cell suppression signaling important treatment autoimmune whereas signaling promotes wound tnfα exists transmembrane form mtnfα
