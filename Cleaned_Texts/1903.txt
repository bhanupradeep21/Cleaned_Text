intrapersonal communication also known autocommunication inner speech communication oneself selftoself communication examples thinking oneself ill better next time made mistake imagining conversation ones boss preparation leaving work early often understood exchange messages sender receiver person theorists use wider definition goes beyond messagebased accounts focuses role meaning making sense things intrapersonal communication happen alone social situations may prompted internally occur response changes environment intrapersonal communication encompasses great variety phenomena central type happens purely internally exchange within ones mind researchers see form wider sense however also types selftoself communication mediated external means like writing diary shopping list oneself verbal intrapersonal communication messages formulated using language contrast nonverbal forms sometimes used imagination memory one contrast among inner verbal forms selftalk inner dialogue selftalk involves one voice talking inner dialogue several voices linked different positions take turns form imaginary interaction phenomena related intrapersonal communication include planning problemsolving perception reasoning selfpersuasion introspection dreaming models intrapersonal communication discuss components involved interact many models hold process starts perception interpretation internal external stimuli cues later steps involve symbolic encoding message becomes new stimulus models identify self sender receiver others see self complex entity understand process exchange different parts self different selves belonging person intrapersonal communication contrasts interpersonal communication sender receiver distinct persons two phenomena influence various ways example positive negative feedback received people affects person talks themself intrapersonal communication involved interpreting messages received others formulating responses role theorists hold intrapersonal communication foundation communication position generally accepted alternative hold intrapersonal communication internalized version interpersonal communication many functions influences intrapersonal communication usually understood significant psychological phenomenon plays key role mental health specifically relation positive negative selftalk negative selftalk focuses bad aspects self times excessively critical way linked psychological stress anxiety depression step commonly associated countering negative selftalk become aware negative patterns steps challenge truth overly critical judgments foster positive patterns thought special relevance regard selfconcept ie person sees themself specifically selfesteem evaluate abilities characteristics intrapersonal communication thoroughly researched forms communication one reason difficult study since happens primarily internal process another reason term often used wide sense making difficult demarcate phenomena belong intrapersonal communication communication takes place within person larry barker gordon wiseman define creating functioning evaluating symbolic processes operate primarily within typical forms selftalk inner dialogue example employee decides leave work early may engage inner dialogue mentally going possible negative comments boss potential responses inner experiences also commonly included imagination visualization form communication involves sending receiving messages selftoself communication sense sender receiver contrasts interpersonal communication sender receiver distinct intrapersonal communication examined discipline known communication theorists like james watson anne hill restrict definition intrapersonal communication inner experiences goes inside heads like talking oneself within ones wider sense also includes external forms selftoself communication speaking oneself aloud private speech writing diary shopping list regard matters sender receiver person matter whether external medium used slightly different conception presented piotr k oleś et al reject idea sender receiver person based idea one imaginary dialogues people friend teacher lost relative oleś et al hold instead hallmark intrapersonal communication happens mind one scholars see process searching interpreting information central aspect intrapersonal communication applies specifically inner monologues reflections oneself people frank j macke dean barnlund stress mechanical exchange messages sufficient intrapersonal communication meaning making sense regard intrapersonal communication distinguished intraorganismic communication takes place personal level exchange information organs intrapersonal communication need cut outer influences often happens reaction example hearing familiar piece music may stir memories lead internal dialog past similar sense intrapersonal communication restricted situations person alone instead also happens social circumstances may occur simultaneously interpersonal case example interpreting another person said formulating response enunciating theorists like mary j farley hold intrapersonal communication essential part communication therefore always accompanies interpersonal context organizations term autocommunication sometimes used synonym employed describe selfcommunication workspace example synchronous autocommunication used mentally reassuring oneself drafting letter asynchronous autocommunication hand takes form reminders term also sometimes used various types intrapersonal communication distinguished academic literature term often used wide sense includes many central contrast based whether exchange happens purely internally mediated external means internal type discussed form plays mind one person without externally expressing message includes mental processes like thinking meditating reflecting however also external forms intrapersonal communication like talking aloud oneself form private examples notetaking school writing diary preparing shopping list praying reciting external intrapersonal communication also characterized fact sender receiver person difference external medium used express another distinction focuses role language discussions academic literature concerned verbal intrapersonal communication like selftalk inner hallmark messages expressed using symbolic coding system form contrast nonverbal forms like forms imagination visualization regard intrapersonal communication used example explore piece music would sound painting among inner verbal forms intrapersonal communication oftendiscussed contrast selftalk inner dialogue case inner dialogue two positions considered exchange takes place contrasting usually happens form different voices taking turns arguing position conceptualized analogy interpersonal communication exchange different subjects selves ipositions within person example facing difficult decision one part person may argue favor one option another part prefers different option inner dialogue also take form exchange imagined partner case anticipating discussion ones spouse imaginary conversations celebrities lost relatives selftalk inner monologue hand split different positions speech directed oneself commenting ones performance telling oneself try selftalk positive negative depending person evaluates themself example failed exam student may engage negative selftalk saying im stupid positive selftalk like dont worry ill better next many differences selftalk inner dialogue inner dialogue usually complex used simulate social situations examine topic different angles goal frequently explore differences conflicting points view make sense strange positions integrate different also plays central role identity construction one function selftalk selfregulation functions include selfdistancing motivation selfevaluation reflection selftalk often happens reaction anticipation certain situations help agent prepare appropriate response may also used regulate emotions cope unpleasant experiences well monitor selftalk inner dialogue distinct phenomena one quickly turn example intrapersonal communication may start selftalk evolve inner dialogue positions intrapersonal communication linked great range phenomena include planning problemsolving internal conflict resolution well judgments oneself forms perception understanding well conceptualization interpretation environmental cues phenomena data processing like drawing inferences thinking selfpersuasion well memory introspection dreaming imagining various models communication proposed aim provide simplified overview process communication showing main components focus primarily interpersonal communication specifically formulated intrapersonal communication according model proposed barker wiseman intrapersonal communication starts reception external internal stimuli carrying external stimuli belong senses usually provide information environment internal stimuli include wide range impressions concerning state body like pain also encompassing barkerwiseman model early step intrapersonal communication focuses classifying stimuli process many weaker stimuli filtered reaching conscious level may still affect communication despite similar process groups remaining stimuli according urgency runs parallel attempts attach symbolic meaning stimuli form decoding processes take place influenced factors like communicators social background current environment symbolic decoding process ideation occurs form thinking organizing information planning proposing last step thus conceived ideas encoded symbolic form expressed using words gestures movements process happen right ideation results generation transmission stimuli either purely internal also external generated stimuli work feedback loop leading back reception interpretation sense person sender receiver feedback makes possible communicator monitor correct another model communication proposed dean barnlund aims give account communication encompasses interpersonal intrapersonal side identifies communication transmission messages production meaning response internal external intrapersonal communication simpler case since one person person perceives private cues like internal thoughts feelings public cues originating environment behavioral cues form behavior one part communication process decoding interpreting cues goal make sense reduce uncertainty accompanied activity encoding behavioral responses cues two processes happen simultaneously influence sheila steinberg follows graeme burton richard dimbleby understanding intrapersonal communication process involving five elements decoding integration memory perceptual sets decoding consists making sense messages integration puts individual pieces information extracted way relation processes like comparing contrasting memory stores previously received information especially relevant regard intrapersonal communication concept one oneself newly received information relates perceptual sets ingrained ways organizing evaluating information example feminine masculine traits conceived encoding last step meaning processed previous steps expressed symbolic form message sent many theorists focus concept self intrapersonal communication variety definitions many agree self entity unique individual ie shared theorists understand intrapersonal communication relation self self others see self complex entity made different parts analyze exchange interaction parts closely related approach talk distinct parts single self different selves person like emotional self intellectual self physical views intrapersonal communication understood analogy interpersonal communication exchange different parts either case intrapersonal relationships play central role concern person relates example see wish intrapersonal relationships directly observable instead inferred based changes perceived example inferences persons selfesteem drawn based whether respond compliment bragging playing intrapersonal interpersonal communication involve exchange messages interpersonal communication sender receiver distinct persons like talking friend phone intrapersonal communication one person occupies despite difference two closely related example theorists like linda costigan lederman conceptualize inner dialogue analogy social interaction exchange different parts two phenomena also influence various ways example positive negative feedback person receives people shapes selfconcept see turn implications talk form positive negative converse also true person talks affects interact one reason form inner dialog usually involved talking others interpret say determine one wants communicate example persons intrapersonal communication characterized selfcriticism may make hard accept praise people basic level affect messages people interpreted example overly selfcritical person may interpret honest compliment form however selftalk may also interfere ability listen example person important meeting later today thoughts may racing around topic making person less responsive interactions cases listener keen making response may cause attention focus mainly selftalk formulating message result may miss important aspects current speaker positive effective selftalk hand tends make people better communicating one way become better interpersonal communication become aware selftalk able balance need another discussion academic literature question whether intrapersonal communication sense basic interpersonal based idea form intrapersonal communication necessary accompanies interpersonal example person receives message friend inviting favorite restaurant often various internal reactions message sending answer return reactions include sights scents memories previous visits checking whether would clash plans devising route get restaurant reactions forms intrapersonal examples include selftalk attempt evaluate positions expressed speaker assess whether one agrees disagrees intrapersonal communication also occur without another party reasons theorists like james honeycutt sheila steinberg claimed intrapersonal communication foundation forms similar claims intrapersonal communication omnipresent requirement preliminary interpersonal however claim primacy intrapersonal communication generally accepted many theorists hold social interaction basic often see inner speech internalized derivative version social closely related issue concerns questions interpersonal intrapersonal communication interact development children according jean piaget example intrapersonal communication develops first manifests form egocentric speech happens play activities may help child learn control activities plan ahead piaget holds early stage children yet fully social beings concerned developing individuality view interpersonal speech arises later persons view opposed lev vygotsky argues intrapersonal communication happens internalization interpersonal communication according children learn tools selftalk parents talk regulate behavior example suggestions warnings commands intrapersonal communication may understood attempt child regulate behavior similar intrapersonal communication serves great variety include internalization selfregulation processing information communication theorist james p lantolf characterizes exceptionally powerful pervasive tool identifies two significant functions internalize cultural norms ways thinking regulate ones activity selfregulatory function intrapersonal communication sometimes understood analogy interpersonal communication example parents may influence behavior children uttering phrases like wait think child learned employed control behavior uttering internally way people learn modify accept reject plans according larry ehrlich intrapersonal communication three main functions one function monitor environment ensure safe regard selftalk used analyze perceptions plan responses case direct indirect threats detected closely related function bring harmony inner outer world making sense oneself ones environment third function existential nature aims dealing many theorists also draw close connection processes searching interpreting inner speech may needed many higher mental processes work vital role mental functions shaping controlling ones thoughts regulating ones behavior reasoning problemsolving planning well remembering often accompanies diverse communicative tasks listening speaking reading writing example understand expression formulate new specific applications calm oneself stressful internalize new knowledge learning second language happens repeating new vocabulary oneself order remember intrapersonal communication also applied great variety creative tasks like using come musical compositions paintings dance stanley b cunningham lists total functions characteristics commonly ascribed intrapersonal communication include talking oneself dialogue different parts self perception well interpreting environmental cues ascribing meaning functions problemsolving decisionmaking introspection reflection dreaming goal external forms intrapersonal communication like taking notes school writing shopping list aid memory cases also help break address complex problem series smaller steps solving mathematical equation line importance intrapersonal communication reflected affects phenomena example argued people engage positive selftalk usually better problemsolving communicating others including listening skills negative intrapersonal communication hand linked insecurities low selfesteem may lead negative interactions others example people suffering imposter syndrome continuously affected selfdoubt anxiety negative intrapersonal communication tends revolve around fears skills inadequate may regard intrapersonal communication affects persons selfview emotions whether see themself capable help build maintain selfconfidence may also create defense mechanisms additionally plays central role selfdiscovery intrapersonal communication also relevant field literature particular interest literary studies term stream mental phenomenon continuous flow momentary states consciousness lived subject include experiences like sensory perceptions thoughts feelings stream consciousness usually seen form intrapersonal communication term sometimes used synonym interior literary criticism term refers narrative technique style writing used express stream experiences usually happens presenting thoughts character directly without summary explanation narrator aims give reader immediate impression characters experience like often takes unpunctuated disjointed form violates rules grammar logic oftendiscussed examples found dorothy richardsons pilgrimage james joyces ulysses virginia woolfs mrs closely related phenomena introspective writing inner speech writing usually understood forms externalized inner speech person writes portions inner way intrapersonal communication conducted responsible positive mental health mental illness pertains specifically positive negative selftalk well relation selftalk form talking oneself differs inner dialogue since involves one voice internal exchange several common distinction positive negative selftalk based evaluative attitude expressed negative selftalk inner voice focuses bad aspects self often excessively critical way take form telling oneself im never going able im good negative selftalk already develop childhood based feedback others particularly people negative selftalk occasional occurrence happens frequently cases detrimental effects mental health example affect emotional wellbeing evoking negative mood lead stress anxiety depression also negatively affect persons confidence various areas example concerning body positive selftalk hand involves seeing oneself positive light linked mental health benefits include higher selfesteem wellbeing well reducing effects depression personality disorders associated lower stress levels reduced risk selfharm effects positive negative selftalk often discussed sport psychology common idea regard positive selftalk enhances performance negative selftalk hinders empirical evidence supporting position yet thoroughly like forms communication intrapersonal communication trained improved effective often happens goal reducing negative selftalk fostering positive selftalk instead early step often become aware negative patterns acknowledge existence followed questioning challenging negative evaluations since often exaggerated person may also try stop replace positive example person becomes aware negative thinking process may try inhibit direct attention positive similar approach used cognitive behavioral therapy central idea field set negative core beliefs responsible negative selftalk include beliefs like im unlovable im unworthy world threatening im unable face challenges key therapeutic method improving intrapersonal communication become aware beliefs question approach focuses practice mindfulness raising selfawareness may improve selfesteem intrapersonal practice consists directing ones attention experiences present moment without evaluation abstaining value judgments may help avoid overly critical evaluations instead foster attitude different forms selftalk different effects person one form coping selftalk main aim help person cope difficult situation experiencing anxiety consists emphasizing persons strengths skills without implying perfection help people calm become clear goals realistically achieve another relevant form instructional selftalk focuses attention components task improve performance physical tasks however may negative effects people already skilled forms selftalk address self employing firstperson pronouns others use secondperson pronouns generally speaking people likely use secondperson pronoun need selfregulation imperative overcome difficulties facilitation hard use firstperson intrapersonal pronouns frequent people talking study sanda dolcos dolores albarracin indicates using secondperson pronoun provide selfsuggestions effective promoting intentions carry behaviors selfconcept plays key role intrapersonal communication persons selfconcept think feel example relation appearance attitudes well strengths seeing oneself sincere respectful thoughtful one selfconcept seeing oneself mean abusive deceitful terms selfimage selfesteem sometimes used synonyms theorists draw precise distinctions according carl rogers selfconcept three parts selfimage ideal self selfworth selfimage concerns properties person ascribes themself idealself ideal person strives toward want like selfworth corresponds whether see themself overall good bad many theorists use term selfesteem instead selfesteem central aspect characterizing intrapersonal communication refers persons subjective evaluation abilities characteristics subjective evaluation may differ facts often based mainly emotional outlook less rational example skilled people suffer imposter syndrome leads believe imposters lacking skills actually selfesteem matters mental health low selfesteem linked problems ranging depression loneliness alienation drug abuse teenage selfesteem also affects person communicates themself self static inborn entity changes throughout interactions people effect individuals selfimage especially true relation judge person receiving positive negative feedback important inner speech strongly associated sense self development sense children tied development however cases internal monologue inner voice considered external self examples auditory conceptualization negative critical thoughts inner critic kind divine delusion called thought similar topic discussed simon jones charles fernyhough explain cases auditory verbal hallucinations form inner speech auditory verbal hallucinations cases person hears speech without external stimulation view speech inner action controlled agent pathological cases recognized action leads auditory verbal hallucination since voice experienced external alien intrapersonal communication researched thoroughly types communication one reason additional problems concerning study conceptualize difficulty regard easy observe interpersonal communication due fact mostly occurs internally without immediate external since directly observable inferred based changes visible example seeing person dresses well takes care health one may infer certain intrapersonal relationships responsible behavior similar inference persons inner life could drawn based whether respond compliment bragging playing approach use questionnaires study intrapersonal communication questionnaires sometimes used process include
