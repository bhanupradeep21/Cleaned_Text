kinship terminology system used languages refer persons individual related kinship different societies classify kinship relations differently therefore use different systems kinship terminology example languages distinguish consanguine affinal uncles ie brothers ones parents husbands sisters ones parents respectively whereas others one word refer father brothers kinship terminologies include terms address used different languages communities different relatives terms reference used identify relationship relatives anthropologist lewis henry morgan performed first survey kinship terminologies use around world though much work considered dated argued kinship terminologies reflect different sets distinctions example kinship terminologies distinguish sexes difference brother sister generations difference child parent moreover argued kinship terminologies distinguish relatives blood marriage although recently anthropologists argued many societies define kinship terms blood however morgan also observed different languages extension societies organize distinctions differently proposed describe kinship terms terminologies either descriptive classificatory descriptive term used represent one type relationship two people classificatory term represents one many different types relationships example word brother englishspeaking societies indicates son parent thus englishspeaking societies use word brother descriptive term persons male first cousin could mothers brothers son mothers sisters son fathers brothers son fathers sisters son englishspeaking societies therefore use word cousin classificatory term morgan discovered descriptive term one society become classificatory term another society example societies one would refer many different people mother woman gave birth oneself well sister husbands sister also ones fathers sister moreover societies group together relatives englishspeaking societies classify together example languages oneword equivalent cousin different terms refer ones mothers sisters children ones fathers sisters children armed different terms morgan identified six basic patterns kinship terminologies basic principles
