thermal imaging camera colloquially known tic type thermographic camera used firefighting rendering infrared radiation visible light cameras allow firefighters see areas heat smoke darkness heatpermeable barriers thermal imaging cameras typically handheld may helmetmounted constructed using heat waterresistant housings ruggedized withstand hazards fireground operations expensive pieces equipment popularity adoption firefighters united states increasing markedly due increased availability government equipment grants following september attacks thermal imaging cameras pick body heat normally used cases people trapped rescuers find thermal imaging camera consists five components optic system detector amplifier signal processing fireservice specific thermal imaging cameras incorporate components ruggedized waterproof parts work together render infrared radiation given warm objects flames visible light representation real camera display shows infrared output differentials two objects temperature appear many thermal imaging cameras use grayscale represent normal temperature objects highlight dangerously hot surfaces different cameras may handheld camera requires one hand position operate leaving one free hand tasks easily transferred firefighters majority thermal imaging cameras use fire service handheld models national institute standards technology fire research division lead government agency developing performance standards fire service thermal imaging cameras united states although us army night vision laboratory contributed preliminary recommendations field include visible lowbattery warnings ability withstand full immersion water ability provide meaningful visual readouts beyond since thermal imaging cameras see darkness smoke allow firefighters quickly find seat structure fire see heat signature visually obscured used search victims outdoors cool night spot smoldering fires inside detect overheating electrical thermal imaging cameras credited saving multiple lives per year victim identification removal low visibility conditions early addition ability see dense smoke thermal imaging cameras also see materials
