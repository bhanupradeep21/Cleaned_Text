social network analysis mathematical sociology interpersonal ties defined informationcarrying connections people interpersonal ties generally come three varieties strong weak absent weak social ties argued responsible majority embeddedness structure social networks society well transmission information networks specifically novel information flows individuals weak rather strong ties close friends tend move circles information receive overlaps considerably already know acquaintances contrast know people thus receive novel included definition absent ties according american sociologist mark granovetter relationships ties without substantial significance nodding relationships people living street tie example frequent vendor one would buy relations familiar strangers also called invisible ties since hardly observable often overlooked relevant type nevertheless support peoples sense familiarity furthermore fact two people may know name necessarily qualify existence weak tie interaction

point view weak ties play role affecting social cohesion social network theory social relationships viewed terms nodes ties nodes individual actors within networks ties relationships actors many kinds

tie situation would create according granovetter called forbidden triad words tie according logic always present whether weak strong given two strong ties direction weak tie hypothesis postulates clumps cliques social structure form bound predominately strong ties weak ties function crucial bridge two densely knit clumps close may follow individuals bridging weak ties deprived information distant parts social system confined provincial news views close friends however large number weak ties mean novel information effectively swamped among high volume information even crowding strong
