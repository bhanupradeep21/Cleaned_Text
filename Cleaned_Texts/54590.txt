biochemistry fermentation theory refers historical study models natural fermentation processes especially alcoholic lactic acid fermentation notable contributors theory include justus von liebig louis pasteur latter developed purely microbial basis fermentation process based experiments pasteurs work fermentation later led development germ theory disease put concept spontaneous generation although fermentation process used extensively throughout history prior origin pasteurs prevailing theories underlying biological chemical processes fully understood contemporary fermentation used production various alcoholic beverages foodstuffs fermentation anaerobic metabolic process converts sugar acids gases alcohols oxygen starved environments yeast many microbes commonly use fermentation carry anaerobic respiration necessary survival even human body carries fermentation processes time time longdistance running lactic acid build muscles course longterm exertion within human body lactic acid byproduct atpproducing fermentation produces energy body continue exercise situations oxygen intake processed fast enough although fermentation yields less atp aerobic respiration occur much higher rate fermentation used humans consciously since around bce evidenced jars recovered iran zagros mountains area containing remnants microbes similar present winemaking process prior pasteurs research fermentation existed preliminary competing notions one scientist substantial degree influence theory fermentation justus von liebig liebig believed fermentation largely process decomposition consequence exposure yeast air theory corroborated liebigs observation decomposing matter rotten plant animal parts interacted sugar similar manner yeast decomposition albuminous matter ie watersoluble proteins caused sugar transform liebig held view death different theory supported charles cagniard de la tour cell theorist theodor schwann claimed alcoholic fermentation depended biological processes carried brewers louis pasteurs interest fermentation began noticed remarkable properties amyl byproduct lactic acid alcohol biochemical studies particular pasteur noted ability rotate plane polarized light unsymmetric arrangement behaviors characteristic organic compounds pasteur previously examined also presented hurdle research law hemihedral pasteur previously attempting derive connections substances chemical structures external shape optically active amyl alcohol follow expectations according proposed pasteur sought reason happened exception chemical compound generated fermentation process first series lectures later pasteur attempted link optical activity molecular asymmetry organic origins substances asserting chemical processes capable converting symmetric substances inorganic asymmetric ones hence amyl alcohol observation provided first motivations biological explanation fermentation pasteur able observe microbes responsible alcoholic fermentation microscope professor science university according legend originating biography pasteur one chemistry owner beetroot alcohol factory aid unsuccessful year pasteur performed experiments factory observation fermentation process noticing yeast globules became elongated lactic acid formed round full alcohol fermenting different observation pasteur inspected particles originating grapevines microscope revealed presence living cells leaving cells immersed grape juice resulted active alcoholic fermentation observation provided evidence ending distinction artificial fermentation wine true fermentation yeast previous incorrect distinction stemmed part fact yeast added beer wort order provoke desired alcoholic fermentation fermenting catalysts wine occurred naturally grapevines fermentation wine viewed artificial since require additional catalyst natural catalyst present grapevine observations provided pasteur working hypothesis future one chemical processes pasteur studied fermentation sugar lactic acid occurs souring milk experiment pasteur able isolate microorganisms present lactic acid ferment chemical process taken pasteur cultivated microorganisms culture laboratory able accelerate lactic acid fermentation process fresh milk administering cultivated sample important step proving hypothesis lactic acid fermentation catalyzed pasteur also experimented mechanisms brewers yeast absence organic adding pure brewers yeast solution cane sugar ammonium salt yeast ash pasteur able observe alcoholic fermentation process usual byproducts glycerin succinic acid small amounts cellulose fatty however ingredients removed solution fermentation would occur pasteur proof yeast required nitrogen minerals carbon medium metabolic processes releasing carbonic acid ethyl alcohol also disproved liebigs theory since albuminous matter present medium decomposition yeast driving force observed pasteur published work believed microorganisms even small animals frogs would spontaneously generate spontaneous generation historically explained variety ways aristotle ancient greek philosopher theorized creatures appeared certain concoctions earthly elements clay mud mixing water later felix pouchet argued existence plastic forces within plant animal debris capable spontaneously generating eggs new organisms born top common piece evidence seemed corroborate theory appearance maggots raw meat left exposed open air pasteurs interest spontaneous generation led criticize pouchets theories conduct experiments first experiment took boiled sugared yeastwater sealed airtight contraption feeding hot sterile air mixture left unaltered introducing atmospheric dust resulted microbes mold appearing within result also strengthened fact pasteur used asbestos form totally inorganic matter carry atmospheric dust second experiment pasteur used flasks sugaryeast mixture left idle swanneck flasks instead introducing extraneous matter flasks kept open common air control group exhibited mold microbial growths within day two swanneck flasks failed show microbial growths pasteur concluded structure necks blocked passage atmospheric dust two experiments pasteur concluded atmospheric dust carried germs responsible spontaneous generation thus pasteurs work provided proof emergent growth bacteria nutrient broths caused biogenesis rather form spontaneous generation today process fermentation used multitude everyday applications including medication beverages food currently companies like genencor international uses production enzymes involved fermentation build revenue million many medications antibiotics produced fermentation process example important drug cortisone prepared fermentation plant steroid known diosgenin enzymes used reaction provided mold rhizopus nigricanscitation needed commonly known alcohol types brands also produced way fermentation distillation moonshine classic example carried finally foods yogurt made fermentation
