ataxia greek α negative prefix τάξις order lack order neurological sign consisting lack voluntary coordination muscle movements include gait abnormality speech changes abnormalities eye movements indicates dysfunction parts nervous system coordinate movement cerebellum nervous system dysfunctions occur several different patterns different results different possible causes ataxia limited one side body referred hemiataxia friedreichs ataxia gait abnormality commonly presented symptom dystaxia mild degree term cerebellar ataxia used indicate ataxia due dysfunction cerebellum responsible integrating significant amount neural information used coordinate smoothly ongoing movements participate motor planning although ataxia present cerebellar lesions many conditions affecting cerebellum produce people cerebellar ataxia may trouble regulating force range direction velocity rhythm muscle results characteristic type irregular uncoordinated movement manifest many possible ways asthenia asynergy delayed reaction time individuals cerebellar ataxia could also display instability gait difficulty eye movements dysarthria dysphagia hypotonia dysmetria deficits vary depending cerebellar structures damaged whether lesion bi unilateralcitation needed people cerebellar ataxia may initially present poor balance could demonstrated inability stand one leg perform tandem gait condition progresses walking characterized widened base high stepping well staggering lurching side turning also problematic could result falls cerebellar ataxia becomes severe great assistance effort needed stand dysarthria impairment articulation may also present characterized scanning speech consists slower rate irregular rhythm variable also slurring speech tremor voice ataxic respiration may occur cerebellar ataxia could result incoordination movement particularly extremities overshooting hypermetria occurs fingertonose testing heel shin testing thus dysmetria impairments alternating movements dysdiadochokinesia well dysrhythmia may also displayed tremor head trunk titubation may seen individuals cerebellar dysmetria thought caused deficit control interaction torques multijoint interaction torques created associated joint primary joint moved example movement required reaching touch target front body flexion shoulder would create torque elbow extension elbow would create torque wrist torques increase speed movement increases must compensated adjusted create coordinated movement may therefore explain decreased coordination higher movement velocities accelerations term sensory ataxia used indicate ataxia due loss proprioception loss sensitivity positions joint body parts generally caused dysfunction dorsal columns spinal cord carry proprioceptive information brain cases cause sensory ataxia may instead dysfunction various parts brain receive positional information including cerebellum thalamus parietal sensory ataxia presents unsteady stomping gait heavy heel strikes well postural instability usually worsened lack proprioceptive input compensated visual input poorly lit physicians find evidence sensory ataxia physical examination patients stand feet together eyes shut affected patients cause instability worsen markedly producing wide oscillations possibly fall called positive rombergs test worsening fingerpointing test eyes closed another feature sensory

depressant effect central nervous system function common example ethanol alcohol capable causing reversible cerebellar vestibular ataxia chronic intake ethanol causes atrophy cerebellum oxidative endoplasmic reticulum stresses induced thiamine examples include various prescription drugs eg antiepileptic drugs cerebellar ataxia possible adverse effect lithium level synthetic cannabinoid various medical recreational drugs eg ketamine pcp dextromethorphan nmda receptor antagonists produce dissociative state high doses class pharmaceuticals cause short term ataxia especially high doses exposure
