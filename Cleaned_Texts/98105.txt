chiasmal syndrome set signs symptoms associated lesions optic chiasm manifesting various impairments affecteds visual field according location lesion along optic nerve pituitary adenomas common cause however chiasmal syndrome may caused cancer associated medical conditions multiple sclerosis neurofibromatosis divides causes chiasmal syndromes intrinsic extrinsic causes intrinsic implies thickening chiasm extrinsic implies compression another structure less common causes chiasmal syndrome metabolic toxic traumatic infectious nature intrinsic etiologies include gliomas multiple sclerosis gliomas optic chiasm usually derived astrocytes tumors slow growing often found however worse prognosis especially extended hypothalamus frequently associated neurofibromatosis type treatment involves resection optic nerve supposed artifactual nature wilbrands knee implications degree resection obtained namely cutting optic nerve immediately junction chiasm without fear potentially resulting visual field vast majority chiasmal syndromes compressive ruben et describe several compressive etiologies important understand successfully managed usual suspects pituitary adenomas craniopharyngiomas meningiomas pituitary tumors common cause chiasmal syndromes visual field defects may one first signs nonfunctional pituitary tumor much less frequent functional adenomas systemic hormonal aberrations cushings syndrome galactorrhea acromegaly usually predate compressive signs pituitary tumors often encroach upon middle chiasm pituitary apoplexy one acute chiasmal syndromes lead sudden visual loss hemorrhagic adenoma rapidly enlarges embryonic remnants rathkes pouch may undergo neoplastic change called craniopharyngioma tumors may develop time two age groups risk one peak occurs first twenty years life occurs fifty seventy years craniopharyngiomas generally approach optic chiasm behind extension craniopharyngiomas third ventricle may cause hydrocephalus meningiomas develop arachnoid layer tuberculum sellae sphenoid planum meningiomas usually compress optic chiasm meningioma arises diaphragma sellae posterior chiasm damaged medial sphenoid ridge types push chiasm side olfactory groove subfrontal types reach chiasm meningiomas also associated neurofibromatosis type women prone develop meningiomas optic chiasm formed union two optic nerves nasal fibers optic nerve decussate cross

significant evidence wilbrands knee simply artifact error optic nerve axons one eye selectively studied human enucleation contralateral eye thus degeneration axons one side several years occurring

contralateral homonymous hemianopia optic disc pallor may apparent ophthalmoscope result longstanding lesion affect lateral uncrossed fibers pallor may take bowtie configuration due loss retinal ganglion cells nasal macula papillomacular bundle compressive lesions often cause headache may compress third ventricle leading hydrocephalus common tumors also cause pituitary gland malfunction
