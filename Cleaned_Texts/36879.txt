pak breeders pak protectors two developmental stages fictional life larry nivens known space universe pak first appeared adults appeared galaxy story expanded novel protector larry niven pak also appear several nivens later novels notably set ringworld destroyer worlds depicts confrontation pak puppeteers niven written invented protectors thought experiment explain common effects aging humans create fictional evolutionary explanation humans long lives females passed reproductive accordingly positive attributes protectors based negative human aging effects swollen joints decreased musclefat ratio weakening heart invariant diet decreasing height facial atrophy leathery skin hair loss lack sex drive tooth loss turned advantage shift breeder protector protector audience learns humans descended pak pak children breeders appear earths fossil record homo habilis pak protectors make earth apparently found fossil record pak species goes three stages development child breeder protector pak child analogous human child sexually immature dependent upon adults survival pak breeder analogous youngish human adult sexually mature selfsufficient later writings providing immediate care children pak breeder stage though capable space travel deemed fully sentient breeders large extent rely protectors longterm survival earlier niven stories describe breeder intelligent enough swing club throw stone pak protector analogous human form described fighting machine armorlike skin superhuman strength superhuman intelligence nivens stories focus pak mostly concentrate unique protectorstage niven explained evolution pak resulting high radiation levels home world near core galaxy high radiation near stardense core caused severe mutations destabilize evolutionary process result pak evolved mechanism eliminate dangerous mutations population mechanism protector stage protectors highly sensitive smell close relatives weed smell wrong may indicate potentially dangerous mutation weeding also suppressed positive mutations essentially halting pak evolution protectors fully sentient far intelligent ordinary humans superior intelligence however serves pak protectors instincts protect bloodline costs pak drive toward collection abstract knowledge concept art even possess enough artistic impulse understand purpose making sketches paintings reasons directly useful change breeder protector result peramorphic transformation brought plant known treeoflife humans primates descended pak treeoflife create protectorstage human treeoflife mechanism breeder becomes protector term originally used refer specific plant consumed triggers transformation term treeoflife virus used describe symbiotic virus actually governs transition niven took name treeoflife book genesis specifically fruit tree life could make adam eve immortal genesis quoted foreword novel protector also mentioned brennan within novel treeoflife plant bush native pak homeworld breeder reaches proper age early humans smell root becomes irresistible breeder gorges treeoflife root infecting treeoflife virus transforming protector age window metamorphosis relatively narrow earth years treeoflife common pak world almost risk breeder living past window without exposed roots transition breeder protector involves reconfiguration anatomy skin thickens becoming similar leather armor strong enough turn copper knife joints swell creature becomes parody human form done cantaloupes coconuts increases leverage available muscles increasing force moment arm result protector lift ten times weight genitalia gonads vanish second twochambered heart forms groin fusion femoral veins arms lengthen fingernails turn retractable claws teeth fall lips gums fuse mouth forming horny beak flat protectors transformed humans nonflat protectors transformed pak breeders hair falls head acquires bony ridge protect newly expanded cranium expanded skull allows brain grow enormous size resulting mind even starting something unintelligent chimpanzee becomes far intelligent typical human pak protectors also acquire extended lifespan live tens thousands earth years common element nivens stories transformation complete pak protector must periodically consume treeoflife root maintain virus body without virus protector weaken die dna degraded virus supplies replacement dna treeoflife crop earth failed due insufficient thallium oxide particular oxide never explained earths soil plants grew support virus result protectors led colony earth died starvation store roots ran pak protectors innate need protect close relatives pak protector bloodline protect usually stops eating starves though childless protectors adopt entire pak race family niven states protectors crowded pak homeworld would constantly war gain advantage family alliances would last one ally sees advantage betrayal human protectors ringworld seem less warlike better able work betterment entire species ringworld hominids rather bloodline though may simply function protectors families encounter protectors typically die starvation lack live eg protectors bloodline died violence although protectors vastly extended lifetime infinite original halfmillion year journey earth protector colonists die old age enormous intelligence instinctive need protect family species etc protectors efficient ruthless quite amoral observed several times intelligence combined instinct also compels action completely protectors often little free niven uses trait plot device several times characters set circumstances protector characters react specific manner protector jack brennan human turned protector commits genocide exterminating martian race aliens dangerous might pak interested anything pak also releases genetically modified treeoflife virus colony world home turning everyone middle aged protector killing humans planet order create army childless protectors fight invading pak fleet indicated throughout nivens works humans homo sapiens turned protectors far intelligent pak homo habilis counterparts much way humans intelligent primates evolved niven explains much protector behavior future history revealing ringworlds children arm may run least one protector boosterspice dramatically prolongs human lifespan derived treeoflife protector niven explains humans earths primates descended colony pak breeders stranded earth million years ago protectors built colony ship died treeoflife crops failed original pak breeder population known us homo habilis bred mutated wildly evolving modern humans well earth primates terran primates would transform protector stage exposed treeoflife root accurately symbiotic virus contains ringworld engineers characters find evidence ringworld built pak protectors confirmed statements character ringworlds children claims one original builders populated pak breeders pak protectors dwindled numbers longer able maintain genetic purity breeder forms breeders eventually evolved hominids ringworld one sees larry nivens novels destroyer worlds cowritten niven edward lerner human world piersons puppeteers fleet worlds confronts pak protector war fleet
