true non st elevation myocardial infarction nstemi unstable relief pain angina paramount importance humane reasons pain associated sympathetic activation causes vasoconstriction increases workload pain myocardial ischemia likely respond intervention improves relationship oxygen demand supply like nitrates beta blockers nitrates like nitroglycerin dilate blood vessels beneficial myocardial ischemia two ways increasing blood flow coronary arteries amount oxygen arrives heart muscle relaxing blood vessels body thereby reducing workload heart needs produce oxygen consumes preferred mode administration sublingually relaxing blood vessels nitrates also reduce blood pressure must carefully monitored must used hypotension present must also avoided patients taken sildenafil phosphodiesterase type inhibitors used erectile dysfunction within previous hours combination two could cause serious drop blood pressure intravenous nitrates useful patients hypertension pulmonary reducing sympathetic stimulation heart beta blockers decrease heart rate blood pressure cardiac output hence heart oxygen consumption betablockers alleviate ischemic pain also proved reduce size infarcted heart muscle risk arrhythmias proportion patients acute coronary syndrome actually evolve stemi however also shown increase risk acute heart failure early use contraindicated signs congestive heart failure eg killip class ii hypotension along contraindications beta blockers slow heart rate atrioventricular block absence contraindications beta blocker therapy begin first hours may prudent prefer oral rather intravenous initial administration oxygen patients acute coronary syndrome common practice however evidence support refute supplemental oxygen might harmful beneficial cardiac patients need currently recommended give oxygen breathless patients blood oxygen saturation low eg analgesic agents commonly used opioids especially morphine considered analgesic choice
