tricuspid regurgitation tr also called tricuspid insufficiency type valvular heart disease tricuspid valve heart located right atrium right ventricle close completely right ventricle contracts systole tr allows blood flow backwards right ventricle right atrium increases volume pressure blood right atrium right may increase central venous volume pressure backward flow sufficiently severe causes tr divided hereditary acquired also primary secondary primary tr refers defect solely tricuspid valve infective endocarditis secondary tr refers defect valve consequence pathology left ventricular failure pulmonary mechanism tr either dilatation base annulus valve due right ventricular dilatation results three leaflets far apart reach one another abnormality one three symptoms tr depend severity severe tr causes rightsided heart failure development ascites peripheral severe cases right heart failure due tr venous congestion kidneys liver may lead cardiorenal syndrome kidney failure secondary heart failure cardiohepatic syndromes liver failure secondary heart failure venous congestion tr right heart failure may also lead anasarca diffuse swelling decreased intestinal absorption due swelling surrounding intestines severe cases may lead cachexia pansystolic heart murmur may heard auscultation chest murmur usually low frequency best heard lower left sternal border increases inspiration decreases expiration known carvallos sign however murmur may inaudible due relatively low pressures right side heart third heart sound may also present also heard lower sternal border increasing intensity examination neck may giant cv waves jugular severe tr may enlarged liver detected palpation right upper quadrant abdomen liver may pulsatile palpation even causes tr may classified acquired another classification divides causes primary secondary congenital abnormalities much less common acquired common acquired tr due right ventricular dilatation dilatation often due left heart failure pulmonary hypertension causes right ventricular dilatation include right ventricular infarction inferior myocardial infarction cor regards primary secondary causes terms mechanism tricuspid insufficiency involves expansion tricuspid annulus fibrous rings heart tricuspid insufficiency linked geometric changes tricuspid annulus decreased tricuspid annular release leaflets shape normal prevented normal working mechanism due distortion spatial relationships leaflets also contemplated process via tricuspid regurgitation emerges decrease contraction myocardium around diagnosis tr may suspected typical murmur tr heard signs suggestive right heart failurecitation needed definitive diagnosis made echocardiogram capable measuring presence severity tr well right ventricular dimensions systolic cardiac mri ct scan may also aid diagnosis imaging studies regurgitant volume greater milliliters greater regurgitation across tricuspid valve associated poor medical therapy tricuspid regurgitation consists diuretics loop diuretics first line therapy mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists added worsening refractory cases however disease progresses diuretics may become diuretic resistance tr right heart failure thought develop due variety mechanisms working synergistically lead decreased effectiveness diuretics decreased effective circulating volume ie decreased blood perfusing kidneys leads activation system leads kidneys reabsorbing salt water vasoconstriction intestinal edema may also lead decreased gut absorption diuretics increased fluid retention may lead increased volume distribution preceding mechanisms tr right heart failure sometimes secondary left heart failure lead diuretic resistance diuretic resistance associated poor indications surgical fixation tricuspidal issues include organic lesions valve severe functional regurgitation open heart surgery another issue eg mitral valve fixing tricuspid valve may considered medical consensus unclear argue even mild moderate tricuspid regurgitation addressed others take conservative approach infective endocarditis traumatic lesions surgical options include annuloplasty replacement valve adding rigid prosthetic ring aims decrease diameter valve stabilize another annuloplasty modality de vega technique valve diameter decreased two sutures placed around periphery valve cases severe organic lesions valve endocarditis valve may excised tricuspid valve replacement either mechanical valve bioprosthesis may indicated depending mechanical prostheses cause thromboembolic phenomena bioprostheses may degenerate evidence suggests significant difference survival rates recipients mechanical versus biological tricuspid controlled severity tr tricuspid valve surgery performed tr patients considered appropriate associated improved outcomes hazard ratio prognosis tr less favorable females males females greater risk progressing severe tr compared survival rates proportional tr even mild tr reduces survival compared tr studies year mortality rate severe medically treated tr times increased risk death moderate severe tr compared mild tr tricuspid valvular even mild tr large population based study showed greater risk death compared healthy framingham heart study presence tricuspid regurgitation mild severity greater present men mild tricuspid regurgitation tends common presence structurally normal tricuspid valve apparatus considered normal clinically significant tr common females thought partly driven increased prevalence atrial fibrillation heart failure preserved ejection fraction risk factors tr women compared moderate severe tricuspid regurgitation usually associated tricuspid valve leaflet abnormalities andor possibly annular dilation usually pathologic lead irreversible damage cardiac muscle worse outcomes due chronic prolonged right ventricular volume study male elite football players aged sedentary nonathletes found athletes tricuspid
