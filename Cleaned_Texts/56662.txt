rh factor testing also known rhesus factor testing procedure determining rhesus status individual see rh blood group rhesus factor testing utilises genotyping technique detect presence rhd checking existence rhd gene individuals genome presence rhesus rhd antigens inferred individuals positive rhd status rhd antigens expressed cell membrane red blood cells whereas rhesus antigens absent individuals negative rhd rhesus factor testing usually conducted pregnant women determine rhd blood group mother foetus confirming rhd status mother foetus precautions made necessary prevent medical conditions caused rhesus entire rh blood group system involves multiple antigens rh factor testing however rhesus factor refers rhd antigen specifically rhd gene codes rhd antigen located chromosome rhd dominant gene meaning long least one rhd gene inherited either parent rhd antigen vice versa rhd gene inherited rhd antigen produced noninvasive extraction blood plasma commonly used test samples verifying maternal rhd status blood plasma also used determining foetal rhd status mother rhd maternal blood plasma contains maternal dna trace amounts foetal blood samples obtained venipuncture mother since plasma components blood different densities centrifugation blood samples added anticoagulant edta segregate blood contents multiples blood plasma isolated components rhesus factor testing method extracting foetal dna maternal blood plasma considered type noninvasive prenatal noninvasive prenatal testing used mother however case maternal rhd status negative invasive prenatal testing may used determine foetal rhd status instead two common invasive methods extracting foetal dna chorionic villus sampling cvs amniocentesis invasive procedures conducted rhd rhd mothers invasive procedure medications prevent rh immunisation usually prescribed rhd done avoid production maternal antid antibodies may attack foetal blood cells foetus rh incompatible chorionic villus sampling usually done week pregnancy samples chorionic villi tiny projections placental placental tissues derived embryonic cells hence contains foetal genetic information used determine childs rhd two types chorionic villus sampling transcervical sampling involves inserting catheter cervix placenta obtain villi ultrasound used guide catheter site transabdominal sampling requires insertion needle abdomen uterus obtain placental local anaesthesia applied reduce pain invasive amniocentesis another invasive procedure used collect foetal dna samplesmedical citation needed procedure usually done week week purpose amc extract small amount amniotic fluid foetal cells may shed foetus suspended amniotic foetal genome found cells therefore extracting amniotic fluid required foetal genetic material genotyping rhd amniocentesis commences doctor inject local anaesthetics mothers doctor apply ultrasound locate foetus guidance ultrasound imaging long thin hollow needle insert skin abdomen uterus needle used withdraw trace amount amniotic removed maternal body amniotic fluid extracted sent laboratory testing presence rhd gene individuals genome determined genotyping firstly body fluid containing individuals dna extracted dna isolated unwanted impurities isolated dna mixed various reagents prepare polymerase chain reactions pcr mixture pcr mixture usually contains taq dna polymerase dna primers deoxyribonucleotides dntp buffer dna primers specific exon exon different circumstances primers regions rhd gene intron exon may also mixture subjected series pcr performed thermal end pcr amount rhd gene amplified present product pcr analysed gel electrophoresis gel electrophoresis dna reference ladder positive control containing dna rhd gene pcr product loaded onto wells electric current applied dna fragments migrate positive terminal negative charge since dna fragments different molecular sizes larger slower utilising property dna fragments different molecular masses segregated help gel staining visualising devices uv transilluminators rhd gene dna fragments present visible band corresponding molecular dna sequencing conducted confirm sequence product dna fragments matches rhd gene sequence rh factor testing crucial prevent haemolytic conditions caused rh incompatibilitycitation needed consequence haemolytic conditions dangerous even lethal may lead multiple rh factor testing determine rhesus status individuals also indicate necessity medical intervention rhd antigens red blood cells exposed individual rhd status highfrequency igg antirhd antibodies developed rhd individuals antibodies attack red blood cells attached rhd antigens lead destruction cells condition known haemolytic destruction red blood cells releases haemoglobin bloodstream haemoglobin may excreted urine causing sudden release haemoglobin also pass liver metabolised bilirubin high concentrations accumulates skin cause liberation blood cell debris circulation also cause disseminated intravascular patients receiving incompatible blood transfusion may pale skin splenomegaly hepatomegaly yellowing mouth eyes addition urine may appear dark colour patients may experience dizziness tachycardia increase heart rate also symptom haemolytic case pregnancy rhd mother carries rhd fetus fetal red blood cells may cross placenta maternal circulation sensitising mother produce antirhd since mixing fetal maternal blood occurs mainly separation placenta delivery first rhd pregnancy rarely causes danger foetus delivery occurs synthesis antibodies however mother conceive another rhd child future antirhd antibodies cross placenta attack lyse red cells foetus causing aforementioned haemolytic reaction foetus known haemolytic disease disease usually fatal foetus hence preventive measures conducted symptoms disease may vary pregnancy usually noticeable pregnancy however prenatal tests may reveal yellow colouring amniotic fluid caused buildup splenomegaly cardiomegaly hepatomegaly may occur excessive tissue fluid may accumulate stomach lungs scalp typically signs hydrops birth symptoms child similar incompatible blood transfusion adults baby may pale skin due anaemia yellowing umbilical cord skin eyes also known jaundice may arise within hours signs hydrops fetalis enlargement spleen heart liver along severe edema continue normally extra medical intervention required maternal rh status rhd rhd mothers going first pregnancy however case sensitised rhd mother previously conceived rhd child foetus rh medication antid immunoglobulin given rhd injecting rhd mother antid immunoglobulin proven effective avoiding sensitisation rhd antigen even though mechanism medication works remains antid immunoglobulin injection also offered rhd individuals
