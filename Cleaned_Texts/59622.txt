blindsight ability people cortically blind respond visual stimuli consciously see due lesions primary visual cortex also known striate cortex brodmann area term coined lawrence weiskrantz colleagues paper published issue previous paper studying discriminatory capacity cortically blind patient published nature assumed existence blindsight controversial arguing merely degraded conscious majority studies blindsight conducted patients hemianopic ie blind one half visual field following destruction left right striate cortex patients asked detect localize discriminate amongst visual stimuli presented blind side often forcedresponse guessing situation even though may consciously recognize visual stimulus research shows blind patients may achieve higher accuracy would expected chance alone type blindsight term given ability levels significantly visual stimulus location type movement without conscious awareness stimuli type blindsight occurs patients claim feeling change within blind visual reclassification blindsight type type made shown celebrated blindsight patient gy fact usually conscious stimuli presented blind field stimuli certain specific characteristics namely high contrast moving fast speeds excess degrees per aftermath first world war neurologist george riddoch described patients blinded gunshot wounds could see stationary objects reported conscious seeing moving objects blind reason phenomenon recently also called riddoch since become apparent subjects also become aware visual stimuli belonging visual domains color luminance presented blind ability hemianopic subjects become consciously aware stimuli presented blind field also commonly referred residual degraded originally defined blindsight challenged common belief perceptions must enter consciousness affect behavior showing behavior guided sensory information conscious since demonstration blind patients experience visual stimuli consciously consequent redefinition blindsight type type nuanced view phenomenon blindsight may thought converse form anosognosia known anton syndrome full cortical blindness along confabulation visual experience much current understanding blindsight attributed early experiments monkeys one monkey named helen could considered star monkey visual research original blindsight helen macaque monkey decorticated specifically primary visual cortex completely removed blinding nevertheless certain specific situations helen exhibited sighted behavior pupils would dilate would blink stimuli threatened eyes furthermore certain experimental conditions could detect variety visual stimuli presence location objects well shape pattern orientation motion needed many cases able navigate environment interact objects similar phenomenon also discovered humans subjects suffered damage visual cortices due accidents strokes reported partial total blindness despite prompted could guess presence details objects aboveaverage accuracy much like animal subjects could catch objects tossed subjects never developed kind confidence abilities even told successes would begin spontaneously make guesses objects instead still required prompting furthermore blindsight subjects rarely express amazement abilities sighted people would expect patients blindsight damage system produces visual perception visual cortex brain nerve fibers bring information eyes rather underlying brain system controlling eye phenomenon originally thought show complex perception system damaged people use underlying control system guide hand movements towards object even though see reaching hence visual information control behavior without producing conscious sensation ability blindsight act able see objects unconscious suggested consciousness general property parts brain produced specialized parts blindsight patients show awareness single visual features edges motion gain holistic visual percept suggests perceptual awareness modular sighted binding process unifies information whole percept interrupted patients conditions blindsight visual therefore object identification object recognition thought separate processes occur different areas brain working independently one another modular theory object perception integration would account hidden perception experienced blindsight patients research shown visual stimuli single visual features sharp borders sharp onsetoffset low spatial contribute strictly necessary objects salience blindsight three theories explanation blindsight first states damage area branches optic nerve deliver visual information superior colliculus several areas including parts cerebral cortex turn areas might control blindsight responses another explanation phenomenon blindsight even though majority persons visual cortex may damaged tiny islands functioning tissue islands large enough provide conscious perception nevertheless enough unconscious visual third theory information required

representation includes position velocity individual objects relative organism extract vergence signal benefit precision previously auxiliary optical system extract focus control signal lenses eyes stereoscopic information attached object information passed visual recently demonstration direct input lgn area delivers signals fast moving stimuli latencies another explanation emerged one proposes delivery signals sufficient arouse conscious experience fast visual motion without implying alone responsible since signals reach may propagated areas latter account would seem exclude possibility signals preprocessed postprocessed return connections back pulvinar nucleus thalamus also sends direct bypassing signals precise role generating conscious visual experience motion yet determined evidence blindsight indirectly observed children young two months although difficulty determining type patient old enough answer experiment researchers attempted show monkeys lesions even wholly removed striate cortexes also experienced blindsight study monkeys complete tasks similar commonly used human subjects monkeys placed front monitor taught indicate whether stationary object nothing present visual field tone played monkeys performed task except stationary objects presented outside visual field monkeys performed similar human participants unable perceive presence stationary objects outside visual another study group sought prove monkeys could also conscious movement deficit visual field despite consciously aware presence object researchers used another standard test humans similar previous study except moving objects presented deficit visual field starting center deficit visual field object would either move right monkeys performed identically humans test getting right almost every time showed monkeys ability detect movement separate ability consciously detect object deficit visual field gave evidence claim damage striate cortex plays large role causing

visual information even unconscious information may affected sometimes even unaffected damage different areas visual previous studies already demonstrated even without conscious awareness visual

hierarchical series stages much crosstalk feedback areas route retina visual pathway cortex though far largest commonly thought residual performance people exhibiting blindsight due preserved pathways
