larger iguanodontia however although shares similarities iguanodon thumb spike ouranosaurus longer usually placed iguanodontid family grouping generally considered paraphyletic series subsequent offshoots main stemline iguandontian evolution instead placed clade hadrosauriformes closely related hadrosauroidea contains hadrosauridae also known duckbilled dinosaurs closest relatives ouranosaurus appears represent early specialized branch group showing traits independent convergence hadrosaurids thus basal hadrosauriform simplified cladogram follows analysis andrew mcdonald

iguanodon mantellisaurus ouranosaurus hadrosauroidea jaws apparently operated relatively weak muscles ouranosaurus small temporal openings behind eyes larger capitimandibularis muscle attached coronoid process lower jaw bone small rounded horns front eyes made ouranosaurus known horned ornithopod back skull rather narrow could compensate lack greater area attachment jaw muscle openings normally would provide allowing power stronger bite lesser muscle musculus depressor mandibulae used open lower jaws located back skull connected strongly projecting broad anteriorly oblique processus paroccipitalis ouranosaurus probably used teeth chew tough plant food diet suggested leaves fruit seeds chewing would allow free energy high quality wide beak hand indicates specialisation eating large amounts low quality fodder ouranosaurus lived river delta ouranosaurus bears similarities derived iguanodonts basal ornithopods remodeling present subadult paratype high vascular density circumferential arrangement microstructure suggests fast growth faster growth occurs phylogenetic groups higher body size although relationship unclear ouranosaurus similar size basal tenontosaurus
