affective haptics emerging area research focuses study design devices systems elicit enhance influence emotional state human means sense touch research field originated dzmitry tsetserukou alena neviarouskaya affective haptics realtime communication system rich emotional haptic channels driven motivation enhance social interactivity emotionally immersive experience users realtime messaging virtual augmented realities idea reinforcing intensifying feelings reproducing simulating emotions felt partner proposed four basic haptic tactile channels governing emotions distinguished according jameslange conscious experience emotion occurs cortex receives signals changes physiological state researchers argued feelings preceded certain physiological changes thus see venomous snake feel fear cortex received signals racing heart knocking knees etc distinguishes primary secondary emotions involve changes bodily states secondary emotions evoked thoughts recent empirical studies support noncognitive theories nature emotions proven easily evoke emotions something simple changing facial expression eg smile brings feeling human emotions easily evoked different cues sense touch one emotionally charged channels affective haptic devices produce different senses touch including kinesthetic coetaneous channels kinesthetic stimulations produced forces exerted body sensed mechanoreceptors tendons muscles hand mechanoreceptors skin layers responsible perception cutaneous stimulation different types tactile corpuscles allow us sensing thermal property object pressure vibration frequency stimuli online interactions rely heavily vision hearing substantial need exists mediated social forms physical contact hugging particularly emotionally charged conveys warmth love affiliation recently researchers made several attempts create hugging device providing sense physical copresence key feature physically reproduces humanhug pattern generating pressure simultaneously users chest back idea realistically reproduce hugging integration activehaptic device haptihug pseudohaptic touch simulated hugging animation thus high immersion physical contact partners hugging achieved affection goes hugging alone people long distance relationships faced lack physical intimacy daytoday basis haptic technology allows kinesthetic tactile interface design field digital copresence envelops teledildonics well kiiroo svir good example adult cybertoy incorporates tactile input means surface touch capacitive inside kinesthetic nature rings contract pulse vibrate according movements ones partner makes real time svir mimics actual motion opue counterpart also compatible svir models svir enables women intercourse partner use opue interactive vibrator matter great distance separates couple different types devices used produce physiological changes bodily organs heart plays particularly important role emotional experience heart imitator produces special heartbeat patterns according emotion conveyed elicited sadness associated slightly intense heartbeat anger quick violent heartbeat fear intense heart rate false heart beat feedback directly interpreted real heart beat change emotional perception reproduces butterflies stomach fluttery tickling feeling felt people experiencing love arrays vibration motors attached users abdomen sends shivers spine row vibration motors sends chills spine cold airflow fan cold side peltier element haptitemper also intended simulation warmth human skin evoke either pleasant feeling aggression directly evokes joy tickling users ribs includes four vibration motors reproducing stimuli similar human finger movements recent findings show attractive things make people feel good turn makes think concept emotional haptic design core idea make user feel affinity device affective computing used measure recognize emotional information systems devises employing affective haptics emotional information extracted using techniques speech recognition natural language processing facial expression detection measurement physiological data possible applications follows affective haptics vanguard emotional technology lets users feel emotionally present communicating remote physical location remote environment real virtual augmented philosophy behind ifeelim intelligent system feeling enhancement powered affect sensitive instant messenger feel therefore ifeelim system great importance placed automatic sensing emotions conveyed textual messages virtual world second life artificial intelligence visualization detected emotions avatars virtual environment enhancement users affective state reproduction feeling social touch eg hug means haptic stimulation real world control conversation implemented second life object called attached avatars chest addition communication system textual affect sensing affect analysis emoheart responsible sensing symbolic cues keywords hug communicative function conveyed text visualization hugging second life ifeelim system considerably enhance emotionally immersive experience realtime messaging order build social interface r√©hman et al developed two tactile systems ie mobile phone based chair based could render human facial expression visually impaired systems conveyed human emotions visually impaired persons using vibrotactile stimuli produce moviespecific tactile stimuli influencing viewers emotions viewers body wearable tactile jacket developed philips motivation increase emotional immersion movieviewing jacket contains
