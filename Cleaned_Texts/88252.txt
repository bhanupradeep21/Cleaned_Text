explain equity premiumcitation needed argued number ways different forms argument dont enough statistical power distinguish equity premium zero related criticism apparent equity premium artifact observing stock market bubbles progress note however mainstream economists agree evidence shows substantial statistical power benartzi thaler analyzed equity returns period found whilst equity returns remained stable return government bonds fell significantly around moreover analysis faculty members funded retirement showed people invested stocks received much higher returns people invested government implications individual investor individual investor equity premium may represent reasonable reward taking risk buying shares base decisions allocate assets shares bonds depending risk tolerant risk averse hand investor believes equity premium arise mistakes fears would capitalize fear mistake invest considerable portions assets shares prudent note economists commonly allocate significant portions asset currently equity premium estimated although lower historical rates still significantly advantageous bonds investors investing retirements funds longterm magnitude equity premium brings substantial implications policy welfare also resource allocation policy welfare implications campbell cochrane found study model simulates equity premium values consistent asset prices welfare costs similar magnitude welfare therefore essentially large risk premium society asset prices reflection consumer preferences implies cost welfare also large also means recessions welfare costs excessive regardless aggregate consumption equity premium rises recessionstate income marginal values steadily increase also thus increasing welfare costs recessions also brings questions regarding need microeconomic policies operate way higher productivity long run trading shortterm pain form adjustment costs given impact welfare recessions large equity premium evident shortterm trade offs result economic policy likely ideal would preferred take place times normal economic resource allocation large risk premium associated equity high cost systematic risk returns one potential implications individual portfolio decisions research argued high rates return signs misplaced riskaversion investors able earn high returns little risk switching stocks assets research contrary indicates large percentage general public believe stock market best investors long may also link another implication trends equity premium claims made equity premium declined time past years may supported studies claiming tax declines may also continue reduce premium fact transaction costs securities markets decline consistent declining trend implication also supported models noise traders create cyclical premium due noise traders excessively optimistic thus declining premium vice versa optimism replaced pessimism would explain constant decline equity premium stock price
