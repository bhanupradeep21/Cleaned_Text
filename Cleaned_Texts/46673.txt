nonrandom segregation chromosomes deviation usual distribution chromosomes meiosis segregation genome among gametes usually according mendelian rule law segregation genes homologous chromosomes randomly distributed among daughter nuclei various modes deviating numerous organisms normal relevant taxa may involve single chromosome pairs bivalents single chromosomes without mating partners univalents even whole sets chromosomes separated according parental origin rule maternal origin passed offspring also happens nonhomologous chromosomes segregate coordinated manner result form nonmendelian inheritance article describes cases nonrandom segregation normal case particular organisms occurs frequently related phenomenon called meiotic drive segregation distortion higher average

netwings mostly one x one chromosome mate meiosis however species multiple univalent sex chromosomes univalent b chromosomes may added segregate orderly fashion spindle poles called distance similar relationships multiple sex univalents also described flea cricket eneoptera surinamensis three free univalent sex chromomeres present already migrating spindle poles autosomes assemble spindle whirl worm mesostoma ehrenbergii three five chromosome pairs mate meiosis thus three bivalents four univalents present univalents also segregate bivalents fixed preparations univalents often correctly distributed hilary oakley found reason observed process living object according univalents move back forth poles metaphase ie bivalents equator usually one univalent moves longer pause five ten minutes another one starts move continues four correctly distributed followed anaphase ie segregation paired also northern mole cricket neocurtilla hexadactyla already mentioned beginning live observations meiosis informative eneoptera three sex chromosomes present present univalent case segregation sex chromosomes also occurs autosomes bivalent already shifted metaphase metaphase plate toward one spindle pole way chromosome located near univalent located pole micromanipulation experiments shifted bivalent univalent spindle rené camenzind r bruce nicklas found active element depends

irradiation microtubule junction uv microbeams often onethird cases resulted moving half spindle effect surprisingly seen irradiation one three spindle fibers sex chromosomes located whereas irradiation autosomal spindle fibers effect dwayne wise et al concluded four microtubule bundles form interacting network enables coordinated segregation sex chromosomes ie correct allocation behavior chromosomes fungus gnat spermatogenesis unusual several respects detail meiosis ii already discussed however meiosis far remarkable otherwise obligatory pairing homologous chromosomes completely omitted segregated according origin maternal paternal segregation starts right nuclear envelope dissolution metaphase omitted paternal chromosomes enter small daughter cell like polar bodies passes away oogenesis thus spermatozoa receive maternal chromosomes males act intermediaries purely female lineages construction spindle apparatus division also unusual bipolar spindle merely halfspindle one pole maternal chromosomes move towards pole paternal ones away fungus gnats addition regular chromosomes germlinelimited lchromosomes limited present cells germline eliminated somatic cells segregate maternal regular chromosomes spermatogenesis thus enter sperm doubling number compensated early stage embryonic development eliminating excess l chromosomes nucleus exactly two always cecidomyiidae spermatozoa also contain set chromosomes maternal origin paternal chromosomes eliminated meiosis pairing homologous chromosomes omitted cell division inaequal maternal chromosomes move spindle pole thereby entering daughter cell two spermatozoa emerge meiosis ii daughter cell perishes addition numerous germlinelimited chromosomes like fungus gnats remain paternal regular chromosomes thus scale insects males parahaploid although two sets chromosomes chromosomes maternal origin active passed offspring inactivation paternal chromosomes occurs early embryonic stage blastula chromosomes become highly condensed heterochromatized also occurs humans female sex one two x chromosomes becomes heterochromatic elimination inheritance occur several ways one occurs meiosis called lecanoid chromosome system meiosis inverse scale insects aphids discussed actual reduction division meiosis ii lecanoid mode chromosomes form double metaphase plate maternal chromosomes one side paternal chromosomes normal case chance rules anaphase two complete sets step apart forming daughter nucleus since meiosis ii associated cell division since two daughter formations first division also reunite fournucleated cell eventually results generally case scale insect spermatogenesis nuclei however two maternal chromosomes become sperm nuclei two become condensed finally plant kingdom polyploidy common part allopolyploid species chromosome finds homologous partner meiosis also species odd number chromosome sets generally reproduce apomictic bypassing meiosis fertilization univalents randomly distributed among daughter nuclei meiosis however plants known univalents distributed nonrandomly therefore reproduce sexually oldest example dog roses discovered early pentaploid five sets chromosomes two mate meiosis sexes bivalents univalents female sex ie embryo sac mother cell univalents migrate undivided meiosis spindle pole lies direction micropyle since embryo sac formed oocyte thus receives complete sets chromosomes pollenmeiosis hand many univalents remain anaphase ii socalled lagging thus lost chromosome loss high pollen grains contain haploid set chromosomes paired meiosis since haploid pollen grains functional complete pentaploid chromosome set restored fertilization way sets chromosomes transmitted exclusively female line remaining two behave normally leucopogon juniperinus triploid chromosome sets two mate meiosis univalents third set distributed directionally unlike dog roses sexes pollen meiosis related species tribus stypheleae associated inequivalent cell division three four daughter nuclei assemble one end initially still undivided pollen mother cell form three small cells subsequently develop thus one meiosis products gives rise pollen grain mostly haploid result directional segregation univalents meiosis e univalents eliminated pollen nucleus lagging directional distribution embryo sac mother cell hand migrate towards micropyle greatly increased probability thus preferentially enter oocyte although directional distribution species means sexes therefore results many aneuploid gametes effective enough allow high south american sweetgrass andropogon ternatus also triploid meiosis one set chromosomes remains unpaired anaphase univalents sexes remain segregating halfbivalents form third nucleus included one two daughter cells female meiosis daughter cell facing micropyle thus agreement two plant species discussed previously univalents allocated directionally micropylar side however since embryo sac formed end tetrad facing chalaza results elimination univalents inheritance compensation done pollen apparently pollen grains arise dinucleate meiocytes therefore diploid develop normally become fernando
