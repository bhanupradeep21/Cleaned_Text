previous history pain relatively recent discovery neurons conduct interpret signals including sensations pain within body various theories proposed causes pain role function even within seemingly limited groups ancient greeks competing theories root cause pain aristotle include sense pain enumerated five senses like plato saw pain pleasure sensations emotions passions alternatively hippocrates

spiritual experience physical mechanical sensation meaning cure pain could found researching locating pain fibers within bodies specificity theory states pain specific sensation sensory apparatus independent touch emerged nineteenth century prefigured work avicenna scottish anatomist charles bell proposed exist different kinds sensory receptor adapted respond one stimulus johannes müller established single stimulus type eg blow electric current produce different sensations depending type nerve stimulated hypothesized specific energy peculiar five nerve types serve aristotles five senses type energy determines type sensation nerve considered feelings itching pleasure pain heat cold touch varieties single sense called feeling müllers doctrine killed ancient idea nerves carry actual properties incorporeal copies perceived object marking beginning modern era sensory psychology prompted others ask nerves evoke different qualities touch feeling specific filippo pacini isolated receptors nervous system detect pressure vibrations georg meissner rudolf wagner described receptors sensitive light touch wilhelm krause found receptor responds gentle vibration moritz schiff first definitively formulate specificity theory pain demonstrated touch pain sensations traveled brain along separate spinal cord magnus blix reported specific spots skin elicit sensations either cold heat stimulated proposed different sensations cool warm caused stimulation different specific receptors max von frey found described heat cold receptors reported finding pain spots skin human von frey proposed low threshold cutaneous spots elicit feeling touch high threshold spots elicit pain pain distinct cutaneous sensation independent touch heat cold associated free nerve first

argued pain generated sensory stimulus provided intense enough formulation hypothesis became known intensive alfred goldscheider confirmed existence distinct heat cold sensors evoking heat cold sensations using fine needle penetrate electrically stimulate different nerve trunks bypassing receptors though failed find specific pain sensitive spots skin goldscheider concluded available evidence supported pain specificity held view series experiments conducted bernhard naunyn rapidly timessecond prodded skin tabes dorsalis patients touch threshold eg hair seconds produced unbearable pain obtained similar results using stimuli including electricity produce rapid subthreshold stimulation concluded pain product summation goldscheider extended intensive theory proposing tactile nerve

gathered considerable amounts evidence support theory pain physical phenomenon rather biopsychosocial phenomenon encompassing culture nociceptive stimuli environment experience perception pain example sun dance ritual performed traditional groups native americans ritual cuts made chest young man strips leather slipped cuts poles tied leather ritual lasts hours undoubtedly generates large amounts
