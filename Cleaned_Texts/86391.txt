evidence man woman punished zina pregnant woman confesses baby born illegal relationship subject conviction islamic courts cases witnesses confession woman receive punishment pregnancy women fall pregnant without committing illegal sexual intercourse woman could raped coerced case victim perpetrator crime therefore punished even accused misconduct merely strength falling four witnesses
