gobiconodontinae erected within amphilestidae genera gobiconodon guchinodon klamelia gobiconodontinae raised family rank later decades multiple new genera assigned gobiconodontidae including fuxinoconodon hangjinia meemannodon repenomamus spinolestes huasteconodon early jurassic mexico also assigned gobiconodontidae first described inclusion within family along gobiconodontids gobiconodon often placed within eutriconodonta group characterised triconodont molariforms cusps placed straight line phylogenetic analyses often found eutriconodonts closer therians group containing marsupials placentals sometimes alternatively placed outside mammalian crown group clade formed monotremes therians within larger clade analyses found eutriconodonta monophyletic group containing descendants common ancestor others recover paraphyletic grade ancestral trechnotheria derived postcanines teeth behind canine gobiconodon divided two types depending shape ones front relatively simple classified
