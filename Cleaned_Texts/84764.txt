appropriate relationship elements according pat pattison author writing better lyrics prosody created musical lyrical elements work together support central message song achieve prosody rhythmic placement lyric music must support natural rhythm meaning proper lyric setting involves identification stressed unstressed syllables syllables distinguished suprasegmentals qualities intonation duration dynamics numerous parts speech hold different levels meaning assigned different levels importance stress determined natural rhythmic meter also words level meaning stressed unstressed syllables form rhythmic patterns similar musical beats musical time signatures made strong weak beats stressed unstressed syllabic patterns lyrical content aligned strong weak beats music order ensure lyrics easily recognized correctly understood fulfill ultimate meaning emotion purpose proper lyric setting song establish lyrical content authentic form promote relatability languages made segments called vowels consonants vowels may stand join consonants create syllables words made one syllables superimposed syllables speech features stress tone called suprasegmentals also known prosodic features sounds present syllables words phrases suprasegmentals considered musical aspects speech common prosodic features intonation duration dynamics importance identify suprasegmentals language combination variables defines stressed unstressed syllables words factors intonation duration dynamics contribute greatly process identifying executing proper lyric setting english language intonation pitch suprasegmental incorporates three variables intonation acoustically corresponds fundamental one feature defines division speech units various pitches syllables naturally assigned way pitch plays important role differentiating stressed unstressed syllables lower higher pitches creating rhythm language intonation additionally used speech special effect highlighting words create emphasis support specific emotion however choice made subconsciously important note application pitch english language artificial process native speakers utilize pitch fluctuations words sentences exclamations inherently recognizing lower higher pitches language process lyric setting increases probability preserving natural shape language speech duration length sounds suprasegmental measured time units milliseconds seconds music however duration measured note value regarding beats subdivisions syllables english language naturally expressed various durations partnership pitch duration syllable indicate prominence syllable whether stressed unstressed length sounds contributes greatly rhythm language composition poetry lyrics recognition duration syllables lyric setting increases probability properly setting words addition promoting prosody length musical time dynamics speech distinctions levels volume varying soft loud acoustically dynamics correspond intensity also known sound pressure level measured decibels syllables english language expressed different dynamics depending natural prominence stress dynamics also used outside normal speech patterns emphasize certain words express particular emotions recognizing dynamics speech process lyric setting increase probability preserving natural emotion responsible dynamics promote prosody music english language consists sentences made phrases made words made syllables two types syllables stressed unstressed also referred strong weak stress accentuation emphasis word intonation duration dynamics suprasegmentals contribute determining prominence stress syllable relationship syllables pitch considered strongest variable determines syllable prominence duration dynamics following defining stressed syllable important define unstressed syllable every human voice natural resting pitch varies person person musical terms pitch would recognized voice tonic tonal center resolution tone pitch unstressed syllables rest stressed syllable one emphasized prominence contrast unstressed syllable stressed syllable higher pitch musical terms pitch commonly perfect fourth perfect fifth even minor third voice tonic stressed syllable tends longer duration louder volume contrasts unstressed syllables indicate superior meaning organized patterns stressed unstressed syllables create rhythms meter poetry lyric writing often marked different symbols analyzed stressed syllables indicated forward slash unstressed syllables indicated lowercase stressed vs unstressed syllables identifiable regards natural shape language also regards function different parts speech carry different levels meaning therefore stressed differently words serve meaning function also called semantic cognitive function words always stressed hold meaning words serve grammatical function also called syntactic function grammatical functions hold meaning therefore words unstressed grammatical function purpose support words serve meaning function exceptions however guidelines particularly true dealing contrast following sentences give examples contrasts appropriate stress grammatical functions correct stress grammatical functions preserves rhythm natural words one syllable stressed determined whether function cognitive grammatical words one syllable called multisyllabic words twosyllable words typically one stressed one unstressed

two prosodic features falling unstressed stressed syllable pitch higher tonic lower primary stress volume duration secondary stress similar primary stress prominent words three syllables usually arrangement primary secondary unstressed music language alike utilize rhythm organize convey ideas time signatures music contain patterns strong weak beats every time signature first beat downbeat

properly aligning lyrical content context musical rhythm proper lyric setting preserves natural shape language promotes prosody involves melody lyrics paired sung one unit melody defined succession

stressed syllables placed first fourth beats unstressed syllables placed second third fifth sixth beats using duple meter time stressed syllables placed first fourth beats unstressed syllables placed second third fifth sixth beats note triplet time signatures accommodate duple triple meter lyrical recognizing suprasegmentals lyric gives extra representation natural contour language song instance stressed syllable reaches higher pitch might decide represent idea musically assigning higher pitch melody essential factor proper lyric setting potential preserve natural contour language could especially true lyric setting questions type sentence last syllable typically rises end indicate question syllables would otherwise maintain tonic pitch may naturally reach pitch stressed syllable context question taking account songwriter may decide preserve contour question pitch one also might consider duration stressed vs unstressed syllables apply concept musical rhythm assigning longer note value stressed syllable shorter note value unstressed syllable within melody essential however use duration create proper lyric setting natural contour language could potentially represented music prominently duration taken account dynamics typically interpretation vocalist song songwriter may choose emphasize stressed syllables louder dynamics unstressed syllables softer dynamics however essential factor lyric setting either suprasegmentals utilized solely special effect enhance meaning specific word phrase section instead enhance technical qualities stressed unstressed syllables using suprasegmentals way another aspect setting lyrics create prosody preserve natural emotion lyrical ultimate goal songwriting create emotional connection listener proper lyric setting essential tool achieving goal stressed unstressed syllables take rightful places song takes natural form although emotions may appear though mere happenstance technical tools proper lyric setting working behind scenes maintain basic building blocks song needs order achieve prosody effects proper lyric setting satisfying conditions lyrical content achieves highest state relatability lyric properly set natural rhythms present music words familiar easily recognized listener goal avoid causing audience work overtime identify words brain automatically interpret correctly set phrase though spoken conversation done quickly immediately without much thought following identification word comes understanding meaning meaning word intending context song lyric properly set word might mistaken different word completely unidentified songs constantly moving forward little time listener decipher words time listener identifies improperly set lyric song already moved onto new words melodies misstressed word loses opportunity live full meaning context words easily recognized understood song chance establishing emotional connection listener increased subconsciously creates level trust expectation
