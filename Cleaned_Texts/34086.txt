consequence reduced selfawareness accountability others later focused exclusively loss self core psychological process underlying deindividuation criticized deindividuation theory several reasons among others historical evidence case studies strongly suggested psychological process proposed deindividuation theory loss self occur metaanalysis empirical deindividuation research confirmed consistent empirical evidence processes contrary anonymity reduced selfawareness enhanced sensitivity local norms side researchers concluded good empirical support process deindividuation factors produce deindividuation highly variable effects account side proposes blanket indiscriminate effects anonymity anonymity effects influenced understood interaction social context also challenged conceptualization deindividuation loss self process assumes individuals unitary selfconcept less aware reicher others argued individuals unitary sense self social identity theory instance points ones sense self made personal identity multiple social identities combine shape ones personality social identities likely become basis selfdefinition social identity salient making comparisons us one consequence salience depersonalization social identity research term depersonalization refers switch group level selfcategorization self others seen terms group identities note research social identity depersonalization deindividuation loss self according selfcategorization depersonalization makes perceptions outgroup stereotypical selfperceptions also shift self ingroup members become interchangeable individual selfstereotypes terms group attributes depersonalization thus transforms individuals group members regulate behavior according ingroup norms importantly contrast deindividuation psychological state depersonalization imply loss rationality behavioural disinhibition rather individual behaves rationally regulates behaviour according ingroup standards ideas social identity theory selfcategorization theory provided key ingredients reichers critique deindividuation theory also foundations upon side modelled deindividuation basically one person think individual rather group one necessarily mean bad inappropriate behavior means group norms needed recent studies side model may put end racism growing children well social awkwardnessclarification needed fresh minds growing world technology side model becoming researched topic side model tells us people change behavior introduced groups example person engages activity party social event change behavior

side argues anonymity social context interaction cognitive strategic consequences group immersion anonymity cognitive consequences affect relative salience personal social identities factors produce loss self proposed deindividuation theory rather anonymity immersion group enhance salience social identity thereby depersonalize social perceptions others self side argues occurs principally visual anonymity obscures individual features interpersonal differences result decreased visibility individual within anonymous groups process depersonalization accentuated cognitive efforts perceive group entity amplified provided basis perceive self others members one group anonymity therefore enhances salience shared social identity net result people tend perceive self others terms stereotypic group features influenced important note anonymity automatically mechanically influence salience social identities individual identified way promotes individuated personperception alternatively promotes stronger social categorization instances making individual identifiable may strengthen social categorization may happen particularly contexts within social categories potentially meaningful therefore accessible group memberships visually clearly identifiable case gender certain racial characteristics disabilities side thus describes cognitive process salience social identity affected absence presence individuating information important note process operate extent sense groupness exists outset individuals interact anonymously absence specific social identity group boundaries anonymity would reverse effect accentuating one isolation group obscuring group needed juxtaposing two possibilities anonymity group either effect amplifying shared social identity however rudimentary already place amplify individual independence exists contexts shared identity available latter process whereby anonymity provides opportunities people express develop identities independent social influence group elaborated strategic side anonymity also strategic consequences affects ability express personal social strategic concerns come play outgroup power ingroup norms groups odds cases identifiability ingroup members towards outgroup shift power balance groups identifiability towards powerful outgroup limits degree ingroups identity expressed freely without sanction dimensions ingroup norms conflict outgroup standards values punishable otherwise sanctionable conversely anonymity towards powerful outgroup may convenient instrument ingroup express dimensions strategic side thus proposes anonymity may used less powerful groups express aspects identity may appear similar effects anonymity accountability classic deindividuation theory however unlike deindividuation theory side takes account intergroup context within identifiability anonymity occur implication loss accountability result disinhibited random antinormative behaviour individuals deindividuation theory concerned rather according side anonymity affects ability group express identity thus engage targeted ingroup normative behaviour thereby changing power relations groups close connection identity expression power proposed side may explain patterned targeted behaviour crowds whose violent actions occur often symbolic addition anonymity groups side also considers strategic effects anonymity within groups side particularly explored consequences anonymity well isolation ingroup members one hand deprives individual group members social support fellows may hinder ability express ingroup identity face powerful unsympathetic outgroup hand knowledge ingroup members unable identify self may consequences particular low identifiers feel less committed ingroup norms today side used explain
