gave tregors case seriously misquoted coke stated herle said statutes made law right made perceiving would put execution fact reference law right found original text herle wrote statutes made made put execution meaning statutes poorly drafted interpreted work parliament would accept courts applying theodore plucknett wrote whoever reads whole herles remarks see regard statute discussion falling within category contrary suggested perfectly obvious straightforward interpretation cokes first authority far second authority cessavit goes much support thesis concerns situation william bereford
