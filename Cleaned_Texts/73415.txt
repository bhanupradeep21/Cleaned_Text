saliva commonly referred spit extracellular fluid produced secreted salivary glands mouth humans saliva around water plus electrolytes mucus white blood cells epithelial cells dna extracted enzymes lipase amylase antimicrobial agents secretory iga enzymes found saliva essential beginning process digestion dietary starches fats enzymes also play role breaking food particles entrapped within dental crevices thus protecting teeth bacterial saliva also performs lubricating function wetting food permitting initiation swallowing protecting oral mucosa drying various animal species special uses saliva go beyond predigestion swifts use gummy saliva build nests aerodramus nests form basis birds nest cobras vipers certain members venom clade hunt venomous saliva injected fangs caterpillars produce silk fiber silk proteins stored modified salivary glands unrelated vertebrate produced salivary glands human saliva comprises water also contains many important substances including electrolytes mucus antibacterial compounds various medically constituents saliva noninvasively provide important diagnostic information related oral systemic experts debate amount saliva healthy person produces production estimated per day researchers generally accept sleep amount drops humans submandibular gland contributes around secretions parotid gland secretes small amounts secreted salivary saliva contributes digestion food maintenance oral hygiene without normal salivary function frequency dental caries gum disease gingivitis periodontitis oral problems increases significantlycitation needed saliva limits growth bacterial pathogens major factor sustaining systemic oral health prevention tooth decay removal sugars food sources saliva coats oral mucosa mechanically protecting trauma eating swallowing speaking mouth soreness common people reduced saliva xerostomia food especially dry food sticks inside mouth digestive functions saliva include moistening food helping create food bolus lubricative function saliva allows food bolus passed easily mouth esophagus saliva contains enzyme amylase also called ptyalin capable breaking starch simpler sugars maltose dextrin broken small intestine starch digestion takes place mouth cavity salivary glands also secrete salivary lipase potent form lipase begin fat digestion salivary lipase plays large role fat digestion newborn infants pancreatic lipase still needs time saliva important sense taste liquid medium chemicals carried taste receptor cells mostly associated lingual papillae people little saliva often complain dysgeusia ie disordered taste eg reduced ability taste bad metallic taste times rare condition identified affect taste saliva hypernatrium excessive amounts sodium saliva caused condition eg sjögren syndrome causing everything taste salty production saliva stimulated sympathetic nervous system saliva stimulated sympathetic innervation thicker saliva stimulated parasympathetically fluidlike sympathetic stimulation saliva facilitate respiration whereas parasympathetic stimulation facilitate digestion parasympathetic stimulation leads acetylcholine ach release onto salivary acinar cells ach binds muscarinic receptors specifically causes increased intracellular calcium ion concentration second messenger system increased calcium causes vesicles within cells fuse apical cell membrane leading secretion ach also causes salivary gland release kallikrein enzyme converts kininogen lysylbradykinin lysylbradykinin acts upon blood vessels capillaries salivary gland generate vasodilation increased capillary permeability respectively resulting increased blood flow acini allows production saliva addition substance p bind tachykinin receptors leading increased intracellular calcium concentrations subsequently increased saliva secretion lastly parasympathetic sympathetic nervous stimulation lead myoepithelium contraction causes expulsion secretions secretory acinus ducts eventually oral cavity sympathetic stimulation results release norepinephrine norepinephrine binding αadrenergic receptors cause increase intracellular calcium levels leading fluid vs protein secretion norepinephrine binds βadrenergic receptors result protein enzyme secretion vs fluid secretion stimulation norepinephrine initially decreases blood flow salivary glands due constriction blood vessels effect overtaken vasodilation caused various local vasodilators saliva production may also pharmacologically stimulated socalled sialagogues also suppressed socalled antisialagogues spitting act forcibly ejecting saliva substances mouth many parts world considered rude social taboo sometimes outlawed countries example outlawed reasons public decency attempting reduce spread disease laws may strictly enforced singapore fine spitting may high multiple offenses one even arrestedcitation needed china expectoration socially acceptable even officially disapproved illegal spittoons still common appearance cultures animals even humans cases use spitting automatic defensive maneuver camels well known though domestic camels trained spitting infected person example one whose saliva contains large amounts health hazard public many birds swift family apodidae produce viscous saliva nesting season glue together materials construct two species swifts genus aerodramus build nests using saliva base birds nest common belief saliva contained mouth natural disinfectants leads people believe beneficial lick wounds researchers university florida gainesville discovered protein called nerve growth factor ngf saliva mice wounds doused ngf healed twice fast untreated unlicked wounds therefore saliva help heal wounds species ngf found human saliva however researchers find human saliva contains antibacterial agents secretory mucin iga lactoferrin lysozyme shown human licking wounds disinfects licking likely help clean wound removing larger contaminants dirt may help directly remove infective bodies brushing away therefore licking would way wiping pathogens useful clean water available animal person pavlovs experiment dogs conditioned salivate response ringing bell stimulus associated meal hunger salivary secretion also associated nausea saliva usually formed mouth act called gleeking voluntary involuntary old cultures chewed grains produce alcoholic beverages kasiri sake number commercially available saliva substitutes httpsenwikipediaorgwikisaliva
