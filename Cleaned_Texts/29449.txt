antiexhaustion hypothesis possible explanation existence large repertoires song switching behaviour exhibited hypothesis states muscle exhaustion occurring due repeating song bouts avoided switching different song birds antiexhaustion hypothesis therefore predicts birds larger repertoires less susceptible exhaustion readily change song antiexhaustion hypothesis first proposed marcel lambrechts andré dhondt carried study using recordings great tits parus major dawn several studies carried results contradicted antiexhaustion hypothesis recent studies shown evidence antiexhaustion hypothesis cause large repertoires since proposal antiexhaustion hypothesis several hypotheses proposed explain existence repertoires song switching behaviour birds including motivation hypothesis warmup great tit parus major passerine bird belonging family paridae passerines commonly referred songbirds passerines singing multiple speciesspecific songs making birds ranked depending perform songs repertoire one side birds sing eventual variety small repertoires meaning song type repertoire repeated switch different song side birds sing immediate variety larger repertoires meaning switch song types great tit particular sings eventual variety small repertoire usually consisting two seven different song songs broken several simpler components songs made bouts last bout stereotyped repetition one five notes called two phrases sung short bursts called inbetween strophes periods silence referred interstrophe therefore great tit sings several strophes one song type switching bout another song type biologically large repertoire advantageous territorial defence larger repertoires also correlated higher reproductive marcel lambrechts andré dhondt proved average strophe length repertoire size used proxies male male quality refers fitness bird measuring well survives reproductive lambrechts dhondt set find answers four questions also pertaining percentage performance time male quality great first four questions sought determine high quality males higher fitness higher percentage performance time bouts compared lower quality males percentage performance time meaning percentage time song second high quality males sing longer bouts low quality third answer sought whether percentage performance time changed stayed final question sought answer whether percentage performance time changed bird switches song order determine answer four proposed questions marcel andré recorded male great tits two plots l b peerdsbos another plot u campus university antwerp came antiexhaustion hypothesis explanation results obtained results showed high quality males predicted higher percentage performance time low quality lambrechts dhondt also found great tits show systematic decrease percentage performance time bout also known finding drove hypothesis males able recover high percentage performance switching song types male producing shorter strophes longer interstrophe pauses low percentage performance switching different song type bird would able produce longer strophes shorter interstrophe lambrechts dhondt proposed antiexhaustion hypothesis provided functional casual explanation song switching behaviour birds along song antiexhaustion hypothesis stated necessary bird sing prolonged period time high rate must continuously switch song hypothesis focused around idea extended bouts singing would lead neuromuscular exhaustion repetitive stereotyped fashion song marcel andré proposed male great tits would longer interstrophe pauses towards end song due switching song types birds would using alternative soundproducing muscles nerves therefore would able recover high percentage performance study completed angelika poesel bart kempenaers aimed explaining drift blue tit cyanistes caeruleus song among parus species also explain findings relation antiexhaustion hypothesis motivation studied group male blue tits kolbeterberg vienna austria living mixed deciduous results study showed male blue tits show decrease performance output percentage performance time longer performed one song typed illustrated increase interstrophe order confirm antiexhaustion hypothesis two factors proposed lambrechts dhondt influenced low percentage performance time needed two factors initial level song output greater initial output greater drift would number switches song types switch song types performance output results study could conclude repeated stereotyped song difficult maintain long period time supported antiexhaustive motivation hypothesis competing hypothesis antiexhaustion hypothesis motivation hypothesis proposed weary explained drift may due lack motivation keep singing song neuromuscular study also worked great tits playing song weary suggested drift due lack motivation bird presented song rival example bird able increase song output motivational weary also argued drift caused neuromuscular exhaustion birds would able increase song output switch song types case lambrechts argued back test completed weary appropriate completed day dawn chorus song output order solve conflict weary lambrechts got together performed series tests day dawn chorus testing responsiveness results showed hypotheses supported drift common dawn chorus supporting antiexhaustive hypothesis also increase song output similar periods high low output supporting motivation results concluded antiexhaustive hypothesis motivation hypothesis possible occur warmup hypothesis proposed schraft et al seems contradict antiexhaustion hypothesis hypothesis foresees birds greater singing performance depending number songs bird sung day known recent practice regardless song study carried march june cabo rojo national wildlife refuge puerto male adelaides warblers setophaga adelaidae recorded breeding season resident woods found average repertoire schraft et al tested several hypotheses different prediction different independent song type specific hypothesis predicted performance would decrease consecutive repetitions song type independent variable run hypothesis consistent antiexhaustion hypothesis song type general hypothesis predicted performance would increase higher latency period songs independent variable warmup hypothesis predicted performance would increase number songs sung independent variable type singing showcases higher performance predicted type songs would higher performance type ii songs independent vocal interaction hypothesis predicted performance would increase also hypothesized timedependent factors influenced performance independent variable results study showed singing performance improves time throughout explained warmup hypothesis cumulative number songs bird sung hypotheses found effect singing performance including song type specific
