raghib syndrome rare congenital heart defect left superior vena cava lsvc draining left atrium addition absent coronary sinus atrial septal considered dangerous heart condition puts individual high risk defects often associated raghib syndrome include ventricular septal defects enlargement tricuspid annulus pulmonary considered extremely rare developmental complex cases regarding persistent left superior vena cava plsvc relatively common among congenital heart also important note plsvc often drains right atrium drains left atrium approximately individuals individual underlying heart condition superior vena cava delivers blood returning body right due oxygen used various biological processes throughout body blood extremely low blood oxygenation therefore right side heart pumps blood lungs gas exchange takes place oxygenated blood transported back left side heart pulmonary left atrium left ventricle work push oxygen saturated blood aorta stated earlier individuals raghib syndrome experience drainage left superior vena cava left means deoxygenated blood returning body directly bypassing lungs entering left atrium pumped back body causing result major implications several biological processes often requiring surgical coronary sinus vein continuing great cardiac collects blood ventricular veins heart muscle ventricle contraction moves blood right essentially coronary sinus takes deoxygenated blood veins heart muscle epicardial ventricular veins delivers right side heart transported lungs oxygenated extremely rare individual lacking component lastly common aspect raghib syndrome atrial septal defect hole septum dividing right left atriums size hole may vary significantly individual individual may even notice symptoms defect well adulthood main concern atrial septal defect cause right side heart become amount blood pumped lungs increases significantly blood left atrium leaks back right thus leading damaged blood vessels increased blood pressure even increase right side raghib syndrome classified congenital heart defect means defect present anterior posterior cardinal veins part embryonic venous eighth week fetal development cardinal veins slowly shrink disappear left anterior cardinal vein eventually transforms ligament vein fails disappear persistent left superior vena cava anomaly present population roughly congenital heart usually babies experience persistence left superior vena cava display heart anomalies raghib syndrome additional defects include absent coronary sinus along atrial septal persistent left super vena cava interfere rotation sinoatrial region thus causes right left cardinal veins heart lie level preventing formation coronary symptoms raghib syndrome include bluish discoloration skin otherwise characterized cyanosis result inadequate oxygenation red blood presents mainly skin nails lips surrounding eyes lack oxygenation bloodstream also cause symptoms regarding issues fine motor tasks cognitive symptoms raghib syndrome usually classified cryptogenic stroke otherwise known stroke resulting unknown symptoms include slurred speech leftsided facial numbness lefthanded symptoms raghib syndrome intense individuals might asymptomatic unaware congenital heart diagnosis often difficult since anomalies may noticed postmortem evaluation thus instances may considered benign essentially main symptoms making disease dangerous result lack oxygen reaching vital tissues muscles organs cyanosis typically classified less oxygen saturation typically blood oxygen saturation levels fall around oxygen used number biological processes throughout body perhaps vital processes cellular cells take molecules glucose convert chemical energy form adenosine triphosphate glycolysis single molecule glucose broken two molecules pyruvate converted acetylcoenzyme citric acid cycle takes acetylcoa series reactions generates molecules nadh used electron transport electron transport chain uses nadh form proton gradient mitochondria used generate oxygen comes play complex iv electron transport oxygen considered final electron acceptor essentially complex iv accepts electrons cytochrome c one time donates oxygen order form process two hydrogen protons transported intermembrane space therefore oxygen vital part generating energy cases raghib syndrome diagnosed postmortem evaluation however symptoms present individual evaluation heart conducted lead early detection diagnosis typically involves use cardiac magnetic resonance imaging magnetic resonance imagining medical imagine technique use magnetic field computergenerated radio waves able construct images organs tissues often times accompanied cardiac computed tomography cct scan creates images heart blood unlike cmri done directing xrays various angles order form detailed highresolution scan thus leading diagnosis issues regarding structure heart valves arteries aorta veins cct scan involve intravenous injection contrast media used define tissues differentiate use mri cct scan also aid doctors determining surgical intervention another possible way diagnose heart condition using electrocardiogram ecg individual electrodes placed chest measure electrical signal heart several things tracked ekg first p wave takes place electrical impulse travels left right atria causing contract pump blood ventricles make qrs complex contract push blood heart heart fully relaxes wave repolarization ekgs individuals raghib syndrome could show wave inversions leads left ventricular echocardiogram hand uses sound waves order create images heart allows doctors visualize well blood pumped throughout cardiac catheterization another way understand blood flow cardiac catheterization long thin tube otherwise known catheter inserted blood vessel examine heart valves take blood heart samples even place dye bloodstream better catheter placed blood vessel groin upper thigh arm lastly patients may also display significant reduction arterial blood oxygen depending size impact heart defects certain patients raghib syndrome could maintain oxygen saturation levels usually treatment involves surgical intervention order repair persistent left superior vena cava plsvc draining left several surgical options used based individual main goal surgical interventions reestablish intracardiac flow blood atrial patches applied areas concern roof left atrium coronary sinus helps form tunnel aiding blood often surgical correction done divert blood flow plsvc right atrium rather left sources indicate main surgical done attaching pslvc directly right atrium using graft attaching pslvc left pulmonary artery intraatrial baffle performing litigation pslvc however surgically attaching plsvc left pulmonary artery increase risk sources indicated reroofing coronary sinus important procedure yield optimum another source indicates simple monitoring individual placing medications used less extreme important seek medical advice professional symptoms degrees defect immensely individual individual one case study female given pericardial patch close atrial septal defect anastomosed pslvc directly left pulmonary thus getting rid leakage blood left atrium ensuring blood pslvc directed right side heart pumped followup several years later indicated surgery successful symptoms cryptogenic another case study done infant diagnosed raghib syndrome mri done extracardiac intervention method applied plsvc directly connected right atrial seen best intervention method since decreased risk obstructing pulmonary vein blood flow reduced tension left atrium hopefully prevented future female showing lefthanded clumsiness hypertension strokelike symptoms facial numbness slurred speech brought indepth analysis brain heart showed signs raghib unlike individuals discharged several medications aspirin metoprolol well holter monitor keep track lastly female experienced several years cyanosis heart individual underwent surgical intervention diagnose raghib syndrome using chest xray surgery doctors found coronary sinus completely unroofed plsvc draining directly left surgeons reroofed coronary sinus reconstructed atrial septum prevent drainage redirected plsvc right surgical intervention many individuals suffering defect able go lead fully functional issues may arise heart condition goes undiagnosed thus putting individual increased risk however could remain benign anomaly individuals never result symptoms httpsenwikipediaorgwikiraghibsyndrome
