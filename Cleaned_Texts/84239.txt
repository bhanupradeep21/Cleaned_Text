third molar commonly called wisdom tooth posterior three molars quadrant human dentition age wisdom teeth come erupt generally occurs late teens early adults four wisdom teeth one four quadrants possible none fewer case extras called supernumerary teeth wisdom teeth may become stuck teeth enough space come normally impacted wisdom teeth still sometimes removed orthodontic treatment believing move teeth cause crowding though held anymore impacted wisdom teeth may suffer tooth decay oral hygiene becomes difficult wisdom teeth partially erupted gum may also cause infection surrounding gum tissues termed pericoronitis conservative treatments operculectomies may appropriate cases however impacted wisdom teeth commonly extracted treat prevent problems sources oppose prophylactic removal diseasefree impacted wisdom teeth including national institute health care excellence morphology wisdom teeth variable maxillary upper third molars commonly triangular crown deep central fossa

experience contributing risk factors ian damage procedure careful casebycase consideration crucial avoid lower anterior teeth crowding common discussion among orthodontic community decades thought unerupted wisdom teeth produced forward directed force would cause crowding anterior segment recent research shown agreed opinion cause due variety factors includes dental factors tooth crown size primary tooth loss skeletal factors include growth maxilla mandible presence malocclusions general factors including age gender patient overall recent research suggested wisdom teeth alone cause
