gusev crater planet mars located aeolis quadrangle crater kilometers diameter formed approximately three four billion years ago named russian astronomer matvey gusev prior exploration crater spirit rover crater postulated ancient lakebed maadim vallis draining volcaniclastic origin combination interpretations based viking orbiter imagery moc imagery themis thermal mapping mola elevation mapping however spirit find lacustrine deposits instead spirit found alkaline volcanic rocks including olivine basalt comminuted basaltic debris lavas pyroclastic rocks eruption recently satellite images showed trails dust devils gusevs floor spirit rover later photographed dust devils ground likely owes much longevity dust devils cleaning solar panels january gusev landing site first nasas two mars exploration rovers named spirit hoped numerous smaller recent craters region would exposed sedimentary material early eras although first region proved disappointing lack available bedrock study flat lava plains crater eventually arrived columbia hills however rocks examined region showed evidence small amounts briny salty water interacting ancient although nearly much meridiani planum landing area spirits twin opportunity spirit became stuck soil region went offline harsh martian winter gusev also considered potential landing site mars perseverance rover rocks plains gusev type basalt contain minerals olivine pyroxene plagioclase magnetite look like volcanic basalt finegrained irregular holes geologists would say vesicles much soil plains came breakdown local rocks fairly high levels nickel found soils probably analysis shows rocks slightly altered tiny amounts water outside coatings cracks inside rocks suggest water deposited minerals maybe bromine compounds rocks contain fine coating dust one harder rinds material one type brushed another needed ground rock abrasion tool variety rocks columbia hills mars altered water much water dust gusev crater dust around planet dust found magnetic moreover spirit found magnetism caused mineral magnetite especially magnetite contained element titanium one magnet able completely divert dust hence martian dust thought spectra dust similar spectra bright low thermal inertia regions like tharsis arabia detected orbiting satellites thin layer dust maybe less one millimeter thick covers surfaces something contains small amount chemically bound observations rocks plains show contain minerals pyroxene olivine plagioclase magnetite rocks classified different ways amounts types minerals make rocks primitive called picritic basalts rocks similar ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic komatiites rocks plains also resemble basaltic shergottites meteorites came mars one classification system compares amount alkali elements amount silica graph system gusev plains rocks lie near junction basalt picrobasalt tephrite irvinebarager classification calls plains rocks slightly altered probably thin films water softer contain veins light colored material may bromine compounds well coatings rinds thought small amounts water may gotten cracks inducing mineralization coatings rocks may occurred rocks buried interacted thin films water dust one sign altered easier grind rocks compared types rocks found earth first color picture gusev crater rocks found basalt everything covered fine dust spirit determined magnetic mineral magnetite crosssectional drawing typical rock plains gusev crater rocks contain coating dust one harder coatings veins waterdeposited veins visible along crystals olivine veins may contain bromine salts approximate truecolor view rock nicknamed adirondack taken spirits pancam digital camera image spirits pancam adirondack rat grind spirits rock grinding tool scientists found variety rock types columbia hills placed six different categories six clovis wishbone peace watchtower backstay independence named prominent rock group chemical compositions measured apxs significantly different importantly rocks columbia hills show various degrees alteration due aqueous enriched elements phosphorus sulfur chlorine carried around water solutions columbia hills rocks contain basaltic glass along varying amounts olivine olivine abundance varies inversely amount sulfates exactly expected water destroys olivine helps produce sulfates clovis group especially interesting m√∂ssbauer spectrometermb detected goethite goethite forms presence water discovery first direct evidence past water columbia hillss rocks addition mb spectra rocks outcrops displayed strong decline olivine although rocks probably contained much olivine marker lack water easily decomposes presence water sulfate found needs water form wishstone contained great deal plagioclase olivine anhydrate sulfate peace rocks showed sulfur strong evidence bound water hydrated sulfates suspected watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently may altered water independence class showed signs clay perhaps montmorillonite member smectite group clays require fairly long term exposure water form one type soil called paso robles columbia hills may evaporate deposit contains large amounts sulfur phosphorus calcium also mb found much iron paso robles soil oxidized fe form would happen water towards middle sixyear mission mission supposed last days large amounts pure silica found soil silica could come interaction soil acid vapors produced volcanic activity presence water water hot spring spirit stopped working scientists studied old data miniature thermal emission spectrometer minites confirmed presence large amounts carbonaterich rocks means regions planet may harbored water carbonates discovered outcrop rocks called summary spirit found evidence slight weathering plains gusev evidence lake however columbia hills clear evidence moderate amount aqueous weathering evidence included sulfates minerals goethite carbonates form presence water believed gusev crater may held lake long ago since covered igneous materials dust contains magnetic component identified magnetite titanium furthermore thin coating dust covers everything mars parts mars gusev crater one three candidates landing site
