hemochromatosis type hereditary iron overload disorder affects ferroportin iron transport protein needed export iron cells although disease rare found throughout world affects people various ethnic groups majority individuals type hemochromatosis relatively mild form disease affected individuals severe form disease progresses iron may accumulate tissues affected individuals time potentially resulting organ symptoms vary greatly individuals type hemochromatosis difference symptoms likely due different types mutations patients may general signs symptoms type hemochromatosis caused excess iron cells leads tissue damage damage largely due ironcatalyzed oxidative reactions iron exchange electrons variety substrates lead generation reactive oxygen species lead oxidative stress lipid peroxidation dna damage may result cell two main forms hemochromatosis type exist b symptoms forms distinct one type hemochromatosis typically milder symptoms types hemochromatosis individuals type hemochromatosis tend hyperferritinemia elevated ferritin blood plasma low saturated transferrin levels individuals likely liver spleen iron overload primarily kupffer cells iron export impaired iron unavailable transport circulating transferrin iron unavailability potentially leads mild anemia type hemochromatosis patients iron necessary hemoglobin synthesis red blood cells relatively high turnover time iron stores increase individuals type hemochromatosis may develop hepatic symptoms type hemochromatosis tend severe resemble symptoms hemochromatosis types plasma iron concentration elevated symptoms include joint pain diabetes arrhythmia liver iron deposition tends greater type type liver damage occurs frequently form hemochromatosis type individuals develop cirrhosis type hemochromatosis caused mutations gene located long arm chromosome specifically gene encodes ferroportin protein responsible exporting iron cells intestine liver spleen kidney well reticuloendothelial macrophages mutations gene identified patients type reported mutations deletions missense mutations lead amino acid mutations change amino acid sequence result loss function gain function resulting ferroportin protein loss function mutation results phenotype different gain function mutation phenotypes associated two different forms type hemochromatosis lossoffunction mutations frequent

hemochromatosis recessive pattern inheritance type autosomal dominant dominant disorder dominant inheritance pattern occurs hemochromatosis type ferroportin multimeric consequently mutant ferroportin associate wildtype ferroportin multimers interfere function normal ferroportin normal iron regulation iron absorbed intestine ferroportin transports iron cells intestinal lining bloodstream iron bloodstream bound transferrin carries iron target cells iron stored cells blood serum protein called ferritin reticuloendothelial macrophages phagocytose red blood cells important iron recycling process ferroportin upregulated reticuloendothelial macrophages phagocytosis occurs iron degraded red blood cells released bloodstream transported types cells needed hepcidin protein synthesized liver response iron inflammation regulator ferroportin expression hepcidin binds ferroportin ferroportin phosphorylated endocytosed tagged ubiquitin mutations gene identified patients type misregulation ferroportin type hemochromatosis involve failure ferroportin properly expressed cell membrane involve failure ferroportin respond negative regulation hemochromatosis type characterized impaired iron export cells reticuloendothelial macrophages affected iron accumulates preferentially kupffer cells located liver serum ferritin increases less iron available circulating transferrin protein binds iron transports bloodstream cell means iron trapped certain types tissues transported tissues needed accumulation iron tissues due impaired iron export lead increasing transferrin iron saturation liver parenchymal iron overload advanced stages ferritin produced suppress oxidative cell damage although amount ferritin cells accumulate hemochromatosis type characterized abnormal iron release macrophages enterocytes mutant ferroportin resistant hepcidin protein serves regulatory function wildtype intestinal iron absorption release iron macrophages thus form disease leads elevated transferrin saturation systemic iron overload results liver iron deposition primarily diagnosis based upon identification symptoms medical history family history laboratory tests blood tests may show high levels ferritin low normal high levels transferrin saturation depending form hemochromatosis diagnosis must confirmed genetic testing treatment based symptoms severity disease iron chelators may used bind excess iron tissues allow excretion excess individuals hemochromatosis type may treated therapeutic phlebotomy however individuals hemochromatosis type may require treatment additionally therapeutic phlebotomy may tolerated individuals type anemia may develop despite elevated serum ferritin levels typically found ferroportin disease
