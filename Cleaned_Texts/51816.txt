hormonal contraception refers birth control methods act endocrine system almost methods composed steroid hormones although india one selective estrogen receptor modulator marketed contraceptive original hormonal combined oral contraceptive first marketed contraceptive ensuing decades many delivery methods developed although oral injectable methods far popular hormonal contraception highly effective taken prescribed schedule users steroid hormone methods experience pregnancy rates less per year perfectuse pregnancy rates hormonal contraceptives usually around rate currently available methods used women development male hormonal contraceptive active research area two main types hormonal contraceptive formulations combined methods contain estrogen progestin progestogenonly methods contain progesterone one synthetic analogues progestins combined methods work suppressing ovulation thickening cervical mucus progestogenonly methods reduce frequency ovulation rely heavily changes cervical mucus incidence certain side effects different different formulations example breakthrough bleeding much common progestogenonly methods certain serious complications occasionally caused estrogencontaining contraceptives believed caused progestogenonly formulations deep vein thrombosis one example hormonal contraception primarily used prevention pregnancy also prescribed treatment polycystic ovary syndrome menstrual disorders dysmenorrhea menorrhagia hormonal treatments hormonal contraceptives frequently successful alleviating symptoms associated polycystic ovary syndrome birth
