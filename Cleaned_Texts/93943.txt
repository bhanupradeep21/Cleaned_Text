verbal behavior book psychologist b f skinner describes calls verbal behavior traditionally called skinners work describes controlling elements verbal behavior terminology invented analysis echoics mands tacts autoclitics others well carefully defined uses ordinary terms audience origin verbal behavior outgrowth series lectures first presented university minnesota early developed summer lectures columbia william james lectures harvard decade books skinners analysis verbal behavior drew heavily methods literary tradition book verbal behavior almost entirely theoretical involving little experimental research work many research papers applied extensions based verbal behavior done since skinners verbal behavior also introduced autoclitic six elementary operants mand tact audience

supplementary stimulation discussion practical matters controlling verbal behavior given context material presented thus far issues multiple control involving many elementary operants stated previous chapters discussed special case multiple causation comes play creating new verbal forms skinner describes fragmentary responses combinations typically vocal although may due different conditions selfediting rather special property mutations may nonsense may verbal interchange occurs freudian slips may one special case fragmentary responses tend given reinforcement may discourage selfediting phenomenon appears common children adults learning second language fatigue illness insobriety may tend produce fragmentary responding autoclitic form verbal behavior modifies functions forms verbal

shape private events critical things occur within organisms skin excluded understanding verbal behavior catania p several concerns associated tacting private events skinner acknowledged two major dilemmas first acknowledges difficulty predicting controlling stimuli associated tacting private events p catania describes unavailability stimulus members verbal community p second problem skinner describes current inability understand verbal behavior associated private events developed p skinner continues describe four potential ways verbal community encourage verbal behavior access stimuli speaker suggests frequent method via common public accompaniment example might kid falls starts bleeding caregiver tells statements like got hurt another method collateral response associated private stimulus example would kid comes running crying holding hands knee caregiver might make statement like got hurt third way verbal community provides reinforcement contingent overt behavior organism generalizes private event occurring skinner refers metaphorical metonymical extension final method skinner suggests may help form verbal behavior behavior initially low level turns private event
