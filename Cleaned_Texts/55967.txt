sexual division labour sdl delegation different tasks male female animals among human foragers males females targeted different types foods shared mutual familial species males females eat slightly different foods species males females routinely share food humans two attributes remaining huntergatherer populations world serve evolutionary models help explain origin sexual division labor many studies sexual division labor conducted huntergatherer populations hadza huntergatherer population modern day society sex differences occupation seen across cultures tendency men technical work women tend work related care men women option investing resources either provision children additional offspring according life history theory males females monitor costs benefits alternative maximize reproductive however tradeoff differences exist sexes females likely benefit parental care effort certain offspring relatively reproductive opportunities relatively costly risky contrast males less certain paternity may many mating opportunities bearing relatively low costs risks though every huntergatherer population pinpoints females gathering males hunting notably norm current populations divide roles labor manner natural selection likely favor male reproductive strategies stress mating effort female strategies emphasize parental result women lowrisk task gathering vegetation underground storage organs rich energy provide since women provide reliable source caloric intake men able afford higher risk failure hunting animals book catching fire cooking made us british primatologist richard wrangham suggests origin division labor males females may originated invention cooking estimated happened simultaneously humans gaining control fire million years idea early proposed friedrich engels unfinished essay classic theory natural selection positing difference male female reproductive strategies recentlywhen reexaminedby alternate theory proposedby promiscuity encouraged among women men alike causing uncertainty among males paternity offspring allowing group cooperation raising offspring due possibility child could descendant male similar observations closest relative humans source moreover recent archaeological research done anthropologist archaeologist steven university arizona suggests sexual division labor exist prior upper paleolithic years ago developed relatively recently human history sexual division labor may arisen allow humans acquire food resources sexual division labor observed globally across many societies breadwinner homemaker model stable characteristic division pronounced fields work others generally work outside dangerous work work highly technical disciplines typically stem jobs exception related health care likely done work related care interpersonal relations generally likely done borders division generally stable fields showing reversal proportions fields see increasing segregation positively correlated levels egalitarian policies countries known genderequality paradox traditional explanation sexual division labour finds males females cooperate within pair bonds targeting different foods everyone household females may target foods conflict reproduction child care males target foods females gather increases variance daily consumption provides broader diet foraging specialization particular food groups increase skill level thus foraging success rates targeted foods hypothesis proposes men hunt gain social attention mating benefits widely sharing game model proposes hunting functions mainly provide honest signal underlying genetic quality hunters later yields mating advantage social women tend target foods reliable men tend target difficulttoacquire foods signal abilities genetic quality hunting thus viewed form mating malemale status competition familial recent studies hadza revealed men hunt mainly distribute food families rather sharing members conclusion suggests evidence hunting signaling purposes victorian era closely examined sally shuttleworth company women played dual roles expected deliver conviction aspects required perform duties outside household states two traditional tropes combined victorian medical textbooks demonstrated womans biological fitness adaptation sacred role homemaker also terrifying subjection forces body angel demon woman came represent civilizing power would cleanse male contamination brutal world economic market also rampant uncontrolled excesses material optimal foraging theory oft states organisms forage way maximize energy intake per unit words animals behave way find capture consume food containing calories expending least amount time possible sexual division labor provides appropriate explanation males forgo opportunity gather items caloric value strategy would seem suboptimal energetic standpoint oft suggests sexual division labor adaptation benefits household thus foraging behavior males appear optimal level huntergatherer man rely resources others passes food item caloric value assumed foraging optimal level passes opportunity food women routinely gather long men women share spoils optimal men forgo collection continue searching different resources complement resources gathered emergence cooking early homo may created problems food theft women food result females would recruit male partners protect resources others concept known theft hypothesis accommodates explanation labor cooking strongly associated status women forced gather cook foods acquire food otherwise access resources critical reproductive contrary men gather physical dominance allows scrounge cooked foods women thus womens foraging food preparation efforts allow men participate highrisk highreward activities hunting females turn become increasingly sexually attractive means exploit male interest investing many studies investigating spatial abilities men women found significant though metastudies show male advantage mental rotation assessing horizontality female advantage spatial sexual division labor proposed explanation cognitive differences differences disappear short training given favorable image woman furthermore individual differences greater average differences isnt therefore valid prediction male female cognitive hypothesis argues males needed ability follow prey long distances accurately target game projectile technology result male specialization hunting prowess would spurred selection increased spatial navigational ability similarly ability remember locations underground storage organs vegetation would led increase overall efficiency decrease total energy expenditure since time spent searching food would natural selection based behaviors increase hunting success energetic efficiency would bear positive influence reproductive success however recent research suggests sexual division labor developed relatively recently gender roles always earlyhuman cultures contradicting
