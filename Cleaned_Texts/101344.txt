cryolophosaurus ˌkraɪoʊˌloʊfoʊˈsɔːrəs kraɪˌɒloʊfoʊˈsɔːrəs cryohloafohsawrus genus large theropod dinosaur known single species cryolophosaurus ellioti early jurassic antarctica one largest theropods early jurassic subadult estimated reached metres ft long weighed kilograms lb cryolophosaurus first excavated antarcticas early jurassic pliensbachian aged hanson formation formerly upper falla formation paleontologist dr william hammer first carnivorous dinosaur discovered antarctica first nonavian dinosaur continent officially named sediments fossils found dated million years ago representing early jurassic period cryolophosaurus known skull femur material caused classification vary greatly femur possesses many primitive characteristics classified cryolophosaurus dilophosaurid neotheropod outside dilophosauridae averostra whereas skull many advanced features leading genus considered tetanuran abelisaurid ceratosaur even allosaurid cryolophosaurus currently considered derived neotheropod close averostra additionally cryolophosaurus possessed distinctive pompadour crest spanned head side side based evidence related species studies bone texture thought bizarre crest used intraspecies recognition brain cryolophosaurus also primitive theropods cryolophosaurus originally collected austral summer mount kirkpatrick beardmore glacier region transantarctic mountains discovery made hammer professor augustana college team fossils found siliceous siltstone hanson formation formerly upper falla formation dated pliensbachian stage early jurassic cryolophosaurus second dinosaur first theropod discovered antarctica discovered antarctopelta named hammer ohio state university geologist david elliot excavated separate outcrops near beardmore glacier sharing logistical expenses elliots team first came across remains cryolophosaurus rock formation around altitude ft high km mi south pole discovery made soon notified hammer next three weeks hammer excavated kg lb fossilbearing rock team recovered fossil bones including specimens formally named described hammer hickerson journal season field team returned collected material original site second locality discovered metres ft higher section mt name cryolophosaurus ellioti derived greek words κρυος meaning cold frozen reference discovery antarctica λοφος meaning crest σαυρος meaning lizard thus cold crest lizard hammer hickerson named species c ellioti david elliot made initial discovery cryolophosaurus large wellbuilt theropod one largest time holotype specimen estimated reached ft long weighed kg molinapérez larramendi gave larger estimation meters ft kg researchers noted holotype individual probably represents subadult adults could despite slender proportions cryolophosaurus one largest known early jurassic holotype fmnh fully described specimen cryolophosaurus specimen consists incomplete skull mandibles lacking front half nine maxillary teeth fragmentary sixth cervical centrum cervical vertebrae several posterior cervical ribs several anterior dorsal vertebrae mid posterior dorsal vertebrae several dorsal ribs fifth sacral vertebrae three chevrons many partial complete caudal vertebrae centra two partial humeri proximal radius proximal ulna partial ilium proximal pubis ischia one distal two incomplete femora distal end tibia distal end fibula astragalus new material cryolophosaurus unearthed antarctica description material yet published nonabstract holotype cryolophosaurus consists high narrow skull discovered articulated rest skull estimated centimetres long peculiar nasal crest runs eyes rises perpendicular skull fans thin highly furrowed giving unique pompadour appearance earned nickname crest extension skull bones near tear ducts fused either side orbital horns rise eye sockets theropods like monolophosaurus crests usually run along skull instead across unpublished study conducted vernon meidlingerchin suggested previous studies lacked focus endocranial details study found cryolophosaurus fossil nearly complete undistorted cranial cavity complete enough give approximate shape size living brain endocast features clarified dissimilarity skull allosauroids coelurosaurs giving cryolophosaurus basal position closer examination skull bones fused reviewed details snout forehead exceptionally similar classification cryolophosaurus difficult mix primitive advanced characteristics femur traits early theropods skull resembles much later species clade tetanurae like chinas sinraptor yangchuanosaurus led paul sereno et al place cryolophosaurus taxon originally hammer colleagues suspected cryolophosaurus might ceratosaur even early abelisaur traits convergent advanced tetanurans ultimately concluded earliest known member tetanuran subsequent study hammer along smith currie recovered cryolophosaurus tetanuran later study authors found closely related dilophosaurus sterling nesbitt et al using characters tawa found cryolophosaurus neither dilophosaurid averostran neotheropod instead sister group clade composed dilophosaurids however matthew carrano found cryolophosaurus tetanuran related sinosaurus unrelated monograph dilophosaurus found cryolophosaurus derived neotheropod close averostra derived position zupaysaurus less following cladogram illustrates synthesis relationships early theropod groups compiled hendrickx et al coelophysidae liliensternus zupaysaurus dilophosauridae ceratosauria cryolophosaurus sinosaurus monolophosaurus megalosauroidea allosauroidea coelurosauria however study conducted adam marsh timothy rowe found cryolophosaurus basal neotheropod still closer averostra coelophysoidea still basal lepidus liliensternus coelophysis kayentakatae coelophysis megapnosaurus camposaurus zupaysaurus cryolophosaurus dilophosaurus ceratosauria tetanurae cranial display features one possessed cryolophosaurus make sense social gregarious animals members species available

fossil thomas r holtz jr found bizarre crest cryolophosaurus primarily intraspecies recognition based evidence related species studies bone according thomas rich colleagues crest would ineffective

ribs supposed prosauropod dinosaur found mouth cryolophosaurus led hammer conclude feeding prosauropod died hammer noted since ribs found extending way back theropods neck region individual may choked death however smith et al concluded remains belonged cryolophosaurus specimen hammers hammer also concluded postcanine tooth belonging tritylodont early mammal relative found remains part stomach contents cryolophosaurus bones pathologies show evidence scavenging broken teeth juvenile cryolophosaurus found teeth roots likely shed naturally scavenging adult cryolophosaurus carcass another possible pathology found astragalus ankle bone cryolophosaurus bone preserved small splint fibula located ankle splint however may also unique morphological feature known specimens cryolophosaurus
