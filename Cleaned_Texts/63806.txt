tumor bone metastases classified osteolytic osteoblastic unlike hematologic malignancies originate blood form nonsolid tumors bone metastases generally arise epithelial tumors form solid mass inside bone bone metastases especially state advanced disease cause severe pain characterized dull constant ache periodic spikes incident normal conditions bone undergoes continuous remodeling osteoclastmediated bone resorption osteoblastmediated bone processes normally tightly regulated within bone maintain bone structure calcium homeostasis body dysregulation processes tumor cells leads
