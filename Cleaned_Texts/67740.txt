shampoos typically demipermanent hair coloring contains alkaline agent eg ethanolamine sodium carbonate ammonia always employed developer concentration hydrogen peroxide developer may lower used permanent hair color products provide almost lightening hairs color dyeing since alkaline agents employed demipermanent colors less effective removing natural pigment hair ammonia result color hair lighter shade dyeing less damaging hair permanent counterpart demipermanents much effective covering gray hair semipermanents less permanents demipermanents several advantages compared permanent color essentially lifting ie removal natural hair color final color less uniformhomogeneous permanent therefore natural looking gentler hair therefore safer especially damaged hair wash time typically shampoos root regrowth less noticeable change color desired easier achieve demipermanent hair colors permanent darker shades particular may persist longer indicated packet shampoos typically

undesirable brassy yellow hue product known toner used slightly alter hair colors purple shampoo shampoo purple coloring agents also used counteract brassy many ways people maintain hair color hair coloring involves use chemicals capable removing replacing andor covering pigments naturally found inside hair shaft use chemicals result range adverse effects including temporary skin irritation allergy hair breakage skin discoloration unexpected hair color results according international agency research cancer iarc vitro vivo studies exposed human populations shown hair dyes many chemicals used hair dyeing process considered mutagenic certain individuals use hair coloring result allergic reactions andor skin irritation individuals allergic gluten example need cautious purchasing hair color since certain hair dye includes gluten gluten need ingested cause allergy skin contact gluten may cause reaction therefore leading allergy symptoms reactions include redness sores itching burning sensation discomfort symptoms sometimes apparent immediately following application processing tint also arise hours even day later help prevent limit allergic reactions majority hair color products recommend client conduct patch test using product involves mixing small quantity tint preparation applying directly skin period hours irritation develops manufacturers recommend client use

process october leading breast surgeon professor kefah mokbel published metaanalysis showing use hair dyes might increase risk developing breast cancer among another study found similar permanent hair coloring requires three components historically currently coupling agent oxidant process typically performed basic conditions mechanism oxidation dyes involves three oxidation derivative quinone state

intermediates coupler compounds undergo oxidation coupling reaction shown scheme form high molecular weight products trapped hair matrix readily removed washing various combinations primary intermediates coupler compounds provide spectrum shades hair colors primary intermediates aromatic para compounds coupler compounds couplers metasubstituted derivatives aniline come three major classes based color produce react primary intermediate first step shows oxidation pphenylenediamine quinonediimine species exists equilibrium monoprotonated form shown second step involves attack
