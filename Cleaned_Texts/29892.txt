gallbladder diseases diseases involving gallbladder closely linked biliary disease common cause gallstones gallbladder designed aid digestion fats concentrating storing bile made liver transferring biliary tract digestive system bile ducts connect liver gallbladder sphincter oddi gallbladder controlled neurohormonal basis cholecystokinin cck leading contraction release bile bile ducts hormones allow relaxation storing disruption hormones ducts gallbladder lead disease gallstones common disease lead diseases including cholecystitis inflammation gallbladder gallstone pancreatitis gallstone blocks pancreatic treatment considered symptomatic disease vary surgical nonsurgical million new cases gallbladder biliary disease occurred gallbladder disease presents chiefly abdominal pain located right upper abdomen pain described biliary colic pain typically occurs suddenly radiates right shoulder back depending several factors including specific diseases either constant episodic last minutes

oral contraceptive use estrogen replacement therapy established risk factors cholesterol gallstone formation female sex hormones adversely influence hepatic bile secretion gallbladder function estrogens increase cholesterol secretion diminish bile salt secretion progestins act reducing bile salt secretion impairing gallbladder emptying leading stasis new generation progestin drospirenone used oral contraceptives may heighten risk gallstone disease cholecystectomy however increased risk quite modest likely clinically retrospective historical cohort study performed large data base including medicaid billing data states michigan minnesota users ocs compared nonusers oral contraceptives shown risk factors gallbladder disease although risk sufficient magnitude potential clinical importance young royal college general practitioners oral contraception study suggests longterm oral contraceptives associated increased risk gallbladder disease although acceleration disease women susceptible newer research suggests otherwise metaanalysis concludes oral contraceptive use associated slightly transiently increased rate gallbladder disease laters confirms modern lowdose oral
