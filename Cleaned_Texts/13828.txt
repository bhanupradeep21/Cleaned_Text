twopoint discrimination ability discern two nearby objects touching skin truly two distinct points one often tested two sharp points neurological assumed reflect finely innervated area skin clinical settings twopoint discrimination widely used technique assessing tactile relies ability andor willingness patient subjectively report feeling completed patient eyes therapist may use calipers simply reshaped paperclip therapist may alternate randomly touching patient one point two points area tested eg finger arm leg patient asked report whether one two points felt smallest distance two points still results perception two distinct stimuli recorded patients twopoint performance two extremities compared discrepancies although test still commonly used clinically roundly criticized many researchers providing invalid measure tactile spatial acuity several highly regarded alternative tests proposed replace body areas differ tactile receptor density somatosensory cortical representation normally person able recognize two points separated mm fingertips lips mm palms mm mm shins back assuming points posterior columnmedial lemniscus pathway responsible carrying information involving fine discriminative touch therefore twopoint discrimination impaired damage pathway peripheral although twopoint testing commonly used clinically evidence accumulated many research studies indicates flawed measure tactile spatial acuity research studies shown twopoint test may low sensitivity failing detect underestimating sensory poorly tracks recovery function following nerve injury poor testretest fails correlate validated measures tactile spatial acuity grating orientation twopoint testing criticized yielding highly variable performance across within participants reliant subjective criterion adopted participant reporting one compared two resulting performance good true measured twopoint threshold fall unrealistically well skins receptor long recognized pressed precisely simultaneously two points may evoke temporally distinguishable neural activations two points may distinguished one two points perceived spatially two contacts perceived furthermore neurophysiological recordings shown two points evoke different number action potentials receptor population one point two points may distinguished one two points actually perceived merely twopoint configuration produces different overall response summary twopoint task present nonspatial temporal cue nonspatial magnitude cue observant participant unintended nonspatial cues could signal presence two points compared one even points placed closer together participants spatial basis observations several researchers strongly warned use task pointing enormous implausible variability reported levels nerve repair authors one article conclude sole test tactile gnosis recovery seriously questioned comparing thresholds functional recovery patients following nerve repair another author states conclusion drawn data pd valid index sensory capacity underlying integrated hand author book nerve repair concludes convenient critically flawed procedure presents nonspatial cues learned improve performance without physiologic change authors article tersely entitled twopoint threshold measure tactile spatial recommend alternative tests supplant test authors yet another research article concur strongly recommend clinicians researchers simply set aside task replace one ensures purely spatial measure several highly regarded tactile tests developed rigorous replacements psychophysics research laboratories favored test tactile spatial acuity many years grating orientation task got participant attempts discern orientation parallel grooves pressed either along across fingertip got threshold groove width participant performs specified level accuracy eg correct got considered yield valid measure tactile spatial acuity used many research studies manual automated stimulus delivery example got used map spatial acuity different body characterize tactile spatial acuity affected skin track changes tactile spatial acuity occur perceptual recovery nerve although popular tactile research labs got admittedly less practical clinical use requires specialized preconstructed stimulus objects span fixed spatial range rather single continuously adjustable comparative simplicity flexibility test encouraged continuation use clinicians despite tests acknowledged remedy situation twopoint orientation discrimination proposed test combines convenience validity task patient attempts discern orientation eg along across finger created two sharp points contact skin threshold distance points participant performs specified level accuracy eg explained validity task called question allows participant rely nonspatial cues contrast got tasks considered yield valid measures tactile spatial acuity order perform tasks participant must discern spatial modulation neural discharge underlying skin receptors rely nonspatial following figure study evaluated fingertip finger base palm demonstrates contaminated nonspatial cues whereas provides uncontaminated measure tactile spatial acuity
