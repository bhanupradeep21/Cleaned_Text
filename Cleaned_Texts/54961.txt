vezt gene located chromosome encodes protein vezatin vezatin major component cadherincatenin complex critical formation maintenance adherens protein expressed epithelial cells crucial formation cellcell contact junctions mutations gene lead upregulation downregulation protein detrimental effects physiological systems particularly involved development protein vezatin shown play critical role maintenance formation adherens junctions many epithelial cells adherens junctions composed primarily ecadherin alpha beta catenins proteins actin myosin junctions formed vital creating cellcell contacts via interactions different components ecadherins separate cells use calcium based interactions bind whilst catenins bind cadherins actin cytoskeleton cell thus creating cadherincatenin complex vezatin colocalises ecadherin cellcell junctions suggesting fact involved within adherens ecadherin important transmembrane molecule creating facilitating adherens junctions particularly epithelial cells furthermore vezatin appear focal adhesion sites colocalise desmogleins molecules present desmosomes suggesting solely responsible interactions within adherens additionally cells lacking ecadherin thus unable form cellcell contacts vezatin displayed cytoplasmic another key component junction protein myosin viia primarily interaction vezatin myosins mechanochemical proteins interact actins enzymatically convert atp adp order facilitate motor myosin viia unconventional member myosin family heavily expressed within ciliated epithelium nose myosin viia similar structure myosins motor neck actinbinding domain unique due short tail vezatin shown interact tail domain due colocalisation molecules mouse innerear epithelial however interaction observed cellcell contact junctions otherwise proteins dispersed cytoplasm individual results taken together suggest vezatin plays crucial role cadherincatenin complex essential cellcell adhesion morphogenesis blastocyst dependent formation trophectoderm first epithelial like epithelium trophectoderm composed polarised cells highly specialised adhesion complexes along lateral sides layer cells vital implantation embryo uterus gives rise majority extraembryonic order proper physiological function cells ultimately proper development embryo adherens junctions must properly vezt codes protein vezatin essential protein regulation maintenance adherens junctions however genes subsequent protein release determined combination paternal maternal dna mixing case early embryo especially compaction started occur majority control via maternal vezatin shown appear mouse blastocyst early stage suggesting protein fact maternal genome two isoforms protein however evidenced later stage suggesting gene control embryo furthermore expression vezatin shown linked ecadherin disruption vezatin synthesis early embryo leads lack adherens junction formation also results strong reduction ecadherin protein vezatin could involved regulation transcription ecadherin seen within nucleus early embryonic whilst several transcription factors associated repression ecadherin unknown novel target engaged vezatin also inhibited process spermatogenesis occurs male mammals within process rounded spermatocytes developing elongating spermatozoa spermatogenesis two successive phases one spermiogenesis within sertoli cells testis maturation within adherens junctions sertoli cells one epithelial cellcell junction lacks expression vezatin furthermore basal sertolisertoli cell junctions apical sertoligerm cell junctions contain myosin viia lack counterpart myosin viia almost always expressed vezatin absence partnership within testis yet fully understood however vezatin shown expressed within acrosomal region actual vezatin found early spermatid appears formation acrosome occurs later process acrosome divided two functional domains inner acrosomal membrane faces nucleus outer acrosomal membrane contact exterior surfaces sperm compartmentalisation functions vital fusion sperm egg outer acrosomal domain initiates acrosome reaction enabling sperm fuse vezatin present domains translocation vezatin inner outer membrane unknown furthermore vezatin expressed epididymal cells thus vezatin added exterior membrane maturation however knowledge localisation vezatin outer membrane known role adherens junctions suggests plays role fusion mammalian gametes endometriosis gynaecological disorder affecting women reproductive years disorder occurs endometrial tissue grows inside lining uterus grows outer surface predominant symptoms pelvic pain infertility however women inflicted disease may show none whilst disease usually nonfatal prolonged social psychological effects women thus degrades quality whilst causes disease still unclear certain number genes linked contributing factor disease mutations vezt gene identified various genomewide association studies vezt gene complex gene however known single nucleotide polymorphism snp locus highly linked genetic cause endometriosis snp simply variation occurs single nucleotide specific region gene vezatin protein encoded vezt gene seen abundantly endometrial myometrial tissue localisation protein cytoplasmic result concurrent previous literature stating prominent role vezatin regulation maintenance adherens specific snp proven cause increase vezatin expression within endometrial cells thus posing risk factor pathogenesis vezatin expression also greater ectopic endometrium opposed furthermore vezatin expression significantly increased glandular endometrium secretory phase menstrual result conjunction finding adherens junction components also increase expression suggests process may occurring response fluctuating progesterone however mechanism increased vezatin expression leading formation ectopic endometrial tissues unknown furthermore much scientific study required directly link mutations vezt gene direct cause endometriosis httpsenwikipediaorgwikivezt
