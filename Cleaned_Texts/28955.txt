common cold cold viral infectious disease upper respiratory tract primarily affects respiratory mucosa nose throat sinuses signs symptoms may appear fewer two days exposure may include coughing sore throat runny nose sneezing headache people usually recover seven ten symptoms may last three occasionally health problems may develop well virus strains implicated causing common cold rhinoviruses coronaviruses adenoviruses enteroviruses spread air close contact infected people indirectly contact objects environment followed transfer mouth risk factors include going child care facilities sleeping well psychological symptoms mostly due bodys immune response infection rather tissue destruction viruses symptoms influenza similar cold although usually severe less likely include runny vaccine common primary methods prevention hand washing touching eyes nose mouth unwashed hands staying away sick evidence supports use face also cure symptoms zinc may reduce duration severity symptoms started shortly onset nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids ibuprofen may help antibiotics however used colds caused good evidence cough medicines common cold frequent infectious disease normal circumstances average adult gets two three colds year average child may get six infections occur commonly infections existed throughout human typical symptoms cold include cough runny nose sneezing nasal congestion sore throat sometimes accompanied muscle ache fatigue headache loss sore throat present cases cough muscle ache likewise adults fever generally present common infants young cough usually mild compared accompanying cough fever indicate higher likelihood influenza adults great deal similarity exists two number viruses cause common cold may also result asymptomatic color mucus nasal secretion may vary clear yellow green indicate class agent causing cold usually begins fatigue feeling chilled sneezing headache followed couple days runny nose symptoms may begin within sixteen hours typically peak two four days usually resolve seven ten days last three average duration cough eighteen cases people develop postviral cough linger infection children cough lasts ten days cases continues days common cold infection upper respiratory tract caused many different viruses commonly implicated rhinovirus type picornavirus known commonly implicated viruses include human coronaviruses influenza viruses adenoviruses human respiratory syncytial virus rsv enteroviruses rhinoviruses human parainfluenza viruses human frequently one virus total viral types associated common cold virus typically transmitted via airborne droplets aerosols direct contact infected nasal secretions fomites contaminated routes primary importance viruses may survive prolonged periods environment hours rhinoviruses picked peoples hands subsequently carried eyes nose infection transmission animals considered highly unlikely outbreak documented british scientific base adelaide island seventeen weeks isolation thought caused transmission contaminated object asymptomatic human carrier rather husky dogs also present transmission common daycare school due proximity many children little immunity frequently poor infections brought home members evidence recirculated air commercial flight method people sitting close appear greater risk rhinoviruscaused colds infectious first three days symptoms much less infectious herd immunity generated previous exposure cold viruses plays important role limiting viral spread seen younger populations greater rates respiratory poor immune function risk factor insufficient sleep malnutrition associated greater risk developing infection following rhinovirus exposure believed due effects immune breast feeding decreases risk acute otitis media lower respiratory tract infections among recommended breast feeding continued infant developed world breast feeding may protective common cold symptoms common cold believed primarily related immune response mechanism immune response virusspecific example rhinovirus typically acquired direct contact binds humans via receptors receptor unknown mechanisms trigger release inflammatory inflammatory mediators produce generally cause damage nasal respiratory syncytial virus rsv hand contracted direct contact airborne droplets replicates nose throat frequently spreading lower respiratory rsv cause epithelium human parainfluenza virus typically results inflammation nose throat young children affects trachea may produce symptoms croup due small size distinction viral upper respiratory tract infections loosely based location symptoms common cold affecting primarily nose rhinitis throat pharyngitis lungs significant overlap one area selfdiagnosis isolation viral agent involved rarely generally possible identify virus type useful ways reduce spread cold viruses physical using correct hand washing technique face masks healthcare environment gowns disposable gloves also isolation quarantine used disease widespread symptoms nonspecific vaccine protect common vaccination proven difficult many viruses involved mutate creation broadly effective vaccine therefore highly regular hand washing appears effective reducing transmission cold viruses especially among whether addition antivirals antibacterials normal hand washing provides greater benefit wearing face masks around people infected may beneficial however insufficient evidence maintaining greater social unclear whether zinc supplements affect likelihood contracting routine vitamin c supplements reduce risk severity common cold though may reduce treatments common cold primarily involve medications therapies symptomatic getting plenty rest drinking fluids maintain hydration gargling warm salt water

difficulty excluding complications may amenable effective antiviral drugs common cold even though preliminary research shown zinc supplements may shorten duration colds reduce severity symptoms supplementation begins within hours onset zinc remedies directly applied inside nose led loss sense review recommend use zinc common cold various whereas review recommended use zinc also advocated

garlic provide meaningful benefit treating preventing vitamin c supplementation affect incidence common cold may reduce conclusive evidence vitamin supplementation efficacious prevention treatment respiratory tract common cold generally mild selflimiting symptoms generally improving children half cases go away days severe complications occur usually old young secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting sinusitis pharyngitis ear estimated sinusitis occurs ear infection common cold common human affects people adults typically two three infections children may six ten colds year twelve colds year school rates symptomatic infections increase elderly due declining native americans inuit likely infected colds develop complications otitis media may explained much issues poverty overcrowding common misconception one catch cold merely prolonged exposure cold although known colds viral infections prevalence many viruses indeed seasonal occurring frequently cold reason seasonality conclusively possible explanations may include cold temperatureinduced changes respiratory decreased immune low humidity causing increase viral transmission rates perhaps due dry air allowing small viral droplets disperse farther stay air apparent seasonality may also due social factors people spending time indoors near infected specifically children although normal exposure cold increase ones risk infection severe exposure leading significant reduction body temperature hypothermia may put one greater risk common cold although controversial majority evidence suggests may
