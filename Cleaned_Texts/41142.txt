increase symptoms schizophrenia observed correspond decreasing levels estrogen menopausal women observation led researchers propose link estrogen schizophrenia first onset schizophrenia generally occurs ages men first onset occurs approximately years later women second peak late onset schizophrenia ages animal studies suggest estrogen acts barrier dopamine receptors may prevent increase dopamine found patients schizophrenia however contradictory studies estrogen either increased decreased dopamine receptors depending duration experiment estrogen levels low women susceptible respond poorly antipsychotic drugs consequently estrogen often used treat schizophrenia women studies show estrogen patches reduce positive symptoms schizophrenia least short term researchers believe estrogen could also used treat disease mencitation needed gender differences observed age onset schizophrenia women later age onset average diagnosed years later fact first onset schizophrenia men occurs around ages women first onset generally occurs ages however also noted women second peak schizophrenia occurs ages period significant drop estrogen levels factors led researchers believe estrogen may effect psychosis support abovementioned conclusions many studies performed doctors lindamer lohr harris jeste conducted study determine age onset schizophrenia examined gender differences patients ranging age found mean age onset men women important note one study overall averages come combination different studies women developed schizophrenia age men reported thus women men experience late onset indicates indeed another peak women age women develop schizophrenia later life another study conducted older men women determine schizophrenia affects study consisted women men similar age women men found paranoid schizophrenia severe positive symptoms rather negative information consistent studies showing women later age onset schizophrenia severe positive symptoms rather negative genetic factors much developing fact heritability schizophrenia around first degree relative fold increase risk developing disorder compared risk general seems individuals schizophrenia inherit problems associated dopamine brain according answerscom dopamine neurotransmitter essential normal functioning central nervous arvid carlsson designated molecule dopamine led dopamine hypothesis schizophrenia animal studies provide evidence estrogen regulates dopamine studies performed animals estrogen seems act barrier dopamine thus estrogen may prevent increase dopamine found patients schizophrenia directly supports idea estrogen acts deterrent would explain women peak onset schizophrenia late forties since time estrogen levels drop women causing dopamine increase resulting psychotic symptoms biochemical studies prove contradictory approach studies estrogen either increased decreased dopamine receptors depending time allotted contradicts theory estrogen inhibits dopamine receptors therefore acting protectorate schizophrenia estrogen often used treat schizophrenia according online science article prof ina weiner tel aviv universitys department psychology doctoral student michal arad reported findings suggesting restoring normal levels estrogen may work protective agent menopausal supports theory estrogen acts protectorate schizophrenia according dr weiner known long time estrogen levels low women susceptible respond poorly antipsychotic drugs thus supporting use estrogen study dr weiner arad performed ovaries removed rats resulting low estrogen much like result ovaries removal rats showed schizophrenia like test estrogen replacements work reducing schizophrenia symptoms rats given estrogen predicted schizophrenia symptoms antipsychotic drug haloperidol also given rats showed signs relieving schizophrenialike behavior providing evidence effectiveness estrogen comparison antipsychotic also found estrogen effective relieving schizophrenia male female addition found low amounts estrogen increase effectiveness antipsychotic although study suggests estrogen helps alleviating symptoms many argue could side effects cervical cancer heart result study dr weiner concluded women schizophrenia given estrogen supplements midtwenties forties estrogen levels would improve effectiveness antipsychotic drugs would help assisting women schizophrenia maintaining normal lifestyle without peaks schizophrenia forties dr weiner also believes since men less likely develop schizophrenia age forty likely estrogen study done test effectiveness estrogen patches schizophrenia period four weeks individuals tested showed reduction positive symptoms however showed differences negative still known exactly estrogen helps alleviating schizophrenia however study researchers felt perhaps estrogen causes rapid actions cerebral blood flow andor glucose also recognized receptors estrogen located throughout brain thus hormone estrogen regulate also noted although short term estrogen positive effects unsure reliability long however stated believed estrogen could also used men previously found another study done also showed estrogen relieves positive symptoms study mg estrogen administered premenopausal women found first estrogen increased efficiency neuroleptics long period time effect estrogen reversed decreased efficiency researchers concluded estrogen helps short term long term results also found study mentioned previously httpsenwikipediaorgwikieffectsofestrogenonschizophrenia
