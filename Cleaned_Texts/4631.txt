injury thoracic aorta refers injury affects portion aorta lies within chest cavity injuries thoracic aorta usually result physical trauma however also result pathological process main causes injury deceleration car accident crush injuries different grades injuries aorta depending extent injury treatment whether surgical medical depends difficult determine patient thoracic injury symptoms imaging physical exam extent injury patients thoracic aortic injury need treated either surgically endovascular repair open surgical repair medicine keep blood pressure heart rate appropriate however patients thoracic aortic injury live injuries aorta usually result trauma deceleration crush injuries deceleration injuries almost always occur high speed impacts motor vehicle crashes falls substantial height several mechanical processes occur reflected injury recently proposed mechanism aorta compressed bony structures manubrium clavicle first rib spine ascending aorta portion aorta almost vertical one mechanism injury torsion twoway clinical predictors aortic predictors include patient older unrestrained patient hypotension thoracic injury requiring thoracotomy spinal injury head four criteria met likelihood aortic injury aortic wall made three different components inner layer intima muscle layer media outer layer adventitia traumatic injury thoracic aorta cause disruption parts therefore aortic injury scale injury part inner layer complete tear three grades aortic addition grades aortic injury risk rupture also categorized inner layer muscle layer aortic wall involved injury injury categorized significant aortic inner layer portion muscle layer involved injury injury characterized minimal aortic radiographically would seen intimal flap less cm mobile ascending aorta relatively fixed descending thoracic aorta aortic isthmus sudden deceleration mobile ascending aorta pushes forward creating whiplash effect aortic however different mechanism involved ascending aorta proximal isthmus torn rapid deceleration heart pushed left posterior chest causes sudden increase intraaortic pressure cause aortic rupture known water hammer based location injury thorax subsequent injuries take place injury descending thoracic aorta could lead injury ascending aorta could lead hemoperricardium subsequent tamponade could compress difficult rely symptoms diagnose thoracic aortic injury however symptoms include severe chest pain cough shortness breath difficulty swallowing due compression esophagus back pain hoarseness due involvement recurrent laryngeal might external signs bruising anterior chest wall due traumatic clinical signs uncommon nonspecific include generalized hypertension due injury involving sympathetic afferent nerves aortic murmur also audible turbulent blood flow goes inconsistencies terminology aortic injury several terms interchangeably used describe injury aorta tear laceration transection rupture laceration used term consequence tear whereas transection section across axis cross section intents purposes latter used tear occurs across nearly circumference aorta rupture defined forcible disruption tissue disagree usage rupture believe implies tear incompatible life however term accurately gauges severity tears aorta rupture either complete partial classified position gold standard diagnosis thoracic aortic injury aortography method involves inserting catheter aorta directly injecting contrast material primary benefit aortography ability precisely determine location injury surgical another imaging modality ct angiogram sensitivity ct angiogram relies timing ct scan bolus iv contrast administered peripheral iv site since ct angiogram sensitivity less invasive due peripheral placement iv line aortagraphy primary imaging allows visualization aorta provides precise locations traumatic ct angiogram show direct indirect signs aortic injury indirect sign see effacement fat due sign clue radiologist underlying injury direct signs ct include intimal flap irregularity shape aorta filling defects secondary thrombus pouching however non contrasted ct scans chest xrays transesophageal echos also used chest xrays sensitive finding widened mediastinum greater apical cap displacement trachea either side chest midline also normal chest xray however exclude diagnosis thoracic aortic chest xray also useful diagnose subsequent problems caused aortic rupture pneumothorax non contrasted ct scans might show intimal flap periaortic hematoma luminal filling defect aortic contour abnormality pseudoaneurysm contained rupture vessel wall disruption active extravasation intravenous contrast aorta therefore useful assess minimal aortic trans esophageal echos useful patients hemodynamically unstable sensitivity specificity study varies based clinical trans esophageal echo relies placement ultrasound probe patients esophagus order get ultrasound heart esophageal injury expected patient facial injury patient difficulty maintaining away trans esophageal echo first line treatment patients thoracic aortic injury maintaining patients airway intubation treating secondary injuries ensuring patient patent airway lifethreatening injuries treated treatment aortic injury started due constant risk sudden rupture exsanguination urgent treatment necessary patient either undergo endovascular repair surgical endovascular repair current gold standard due increased success rates lower patients able undergo endovascular repair without contraindications proceed repair delayed lifethreatening intraabdominal intracranial bleeding patient risk endovascular repair done first gaining vascular access usually femoral catheter inserted point injury luminal stent blood able pumped stent prevent aortic wall surgical repair done way thoracotomy opening chest point multiple methods used successful methods enable distal perfusion prevent surgery performed constant check blood flow parts body away injury monitored know oxygenation waiting surgery careful regulation blood pressure heart rate systolic blood pressure maintained mmhg allowing perfusion distal injury decreasing risk rupture heart rate kept beats per minute esmolol first choice maintain blood pressure heart rate due short time action blood pressure within range adding nitroprusside sodium added second treatment similar done aortic patient minimal aortic injury patient managed non rather patient followed serial images patient develop severe injury including full thickness injury media layer patient treated thoracic aortic injury leading cause death involving blunt trauma patients thoracic aortic injury die patients make evaluated survive patients survive first hours develop thoracic aortic injury commonly caused penetrating trauma cases around confined thoracic portion aorta including ascending aorta aorta arch descending thoracic aortic injuries ligament arteriosum common location followed portion aorta origin left
