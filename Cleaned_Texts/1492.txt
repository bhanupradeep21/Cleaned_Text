rugarhynchos extinct genus doswelliid archosauriform late triassic new mexico known species rugarhynchos sixmilensis originally described species doswellia receiving genus rugarhynchos close relative doswellia shared several features absence infratemporal fenestra heavily textured skull bones however could also distinguished many unique characteristics thick diagonal ridge side snout blunt spikes osteoderms complex suture quadratojugal squamosal jugal nonmetric multidimensional scaling tooth morphology suggest rugarhynchos general skull anatomy convergent crocodyliforms spinosaurids phytosaurs particularly smilosuchus however snout somewhat less elongated known specimen rugarhynchos nmmnh partial skeleton consisting several bones scattered small area largest component mostly complete right side skull originally described pertaining part snout preparation revealed included skull cranial fragments include right quadrate left premaxilla left maxillary fragments partial right quadratojugal originally considered another maxillary fragment fragment originally described articulated parietal postorbital later considered part palate preserved portion jaw left surangular although large right pterygoid fragment originally considered articular postcranial remains include osteoderms several vertebral fragments isolated rib fragments lower end left femur possible pelvic fragment originally

doswellia kaltenbachi original species doswellia suggested new material may lead two species distinguished two preparation altered several interpretations specimen notable discovery purported snout

derived latin words wrinkle nose reference wide variety rough ridges front premaxilla expands side forming bulbous structure similar many phytosaurs possessed eight teeth first four much larger last

autapomorphy unique distinguishing feature rugarhynchos presence thick diagonal ridge side snout ridge extends upper part maxilla onto lacrimal prefrontal frontal chanaresuchus proterochampsa similar ridge front orbit though less pronounced extend onto maxilla various smaller ridges rough spots present near large diagonal ridge rugarhynchos include raised bulbous rim orbit thin horizontal ridge

doswellia also large hooked upper portion like vancleavea middle pterygoid diagonal ridge two rows teeth stretching along underside intermediate proterochampsids one row teeth pterygoid ridge doswellia least three different ridge along inner edge pterygoid also hosts longitudinal row teeth teeth randomly distributed two ridges though likely many originally present possible palatine bone also preserved bone crescentshaped front half saddleshaped rear half similar proterochampsa chanaresuchus though insufficient data basal archosauriform palates prevents comparison many taxa preserved jaw bone large surangular textured rough longitudinal ridges generally similar doswellia though upper edge convex front tip blunt rounded unique rugarhynchos cupshaped depression rear edge surangular connects articular postcranial material rugarhynchos sparse several fragmentary complete centra main vertebral components among fossils recovered centra low wide similar doswelliids vancleavea litorosuchus unlike proterochampsids low elliptical rib facets located short stalks doswelliids similarly shaped rib facets though set longer stalks like reptiles rugarhynchos would two rib facets either side vertebra upper facets termed diapophyses connected upper rib head tuberculum lower facets parapophyses connected lower rib head capitulum diapophyses preserved large parapophyses present close lower edge centrum capitulum tuberculum preserved ribs closely set cylindrical doswellia vertebrae likely cervicals neck vertebrae due lowset parapophyses prominent midline keels along lower
