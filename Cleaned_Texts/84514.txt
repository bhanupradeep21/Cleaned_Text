hyperandrogenism especially high levels testosterone cause serious adverse effects left untreated high testosterone levels associated health conditions obesity hypertension amenorrhea cessation

hyperandrogenism also observed increase insulin tolerance lead type two diabetes dyslipidemia high cholesterol effects may psychological impacts sometimes leading social anxiety depression especially adolescent girls young women paired obesity hirsutism cause individual low administration highdose testosterone men course weeks cause increase aggression hypomanic symptoms though seen minority acute

spontaneously polycystic ovary syndrome pcos endocrine disorder characterized excess androgens produced ovaries estimated approximately women pcos demonstrate hypersecretion cause condition unknown speculations include genetic predisposition however gene genes responsible remain condition may hereditary basis possible causes include elevated insulin production cases pcos involve insulin thought adipose tissue dysfunction plays role insulin resistance seen insulin induce excess testosterone secretion complication associated polycystic ovary syndrome high cholesterol treated statins metaanalysis atorvastatin shown decrease androgen concentrations people elevated insulin leads lower production sex hormone binding globulin shbg regulatory glycoprotein suppresses function high blood

hyperandrogenism transition body stops releasing estrogen faster rate stops releasing androgens cases difference lower estrogen levels higher androgen levels produce hyperandrogenism decrease sex hormone levels free androgen index increases also contribute many drugs provoke symptoms hyperandrogenism symptoms include limited hirsutism acne dermatitis androgenic alopecia irregularities
