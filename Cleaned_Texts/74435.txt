bioecological model development mature final revision urie bronfenbrenners ecological system theory primary focus ecological systems theory systemic examination contextual variability development processes focuses world outside developing person affected publication ecology human bronfenbrenners first comprehensive statement ecological systems theory additional refinements added whereas earlier statements ecological systems theory focused characteristics environment goal bioecological model explicate characteristics developing person influenced environments person exposed affected bioecological model strongly influenced bronfenbrenners collaborations stephen whereas much bronfenbrenners work focused social development influence social environments development cecis work focuses

initial investigations contextual variability developmental processes seen analysis differences methods parental discipline function historical time social developed work differential effects parental discipline boys girls convergence socialization processes us ussr works expressed experimental variations built development implementation headstart informally discussed new ideas concerning ecological systems theory throughout late early lectures presentations psychological bronfenbrenner published major statement ecological systems theory american articulated series propositions hypotheses cited book ecology human development developing bioecological model human development later bronfenbrenners early thinking strongly influenced developmentalists social psychologists studied developmental processes contextually bound dependent meaning experience defined developing one strong influence lev vygotsky russian psychologist emphasized recognized learning always occurs separated social context second influence kurt lewin german forerunner ecological systems models focused persons psychological activities occur within kind psychological including events past present future shape affect individual centrality persons interpretation environment phenomenological nature built work thomas thomas men define situations real real consequences bronfenbrenner also influenced colleague stephen j ceci coauthored article naturenurture reconceptualized developmental perspective bioecological theory ceci developmental psychologist redefined modern developmental psychologys approach intellectual development focused predicting pattern associations among ecological genetic cognitive variables function proximal processes together bronfenbrenner ceci published beginnings bioecological model made accessible framework use understanding developmental history bioecological systems theory divided two periods first period resulted publication bronfenbrenners theory ecological systems theory titled ecology human development bronfenbrenner described second period time criticism evaluation original development ecological systems theory arose bronfenbrenner noted lack focus role context terms development argued environment children operate important development may shaped interactions specific environment urged colleagues study development terms ecological contexts normal environments children schools homes daycares researchers heeded advice great deal research flourished early focused context however prior research ignoring context bronfenbrenner felt current research focused much context ignored development justification new theory bronfenbrenner wrote pleased direction research mid felt realms development comparison original theory bioecological systems theory adds emphasis person context development additionally bronfenbrenner chose leave key features ecological systems theory eg ecological validity ecological experiments development bioecological systems theory whole bronfenbrenners new theory continued go series transformations continuously analyzed different factors human development critical components bioecological systems theory emerge instead ideas evolved adapted research ideas times example role proximal processes recognized key feature bioecological systems theory emerge theory went series transformations elaborations bronfenbrenner bronfenbrenner developed model adding chronosystem refers person environments change time also placed greater emphasis processes role biological person model ppct since become bedrock bioecological model ppct includes four concepts interactions concepts form basis thus bioecological model highlights importance understanding persons development within environmental systems explains person environment affect one another bidirectionally although even bronfenbrenner critiqued falsifiability bioecological model real world applications developmental research practice policies demonstrated addition adding theoretical understanding human development bioecological model lends changes conceptualization research endeavor earliest comments state developmental research bronfenbrenner lamented developmental research concerned studying strange behavior children strange situations briefest possible period time proposed rather developmental science take goal study children context order best determine processes naturally developmentally generative promote development naturally developmentally disruptive prevent development bronfenbrenner set contrast traditional confirmatory approach hypothesis testing research done confirm hypothesis correct incorrect specifying types research needed support bioecological model bronfenbrenners view dynamic nature model calls primarily generative research designs explore interactions proximal processes see proposition developing person environment time developmental outcome proposition bronfenbrenner called type research discovery mode developmental science best capture dynamic processes developmental research designs would ideally longitudinal time rather crosssectional single point time conducted childrens natural environments rather laboratory designs would thus occur schools homes daycare centers environments proximal processes likely occur bioecological model also proposes scientifically rich studies would include one distinct theoretically related proximal process indeed studies claim based upon bioecological theory include elements process person context time include explicit explanation acknowledgement one elements based interactions proposed elements ppct model appropriate statistical analyses ppct data would likely include explorations mediation moderation effects well multilevel modeling data account nesting different components model moreover research includes genetic environmental components would capture even bioecological models elements ecological systems
