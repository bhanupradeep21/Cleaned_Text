scolotosuchus extinct genus rauisuchid early triassic russia known species scolotosuchus basileus discovered donskaya luka locality differs rauisuchids morphology spine allowed resist great stress gave great range mobility additionally may lacked osteoderms spine instead supported similar manner dinosaurs ft likely apex predator several isolated fossil remains large rauisuchid described donskaya luka locality within lipovskaya formation located central russian upland taxon material attributed named scythosuchus basileus paleontologist andrey gerasimovich sennikov time thought large shortnecked later research conducted sennikov however called validity scythosuchus question holotype specimen poorly preserved neck vertebrae found similar fossils poposauroid tsylmosuchus resulted scythosuchus considered junior synonym however holotype found lack distinguishing traits type series scythosuchus also included series thoracic vertebrae notable short spinous processes rugose dorsal ends vertebrae previously used diagnose scythosuchus clearly belonged distinct type early pseudosuchian unrelated tsylmosuchus discovery additional vertebrae similar morphology supported idea large rauisuchid present donskaya luka eventually leading sennikov establish new genus scolotosuchus time thoracic vertebrae serving holotype specimen addition vertebrae partial pelvis hindlimbs calcaneum also assigned new name scolotosuchus derived skolotoi native name scythians inhabited region fossils found mirrors name scythosuchus taxon type material assigned suffix suchus meanwhile derives greek soukhos meaning crocodile common element names prehistoric pseudosuchians species name basileus also derives greek means king chosen part due fact previously species name scythosuchus also reference royal scythians lived north sea scolotosuchus known peculiar morphology vertebrae highly variable along spinal column neck early thoracic vertebrae characterized short low spinous processes neural spine approximately equal height length another feature present later neck vertebrae well early thoracic vertebrae well developed rugosities ends spinous processes considered hypertrophied apophyseal ossifications sennikov rather result osteoderms fusing vertebrae sennikov also notes frequent discovery isolated neural arches may indicate suture neural arch centra vertebrae weakly fused fused even adult individuals would cause vertebrae effectively fall apart muscles begin rot body decomposes gets buried anterior articular processes prezygapophysis notably wider posterior articular processes postzygapophysis neck first thoracic vertebrae similar size following trunk vertebrae later neck vertebrae around high narrow neural canals formed fact neural arches composed long legs relatively short spinous processes hyposphene hypantrum located back front vertebra respectively well developed hypantrum particular accompanied accessory laminae depressions bone middle vertebrae neck show neural spine bifurcated giving yshape well defined bifurcation another trait unique scolotosuchus among rauisuchids members family bifurcated neural spines feature weakly developed applies batrachotomus stagonosuchus considered rauisuchids sennikov bifurcation additionally restricted front neural spine sennikov also mentions mandasuchus rauisuchid fully bifurcated neural spine besides however authors sterling j nesbitt regard taxa rauisuchids preacetabular process illium short projects slightly cranially fact process poorly developed seen rauisuchid ticinosuchus middle triassic europe subvertical crest sloping slightly sets scolotosuchus apart american postosuchus dorsal blade low upper margin almost straight features typical rauisuchids clearly aligning scolotosuchus group rather contemporary ctenosauriscid bystrowisuchus possessed saddleshaped dorsal blade ischium likewise falls within typical rauisuchid anatomy wide proximal end connects illium narrow distal end femur sigmoid shape elongated slightly compressed shaft moderately wide ends generally resembling expected rauisuchid tibia fragmentary fibula described massive former also elongated rounded proximal oval distal ending calcaneum matches crocodiloidtype ankle joint short tuber region calcaneum articulares astragalus however convex bearing slight resemblance members euparkeriidae otherwise shows depressions sennikov estimates scolotosuchus may reached length approximately sennikov points bifurcated neural spines typically associated development strong epaxial musculature ligament either order support heavy head long neck animals neck head moved great flexion great speeds scolotosuchus shows signs possessed elongated neck considered much likely size weight head may led evolution bifurcated neural spines however since appear case rauisuchids predatory loricatans sennikov additionally proposes scolotosuchus may differed relatives specific methods used capture kill prey suggested may moved head rapidly jerked heavy prey around rugose ends spine towards back neck front torso also indicative strong ligament proportions prezygapophyses compared postzygapophyses indicate addition able sustain great loads neck mobile expected first thoracic vertebrae scolotosuchus greatest range mobility especially side side unusual central neck vertebrae vertebrae despite shortbodied great range motion sideways towards back neck mobility decreased slightly transition neck torso vertebrae show expected range motion presence infrahypantrum laminae indicates back neck front torso endured greatest loads combination great flexibility strong forces likely led development well developed hyposphenehypantrum articulation order stabilize finally sennikov draws parallels rugose expansion neural spine seen scolotosuchus seen poposauroids likely lost osteoderms instead evolved support system similar dinosaurs modern crocodiles many extinct pseudosuchians rauisuchids included use osteoderms combination musculature ligaments create beam bridge allows lift bodies ground erect partially erect gait mammals dinosaurs possibly poposauroids meanwhile use suspension bridgelike system formed ligaments musculature hold spine elongated spinal processes around shoulder region sennikov exclude possibility scolotosuchus osteoderms addition rugose neural spine expansions notes fossils found anywhere donskaya summary scolotosuchus likely apex predator environment likely large head seated atop neck built endure great stress resting capturing prey also flexible likely erect gait similar rauisuchids possibly supported musculature ligament similar dinosaurs donskaya luka scolotosuchus would coexisted variety pseudosuchians archosaurs including small poposauroid tsylmosuchus
