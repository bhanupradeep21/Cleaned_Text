microbiology ancient greek μῑκρος mīkros small βίος bíos life λογία logía study scientific study microorganisms unicellular singlecelled multicellular consisting complex cells acellular lacking microbiology encompasses numerous subdisciplines including virology bacteriology protistology mycology immunology parasitology eukaryotic microorganisms possess membranebound organelles include fungi protists whereas prokaryotic conventionally classified lacking membranebound organelles include bacteria microbiologists traditionally relied culture staining microscopy isolation identification microorganisms however less microorganisms present common environments cultured isolation using current emergence biotechnology microbiologists currently rely molecular biology tools dna sequencebased identification example rrna gene sequence used bacterial identification viruses variably classified considered either simple microorganisms complex molecules prions never considered microorganisms investigated virologists however clinical effects traced originally presumed due chronic viral infections virologists took infectious proteins existence microorganisms predicted many centuries first observed example jains india marcus terentius varro ancient rome first recorded microscope observation fruiting bodies moulds robert hooke jesuit priest athanasius kircher likely first see microbes mentioned observing milk putrid material antonie van leeuwenhoek considered father microbiology observed experimented microscopic organisms using simple microscopes design scientific microbiology developed century work louis pasteur medical microbiology robert koch existence microorganisms hypothesized many centuries actual discovery existence unseen microbiological life postulated jainism based mahaviras teachings early century bce bc paul dundas notes mahavira asserted existence unseen microbiological creatures living earth water air jain scriptures describe nigodas submicroscopic creatures living large clusters short life said pervade every part universe even tissues plants flesh roman marcus terentius varro made references microbes warned locating homestead vicinity swamps bred certain minute creatures seen eyes float air enter body mouth nose thereby cause serious persian scientists hypothesized existence microorganisms avicenna book canon medicine ibn zuhr also known avenzoar discovered scabies mites alrazi gave earliest known description smallpox book virtuous life girolamo fracastoro proposed epidemic diseases caused transferable seedlike entities could transmit infection direct indirect contact vehicle antonie van leeuwenhoek lived life delft netherlands observed bacteria microorganisms using singlelens microscope considered father microbiology used simple singlelensed microscopes van leeuwenhoek often cited first observe microbes robert hooke made first recorded microscopic observation fruiting bodies moulds however suggested jesuit priest called athanasius kircher first observe kircher among first design magic lanterns projection purposes well acquainted properties wrote concerning wonderful structure things nature investigated microscope stating would believe vinegar milk abound innumerable multitude worms also noted putrid material full innumerable creeping animalcules published scrutinium pestis examination plague stating correctly disease caused microbes though saw likely red white blood cells rather plague agent field bacteriology later subdiscipline microbiology founded century ferdinand cohn botanist whose studies algae photosynthetic bacteria led describe several bacteria including bacillus beggiatoa cohn also first formulate scheme taxonomic classification bacteria discover louis pasteur robert koch contemporaries cohn often considered fathers modern medical microbiology pasteur famous series experiments designed disprove widely held theory spontaneous generation thereby solidifying microbiologys identity biological one students adrien certes considered founder marine pasteur also designed methods food preservation pasteurization vaccines several diseases anthrax fowl cholera koch best known contributions germ theory disease proving specific diseases caused specific pathogenic microorganisms developed series criteria become known kochs postulates koch one first scientists focus isolation bacteria pure culture resulting description several novel bacteria including mycobacterium tuberculosis causative agent pasteur koch often considered founders microbiology work accurately reflect true diversity microbial world exclusive focus microorganisms direct medical relevance late century work martinus beijerinck sergei winogradsky true breadth microbiology beijerinck made two major contributions microbiology discovery viruses development enrichment culture work tobacco mosaic virus established basic principles virology development enrichment culturing immediate impact microbiology allowing cultivation wide range microbes wildly different physiologies winogradsky first develop concept chemolithotrophy thereby reveal essential role played microorganisms geochemical responsible first isolation description nitrifying nitrogenfixing frenchcanadian microbiologist felix dherelle codiscovered bacteriophages one earliest applied joseph lister first use phenol disinfectant open wounds branches microbiology classified applied sciences divided according taxonomy case bacteriology mycology protozoology virology phycology microbial ecology considerable overlap specific branches microbiology disciplines certain aspects branches extend beyond traditional scope pure research branch microbiology termed cellular microbiology people fear microbes due association microbes various human diseases many microbes also responsible numerous beneficial processes industrial fermentation eg production alcohol vinegar dairy products antibiotic production act molecular vehicles transfer dna complex organisms plants animals scientists also exploited knowledge microbes produce biotechnologically important enzymes taq reporter genes use genetic systems novel molecular biology techniques yeast twohybrid bacteria used industrial production amino acids corynebacterium glutamicum one important bacterial species annual production two million tons amino acids mainly lglutamate since bacteria ability synthesize antibiotics used medicinal purposes streptomyces make aminoglycoside variety biopolymers polysaccharides polyesters polyamides produced microorganisms
