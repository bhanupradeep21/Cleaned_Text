employees actions impeding organizational knowledge flows seven categories counterproductive knowledge behaviors recognized disengagement knowledge sharing knowledge sharing ignorance partial knowledge sharing knowledge hoarding counterknowledge sharing knowledge hiding knowledge sabotage categories differ terms negative impact counterknowledge sharing employee behavior employees share disinformation misconceptions based unverified examples unverified information include rumors gossip false beliefs unsupportable explanations employees may acquire counterknowledge knowledge hoarding accumulation knowledge employees concealing fact possess knowledge words means accumulation knowledge may may shared later usually knowledge hoarding also happen someone collects information doesnt think others could benefit thus knowledge hoarding necessarily intentional may cause risk counterproductive behaviour knowledge hoarding problem transfer integration knowledge would create value organisation individuals prefer pursue selfinterested outcomes hoarding even knowledge acquired working belongs organisation rather worker individuals perceive personal property usually takes place due knowledge power syndrome organisations knowledge hoarding reduces worth knowledge asset preventing widest utilisation therefore usually associated negative organisational outcomes weakened unit performance workrelated interactions example knowledge hoarding perceived colleagues uncooperative may lead difficult relationships workplace may also impair employees equal access resource causes injustice hand knowledge hoarding may due proper platforms information sharing therefore managerial level knowledge management attempt break hoarding cycle creating new models interaction knowledge sharing also friendly cooperative work environment could potentially reduce knowledge hoarding counterproductive work behaviour even contribute knowledge sharing knowledge hiding defined intentional attempts employees conceal knowledge colleagues request knowledge hiding deliberate action withhold conceal information employees knowledge hiding might influence negatively organizations knowledge exchange reduce efficiency cause lack trust factors might cause knowledge hiding example leadership workspace stressors personality traits psychological three categories knowledge hiding evasive hiding playing dumb rationalized hiding rationalized hiding happens employee explains reasons behind nondelivered knowledge involves justification missing knowledge playing dumb occurs employee pretends discussed knowledge ignore relevant information available evasive hiding occurs employee postpones knowledge delivery deliver less information knowledge hiding limits productive knowledge transfer organizations harms organizational functioning limits organizations performance creativity growth individual level knowledge hiding causes distrust isolates employees mutual idea cases knowledge hiding might actually enhance relationships knowledge sharing important asset organizational perspective knowledge hiding might actually lead positive outcomes rationalized evasive knowledge hiding might cause shortterm victories enhance innovative job evasive hiding negative outcome inrole organizational work culture large affect knowledge hiding sharing organizations organizations promote ethical work culture employee trustworthiness knowledge sharing reduce knowledge employees might feel psychological ownership knowledge see knowledge personal therefore want defend territory hide knowledge hiding prevented supportive organizational work culture management prevent knowledge hiding giving active encouragement employees creating collaborative open discussionoriented workplace new employees taught knowledge hiding leads negative outcomes benefit organization employee knowledge sharing rewarded supported organization management management motivate employees giving recognition knowledge sharing employees give financial support give credit employees ideas employees also encouraged attend conferences publish papers submit patentable ideas management take consideration promoting employees senior titles forms career progression knowledge hiding prevented knowledge sharing supporting attitude management rewarding knowledge sharing employees knowledge sabotage considered extreme form counterproductive knowledge incident employee ie saboteur intentionally provides wrong knowledge information advice document recommendation another employee target saboteur also hide another employee knowledge saboteur acts intentionally aware employees need knowledge required knowledge important employee knows employee could productively apply required knowledge workrelated knowledge sabotage instances categorized reactive proactive depends target behavior whether ask required knowledge reactive form knowledge sabotage occurs knowledge asked proactive action occurs request knowledge saboteur aware target need certain knowledge situations saboteur decides act counterproductively lying sharing incorrect knowledge concealing critical knowledge person would benefit resource knowledge saboteurs rarely act organization purpose instead driven interemployee personality personality despite negative consequences organizational level time waste failed delayed projects lost clients unnecessary expenses hiring costs understaffing poor quality products thus consequences often unintentional saboteurs driven motivators harming many motivational drivers concerns people urge share critical information sharing information perceived undermining one position example people want share information due personal organizational culture also plays big role much information sabotage occurs eager people help example work culture puts employees competitive position contributes occurrence information sabotage lateness described arriving
