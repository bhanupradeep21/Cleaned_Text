cold injury cold weather injury damage body cold exposure including hypothermia several skin coldrelated skin injuries categorized freezing nonfreezing cold freezing cold injuries involve tissue damage exposed temperatures freezing less degrees nonfreezing cold injuries involve tissue damage exposed temperatures often degrees celsius extended periods injuries disproportionally affected military members recreational winter activities also increased risk incidence within civilian additional risk factors include homelessness inadequate wet clothing alcohol abuse tobacco abuse preexisting medical conditions impair blood freezing cold skin injuries include frostbite injuries often affect fingers toes nose ears since less commonly covered clothing cold affected skin becomes numb turns white blue develops frostnip superficial skin injury wont freeze skin cause longterm frostbite involves freezing fluids inside outside cells results cell breakdown electrolyte imbalances surrounding blood vessel constriction injury disrupts blood flow affected tissue may cause tissue death diagnosis based symptoms imaging help assess viable tissue risk prehospital treatment involves transfer warm environment changing wet clothing rapid rewarming warm water refreezing hospital management involves rewarming wound care medications treat pain possible blood amputation unsalvageable tissue may required weeks months initial nonfreezing cold skin injuries include trench foot subclass immersion foot caused exposure cold injuries often affect feet subjected wet cold several hours affected individuals report tingling numbing sensation red blue discoloration swelling blisters affected mechanism injury isnt fully understood may involve coldinduced damage blood vessels nerves results small blood vessel capillary destruction swelling tissue diagnosis based prehospital treatment includes transfer warm environment exchanging wet hospital management includes gradual rewarming air drying elevating affected skin pain lacking comprehensive data overall incidence freezing cold injuries including military populations disproportionally affected due prolonged cold exposure associated work united states military reported frostbite increased incidence cases noted individuals participate winter recreational activities especially several physical behavioral environmental risk factors contribute freezing cold injury cases include homelessness inadequate clothing high altitude dehydration alcohol tobacco individuals previous cold injury increased risk another cold preexisting medical conditions compromise blood flow diabetes raynaud syndrome peripheral vascular disease increase risk damage freezing cold injury occurs direct freezing tissue disrupted blood flow affected skin rewarming freezing causes ice crystal formation tissue disrupts cell membranes surrounding blood electrolyte imbalances tissue swelling edema inflammation occur intracellular contents enter surrounding tissue constriction blood vessels response freezing cause tissue death necrosis severe cases due blood vessel rewarming process restored blood flow induces inflammatory damage via formation reactive oxygen inflammation involves specific molecules prostaglandins thromboxanes bradykinin histamine cause edema damage blood vessels leading potential blood clot formation interruption blood freezing cold injuries diagnosed based symptom presentation several weeks often needed determine full extent tissue suspected severe cases magnetic resonance angiography mra bone scan may used injury determine likelihood tissue recovery potential need bone scanning help determine ability use tissue plasminogen activator tpa breaking associated blood cases suspected freezing cold injury coldinduced conditions evaluated treated conditions may include hypothermia accidental reduction core body temperature less degrees celsius commonly due cold environment often presents uncontrollable shivering may progress impaired consciousness abnormal vital severe cases cause cardiac hypothermia treated first present bringing core body temperature degrees raynauds phenomenon abnormal spasming blood vessels often tips fingers toes usually response strong emotions cold digits turn white blue primary disorder secondary underlying medical affected individuals moved warm environment wet clothing removed rewarming attempted risk refreezing would worsen tissue rewarming involve rubbing massaging affected skin avoid worsening placing affected skin armpit groin crease warm water bath viable rewarming aloe vera gel nsaids help reduce choice rewarming method depends suspected extent skin injury severity hypothermia passive rewarming techniques blankets may sufficient milder active rewarming techniques warm intravenous fluids warm water baths may needed severe rewarming continued affected skin becomes red purple color pain management nsaids opioids topical aloe vera gel applied thawed tissue prior dressing clear cloudy blisters may drained needle aspiration hemorrhagic blisters left consider antibiotics severe injuries potential tissue necrosis tetanus toxoid administered based local using tissue plasminogen activator tpa within hours injury reduce tissue damage increase amount salvageable tissue breaking blood led corresponding reduction amputations previous iloprost may used dilate blood vessels decrease platelet aggregation tpa contraindicated reducing clotting ability streptokinase heparin reduce risk surgical treatment may include removal deaddamaged tissue debridement amputation usually performed several weeks initial urgent surgery needed sepsis severe infection wet gangrene fasciotomy may required compartment syndrome develops affected recommended preventative measures freezing cold injuries include appropriate nutrition wearing suitable clothing covers ones skin avoiding constrictive clothing ensuring access warm alcohol substance use longterm complications freezing cold injury depend extent tissue higher degrees injury firm skin rewarming hemorrhagic blisters tissue necrosis gangrene carry worse addition possible amputation several complications reported months years initial injury include chronic pain increased sensitivity cold abnormal skin sensation longterm impaired circulation blood flow nerve damage attributed possible freezing cold injury hands feet graded estimate risk grade absence bluish discoloration skin cyanosis risk amputation longterm complications grade cyanosis distal phalanges possible amputation fingertiptip toe fingernailtoenail grade cyanosis intermediate proximal phalanges possible amputation bone digit functional impairment grade cyanosis carpaltarsal bones possible amputation limb functional impairment nonfreezing cold injuries occur individuals cold wet skin prolonged periods time several hours injuries characterized military populations may unable frequently change environmental surroundings wet however civilian populations occupations expose cold standing water participate winter recreational activities also additional risk factors include immobility homelessness alcohol tobacco abuse elderly age dehydration underlying medical conditions peripheral vascular disease underlying mechanism nonfreezing cold injury isnt fully understood characterized poor blood flow tissue exposed cold wet may result destruction small blood vessels leads swelling nerve damage tissue breakdown due pressure distinction acute chronic mechanisms nonfreezing cold injury acute cases involve disruption blood flow breakdown affected tissue nerve chronic cases occur multiple episodes acute injury partial restoration blood flow persistence longterm nonfreezing cold injury commonly affects feet due prolonged exposure wet socks cold standing symptoms progress series four cold exposure cold exposure increased blood flow affected tissue hyperemia hyperemia nonfreezing cold injury diagnosed based symptoms history prolonged exposure usually hours days cold moisture freezing affected report loss sensation affected skin least minutes abnormal sensation experiencing use imaging lab testing specific nonfreezing cold injury helpful confirming imaging may indicated work possible trauma related coldinduced conditions include chilblains pernio inflammatory skin injury caused exposure nonfreezing presents red patches plaques resolve chronic cases reported individuals repeated cold perniolike skin lesions also associated previous cold urticaria allergic reaction occurs skin exposed cold lesions resemble hives condition occur secondary certain infections individuals suspected nonfreezing cold injury moved warm dry environment wet clothing swapped dry rewarming done gradually room temperature affected skin exposed air elevated heart contrast rapid rewarming associated worsening pain tissue affected skin rubbed massaged avoid
