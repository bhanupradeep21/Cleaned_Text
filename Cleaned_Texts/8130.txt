dna binding sites type binding site found dna molecules may bind dna binding sites distinct binding sites part dna sequence eg genome bound dnabinding proteins dna binding sites often associated specialized proteins known transcription factors thus linked transcriptional regulation sum dna binding sites specific transcription factor referred cistrome dna binding sites also encompasses targets proteins like restriction enzymes sitespecific recombinases see sitespecific recombination dna binding sites thus defined short dna sequences typically base pairs long bp recombination sites specifically bound one dnabinding proteins protein complexes reported binding sites potential undergo fast evolutionary dna binding sites categorized according biological function thus distinguish transcription factorbinding sites restriction sites recombination sites authors proposed binding sites could also classified according convenient mode one hand restriction sites generally represented consensus sequences target mostly identical sequences restriction efficiency decreases abruptly less similar sequences hand dna binding sites given transcription factor usually different varying degrees affinity transcription factor different binding sites makes difficult accurately represent transcription factor binding sites using consensus sequences typically represented using position specific frequency matrices psfm often graphically depicted using sequence logos argument however partly arbitrary restriction enzymes like transcription factors yield gradual though sharp range affinities different sites thus also best represented psfm likewise sitespecific recombinases also show varied range affinities different target existence something akin dna binding sites suspected
