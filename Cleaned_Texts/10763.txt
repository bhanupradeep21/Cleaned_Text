first described rates poisoning vary significantly regions united states cases occur united kingdom medication responsible greatest number young children commonly united states united kingdom paracetamol common cause acute liver signs symptoms paracetamol toxicity occur three phases first phase begins within hours overdose consists nausea vomiting pale appearance however patients often

paracetamol toxicity varies depending dose whether appropriate treatment received toxic dose paracetamol highly variable general recommended maximum daily dose healthy adults higher doses lead

paracetamol four times day two weeks patients expect increase alanine transaminase liver typically three times normal unlikely dose would lead liver studies shown significant hepatotoxicity uncommon

hepatocyte damage death leading acute liver animal studies livers stores glutathione must depleted less normal levels liver toxicity persons history taking paracetamol somewhat accurate effective way diagnose poisoning obtaining blood paracetamol level drug nomogram developed called nomogram estimates risk toxicity based serum concentration paracetamol given number hours determine risk potential

decontamination helpful performed within timeframe gastric lavage better known stomach pumping may considered amount ingested potentially lifethreatening procedure performed within minutes administration activated charcoal common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure efficiently adsorbs paracetamol thereby reducing gastrointestinal administering activated charcoal also poses less
