auditory feedback af aid used humans control speech production singing helping individual verify whether current production speech singing accordance acousticauditory intention process possible known auditory feedback loop threepart cycle allows individuals first speak listen said lastly correct necessary viewpoint movement sciences neurosciences acousticauditory speech signal interpreted result movements skilled actions speech articulators lower jaw lips tongue etc auditory feedback hence inferred feedback mechanism controlling skilled actions way visual feedback controls limb movements eg reaching movements auditory feedback allows one monitor speech rectify production errors quickly identify one making important component fluent speech role auditory feedback speech motor control often investigated exposing participants frequencyaltered feedback inducing brief unpredictable changes frequency auditory feedback consistently shown induce pitchshift reflex suggests reflex aids stabilizing voice frequency around desired however due fact auditory feedback needs milliseconds correction occurs production slow correction mechanism comparison duration production time speech sounds vowels consonants thus auditory feedback slow correct production speech sound realtime nonetheless shown auditory feedback capable changing speechsound production series trials ie adaptation relearning see eg perturbation experiments done diva model neurocomputational speech processing minutes typically sufficient nearlyfull adaptation research also shown auditory linguistic prompts resulted greater correction acoustic perturbations nonlinguistic prompts reflecting decrease accepted variance intended speech external linguistic templates available auditory feedback important aid speech acquisition toddlers providing child information speech outcomes used pickup eventually hone speech motor planning processes auditory inputs typically produced communication partner eg caretaker heard toddler subsequently tries imitate children young age four demonstrated ability adapt speech motor patterns perceived changes vowel auditory feedback enables maintain accuracy speech however childrens speech motor adaption abilities fully optimised due limited auditory perceptual skills thus improvements childrens ability perceive relevant acoustic property usually followed improvement speech adaption individuals born deaf often fail acquire fluent speech reinforcing auditory feedback plays crucial role speech acquisition delayed auditory feedback experiments indicate auditory feedback important speech production even adults shown severe disfluencies speech occur timing voice feedback delayed normal individuals become deaf postlingually unable receive vocal feedback anymore also typically experience deterioration speech highlighting importance auditory feedback speech formation throughout ones lifetime stuttering said due ineffective monitoring auditory feedback mainly caused deficit cortical auditory system modulation speech fluent speakers detect sudden irregularity specific acoustic parameter auditory feedback able instantly correct error speech production individuals stutter hand found weakerthannormal abilities correct individuals stutter hence demonstrate ineffective auditory comparisons desired speech movements compared fluent delayed auditory feedback found effective treatment individuals since extending time speech auditory perception allows time process correct errors posited individuals apraxia speech weak feedforward programs results disfluencies individuals hence develop heavy reliance auditory feedback minimize repair speech even later stages lives whilst fluent speakers easily transitions feedback dependent ideal since heavy reliance mostly auditory feedback said inefficient production rapid accurate auditory masking found decrease disfluency duration increase vocal intensity well syllable rate individuals apraxia since apraxia speech said due weak feedforward programs high dependence auditory feedback auditory masking reasoned increase fluency decreasing frequency speaker attending auditorily speech errors hence reducing likelihood disfluencygenerating corrections enhanced auditory processing observed individuals visual impairment partially compensate lack vision greater sensitivity increased sensitivity auditory feedback allows demonstrate impressive spatial awareness despite lack studies shown vision longer primary source obtaining information focus shifts vision hearing desktop currently assistive technologies screen readers aids visually impaired individuals obtaining information desktop screens via auditory feedback eg assistance come form either speech based auditory feedback nonspeech based auditory feedback speech based interfaces based human speech whilst nonspeech based interfaces based environmental sounds music artificial sound effects visually impaired sole reliance speech based auditory feedback imposes heavier cognitive load irritating contrast nonspeech auditory feedback pleasant conveys information quickly lacks detailed information conveyance training required understand cues hence ideal interface currently adaptive auditory feedback automatically transitions speech nonspeech cues based user state interface found comfortable generates higher satisfaction amongst visually impaired trial conducted explore whether auditory feedback influence learning write found adults auditory feedback enabled writer better discern writing motions resulted increase flow quickness writing using sounds learn writing new subsequent studies tested use auditory feedback aid children dysgraphia learn write found multiple sittings using auditory

track childs improvement auditory auditory feedback important picking new musical piece exposing beginner piano players irregular auditory feedback make mistakes compared given logical anticipatable auditory learning presence auditory feedback also improved ones recollection musical however multiple studies shown even without auditory feedback much disturbance performance seasoned absence delay auditory feedback musicians turn auditory imagery direct forms feedback also used compensation instead visual feedback musicians look hands lead major disturbances seen area pedaling results shown pianists prone stepping pedal less often absence auditory importance auditory feedback case human singing reviewed context singing important singers maintain pitch accuracy even drowned orchestral accompaniment fellow singers many studies looked effects external auditory feedback proprioception also known internal feedback pitch control found external auditory feedback crucial maintaining pitch accuracy especially adults without voice supported recent research revealed nonprofessional singers show lower pitch accuracy receive lesser auditory feedback however research also highlighted pitch professional singers remains almost unaffected auditory feedback since able rely internal feedback years role auditory feedback learning production birdsong studied several research papers found songbirds rely auditory feedback compare sounds make inborn tunes songs memorize numerous studies shown without ability hear songbirds develop erratic songs show deterioration songs sing experiencing hearing several scientific models put forward explain worsening birdsongs loss hearing eg see brainard doupes error adjustment channel anterior forebrain auditory feedback birdsong however decline birdsong quality vary greatly different demographics example studies found songs older songbirds remained consistent slower rate deterioration going researchers attributed songbirds learning use forms nonauditory feedback sensory information maintain quality process called sensorymotor coupling others argued older songbirds longer access auditory feedback learn songs results practice thus stable
