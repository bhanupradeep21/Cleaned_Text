broke pacing tension previous episodes comparing fullmetal alchemist anime series changed faithful adaptation original story still captures intention source material satisfying way motamayor wrote promised neverland anime planning telling story rather skipping chapters manga done story soon humanly possible still telling enough story somewhat resembles mangas plotline taking way sic whatever made impactful first place adding similar final season game jairus taylor anime news network wrote anime adaptation promised neverland total disaster explained anime changed main focus original manga meant horror fantasy linear version hunter x hunter instead mystery thriller way earliest chapters suggested second coming death note taylor commented anime pretty good job delivering suspense expense elements vital original works larger ambitions including entire cut trim worldbuilding elements lack internal monologues characterization diminished motivations certain characters simplification series actual themes messaging regarding second season taylor considered various possible reasons staffs decision make changes wrote regardless went though doesnt really change reality second season
