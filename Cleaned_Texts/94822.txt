independent final followup particularly patients treated within hours however significant mortality rate noted mostly intracranial haemorrhage days later mortality significant amongst treated nontreated suggested tpa effective ischemic stroke must administered early possible onset stroke symptoms given patients present ed timely many national guidelines including aha interpreted cohort studies suggesting specific subgroups may benefit tpa thus recommend use within limited time window event protocol guidelines require use intravenously within first three hours event detriments may outweigh benefits example canadian stroke network guideline states patients disabling acute ischemic stroke treated within hours symptom onset evaluated without delay determine eligibility treatment delayed presentation ed leads decreased eligibility people qualify similarly united states window administration used hours onset symptoms newer guidelines also recommend use hours symptom onset
