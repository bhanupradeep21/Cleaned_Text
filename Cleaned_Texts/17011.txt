elizabeth dexter betty hay april august american cell developmental biologist best known research limb regeneration role extracellular matrix ecm cell differentiation epithelialmesenchymal transitions emt hay led many research teams discovering new findings related fields led obtain several high honors awards work hay primarily worked amphibians years limb regeneration work moved onto avian epithelia research ecm emt hay thrilled introduction transmission electron microscopy tem lifetime aided many findings throughout career moreover hay huge advocate women science betty hay born melbourne florida april isaac lucille elizabeth hay lived parents twin brother sister world war ii began father practicing physician time enlisted us army medical corp family sent biloxi mississippi soon transferred fort hays kansas resided six months lt col hay deported philippines chaotic childhood filled many moves various schools hay attended smith college four graduated summa cum laude obtaining ba degree biological throughout life hay always intrigued animals sophomore year smith college began research amphibian limb regeneration professor meryl rose became bettys mentor close friend hay also worked rose summers marine biological laboratory woods bettys love drawing pictures slides dissected animals experiences cemented aspiration pursue career biology rose eventually convinced hay pursue md instead phd degree believed would give hay opportunities future went receive md degree johns hopkins one four women graduating short year graduating johns hopkins hay joined hopkins anatomy department faculty continued work amphibian regeneration embryological processes soon hay moved new york city work electron microscopists cornell medical college rockefeller institute next moved harvard fawcett one colleagues cornell harvard moved studying salamanders focus embryonic chick cornea hay accepted louise foote pfeiffer professorship embryology hay became editorinchief developmental biology continued succeed elected chairperson harvards department anatomy cellular biology served department years hay retired cell biology department harvard medical school hay best known research limb regeneration process epithelialmesenchymal transitions emt development role extracellular matrix ecm cell beginning research career rose focus induction limb regeneration animals able regenerate limbs worked tracing origin cells regenerating blastema transmission electron microscopy tem showed blastema formed amputated surface amphibian limb contained uniform undifferentiated cells lost remnants myofibrils sign previous differentiation hay able show stages myofibril loss differentiated muscle cells using tem confirmed limb tissues gave rise undifferentiated blastema cells research hay came final conclusion differentiated somatic cells amphibian limb preserved enough developmental strength fully regenerate perfect limb words regeneration limb achieved differentiated cells begin dedifferentiate become stem fischman started medical student cornell immediately joined bettys laboratory due undergraduate experience working amphibian limb regeneration traced blastema cells titrated thymidine discovered epidermis enter blastema blastema formed internal tissues reserve cells epidermis gave rise regenerating autoradiography observations regenerating limbs also proved mononuclear blood cells source osteoclasts looking limbs could obtain labeled nuclei monocytes therefore hay specifically labeled blood exhibited osteoclasts came blood hay met jim dobson scientist good culturing growing epithelium hay needed help order prove epidermis produced collagen idea jeanpaul revel originally used avian corneal epithelium rather salamander epidermis order provide examples epithelium secreting collagen produced monograph findings published steve meier joined soon lab becoming known promoting new idea ecm interacted cells cultured corneal epithelium types ecm able show ecm induce cell differentiation directly interacts cells embryo jonathan bard came spend postdoctoral year hay lab working two projects first corneal endothelium morphogenesis sam meller showed key constraint migration second using nomarski optics study corneal fibroblasts migrated stroma vivo collagen gels technique developed jb tom elsdale scotland work showed contact inhibition movement occurred vivo gary greenburg entered betty lab graduate student started working chick embryos able see epithelia transform mesenchyme suspended collagen jim fitchett also entered lab time worked hay using tem prove emt removed palatal seam forms opposite shelves fuse furthermore studies signaling pathways involved emt development led discovery smads activate pathways embryo instead many colleagues fellow scientists claim bettys greatest scientific contribution revealing role extracellular matrix regulating cell behavior led birth new field cell developmental biology hay believed knowledge ecm essential order understand subjects including cytoskeleton cell migration cell shape control cell growth differentiation asserted basis many scientific ideas originate full understanding ecms composition relationship cell surface role bettys passion science dedication work love teaching others contributed legacy left bettys work revealing role ecm regulating cell behavior led receiving twenty national internal awards included centennial award henry gray award american association anatomists faseb excellence science award eb wilson medal american society cell time hay served president american society cell society development biology american association anatomists elected national academy sciences hays gift honoring parents isaac morris lucille elizabeth hay professorship embryology established johns hopkins university peter n devreotes current holder academic elizabeth hay professorship established harvard medical school junying yuan current occupant bettys immense dedicated passion research caused always put research career personal life led move around lot leave many good friends behind always focused work relationships hay dated many men throughout life claimed men time merely looking hay never married children towards end life resided weston massachusetts many cats hay died lung cancer august hospice wayland
