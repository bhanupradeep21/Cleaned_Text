topical antifungal drugs used treat fungal infections skin scalp nails vagina inside mouth medications come creams gels lotions ointments powders shampoos tinctures sprays antifungal drugs induce fungal cell death destroying cell wall fungus drugs inhibit production ergosterol fundamental component fungal cell membrane wall antifungal drugs generally classified according chemical structures corresponding mechanism actions four classes topical antifungal drugs azole antifungals polyene antifungals allylamine antifungals antifungals azole antifungals inhibit enzyme converts lanosterol ergosterol common examples azole antifungals include clotrimazole econazole ketoconazole miconazole tioconazole polyene antifungal available topically nystatin works binding ergosterol thus disrupting integrity fungal cell membrane similar azoles allylamines disrupt fungal cell wall synthesis inhibition squalene epoxidase enzyme converts squalene ergosterol examples allylamines antifungals comprise amorolfin naftifine terbinafine last group consists antifungal drugs different mechanism action three classes drugs include benzoxaborole antifungals ciclopirox olamine antifungals thiocarbamate antifungals undecylenic alkanolamide antifungals topical antifungal drugs may come side effects itching local irritation also interact food different medications therefore topical antifungals used caution advice medical professionals general mechanism action topical antifungal drugs disruption cell membrane unique components found fungal cell membranes usually drug targets antifungal drugs particular ergosterol sterol important maintaining proper membrane fluidity normal functions cell membrane ergosterol replaces cholesterol found cell membranes mammalian cells antifungal medications target ergosterol synthesis selectively toxic fungi hence killing stopping growth fungi body ergosterol damaged causes contents inside fungal cells leak preventing reproduction fungal cells lastly antifungal agents contribute fungal cell deathcitation needed fungal infections commonly caused dermatophytes yeasts molds yeasts normal inhabitants skin sometimes grow unheeded result symptomatic infections molds uncommon causes fungal infections lead tinea nigra painless brown black patches skin hardtotreat nail infections common examples fungal infections include pityriasis capitis dandruff oral candidiasis oral thrush onychomycosis nail infection tinea pedis athletes foot pityriasis versicolor tinea capitis tinea corporis ringworm tinea cruris jock itch tinea manuum antifungal agents treat dermatophyte yeast infections however nystatin suitable dermatophyte fungal infections therefore different types antifungals selectively remove fungal pathogens host minimum toxicitycitation needed topical antifungals generally safe use adults seniors children different dosages may required patients different age groups discuss healthcare professionals use topical antifungal prior using topical antifungals wash affected area soap water dry completely wash hands thoroughly applying topical preparations apply thin layer topical antifungals area infection avoid using occlusive dressings wrappings unless otherwise directed cliniciancitation needed topical antifungal medications usually come side effects patients may develop itching local irritations application products consult pharmacist clinician treated area shows signs increased irritation possible sensitization erythema pruritus burning blistering swelling oozing drugs also interact food various medications inform pharmacists clinicians existing contemplated concomitant therapy including prescription overthecounter drugs dietary herbal supplements concomitant illnesses therefore topical antifungals used caution seeking advice medical professionalscitation needed azole antifungals generally divided two groups imidazoles triazoles common examples imidazoles include clotrimazole econazole miconazole ketoconazole fluconazole itraconazole posaconazole voriconazole fall triazoles group groups cause substantial damage fungal membrane integrity lowering ergosterol levels along loss cytoplasmic components thus bringing similar effects polyene mechanism action azole antifungal drugs exert effects inhibiting synthesis sterol components fungal membrane azoles predominantly fungistatic inhibit growth fungus instead killing fungus drugs target ergosterol biosynthetic pathway inhibiting Î±demethylase cytochrome enzyme thus preventing demethylation lanosterol ergosterol essential component fungal cell membrane impaired synthesis ergosterol leads cascade membrane defects hence fungal cell growth inhibited due disrupted structure function clinical use topically used azole antifungals belong imidazole group listed common azole antifungals according british national cautions avoid contact eyes mucous membranes using topically avoid intravaginal preparations particularly require use applicator young girls sexually active unless alternative children polyene antifungals work well orally mostly seen solution given topically intravenously systemic antifungal suitable dermatophyte fungal infectionscitation needed mechanism polyene antifungals high affinity ergosterol fungal cell membranes upon binding fungal cell membrane forming pores membrane permeability transport fungus altered result fungal cell death occurs nystatin polyene antifungal available topical administration drug derived streptomyces noursei activity candida dermatophytes clinical use nystatin used topically treatment candida infections skin mucous patients concurrently using latex contraceptives reminded intravaginal preparations nystatin may damage contraceptive additional contraceptive measures may needed treatment duration mechanism action allylamines new type antifungal drug highly selective fungal enzyme minimal effect humans work similar way azoles effects earlier ergosterol synthesis pathway allylamines allow active ingredients medication accumulate well within stratum corneum skin nails exert actions inhibit enzyme squalene epoxidase converts squalene ergosterol inhibition results decreased amounts sterols causing cell death disruption fungal cell wall synthesis known quite effective dermatophytes yeast clinical use common allylamine antifungals naftifine terbinafine usually used topically treatment skin mechanism action benzoxaborole antifungals newer class antifungal medication work blocking ability fungus produce proteins highly specific way hence disrupting action yeast cytoplasmic enzymes involved translation process common example class antifungal clinical mechanism action ciclopirox ciclopirox olamine synthetic antifungal agents exact mechanism action ciclopirox olamine antifungals well understood appears medication works causing depletion important substrates amino acids andor ions within fungal cells resulting inhibition transport substances across fungal cell membranes finally disrupts synthesis dna rna proteins fungal cells leads cell death ciclopirox may also exert antimycotic effects altering fungal cell permeability however leakage cellular constituents resulting decreased cell permeability apparent high drug clinical use ciclopirox olamine comes different formulations used topically wide variety fungal adverse effects general ciclopirox ciclopirox olamine preparations well tolerated patients used topically treatment fungal infections pain itchiness burning sensations may occur following topical application medication patients using ciclopirox nail lacquers redness skin around nail proximal nail fold may occur develop nail disorders ingrown nails changes shape adverse reactions usually mild selfterminating rarely severe enough require discontinuation drug mechanism thiocarbamate antifungals similar mechanism action allylamine antifungals inhibit enzyme squaleneepoxidase converts squalene lanosterol raw material producing ergosterol fungal cells blocking sterol synthesis fungal cells cell extracts integrity fungal cell membranes interrupted thus leading impeded fungal growth clinical tolnaftate one example thiocarbamate antifungals adverse effects side effects rare tolnaftate side reactions may include irritation burning pruritus itchiness contact dermatitiscitation needed mechanism action undecyclenic alkanolamide antifungals also referred undecylenic acid undecenoic acid type unsaturated fatty acid inhibits fungal growth clinical use although undecylenic acids possess antifungal properties drug seldom used antifungal purposes salts undecylenic acid zinc undecenoate calcium undecenoate commonly formulated antifungal creams ointments solutions powders undecenoic acid salt forms applied topically treat superficial dermatophytosis particular tinea corporis ringworm tinea pedis athletes foot tinea cruris jock itch undecenoic acid also formulated several salts derivatives methyl phenyl propyl undecenoate also used treat fungal infections skin limited evidence showing effectiveness undecylenic acid treating nail scalp fungal adverse effects irritation may occur patients topical application undecylenic acid salts derivativescitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikitopicalantifungaldrugs
