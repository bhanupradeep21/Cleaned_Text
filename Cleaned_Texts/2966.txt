archaeolemur extinct genus subfossil lemurs known holocene epoch archaeolemur one common wellknown extinct giant lemurs hundreds bones discovered fossil deposits across larger extant lemur body mass approximately kg lb commonly reconstructed frugivorous terrestrial fossil malagasy colloquially known monkey lemur archaeolemur often compared anthropoids specifically cercopithecines due various morphological fact even misidentified monkey remains first following human arrival madagascar years ago many island megafauna went extinct including giant lemurs radiocarbon dating indicates archaeolemur survived madagascar least ad outliving subfossil genus archaeolemur comprises two known species edwardsi majori former larger robust genus belongs family archaeolemuridae aside archaeolemur also includes extinct species hadropithecus archaeolemuridae historically considered sister group extinct family subfossil lemurs paleopropithecidae also known sloth lemurs extant family indriidae mainly due similarities teeth relationship contested morphological analyses instead grouped archaeolemuridae closely one analysis looked ontogenetic data archaeolemur order extrapolate phylogenetic affinities found genus similarities lemurids indriids terms growth despite challenges sequencing ancient dna recovered edwardsi majori hadropithecus stenognathus fossil specimens study lended important support phylogenetic placement archaeolemuridae sister group living indriidae refuting lemuridae archaeolemur closest authors genetic study placed archaeolemuridae paleopropithecidae indriidae superfamily indrioidea within infraorder lemuriformes although exact phylogenetic relationships three still genetic study refined phylogeny indrioidea supporting sister taxa relationship archaeolemuridae clade containing paleopropithecidae archaeolemur lower dental formula therefore tooth comb key feature strepsirrhines consists four teeth rather characteristic six teeth taxa dental reduction also observed indriids palaeopropithecids suggesting potential synapomorphy among microwear analysis lower incisors shows evidence tooth comb archaeolemur used rather lower incisors thought served dietary function procurement processing upper incisors large spatulate premolars form cutting edge anterior lower premolar adopting caniniform shape molars bilophodont bilophodont molar morphology converges cercopithecine features frequently attributed frugivorous enamel archaeolemur teeth thick highly decussated might played role processing archaeolemur also fused mandibular symphysis adaptation resisting chewing biomechanical analysis jaw showed archaeolemur well suited breaking apart large food dental microwear analysis edwardsi majori molars shows pitting indicates archaeolemur processed harder foods supporting generalist furthermore similar microwear pattern among modern primates found cebus apella hardobject stable isotope analysis majori indicates archaeolemur consumer coprolites associated archaeolemur indicate omnivorous diet included fruit seeds even small overall evidence suggests archaeolemur generalist diet mainly consisted fruit seeds postcranial skeletal morphology reveals important aspects archaeolemur lifestyle name monkey lemur suggests archaeolemur often compared old world monkeys due convergences morphological locomotory features limb certainly similarities two convergences sometimes comprehensive analysis hands feet archaeolemur shows limbs relatively short body size hands pollex hallux reduced along digits likely prehensile nevertheless ability grasp climbing probably archaeolemur broad apical tufts distal phalanges hands feet suggested might related grooming absence functioning tooth unlike paleopropithecidae sloth lemurs highly curved proximal phalanges suspensory behavior proximal phalanges archaeolemur straighter extinct malagasy primates although still curved morphological data along previous study pelvis scapula support conclusion archaeolemur locomotory habits likely consisted terrestrial arboreal probably neither cursorial order reconstruct geographic home range archaeolemur study conducted analyzing strontium isotope ratios bone tooth enamel extinct extant authors found significant difference median isotope variance comparing values extinct living taxa suggests despite larger body size typically predicts mobility variable strontium isotope ratios subfossil lemurs likely active larger home ranges living species despite relatively small home range body size archaeolemur genus believed distributed across madagascar broad habitat difficult pinpoint one specific factor drove archaeolemur extinction many authors agree human activity upon arriving madagascar directly indirectly impacted island unique flora human hunting likely played primary role megafaunal extinctions would cascading effects structure animal plant communities modification landscapes including habitat fragmentation habitat loss would added additional pressure taxa like giant lemurs driving toward like modern species low mobility small home ranges characteristics might made archaeolemur fossil relatives vulnerable large body size frugivory additional factors might make organisms increasingly vulnerable compared smaller animals folivores facing habitat fragmentation likewise terrestrial habit archaeolemur might made susceptible human given archaeolemur larger body size compared modern lemurs interpreted small home range likely frugivorous diet genus may especially vulnerable extinction facing habitat change human intervention madagascar nevertheless archaeolemur inhabited madagascar least ad surviving longer subfossil httpsenwikipediaorgwikiarchaeolemur
