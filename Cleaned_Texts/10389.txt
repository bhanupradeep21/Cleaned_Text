osteochondrodysplasia general term disorder development dysplasia bone osteo cartilage osteochondrodysplasias rare diseases babies born type skeletal nonetheless taken collectively genetic skeletal dysplasias osteochondrodysplasias comprise recognizable group genetically determined disorders generalized skeletal affection osteochondrodysplasias result marked functional limitation even mortality osteochondrodysplasias subtypes overlap clinical aspects therefore plain radiography absolutely necessary establish accurate magnetic resonance imaging provide diagnostic insights guide treatment strategies especially cases spinal involvement early diagnosis timely management skeletal dysplasia important combat functional achondroplasia type autosomal dominant genetic disorder common cause dwarfism also common type nonlethal osteochondrodysplasia skeletal dysplasia prevalence approximately achondroplastic dwarfs short stature average adult height cm feet inches males cm feet inches females achondroplasia dwarfism readily apparent birth likewise craniofacial abnormalities form macrocephaly midface hypoplasia present birth previous clinical findings differentiate achondroplasia pseudoachondroplasia dwarfism recognizable birth craniofacial abnormalities considered disease feature plain radiography plays additional important role differential diagnosis pseudoachondroplasia osteochondrodysplasia made distinctive disproportionate short stature hip knee deformities brachydactyly short fingers ligamentous laxity affects least individuals pseudoachondroplasia inherited autosomal dominant manner caused solely mutations cartilage oligomeric matrix protein comp distinguished moderate severe form disproportionate shortlimb short stature limb shortening fundamentally confined proximal limb segments ie femurs humeri known presenting feature waddling gait noticed onset walking prompt diagnosis skeletal dysplasia general pseudoachondroplasia specific still based upon comprehensive clinical radiographic detailed radiographic examination axial appendicular skeleton invaluable differential diagnosis pseudoachondroplasia coxa vara reduced neck shaft angle broad femoral necks short femurs humeri bulletshaped vertebrae noticeable radiographic features additionally presence metaphyseal broadening cupping dense line ossification knee simulate rachitic changes radiographic features collectively known rachiticlike changes presence epiphyseal changes serves important differentiating feature osteogenesis imperfecta inherited autosomal dominant manner proportion cases caused de novo mutations cause osteogenesis imperfecta vast majority perinatally lethal osteogenesis imperfecta progressively deforming osteogenesis imperfecta classic nondeforming osteogenesis imperfecta blue sclerae common variable osteogenesis imperfecta normal sclerae nearly cases de novo osteogenesis imperfecta identified repeated fractures trivial trauma defective dentinogenesis imperfecta di hearing loss clinical features osteogenesis imperfecta highly variable ranging severe lethal perinatal fractures individuals minimal tendency repeated fractures skeletal deformities normal stature life span clinical spectrum may include individuals various degrees disabling skeletal deformities short radiographic findings osteogenesis imperfecta include long bone deformations bowing tibias femurs pencillike deformity tapering bones cortical thinning rarefaction pathologic fractures various degrees healing bone shortening vertebral accordingly osteogenesis imperfecta classified four subtypes ii iii iv built upon diversity radioclinical mucopolysaccharidoses mps constitute commonly seen group osteochondrodysplasias mucopolysaccharidosis cause wide spectrum clinical radiologic manifestations ranging mild skeletal systemic involvement severe lifethreatening manifestations caused contiguous gene duplication deletion syndrome multiple genes involved forms mps inherited autosomal recessive pattern except fir mps ii hunter syndrome caused abnormal function lysosomal enzymes blocks degradation mucopolysaccharides leads accumulation harmful byproducts namely heparan sulfate dermatan sulfate keratan resulting cellular malfunction lead diverse array skeletal visceral manifestations mps subcategorized according type enzyme inadequacy glycoprotein cleidocranial dysostosis general skeletal condition named collarbone cleido cranium deformities people often common features fibrous dysplasia causes bone growths lesions one bones human body lesions tumorlike growths consist replacement medullary bone fibrous tissue causing expansion weakening areas bone involved especially involving skull facial bones lesions cause externally visible deformities skull often necessarily affected bones syndrome rare genetic disorder caused deletion chromosomal material diagnosis usually made birth early childhood features associated condition include mild moderate learning difficulties short stature unique facial features small head skeletal abnormalities including bony growths projecting surfaces maffucci syndrome sporadic disease characterized presence multiple enchondromas associated multiple simple cavernous soft tissue hemangiomas also lymphangiomas may patients normal birth syndrome manifests childhood puberty enchondromas affect extremities distribution osteosclerosis elevation bone normally detected xray area whiteness bone density significantly increased diagnosis mainly based upon delineating specific clinical radiographic pattern skeletal involvement however different types skeletal dysplasia overlap considerably clinical presentation molecular genetic analysis may required resolve diagnostic difficulties juvenile idiopathic arthritis may closely resemble clinical presentation osteochondrodysplasias genetic skeletal dysplsias conditions present swollen stiff deformed emerging therapies genetic skeletal dysplasias include enzyme replacement hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy therapies aim preventing disease progression thus improving quality life examples use enzyme replacement therapy gaucher results shown effectivity enzyme replacement therapy instances malignant infantile osteopetrosis hematopoietic stem cell transplantation httpsenwikipediaorgwikiosteochondrodysplasia
