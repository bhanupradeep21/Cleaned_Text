sexual selection scaled reptiles studies sexual selection manifests snakes lizards constitute order squamata reptiles three thousand snakes use different tactics acquiring ritual combat males females want mate includes topping behavior exhibited viperids one male twist around vertically elevated fore body opponent forcing downward common neck biting occur snakes species japanese striped snake elaphe quadrivirgata competition involves males maintaining body contact opponent exerting pressure pushing topping entwining order subdue male snakes employ variety strategies help entice female mating redsided garter snake thamnophis sirtalis population alberta canada hibernates majority year emerging early may copulate feed communal dens observed reach populations thousands females often dispersing den rapidly try avoid attacked flurry males must rely pheromonebased tracking locate females multiple males come contact female intrasexual competition often occurs snake species largely malebiased sex ratios often high levels malemale males may strong selection development variety characteristics aid acquiring successful males ones display vigor males able align body cloaca joint

oxidative damage finding indicates color acts health certificate allowing females mating visualize underlying oxidative stress induced damage potential male mating partners snakes two distinctive chemical sensory systems unique roles reception deciphering various chemical signals main olfactory system vomeronasal system used decipher distinct chemosensory snakes much greater complexity

snake species males matesearching sometimes must travel great distance find female examples study done prairie rattlesnakes crotalus viridis indicates males maintain constant search females fixed

color male european green lizards honest sexual dimorphisms phenotypic differences males females species objective many sexual dimorphic studies done snakes focuses broad comparisons species different regions less individual species size dimorphisms common snakes females tend larger populations production large liters feasible males tend larger mating systems malemale competition large hydrophiid snakes otherwise known sea snakes recently evolved terrestrial sea snake scales differ terrestrial snakes rugose wrinkled male sea snakes scale rugosity developed female snakes male turtle headed sea snake emydocephalus annulatus provides interesting case study unique females species display smooth scales year round males hand show shift smooth scales ridged scales upon arrival winter breeding season multiple reasons trait could selected scale rugosity males allows better tactile resistance mating non rugose scales also shown rugose scales provide efficient oxygen uptake system means diffusion courting males often lose mating opportunities deplete oxygen stores must return surface breathe rugose skin provides solution problem structure helps increase rate oxygen diffusion allowing males dive longer snake sperm morphology function highly influenced ability find interact fertilize eggs snake species display extended copulations higher gonad massbody mass proportions males reptilian taxonomic furthermore mating systems wide range variability depending temporal availability predictability females factors influence sperm competition levels intense malemale combative species species participate prolonged mate oviparous species show relatively larger testes sperm midpiece length viviparous species oviparous species often reproduce annually opposed bi annual cycle viviparous species oviparous species reproduce less frequently traits may selected generate stronger propulsions develop mitochondria increase amount sperm per ejaculate help aid sperms success often snake species females copulate multiple males one mating increase chances paternity male sometimes try inhibit female remating common tactic many species obstruct reproductive pathway female order physically prevent additional copulations mating plug ts parietalis jellylike blob produced males implanted within females reproductive tract retention plug last two days two weeks maximal effectiveness declining twoday plug functions prevent leakage males sperm females cloaca reduce attractiveness receptivity female copulations physically block reproductive tract prevent immediate remating plug always effective remating rare occurrence plug females store sperm copulation multiple males ovulation sperm stored still time gap sperm copulation fertilization time gap allows female mate multiple males competitive sperm fertilize females eggs remaining sperm females also gain nutrients sperm storage female mates different males nutritional access copulation female lizard species chose sex offspring based males sperm females produce sons sperm larger sires daughters sperm smaller reason would ensure sons good genes display stronger elaborate traits order maximize reproductive increase production sons demonstrates preference larger daughters produced smaller sires since females need use large amount energy attract male males ready mate however females store sperm variety sires females produce sons daughters high female sand lizard lacerta agilis mates two males sperm competition within females reproductive tract may occur active selection sperm females appears occur manner enhances female basis selective process sperm males distantly related female preferentially used fertilization rather sperm close preference may enhance fitness progeny reducing inbreeding depression semiaquatic black swamp snake seminatrix pygaea lives environment periods drought common shown environmental factors negative effect female snakes whose large size selected increase fecundity droughts create unique scenario test whether survivability reproductive pressures influence female body size females grow larger males malemale competition time selection acts female size order increase drought period larger snakes male female less likely survive larger decline female population mainly female snakes greater body size compared males correlates majority seminatrix pygaea
