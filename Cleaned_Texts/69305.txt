inappropriate sinus tachycardia ist defined sinus tachycardia caused medical ailments physiological reaction pharmaceuticals accompanied symptoms frequently invalidating affecting quality ist symptoms include palpitations chest discomfort exhaustion shortness breath presyncope sinus tachycardia common common type tachycardia rare diagnosed inappropriate sinus tachycardia independent symptom part larger condition although somewhat rarely diagnosed ist viewed benign condition longterm symptoms ist however may distracting warrant treatment heart strong muscle typically sustain higherthannormal heart rhythm though monitoring condition generally mechanism primary etiology inappropriate sinus tachycardia fully elucidated autoimmune mechanism suggested several studies detected autoantibodies activate beta adrenoreceptors mechanism arrhythmia primarily involves sinus node perinodal require av node maintenance treatments form pharmacological therapy catheter ablation available condition currently difficult treat successfully palpitations common symptom roughly patients symptoms include chest pain fatigue shortness breath presyncope reduced exercise tolerance anxiety panic attacks headaches symptoms usually associated elevated heart rate patients persistently elevated sinus rates others paroxysmal episodes normal heart rates exact cause inappropriate sinus tachycardia still debated remains unknown several mechanisms suggested including increased sympathetic decreased parasympathetic drive increased intrinsic heart rate dysfunctional neurohormonal modulation ectopic sinus node activity betaadrenergic receptor autoantibodies data show abnormal response autonomic stimulation result tissuecell level changes intrinsic mechanism whereas others show disruption autonomic stimulation normal tissuescell level findings extrinsic mechanism possible mechanistic theories correct despite sharing single common pathway sinus tachycardia individual patients underlying mechanistic etiologies may electrical currents tightly control sinus node calcium clock funny current appear important currents regulating sinus node rate sinus activation thus heart rate regulated autonomic nervous system rest sinus node primarily regulated tonic phasic parasympathetic activation normal healthy individuals exercise causes vagal activation sympathetic activation increases catecholamine levels raises sinus rates aspect regular regulatory processes influencing sinus rate may compromised patients inappropriate sinus tachycardia diagnosed persistent recurrent sinus tachycardia electrogram longterm monitoring explained means invasive testing electrophysiology studies helpful making diagnosis may useful ruling concomitant supraventricular tachycardia inappropriate

diaphoresis visual blurring leading diagnosis vasovagal syncope diagnosis ist inappropriate sinus tachycardia chronic medical condition negative impact ones quality life numerous treatment options available frequently combined nonpharmacologic lifestyle dietary changes frequently advised avoid triggers stimulants caffeine nicotine managing inappropriate sinus tachycardia controlling symptoms decreasing rate remains significant challenge especially given ambiguity syndrome controlling heart rate hand always result elimination symptoms controlling sinus rate asymptomatic ist patients debatable given treatment may worse syndrome ist single therapy completely effectively reduces heart rate symptoms likely due problems complexity lack complete understanding patients sleeping head bed elevated increasing plasma volume generous salt fluid intake beneficial minimal risk patients venous pooling compression stockings offer additional benefits however adherence often becomes issue lifestyle changes may alleviate symptoms prevent reflex tachycardia especially common chronic dehydration patients overt psychosomatic complaints acceptable consider psychiatric pharmacologic therapy inappropriate sinus tachycardia patients started gradually goal lowering hr improving symptoms pharmacologic treatment ist empirical trialanderror approach typically βblockers firstline treatment inappropriate sinus tachycardia βblockers general alleviate symptoms patients βadrenergic receptor sensitivity elevated catecholamine levels throughout orthostatic stress usually respond well variety βblockers nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers demonstrated modest benefit symptom control ist patients contraindications drugs sympatholytics cholinesterase inhibitors like pyridostigmine limited clinical evidence randomized controlled trials regarding use drugs treatment inappropriate sinus tachycardia possible exception βblockers considered offlabel ivabradine shown reduce hr improve exercise capacity quantitatively reduce subjective symptom burden drug appears lower proarrhythmic risk well tolerated ivabradine shows great promise possible therapy choice betablocker intolerant suboptimally responsive patients chronic condition frequently becomes clinically problematic specific guidelines place determine patients inappropriate sinus tachycardia considered invasive treatments interventions treat inappropriate sinus tachycardia range surgical sinus node exclusion sinus av node radiofrequency catheter ablation typically followed permanent pacemaker implantation recent years radiofrequency sinus node several clinical trials described sinus node modification ablation inappropriate sinus tachycardia primary success rates generally good however high rate symptom recurrence significant complication rates complications include need permanent pacing transient superior vena cava syndrome temporary permanent paralysis phrenic nerve furthermore sinus node modification ablation may alleviate istrelated symptoms also consensus best approach includes modifications ablation open chest versus conventional intravascular access mapping methods finally evidence symptomatic improvement inappropriate sinus tachycardia generally benign prognosis one possible reason favourable prognosis inappropriate sinus tachycardia patients faster heart rates heart rate slows slightly sleep well various diurnal patterns longterm consequences published studies small followup limited populations varied although isolated reports ist rarely associated tachycardiainduced symptoms may
