familial dysautonomia fd also known rileyday syndrome recessive genetic disorder autonomic nervous affects development survival sensory sympathetic parasympathetic neurons autonomic sensory nervous system fd results variable symptoms including insensitivity pain inability produce tears poor growth labile blood pressure episodic hypertension postural hypotension people fd frequent vomiting crises

richard lawrence day fd one example group disorders known hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathies hsans characterized widespread sensory dysfunction variable autonomic dysfunction caused incomplete development sensory autonomic neurons disorders believed genetically distinct signs symptoms familial dysautonomia usually commence infancy worsen age may include gastrointestinal dysmotility including erratic gastric emptying gastroesophageal reflux abnormal esophageal peristalsis oropharyngeal dysphagia poor suckling infancy frequent chokinggagging recurrent vomiting poor weight delayed development especially walking puberty especially girls recurrent aspiration pneumonia due inhalation food possible secondary chronic lung absence overflow tears crying corneal ulcers red skin blotches excessive sweating often eating excitement breathholding spells slurred speechnasal voice tongue ulcers accidental selfinjuries hyporeflexia variable absence deep tendon hypotonia enuresis arrhythmias hypertension including episodic hypertension response emotional stress visceral hypotension including orthostatic compensatory tachycardia invariably impaired temperature pain perception

usually diagnosed several years age generalised signs fd present newborn period dysmorpnic facial features directly inherent disorder facial asymmetry straightened mouth eventually develop due abnormal tone molding facial high incidence breech presentation noted among infants lower birth weight compared premature birth intrauterine growth also noted neonatal period hypotonia respiratory insufficiency poor feeding difficulty swallowing aspiration developmental delay short stature scoliosis corneal disease may issues related disorder first appear infancy early manifestations include hypotonia feeding difficulty impaired swallowing poor growth absence tears frequent lung infections poor bodytemperature control infants may display cold hands developmental milestones eg walking speech may may infants fd lack overflow tears emotional crying may noted age months age overflow emotional tearing may also occur unaffected overflow tearing absent neonates begins appear months affected infants hands may alternatively appear cool mottled vasoconstriction red swollen red skin blotching often precipitated emotional older infants young children breathholding spells may occur possibly leading cyanosis fainting breathholding behaviour usually ceases age breathholding behaviour usually resolves age schoolage children bed wetting vomiting episodes impaired pain temperature
