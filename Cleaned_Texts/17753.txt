poposaurus extinct genus pseudosuchian archosaur late triassic southwestern united states belongs clade poposauroidea unusual group triassic pseudosuchians includes sailbacked beaked aquatic forms fossils found wyoming utah arizona texas except skull parts skeleton known type species p gracilis described named maurice goldsmith mehl second species p langstoni originally type species genus lythrosuchus since first described poposaurus variously classified dinosaur phytosaur rauisuchian like theropod dinosaurs poposaurus obligate biped meaning walked two legs rather four however pseudosuchian closely related living crocodilians poposaurus thought evolved form locomotion independently possibly early archosaurs ability high walk tail comprising half body length poposaurus metres ft long weighed kilograms lb body poposaurus laterally compressed long narrow hip structure pubis ischium elongated end pubis forms distinct hook unique poposaurus early pseudosuchians poposaurus five sacral vertebrae connecting spine hip three early archosaurs hind legs twice long arms placed close together five digits present foot fifth reduced small splint bone next metatarsals calcaneum bone extends far ankle form distinct heel first remains poposaurus found near lander wyoming paleontologist j h lees described fossil ilium part hip popo agie formation identified phytosaur paleorhinus paleontologist g mehl named poposaurus based complete material popo agie formation including vertebrae hips limb bones cited holotype walker museum fact holotype ur mehl concluded ilium described lees ur also belonged poposaurus classify poposaurus phytosaur shape ilium different sacral vertebrae fused hip mehl made comparisons poposaurus earlier named dolichobrachium also triassic wyoming dolichobrachium known teeth humerus part pectoral girdle mehl suggested poposaurus dolichobrachium material could belong animal mehl noted similarities poposaurus theropod dinosaurs including hollow leg bones deep hip socket consider dinosaur sacral vertebra supported one rib theropods usually multiple ribs projecting sacral following years poposaurus assigned many different groups reptiles hungarian paleontologist franz nopcsa classified ornithischian dinosaur identifying similarities iguanodonts camptosaurs nopcsa placed new family called poposauridae new suborder called poposauroidea nopsca poposauroidea one three suborders made order ornithopoda following years many paleontologists supported classification example german paleontologist oskar kuhn classified poposaurus suborder ornithischians called poposauria american paleontologist oliver perry hay placed poposaurus anchisauridae family sauropodomorph dinosaurs german paleontologist friedrich von huene considered early stegosaur american paleontologist edwin harris colbert gave extensive description known material poposaurus classified theropod dinosaur colbert thought poposaurus could primitive archosaur hollow leg bones complex vertebrae placed carnosauria ilium distinct archosaurs colbert placed poposaurus family poposauridae paper colbert described ilium dockum group howard county texas

paleontologists robert long phillip murry described new fossils poposaurus placerias quarry chinle formation arizona among new material parts lower limb including tibia calcaneum removed postosuchus poposauridae claiming material used assignment chimera collection bones belonging different animals pubis postosuchus fact pubis poposaurus leading mistaken classification long murry separated

mehl first named poposaurus described wellmuscled creature light weight possibly bipedal gait occasionally assuredly swift mehl based description long limb bones deep hip socket two features link bipedal dinosaurs since however poposaurus considered pseudosuchian archosaur closely related crocodilians dinosaurs close relatives largebodied rauisuchids ctenosauriscids obligate quadrupeds could walk two legs although entire skeleton unknown poposaurus expected similar appearance relatives nearly complete subadult specimen ypm vp described specimen confirmed mehls description revealing poposaurus indeed bipedal skeleton preserves fore hind limbs showing poposaurus much shorter arms although poposaurus early dinosaurs bipedal method locomotion evolved independently group independent origins shown several differences skeletons poposaurus dinosaurs unlike dinosaurs poposaurus characteristic crurotarsal ankle pseudosuchians usually associated quadrupedal locomotion poposaurus also pillar erect stance acetabulum hip socket faces downward positioned directly head femur contrast dinosaurs buttress erect hip structures acetabulum faces laterally head femur angled fit although evolved bipedal locomotion independently poposaurus dinosaurs inherited propensity erect hindlimb driven movement early archosaur ancestor posture ancestral archosaur inferred method called extant phylogenetic archosauria crown group represented today birds crocodilians meaning first archosaur last common ancestor birds crocodilians birds fixed erect stance crocodilians ability high walk limbs erect erect stance considered homologous birds crocodilians likely phylogenetic bracketing implies inherited trait common ancestor ancestor also erect stance reasoning first archosaurs thought ability high walk poposaurus dinosaurs achieved bipedal posture legs increased size hips strengthened spines adapted dorsoventral flexion adaptations may facilitated bipedal locomotion include development chambered heart lungs unidirectional airflow assumed present poposaurus phylogenetic leg musculature poposaurus hypothesized study examined muscle scars bones made inferences based phylogenetic bracketing muscles three ligaments two connective tissue structures described hypothesized muscles poposaurus share many aspects birds similar crocodilians poposaurus thought puboischiotibialis muscle muscle absent birds probably nonavian dinosaurs well extensor digitorum brevis probably present foot poposaurus birds puboischiofemoralis externus muscle poposaurus also similar living crocodilians aspects muscles poposaurus differ crocodilians example puboischiofemoralis internus muscle originates spine crocodilians hip poposaurus hip origin muscle considered original condition archosaurs since also seen birds nonavian dinosaurs poposaurus thought adductor muscles even larger dinosaurs insertion site runs along entire length study leg musculature poposaurus also suggested distinctive form
