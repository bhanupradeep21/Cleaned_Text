margaret adaline reed lewis american cell biologist embryologist made contributions cancer research cell culture techniques likely first person successfully grow mammalian tissue vitro authored around papers many coauthored husband warren harmon lewis lewises developed growth medium called lockelewis solution jointly received gerhard gold medal pathological society margaret adaline reed born kittanning pennsylvania november parents joseph c martha walker reed attended goucher college known womans college baltimore earned ab graduation studied bryn mawr college columbia university universities zurich paris berlin never earned graduate degree bryn mawr columbia researched regeneration amphibians crayfish assisted noted embryologist thomas hunt margaret reed researched berlin max hartmanns lab performed probably first vitro mammalian cell culture guinea pig bone marrow explanting bone marrow placing nutrientrich agar produced fellow lab researcher rhoda erdmann incubating sample days found nuclei exhibited characteristics mitosis discovery revisited margaret reed married warren lewis combined efforts lewises found cell proliferation media selection methods seemed occur tissues common organs connective tissue blood vessel endothelium since lewises main interest microscopic cell structures objective create optically clear media led creation lockelewis solution medium composed salt solutions supplemented bouillon dextrose tissue grown medium prepared method become known lewis culture tissue bits put hanging drop underside thin glass slip lockelewis solution robust cells fibroblasts macrophages tendency migrate explant flatten making easy observe high lewis among first scientists observe dynamics mitochondria living cells margaret warren lewis published comprehensive shapes movements mitochondria cultured cells lewiss pioneering timelapse studies included observations mitochondrial movement toward away centrosome mitochondrial fission mitochondrial fusion paper lewis presented perhaps first descriptions stressinduced mitochondrial fragmentation mitophagy lewis husband helped develop put practice first experimental systems observing understanding somatic cell physiology complex organisms demonstrated behavior autonomous cells significant relationship development infection immunity physiology development cancer organism result work served establish importance cellular behavior result couples greatest impact embryology cell biology twentieth century teaching later generations biologists basic factors involved tissue culture based learned research lewises saw place findings cell related embryology well expressed perspective president carnegie institution washington wrote knowing extent cells permanent individuality must determined possible understand cooperate integrated tissue perspective gave margaret warren lewis place department embryology carnegie institution many avenues opened cell culture explore margaret lewis husband diverged area study margaret lewis choosing focus microbiological problems involved close observations chick embryo intestines reacting typhoid bacilli medium grown tissue culture techniques lewises developed studies showed infections diseases cellular phenomena infection observed isolated system events occurred way would observed organism work chick embryos margaret lewis studied connective tissue formation within tissues well outside environment factors involved coagulation present lewis observed connective tissue fibrils resulted cytoplasmic transformations cells studies explanted tissue cultures lewis noted cells choose migrate away tissue sample divide individual cells resulting loss tissues characteristic appearance however also made distinction cells become embryonic like champy others claimed instead lose differentiated appearance tissue spreading cells lack characteristic tissue form caused fibril development many tissue cultures lacking however cultures connective tissue fibers develop progression could tracked observed fibrils start delicate lines exoplasm become bundles passed cells lewis also found evidence vacuoles forming fibrils believed case lewis isolated spontaneous epidermoid carcinoma mouse lung became known lewis lung carcinoma carcinoma one earliest tumors could transplanted used determine compound potential anticancer played significant role recent tumor models used metastatic angiogenesis studies highly malignant carcinoma producing tumors transplanted increasing metastatic growth subcutaneously implanted carcinoma margaret reed lewis research mechanics cancer included myeloid infiltration strangulationinduced atrophy tumors study myeloid infiltration lewis found phenomenon occurred adrenals common subjects tested tumors however tumor growth seemed associated progression neutrophilia peripheral blood myeloid hyperplasia certain tumor atrophy paper margaret lewis showed tumor tissue inactivated environments devoid sufficient circulation continued stay arrested state transplanted rats led absorption resistance viable tumor lewis held several teaching positions assistant zoology bryn mawr college science teacher miss chapins school lecturer physiology new york medical college women lecturer barnard college instructor anatomy physiology johns hopkins hospital training school nurses married warren harmon lewis also cell physiologist lewises collaborated many research projects years including discovery macrophage cells derived monocytes separate cell whether working independent collaborative project couple worked alongside lab consulted children margaret nast lewis became physicist warren r lewis worked engineer atomic physicist jessica h lewis associate research female scientist early twentieth century margaret reed lewis able push achievements field work husband able develop tissue culturing techniques demonstrate single cells impacted organism lewis joined
