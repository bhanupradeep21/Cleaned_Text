pupa latin pupa doll pl pupae life stage insects undergoing transformation immature mature stages insects go pupal stage holometabolous go four distinct stages life cycle stages thereof egg larva pupa imago processes entering completing pupal stage controlled insects hormones especially juvenile hormone prothoracicotropic hormone ecdysone act becoming pupa called pupation act emerging pupal case called eclosion emergence pupae different groups insects different names chrysalis pupae butterflies tumbler mosquito family pupae may enclosed structures cocoons nests pupal stage follows larval stage precedes adulthood imago insects complete metamorphosis pupa nonfeeding usually sessile stage highly active mosquitoes pupal stage adult structures insect formed larval structures broken adult structures grow imaginal pupal stage may last weeks months even years depending temperature species example pupal stage lasts eight fifteen days monarch pupa may enter dormancy diapause appropriate season emerge adult insect temperate climates pupae usually stay dormant winter tropics pupae usually dry season insects emerge eclose pupae splitting pupal case butterflies emerge morning mosquitoes emergence evening night fleas process triggered vibrations indicate possible presence suitable host prior emergence adult inside pupal exoskeleton termed pharate pharate adult eclosed pupa empty pupal exoskeleton called exuvia hymenopterans ants bees wasps exuvia thin membranous becomes crumpled shed measuring timing emergence interest chronobiologists process regulated circadian clocks many species necessitating different assays measure eclosion timing taxa lepidoptera especially heliconius pupal mating extreme form reproductive strategy adult male mates female pupa emerge newly moulted female accompanied actions capping reproductive system female sphragis denying access males exuding antiaphrodisiac pupae usually immobile largely defenseless overcome pupae often covered cocoon conceal environment form species lycaenid butterflies protected pupal stage ants another means defense pupae species capability making sounds vibrations scare potential predators species use chemical defenses including toxic secretions pupae social hymenopterans protected adult members hive based presence absence articulated mandibles employed emerging cocoon pupal case pupae classified two based whether pupal appendages free attached body pupae classified one three types chrysalis latin chrysallis ancient greek χρυσαλλίς chrysallís plural chrysalides also known aurelia nympha pupal stage butterflies term derived coloration found pupae many butterflies referred ancient greek term χρυσός chrysós gold caterpillar fully grown makes button silk uses fasten body leaf twig caterpillars skin comes final time old skin hard skin called chrysalises often showy formed open familiar examples pupae chrysalides attached surface velcrolike arrangement silken pad spun caterpillar usually cemented underside perch cremastral hook hooks protruding rear chrysalis cremaster tip pupal abdomen caterpillar fixes pad silk gr kremastos like types pupae chrysalis stage butterflies one little movement however butterfly pupae capable moving abdominal segments produce sounds scare away potential predators within chrysalis growth differentiation adult butterfly emerges ecloses expands wings pumping haemolymph wing although sudden rapid change pupa imago often called metamorphosis metamorphosis really whole series changes insect undergoes egg adult emerging butterfly uses liquid sometimes called cocoonase softens shell chrysalis additionally uses two sharp claws located thick joints base forewings help make way emerged chrysalis butterfly usually sit empty shell order expand harden wings however chrysalis near ground fell silk pad butterfly would find another vertical surface rest upon harden wings wall fence moth pupae usually dark color either formed underground cells loose soil pupa contained protective silk case called cocoon pupa species hornet moth develop sharp ridges around outside called adminicula allow pupa move place concealment inside tree trunk time adult pupa chrysalis cocoon frequently confused quite distinct pupa stage larva adult stages chrysalis generally refers butterfly pupa although term may misleading moths whose pupae resembles chrysalis eg plume winged moths family pterophoridae geometrid moths cocoon silk case larvae moths sometimes insects spin around pupa cocoon casing spun silk many moths numerous holometabolous insect larvae protective covering pupa cocoons may tough soft opaque translucent solid meshlike various colors composed multiple layers depending type insect larva producing many moth caterpillars shed larval hairs setae incorporate cocoon urticating hairs cocoon also irritating touch larvae attach small twigs fecal pellets pieces vegetation outside cocoon attempt disguise predators others spin cocoon concealed underside leaf crevice near base tree trunk suspended twig concealed leaf silk cocoon silk moth unraveled harvest silk fibre makes moth economically important lepidopterans silk moth completely domesticated lepidopteran exist wild insects pupate cocoon must escape either pupa cutting way secreting enzymes sometimes called cocoonase soften cocoon cocoons constructed builtin lines weakness along tear easily inside exit holes allow oneway passage features facilitate escape adult insect emerges pupal skin pupae remain inside exoskeleton final larval instar last larval shell called
