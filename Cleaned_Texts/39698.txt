investigation underlying cognitive processes craving addictive substance nicotine alcohol order better understand cognitive processes involved elaborated intrusion ei theory craving developed according ei craving persists individuals develop mental images coveted substance pleasurable also increase awareness result cruel circle desire imagery preparation satisfy desire quickly escalates greater expression imagery incorporates working memory interferes performance simultaneous cognitive tasks strengthens emotional response essentially mind consumed craving desired substance craving turn interrupts concurrent cognitive craving nicotine alcohol extreme case ei theory also applies ordinary motivations desires deprivation time individual receive reinforcer satiation occurs individual received reinforcer degree temporarily reinforcing deprive stimulus value reinforcement example person deprived food may go extreme measures get food stealing hand person eats large meal
