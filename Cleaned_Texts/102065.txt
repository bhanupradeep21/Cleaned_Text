estrogen receptor alpha erα also known nuclear receptor subfamily group member one two main types estrogen receptor nuclear receptor mainly found chromatinbinding activated sex hormone estrogen humans erα encoded gene estrogen receptor estrogen receptor er ligandactivated transcription factor composed several domains important hormone binding dna binding activation alternative splicing results several mrna transcripts differ primarily untranslated regions translated receptors show less agonists erα selective erβ include antagonists erα selective erβ include erα plays role physiological development function variety organ systems varying degrees including reproductive central nervous skeletal cardiovascular accordingly erα widely expressed throughout body including uterus ovary male reproductive organs mammary gland bone heart hypothalamus pituitary gland liver lung kidney spleen adipose development function tissues disrupted animal models lacking active erα genes erα knockout mouse erko providing preliminary understanding erα function specific target erα essential maturation female reproductive phenotype absence erα erko mouse develops adult uterus indicating erα may mediate initial growth however erα plays role completion development subsequent function activation erα known trigger cell proliferation uterus female erko mice hypoplastic suggesting erα mediates mitosis differentiation uterus response estrogen similarly prepubertal female erko mice develop ovaries nearly indistinguishable wildtype counterparts however erko mice mature progressively present abnormal ovarian phenotype physiology specifically female erko mice develop enlarged ovaries containing hemorrhagic follicular cysts also lack corpus luteum therefore adult ovarian phenotype suggests absence erα estrogen longer able perform negative feedback hypothalamus resulting chronically elevated lh levels constant ovarian results identify pivotal role erα hypothalamus addition role estrogendriven maturation theca interstitial cells erα similarly essential maturation maintenance male reproductive phenotype male erko mice infertile present undersized integrity testicular

spermatogenesis loss intromission ejaculatory estrogen stimulation erα known stimulate cell proliferation breast erα thought responsible pubertal development adult phenotype mediation mammary gland response role consistent abnormalities female erko mice epithelial ducts female erko mice fail grow beyond prepubertal length lactational structures result functions mammary lactation release greatly impaired erko though expression bone moderate erα known responsible maintenance bone hypothesized estrogen stimulation erα may trigger release growth factors epidermal growth factor insulinlike growth turn regulate bone development accordingly male female erko mice exhibit decreased bone length estrogen signaling erα appears responsible various aspects central nervous development synaptogenesis synaptic brain erα found hypothalamus preoptic area arcuate nucleus three linked reproductive behavior masculinization mouse brain appears take place erα furthermore studies models psychopathology neurodegenerative disease states suggest estrogen receptors mediate neuroprotective role estrogen finally erα appears mediate positive feedback effects estrogen brains secretion gnrh lh way increasing
