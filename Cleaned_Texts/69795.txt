linguistics prosody ˈprɒsədi study elements speech individual phonetic segments vowels consonants properties syllables larger units speech including linguistic functions intonation stress rhythm elements known prosody may reflect features speaker utterance emotional state form utterance statement question command presence irony sarcasm emphasis contrast focus may reflect elements language encoded grammar punctuation choice vocabulary study prosodic aspects speech usual distinguish auditory measures subjective impressions produced mind listener objective measures physical properties sound wave physiological characteristics articulation may measured objectively auditory subjective objective acoustic articulatory measures prosody correspond linear studies prosody based auditory analysis using auditory scales agreed number prosodic variables auditory terms major variables acoustic terms correspond reasonably closely different combinations variables exploited linguistic functions intonation stress well prosodic features rhythm additional prosodic variables studied including voice quality pausing behavior prosodic variables studied either contours across prosodic unit behavior prosodic features suprasegmental since properties units speech defined groups sounds rather single talking prosodic features important distinguish personal characteristics belong individuals voice example habitual pitch range intonation patterns etc independently variable prosodic features used contrastively communicate meaning example use changes pitch indicate difference statements questions personal characteristics belong individual linguistically significant prosodic features clear aspects prosody found languages specific particular languages dialects writers eg oconnor arnold described intonation entirely terms pitch others eg crystal propose intonation combination several prosodic variables english intonation often said based three aspects choice pitch movement highlighting particular words create different intonation patterns seen following english examples thats cat yup thats cat cat thought mountain lion example example using intonation highlight particular words employ rising falling pitch change meaning read outloud pitch voice moves different directions word cat first line pitch goes indicating question second line pitch falls indicating statement confirmation finally third line complicated risefall pattern indicates incredulity pitchintonation pattern communicates different additional pitchrelated variation pitch range speakers capable speaking wide range pitch usually associated excitement times narrow range english makes use changes key shifting ones intonation higher lower part ones pitch range believed meaningful certain stress functions means making syllable prominent stress may studied relation individual words named word stress lexical stress relation larger units speech traditionally referred sentence stress appropriately named prosodic stress stressed syllables made prominent several variables stress typically associated following cues powerful prominent others alan cruttenden example writes perceptual experiments clearly shown english rate three features pitch length loudness form scale importance bringing syllables prominence pitch efficacious loudness least pitch prominence major factor resulting prominence often called accent rather considerable variation language language concerning role stress identifying words interpreting grammar although rhythm prosodic variable way pitch loudness usual

commonly notes pause length distinguishing auditory hesitation silent pauses one challenge contrasting junctures within without word chunks aid identifying pauses variety filled pause types formulaic language pause fillers include like er uhm paralinguistic expressive respiratory pauses include sigh gasp although related breathing pauses may contain contrastive linguistic content periods

intonation said number perceptually significant functions english languages contributing recognition comprehension believed prosody assists listeners parsing continuous speech recognition words providing cues syntactic structure grammatical boundaries sentence type boundaries intonation units often associated grammatical syntactic boundaries marked prosodic features pauses slowing tempo well pitch reset speakers pitch level returns level typical onset new intonation unit way potential ambiguities may resolved example sentence invited bob bill al got rejected ambiguous written although

associates studied intonation indicate whether information new already established whether speaker dominant conversation speaker inviting listener make contribution prosody also important signalling emotions attitudes involuntary voice affected anxiety fear prosodic information linguistically significant however speaker varies speech intentionally example indicate sarcasm usually involves use prosodic features useful prosodic feature detecting sarcasm reduction mean fundamental frequency relative speech humor neutrality sincerity prosodic cues important indicating sarcasm context clues shared knowledge also emotional prosody considered charles darwin descent man predate evolution human language even monkeys express strong feelings different tones anger impatience low fear pain high native speakers listening actors reading emotionally neutral text projecting emotions correctly recognized happiness time anger surprise sadness neutral tone database speech processed computer segmental features allowed better recognition happiness anger suprasegmental prosodic features allowed recognition reverse true surprise recognized time segmental features time suprasegmental typical conversation actor voice involved recognition emotion may quite low order hampering complex interrelationship function speech advocated however even emotional expression prosody always consciously recognized tone voice may continue subconscious effects conversation sort expression stems linguistic semantic effects thus isolated traditionalclarification needed linguistic contentdubious discuss

listeners guide decisions emotional affect situation whether person decodes prosody positive negative neutral plays role way person decodes facial expression accompanying utterance facial expression becomes closer neutral prosodic interpretation influences interpretation facial expression study marc pell revealed ms prosodic information necessary listeners able identify affective tone utterance lengths enough information listeners process emotional context unique prosodic features noted infantdirected speech ids also known baby talk childdirected speech cds motherese adults especially caregivers speaking young children tend imitate childlike speech using higher variable pitch well exaggerated stress prosodic characteristics thought assist children acquiring phonemes segmenting words recognizing phrasal boundaries though evidence indicate infantdirected speech necessary language acquisition specific prosodic features observed many different aprosodia acquired developmental impairment comprehending generating emotion conveyed spoken language aprosody often accompanied inability properly utilize variations speech particularly deficits ability accurately modulate pitch
