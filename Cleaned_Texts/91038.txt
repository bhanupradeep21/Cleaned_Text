dissonance typically experienced psychological stress persons participate action goes one according theory two actions ideas psychologically consistent people power change become discomfort triggered persons belief clashing new information perceived wherein individual tries find way resolve contradiction reduce prophecy fails social psychological study modern group predicted destruction world theory cognitive dissonance leon festinger proposed human beings strive internal psychological consistency function mentally real person experiences internal inconsistency tends become psychologically uncomfortable motivated reduce cognitive tend make changes justify stressful behavior either adding new parts cognition causing psychological dissonance rationalization avoiding circumstances contradictory information likely increase magnitude cognitive dissonance confirmation coping nuances contradictory ideas experiences mentally stressful requires energy effort sit seemingly opposite things seem true festinger argued people would inevitably resolve dissonance blindly believing whatever wanted function reality society human beings continually adjust correspondence mental attitudes personal actions continual adjustments cognition action result one three relationships term magnitude dissonance refers level discomfort caused person caused relationship two different internal beliefs action incompatible beliefs two factors determine degree psychological dissonance caused two conflicting cognitions two conflicting actions always degree dissonance within person go making

selective exposure theory discussed since early days festingers proposal cognitive dissonance noticed people would selectively expose media others specifically would avoid dissonant messages prefer consonant selective exposure people actively selectively choose watch view read fit current state mind mood words consumers select attitudeconsistent information avoid attitudechallenging applied media news music messaging channel idea choosing something opposition feel believe increase cognitive dissonance example study done elderly home loneliest family frequent visitors residents shown series documentaries three featured happy successful elderly person three featured unhappy lonely elderly watching documentaries residents indicated preferred media featuring unhappy lonely person happy person attested feeling lonely experiencing cognitive dissonance watching somebody age feeling happy successful study explains people select media aligns mood selectively exposing people experiences already experiencing comfortable see movie character similar watch one someone age successful another example note people mostly consume media aligns political views study done participants shown attitudinally consistent challenging politically balanced online results showed participants trusted attitudeconsistent news others regardless source evident participants actively selected media aligns beliefs rather opposing fact recent research suggested discrepancy cognitions drives individuals crave attitudeconsistent information experience negative emotions drives individuals avoid counter attitudinal information words psychological discomfort activates selective exposure dissonancereduction four theoretic paradigms cognitive dissonance mental stress people

communication initially advanced american psychologist leon festinger festinger theorized cognitive dissonance usually arises person holds two incompatible beliefs normal occurrence since people encounter different situations invoke conflicting thought sequences conflict results psychological discomfort according festinger people experiencing thought conflict try reduce psychological discomfort attempting achieve emotional equilibrium equilibrium achieved three main ways first person may downplay importance dissonant thought second person may attempt outweigh dissonant thought consonant thoughts lastly person may incorporate dissonant thought current belief dissonance plays important role persuasion persuade people must cause experience dissonance offer proposal way resolve
