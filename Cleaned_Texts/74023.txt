social psychology stereotype generalized belief particular category expectation people might every person particular group type expectation vary example expectation groups personality preferences appearance ability stereotypes often overgeneralized inaccurate resistant new stereotype necessarily need negative assumption may positive neutral negative explicit stereotype refers stereotypes one aware one holds aware one using judge people person making judgments particular person b group g person explicit stereotype group g decision bias partially mitigated using conscious control however attempts offset bias due conscious awareness stereotype often fail truly impartial due either underestimating overestimating amount bias created stereotype implicit stereotypes lay individuals subconsciousness control awareness implicit stereotypes built based two concepts associative networks semantic knowledge memory automatic implicit stereotypes automatic involuntary associations people make social group domain attribute example one beliefs women men equally capable becoming successful electricians time many associate electricians men social psychology stereotype thought widely adopted specific types individuals certain ways behaving intended represent entire group individuals behaviors thoughts beliefs may may accurately reflect within psychology across disciplines different conceptualizations theories stereotyping exist times sharing commonalities well containing contradictory elements even social sciences subdisciplines psychology stereotypes occasionally reproduced identified certain theories example assumptions term stereotype comes french adjective stéréotype derives greek words στερεός stereos firm τύπος typos hence solid impression one ideastheories term first used printing trade firmin didot describe printing plate duplicated typography duplicate printing plate stereotype used printing instead original outside printing first reference stereotype english noun meant image perpetuated without however stereotype first used modern psychological sense american journalist walter lippmann work public stereotypes prejudice racism understood related different stereotypes regarded cognitive component often occurs without conscious awareness whereas prejudice affective component stereotyping discrimination one behavioral components prejudicial tripartite view intergroup attitudes stereotypes reflect expectations beliefs characteristics members groups perceived different ones prejudice represents emotional response discrimination refers although related three concepts exist independently according daniel katz kenneth braly stereotyping leads racial prejudice people emotionally react name group ascribe characteristics members group evaluate possible prejudicial effects stereotype content refers attributes people think characterize group studies stereotype content examine people think others rather reasons mechanisms involved early theories stereotype content proposed social psychologists gordon allport assumed stereotypes outgroups reflected uniform instance katz braly argued classic study ethnic stereotypes uniformly contrast newer model stereotype content theorizes stereotypes frequently ambivalent vary along two dimensions warmth competence warmth competence respectively predicted lack competition status groups compete ingroup resources eg college space perceived warm whereas highstatus eg economically educationally successful groups considered competent groups within four combinations high low levels warmth competence elicit distinct model explains phenomenon outgroups admired disliked whereas others liked disrespected model empirically tested variety national international samples found reliably predict stereotype even recent model stereotype content called abc model suggested methods study warmth competence stereotype content model scm missing crucial element stereotypes social groups often spontaneously experiments scm usually ask participants rate traits according warmth competence doesnt allow participants use stereotype abc model proposed koch colleagues estimate people spontaneously stereotype us social groups people using traits koch et al conducted several studies asking participants list groups sort according using statistical techniques revealed three dimensions explained similarity ratings three dimensions agency beliefs b communion c agency associated reaching goals standing socioeconomic status related competence scm examples traits including poor wealthy powerful powerless low status high status beliefs associated views world morals conservativeprogressive beliefs examples traits including traditional modern religious scienceoriented conventional alternative finally communion associated connecting others fitting similar warmth scm examples traits including trustworthy untrustworthy cold warm repellent according research using model curvilinear relationship agency example group high low agency dimension may seen uncommunal whereas groups average agency seen model many implications predicting behaviour towards stereotyped groups example koch colleagues recently proposed perceived similarity agency beliefs increases intergroup early studies suggested stereotypes used rigid repressed authoritarian people idea refuted contemporary studies suggest ubiquity stereotypes suggested regard stereotypes collective group beliefs meaning people belong social group share set modern research asserts full understanding stereotypes requires considering two complementary perspectives shared within particular culturesubculture formed mind individual stereotyping serve cognitive functions interpersonal level social functions intergroup stereotyping function intergroup level see social identity approaches social identity theory selfcategorization theory individual must see part group part group must also salient craig mcgarty russell spears vincent yzerbyt argued cognitive functions stereotyping best understood relation social functions vice stereotypes help make sense world form categorization helps simplify systematize information thus information easily identified recalled predicted reacted stereotypes categories objects people stereotypes objects people different within stereotypes objects people similar gordon allport suggested possible answers people find easier understand categorized first people consult category identify response patterns second categorized information specific noncategorized information categorization accentuates properties shared members group third people readily describe objects category objects category distinct characteristics finally people take granted characteristics particular category category may arbitrary grouping complementary perspective theorizes stereotypes function time energysavers allow people act yet another perspective suggests stereotypes peoples biased perceptions social view people use stereotypes shortcuts make sense social contexts makes persons task understanding world less cognitively following situations overarching purpose stereotyping people put collective self ingroup membership positive mentioned previously stereotypes used explain social henri described observations people found antisemitic fabricated contents protocols elders zion made sense jews certain characteristics therefore according jews stereotyped evil yearning world domination match antisemitic facts presented protocols elders zion people create stereotypes outgroup justify actions ingroup committed plans commit towards example according europeans stereotyped african indian chinese people incapable achieving financial advances without european help stereotype used justify european colonialism africa india china assumption people want ingroup positive image relative outgroups people want differentiate ingroup relevant outgroups desirable outgroup affect ingroups image image preservation point view point ingroup positively distinct people actively create certain images relevant outgroups stereotyping people see ingroup longer clearly andor positively differentiated relevant outgroups want restore intergroup differentiation state favours stereotypes emphasize persons group membership two steps stereotypes emphasize persons similarities ingroup members relevant dimensions also persons differences outgroup members relevant people change stereotype ingroups outgroups suit outgroup treats ingroup member badly drawn members seen members within group able relate though stereotype identical situations person embrace stereotype avoid humiliation failing task blaming stereotypes indicator ingroup intragroup disagreements stereotypes ingroup andor outgroups ingroup members take collective action prevent ingroup members diverging john c turner proposed ingroup members disagree outgroup stereotype one three possible collective actions follow first ingroup members may negotiate conclude different outgroup stereotypes stereotyping different subgroups outgroup eg russian gymnasts versus russian boxers second ingroup members may negotiate conclude disagreeing categorical differences amongst accordingly context better categorise ingroup members different categories eg democrats versus republican shared category eg american finally ingroup members may influence arrive common outgroup stereotype different disciplines give different accounts stereotypes develop psychologists may focus individuals experience groups patterns communication groups intergroup conflict sociologists may focus relations among different groups social structure suggest stereotypes result conflict poor parenting inadequate mental emotional development stereotypes formed two main factors explain persistence first cognitive effects schematic processing see schema make member group behaves expect behavior confirms even strengthens existing stereotypes second affective emotional aspects prejudice render logical arguments stereotypes ineffective countering power emotional correspondence bias refers tendency ascribe persons behavior disposition personality underestimate extent situational factors elicited behavior correspondence bias play important role stereotype example study roguer yzerbyt participants watched video showing students randomly instructed find arguments either euthanasia students argued favor euthanasia came law department different departments results showed participants attributed students responses attitudes although made clear video students choice position participants reported group membership ie department students

infrequent events metaanalytic review studies showed illusory correlation effects stronger infrequent distinctive information hamilton giffords distinctivenessbased explanation stereotype formation subsequently study mcconnell sherman hamilton found people formed stereotypes based information distinctive time presentation considered distinctive time person judges nondistinctive information memory distinctive information reencoded rerepresented distinctive first one explanation stereotypes shared result common environment stimulates people react problem common environment explanation general explain shared stereotypes occur without direct research since suggested people highly similar describe different racial national groups although people personal experience groups another explanation says people socialised adopt psychologists believe although stereotypes absorbed age stereotypes usually acquired early childhood influence parents teachers peers media stereotypes defined social values stereotypes change per changes social suggestion stereotype content depends social values reflects walter lippmans argument publication stereotypes rigid changed studies emerging since refuted suggestion stereotype contents changed studies suggested one groups stereotype another group would become less positive depending whether intergroup relationship improved intergroup events eg world war ii persian gulf conflicts often changed intergroup relationships example wwii black american students held negative stereotype people countries united statess wwii changes intergroup relationship relevant stereotypes according third explanation shared stereotypes neither caused coincidence common stimuli socialisation explanation posits stereotypes shared group members motivated behave certain ways stereotypes reflect important note explanation stereotypes consequence cause intergroup relations explanation assumes important people acknowledge ingroup outgroup emphasise difference outgroup members similarity ingroup international migration creates opportunities intergroup relations interactions always disconfirm stereotypes also known form maintain dualprocess model cognitive processing stereotypes asserts automatic activation stereotypes followed controlled processing stage individual may choose disregard ignore stereotyped information brought number studies found stereotypes activated automatically patricia devine example suggested stereotypes automatically activated presence member symbolic equivalent stereotyped group unintentional activation stereotype equally strong high lowprejudice persons words related cultural stereotype blacks presented subliminally ostensibly unrelated impressionformation task subjects read paragraph describing raceunspecified target persons behaviors rated target person several trait scales results showed participants received high proportion racial words rated target person story significantly hostile participants presented lower proportion words related stereotype effect held true high lowprejudice subjects measured modern racism scale thus racial stereotype activated even lowprejudice individuals personally endorse studies using alternative priming methods shown activation gender age stereotypes also subsequent research suggested relation category activation stereotype activation lepore brown instance noted words used devines study neutral category labels eg blacks stereotypic attributes eg lazy argued neutral category labels presented people high low prejudice would respond differently design similar devines lepore brown primed category africanamericans using labels blacks west indians assessed differential activation associated stereotype subsequent impressionformation task found highprejudice participants increased ratings target person negative stereotypic dimensions decreased positive dimension whereas lowprejudice subjects tended opposite direction results suggest level prejudice stereotype endorsement affects peoples judgements category stereotype per se research shown people trained activate counterstereotypic information thereby reduce automatic activation negative stereotypes study kawakami et al example participants presented category label taught respond stereotypic traits yes nonstereotypic traits training period subjects showed reduced stereotype effect based learning new positive stereotypes rather negation already existing empirical evidence suggests stereotype activation automatically influence social example bargh chen burrows activated stereotype elderly among half participants administering scrambledsentence test participants saw words related age stereotypes subjects primed stereotype walked significantly slowly control group although test include words specifically referring slowness thus acting way stereotype suggests elderly people act stereotype elder affect subjective perception another experiment bargh chen burrows also found stereotype blacks includes notion aggression subliminal exposure black faces increased likelihood randomly selected white college students reacted aggression hostility participants subconsciously viewed white similarly correll et al showed activated stereotypes blacks influence peoples behavior series experiments black white participants played video game black white person shown holding gun harmless object eg mobile phone participants decide quickly possible whether shoot target target person armed black white participants faster deciding shoot target black white target unarmed participants avoided shooting quickly white time pressure made shooter bias even stereotypes efficient shortcuts sensemaking tools however keep people processing new unexpected information individual thus biasing impression formation early researchers believed stereotypes inaccurate representations series pioneering studies found empirical support widely held racial gordon allport wrote possible stereotype grow defiance research role illusory correlations formation stereotypes suggests stereotypes develop incorrect inferences relationship two events eg membership social group bad good attributes means least stereotypes book yuehting lee et al argued stereotypes sometimes similarly study jussim et al reviewed four studies racial stereotypes seven studies gender stereotypes regarding demographic characteristics academic achievement personality behavior argued aspects ethnic gender stereotypes accurate stereotypes concerning political affiliation nationality much less study terracciano et al found stereotypic beliefs nationality reflect actual personality traits people different paper marlene mackie argued stereotypes inaccurate definition rather empirical claim stereotypes simply defined inaccurate even though supposed inaccuracy stereotypes treated though empirical attributive ambiguity refers uncertainty members stereotyped groups experience interpreting causes others behavior toward stereotyped individuals receive negative feedback attribute either personal shortcomings lack ability poor effort evaluators stereotypes prejudice toward social group alternatively positive feedback either attributed personal merit discounted form sympathy crocker et al showed black participants evaluated white person aware race black subjects mistrusted feedback attributing negative feedback evaluators stereotypes positive feedback evaluators desire appear unbiased black participants race unknown evaluator accepting attributional ambiguity shown affect persons selfesteem receive positive evaluations stereotyped individuals uncertain whether really deserved success consequently find difficult take credit achievements case negative feedback ambiguity shown protective effect selfesteem allows people assign blame external causes studies however found effect holds stereotyped individuals absolutely certain negative outcomes due evaluatorss prejudice room uncertainty remains stereotyped individuals tend blame attributional ambiguity also make difficult assess ones skills performancerelated evaluations mistrusted discounted moreover lead belief ones efforts directly linked outcomes thereby depressing ones motivation stereotype threat occurs people aware negative stereotype social group experience anxiety concern might confirm stereotype threat shown undermine performance variety claude steele joshua aronson conducted first experiments showing stereotype threat depress intellectual performance standardized tests one study found black college students performed worse white students verbal test task framed measure intelligence presented manner performance gap narrowed subsequent experiments showed framing test diagnostic intellectual ability made black students aware negative stereotypes group turn impaired stereotype threat effects demonstrated array social groups many different arenas including academics also researchers suggested stereotype threat interpreted factor reallife performance gaps raised possibility publication critics focused correcting claim misconceptions early studies showing large however metaanalyses systematic reviews shown significant evidence effects stereotype threat though phenomenon defies oversimplistic stereotypes lead people expect certain actions members social groups stereotypebased expectations may lead selffulfilling prophecies ones inaccurate expectations persons behavior social interaction prompt person act stereotypeconsistent ways thus confirming ones erroneous expectations validating word zanna cooper demonstrated effects stereotypes context job interview white participants interviewed black white subjects prior experiments trained act standardized manner analysis videotaped interviews showed black job applicants treated differently received shorter amounts interview time less eye contact interviewers made speech errors eg stutters sentence incompletions incoherent sounds physically distanced black applicants second experiment trained interviewers instructed treat applicants white like whites blacks treated first experiment result applicants treated like blacks first experiment behaved nervous manner received negative performance ratings interviewees receiving treatment previously afforded study snyder tanke berscheid found similar pattern social interactions men women male undergraduate students asked talk female undergraduates believed physically attractive unattractive phone conversations taped analysis showed men thought talking attractive woman communicated positive friendlier manner men believed talking unattractive women altered womens behavior female subjects unknowingly perceived physically attractive behaved friendly likeable sociable manner comparison subjects regarded study j thomas kellow brett jones looked effects selffulfilling prophecy african american caucasian high school freshman students white black students informed test performance would predictive performance statewide high stakes standardized test also told historically white students outperformed black students test knowledge created selffulfilling prophecy white black students white students scored statistically significantly higher african american students test stereotype threat underperforming standardized tests affected african american students accountancy popular stereotype represents members profession humorless introspective stereotypes simplify justify social reality potentially powerful effects people perceive treat one result stereotypes lead discrimination labor markets example tilcsik found employers seek job applicants stereotypically male heterosexual traits particularly likely engage discrimination gay men suggesting discrimination basis sexual orientation partly rooted specific stereotypes stereotypes loom large many labor agerström rooth showed automatic obesity stereotypes captured implicit association test predict real hiring discrimination similarly experiments suggest gender stereotypes play important role judgments affect hiring stereotypes cause racist prejudice example scientists activists warned use stereotype nigerian prince referring advancefee scammers racist ie reducing nigeria nation scammers fraudulent princes people still online stereotype needs called stereotypes affect selfevaluations lead instance correll found specific stereotypes eg stereotype women lower mathematical ability affect womens mens evaluations abilities eg math science men assess task ability higher women performing similarly study sinclair et al shown asian american women rated math ability favorably ethnicity relevant stereotype asian americans excel math made salient contrast rated math ability less favorably gender corresponding stereotype womens inferior math skills made salient sinclair et al found however effect stereotypes selfevaluations mediated degree close people someones life endorse stereotypes peoples selfstereotyping increase decrease depending whether close others view stereotypeconsistent inconsistent stereotyping also play central role depression people negative selfstereotypes according cox abramson devine hollon depression caused prejudice ie deprejudice related group membership eg eg someone holds prejudicial beliefs stigmatized group becomes member group may internalize prejudice develop depression people may also show prejudice internalization selfstereotyping negative childhood experiences verbal physical stereotypes traditional familiar symbol clusters expressing less complex idea convenient way often simplistic pronouncements gender racial ethnic cultural backgrounds become source misinformation delusion example school students confronted task writing theme think terms literary associations often using stereotypes picked books films magazines read viewed danger stereotyping lies existence fact become substitute observation misinterpretation cultural promoting information literacy pedagogical approach effectively combat entrenchment stereotypes necessity using information literacy separate multicultural fact fiction well illustrated examples literature stereotypes common various cultural media take form dramatic stock characters instantly recognizable nature stereotypes mean effective advertising situation alexander fedorov proposed concept media stereotypes analysis concept refers identification analysis stereotypical images people ideas events stories themes etc media characters appear movies greatly affect people worldwide perceive gender relations race cultural communities approximately worldwide ticket sales directed toward hollywood movies american movie industry greatly responsible portraying characters different cultures diversity fit stereotypical led spread persistence gender racial ethnic cultural stereotypes seen example russians usually portrayed ruthless agents brutal mobsters villains hollywood according russian american professor nina l khrushcheva cant even turn tv go movies without reference russians portrayals latin americans film print media restricted narrow set characters latin americans largely depicted sexualized figures latino macho latina vixen gang members illegal immigrants entertainers comparison rarely portrayed working professionals business leaders hollywood films several latin american stereotypes historically used examples el bandido halfbreed harlot male buffoon female clown latin lover dark lady wise old man poor peon many hispanic characters hollywood films consists one basic stereotypes rare view latin american actors representing characters outside stereotypical media stereotypes women first emerged early century various stereotypic depictions types women appeared magazines including victorian ideals femininity new woman gibson girl femme fatale stereotypes also common video games women portrayed stereotypes damsel distress sexual objects see gender representation video studies show minorities portrayed often stereotypical roles athletes see race video games literature art stereotypes clichéd predictable characters situations throughout history storytellers drawn stereotypical characters situations immediately connect audience new female athletes encounter various pressures stereotypes significant psychological consequences stereotypes give rise challenges athletes lives including diminished selfesteem leading profound psychological impacts female athletes made considerable strides overcoming obstacles transitioned unable compete competitively due biological misconceptions equal opportunities male athletes thanks title today greater societal acceptance female athletes however
