articulatory phonetics place articulation also point articulation consonant location along vocal tract production point constriction made active passive articulator active articulators organs capable voluntary movement create constriction passive articulators called normally fixed parts active articulator makes along manner articulation phonation place articulation gives consonant distinctive sound since vowels produced open vocal tract point production occurs easily determined therefore described terms place articulation relative positions vowel space mostly dependent formant frequencies less specific tongue position lip terminology used describing places articulation developed allow specifying theoretically possible contrasts known language distinguishes places described literature less precision needed distinguish sounds particular human voice produces sounds following needed larynx voice box cylindrical framework cartilage serves anchor vocal folds muscles vocal folds contract airflow lungs impeded vocal folds forced apart increasing air pressure lungs process continues periodic cycle felt vibration buzzing singing vibration frequency vocal folds determines pitch sound produced voiced phonemes pure vowels definition distinguished buzzing sound periodic oscillation vocal cords lips mouth used similar way create similar sound toddler trumpeter demonstrate rubber balloon inflated tied stretched tightly across neck produces squeak buzz depending tension across neck level pressure inside balloon similar actions similar results occur vocal cords contracted relaxed across larynx active articulators movable parts vocal apparatus impede direct airstream typically part tongue five major parts vocal tract move lips flexible front tongue body tongue root tongue together epiglottis glottis discrete act independently two may work together called five main active parts divided many languages contrast sounds produced within major part vocal apparatus following areas known bilabial consonants lips move articulatory gesture brings lips together convention lower lip said active upper lip passive similarly linguolabial consonants tongue contacts upper lip upper lip actively moving meet tongue nonetheless tongue conventionally said active lip passive reason parts mouth vocal tract typically active vocal tract typically passive dorsal gestures different parts body tongue contact different parts roof mouth independently controlled subsumed term dorsal unlike coronal gestures involving front tongue flexible epiglottis may active contacting pharynx passive contacted aryepiglottal folds distinctions made laryngeal areas difficult observe subject ongoing investigation several stillunidentified combinations thought possible glottis acts

roof mouth back although continuum several contrastive areas languages may distinguish consonants articulating different areas languages contrast two sounds within area unless feature contrasts well following areas contrastive regions strictly separated instance sounds many languages surface tongue contacts relatively large area back upper teeth alveolar ridge common enough received name dentialveolar likewise alveolar postalveolar regions merge hard soft palate soft palate uvula adjacent regions terms like prevelar intermediate palatal velar postvelar velar uvular upper vs lower pharyngeal may used specify precisely articulation takes place however although language may contrast prevelar postvelar sounds also contrast palatal uvular sounds type consonant contrasts limited number always exact location following table shows possible combinations active passive articulators possible locations sibilants well nonsibilants occur indicated dashed red sibilants additional complications involving tongue shape see article sibilants chart possible articulations precise vocabulary compounding two places articulation sometimes seen however usually reduced passive articulation generally sufficient thus usually called palatal velar uvular ambiguity additional terms invented commonly called retroflex note additional shades passive articulation sometimes specified using pre post example prepalatal near border postalveolar region hard palate prevelar back hard palate also postpalatal even mediopalatal middle hard palate postvelar near border soft palate uvula
