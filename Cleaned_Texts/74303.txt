describe crocodylus checchiai var specimen represents mesorostral skull length cm tip snout end supraoccipital skulls surface heavily ornamented dense network pits ridges however despite visible ornamentation finer detail skull sutures obscured thin layer sandy crust like crocodiles c checchiai shows marked constriction behind external nares premaxilla maxilla connect making room enlarged dentary tooth first two dentary teeth also slightly enlarged piercing premaxilla creating two small holes visible even viewed fifth maxillary tooth likewise enlarged point maxilla bears notable convex bump around root visible viewed top side upper jaw houses total eighteen teeth five premaxilla maxilla arranged relatively linear fashion teeth upper jaw consistent shape relatively slender shape contrast teeth show variation slender teeth towards tip snout stout teeth back lacrimals larger prefrontals broadly contact nasal bone without maxilla inserting two bones external nares elongated surrounded mostly premaxilla small portion posterior edge presumably composed nasal bone however area broken thus certain orbits large nearly circular ventral margin infratemporal fenestrae smaller damaged breakage towards back quadratojugal lamina would notable feature c checchiai however swollen rostral boss covers nasals well parts lacrimals prefrontals anteriormost tip frontal bone type structure typical neotropic radiation crocodylus american crocodile unheard african indopacific species historically phylogenetic placement crocodylus checchiai poorly explored earliest attempts placing species within crocodylus largely ignored rostral boss spite characteristic nature neotropic species maccagno initially believing closely related c palaeindicus based characters currently thought little value later research conducted tchernov leakey instead found ties extant nile crocodile later even deeming two species synonymous one another first researcher recognize ties c checchiai crocodiles america max k hecht noted similar skull structure c checchiai specifically relation cuban crocodiles morelets crocodile however full phylogenetic analysis performed brochu storrs found support species inclusion crocodylus failed recover relationship much detail due formation large later analysis conducted delfino colleagues differs brochu storrs several characters due use libyan specimen rather tanzanian fossils resulted better resolved tree finding taxon sit base neotropic clade suggests c checchiai may geographic phylogenetic link american crocodylus species ancestral
