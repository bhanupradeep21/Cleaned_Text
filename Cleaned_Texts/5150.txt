developmental homeostasis process animals develop less normally despite defective genes deficient organisms ability overcome certain circumstances order develop normally either physical mental circumstance interferes either physical mental trait many species specific norm fit norm prosper dont killed find difficult thrive important animal able interact group members effectively animals must learn species norms early live normal successful life species developmental homeostasis determines species adapts live normal life therefore focus many experiments experiments geared designed test threshold certain species overcome prosper despite certain due fact survival species based ability interact normal manner usually interfere fine line animal rights acceptable rhesus monkey experiments show young monkey needs physical contact monkeys learn social behaviors interact effectively one ways mental developmental homeostasis researched one way physical developmental homeostasis tested facial symmetry experiment people asked rate faces saw better looking experiment resulted pictures symmetrical faces called better looking found humans experiments brushlegged wolf spider barn swallow birds favored traits give bearer advantage attracting high quality mates species value developmental homeostasis physically mentally ability one adapt social norms seems increase likelihood reproductive advantage able attract mates leave developmental homeostasis attributes way many animals develop contains way develop normally abnormally despite faulty genes insufficient environment property development reduces variation around mean value phenotype reflects ability developmental processes suppress outcomes order generate adaptive phenotype effects developmental homeostasis demonstrated experiment conducted margaret harry harlow wanted test consequences infant rhesus monkeys would separated mothers little interaction monkeys first separated mothers six twelve hours birth placed human made mechanical substitute called surrogate surrogates made either wire cylinder structure terry cloth structure placed babies cage terry cloth structure also placed nursing bottle monkeys preferred clung cloth surrogate mother short period time monkeys took side effects weight loss abnormal physical development monkeys reached age could eat solid foods separated cloth mothers three days reunited mothers clung wander young rhesus monkeys natural habitat normally explore venture harlow concluded need contact comfort stronger need explore isolated social interaction also caused negative outcomes later life surrogateraised monkeys exhibited depression aggressive behavior would clutch rock constantly back forth avoid interaction others affecting social behavior also impacted interacting sexually monkeys underwent little sexual posturing reproduction source needed test much social experience necessary needed normal development harlows performed another experiment isolated young rhesus monkeys limiting interaction time monkeys gave fifteen minutes day three monkeys interact beginning monkeys would attach begin play normal behavior monkeys natural habitat age one month play monkeys species six months constantly interacting groups results showed time monkeys developed relatively normal behavior limiting social interaction babies affect interacting sexually socially also exhibit abnormal aggression depression socializing harry harlow began studying partial total isolation infant monkeys raising cages partial isolation involved raising monkeys bare wire cages allowed see smell hear monkeys give opportunity physical contact total social isolation involved rearing monkeys isolation chambers took away contact monkeys results showed monkeys placed partial isolation displayed various abnormal behaviors blank staring circling cages numerous times selfmutilation cages placed several locations monkeys remained tested solitary confinement fifteen total isolation experiments baby monkeys left alone three six twelve twentyfour months experiments resulted monkeys severely psychologically disturbed abnormal development first removed isolation usually went emotional shock clutching rocking multiple times one six monkeys isolated three months refused eat release died five days later longer time isolation detrimental monkeys act socially placed monkeys harlow pointed monkey actually died isolation harlow tried reintegrate monkeys isolated six months placing monkeys reared normally stated produced severe deficits virtually every aspect social behavior achieved limited recovery simple social responses developmental homeostasis plays role development symmetrical asymmetrical bodies effect species shows individuals species symmetrical features likely obtain mate one asymmetrical features symmetry facial features humans could found appealing men women could due ability find prospective mates responding positively either body facial symmetry could attributes announce individuals capacity overcome challenges normal human preference symmetry explained humans looking mate choice mainly symmetry reliable indicator genetic quality mates look cognitive mechanisms adaptive significance facial attractiveness interest psychologists men women find traits averageness symmetry masculinity male femininity female faces noted humans find symmetrical faces attractive asymmetrical faces disruptions development caused mutations inability secure critical material resources early life could generate asymmetries appearance body asymmetry reflects suboptimal development brain important organs preference symmetrical traits could enable selective individual acquire partner good genes transfer disruptions development could caused stress illness genetic factors study facial symmetry beauty experimented gillian rhodes called facial symmetry perception experiment images human faces digitally manipulated show various amounts symmetry people asked rate faces found faces symmetry attractive developmental homeostasis present humans animals well choosing symmetrical features asymmetrical features observed birds lizards araneae even insects example barn swallow females reported prefer males whose long outer feathers length side symmetrical males gain reproductive advantage female mate another example behavior exhibited damselfly lestes viridis males symmetrical hindwings mated unmated rivals asymmetrical examples show individuals high quality features able reproduce large symmetrical traits individuals lower quality features suffer costs produce asymmetrical one species chooses mates based body symmetry brushlegged wolf spider males larger tufts one leg asymmetrical tend smaller poorer fitness males symmetrical tufts
