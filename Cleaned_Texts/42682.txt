cancer selection viewed lens natural selection animal hosts body environment applies selective pressures upon cancer cells fit cancer cells traits allow compete cancer cells related genetically different genetic diversity cells within tumor gives cancer evolutionary advantage hosts ability inhibit destroy tumors therefore selective pressures clinical treatments pharmaceutical treatments needed help destroy large amount genetically diverse cancerous cells within tumor high genetic diversity cancer cells within tumor makes cancer formidable foe survival animal hosts also proposed cancer selection selective force driven evolution animals therefore cancer animals paired competitors coevolution throughout time evolution driven natural selection cornerstone nearly branches biology including cancer charles darwins book origin species published darwin proposed theory evolution means natural selection natural selection force drives changes phenotypes observed populations time therefore responsible diversity amongst living things pressures applied natural selection upon individuals leads evolutionary change time natural selection simply selective pressures acting upon individuals within population due changes environment picks traits best fit selective change observations darwin proposed diversity phenotypes amongst living things also applied cancer biology explain selection drives change population cells within tumor time therefore purpose cancer evolution body organism environment changes environment whether via natural processes clinical therapies apply selective pressures upon cancer drive selective adaptation cancerous tumor cancer disease highly diverse pathology initiation progression noncancerous tissue malignant tumor tissue cancer considered stochastic nature many variables probabilities contribute cell tissue progresses state noncancerous cancerous eventually cancer differs many diseases due uniquely long lifespan disease contributes diversity cancer cells within tumor related tumors host time passes cancerous tumors progress genetic diversity amongst clonal cells due ability accumulate changes time tumor reaches homeostasis thus allowing spread disease throughout body host overlap pathway developmental pathways possible events lead outcome metastasis becomes apparent cancer unique ability find way progress cancerous phenotype therefore moment initiation putting cells tissues pathway towards metastasis majority tumor cells accumulate mutations increases genetic diversity within tumor intratumor genetic tumors composed genetically diverse cells also lead intertumor heterogeneity meaning related tumors within host genetically different tumor heterogeneity gives selective advantage best fit clonal subclonal cells tumor due heterogeneity unchecked proliferation tumor cells cancer given selective advantage noncancerous cells also selective pressures choose pharmaceutical clinical therapies also hosts immune due diverse nature cancer able evolve defined specific mechanisms resist selective pressures goal selective pressures upon cancer rid disease diversity thus forcing back initial less harmful easily treatable less diverse non cancerous neoplastic state considered neoplastic state neoplasm simply abnormal growth tissue range harmless noncancerous mole cancerous tumor cancer circumvent negative selective pressures due ability accumulate mutations cause genetic diversity tumor cells cells proliferate cancer seems evolved propensity least selection fitness demonstrated ability tumors undergoing large amounts mutations find way cells composing tumor survive produce cellular offspring better fit survival therefore cancer initiation progression highly conserved evolutionarily tumor would dissociate merely due inordinate volume mutations occur within another interesting way look cancer evolution lens selective pressures shape disease throughout time spent within organism rather think cancer selective force shaping evolution populations animal hosts taking approach cancer selection would defined terms natural selection artificial selection defined means like natural artificial selection cancer selection would defined selective force capable driving population diversity time lead evolution cancer often defined selfish composed selfish cell lines produce progeny higher fitness reproductive success parental cells allow compete clonal cells increase fitness cancer progression course detrimental host within cancer therefore one could possibly look cancer animal hosts intertwined complicated dance known biologists theory would propose animals evolve new morphological traits lifehistory behaviors become susceptible developing cancer therefore cancer gains evolutionary advantage animals newly evolved animal traits select survival places selective pressure back upon animal species evolve forever succumb cancer selective recently theorized morphological life history diversity seen today animals result uncountable deaths caused cancer ancestral animal cancer disease long lifespan therefore animals evolved bigger complex organisms longer lifespans morphologies highly restricted need adapt resistance negative selective pressures cancer placed upon cancer cells thrive must able proliferate unchecked uncontrolled within tissues animal hosts therefore animals adapted cancer selection evolving tumor suppressing genes help inhibit initiation progression cancerous cells httpsenwikipediaorgwikicancerselection
