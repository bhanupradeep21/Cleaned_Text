synovial fluid also called synoviahelp viscous nonnewtonian fluid found cavities synovial joints egg principal role synovial fluid reduce friction articular cartilage synovial joints synovial fluid small component transcellular fluid component extracellular fluid inner membrane synovial joints called synovial membrane secretes synovial fluid joint synovial fluid ultrafiltrate plasma contains proteins derived blood plasma proteins produced cells within joint fluid contains hyaluronan secreted fibroblastlike cells synovial membrane lubricin proteoglycan secreted surface chondrocytes articular cartilage interstitial fluid filtered blood fluid forms thin layer roughly μm surface cartilage also seeps microcavities irregularities articular cartilage surface filling empty fluid articular cartilage effectively serves synovial fluid reserve movement synovial fluid held cartilage squeezed mechanically maintain layer fluid cartilage surface socalled weeping lubrication functions synovial fluid include synovial tissue sterile composed vascularized connective tissue lacks basement membrane two cell types type type b present type derived blood monocytes removes wearandtear debris synovial fluid type b produces hyaluronan synovial fluid made hyaluronic acid lubricin proteinases collagenases synovial fluid exhibits nonnewtonian flow characteristics viscosity coefficient constant fluid linearly viscous synovial fluid thixotropic characteristics conditions sudden increase pressure kind mechanical shock viscosity suddenly normal synovial fluid contains mgml hyaluronan hyaluronic polymer disaccharides composed dglucuronic acid dnacetylglucosamine joined alternating glycosidic medical source hyaluronan synthesized synovial membrane secreted joint cavity increase viscosity elasticity articular cartilages lubricate surfaces synovium medical source synovial fluid contains lubricin also known second lubricating component secreted synovial chiefly responsible socalled boundarylayer lubrication reduces friction opposing surfaces cartilage also evidence helps regulate synovial cell also contains phagocytic cells remove microbes debris results normal wear tear joint synovial fluid may collected syringe procedure termed arthrocentesis also known joint aspiration synovial fluid may classified normal noninflammatory inflammatory septic hemorrhagic glucose mgdl concentration synovial fluid nearly equal serum normal normal decreased decreased many synovial fluid types associated specific glucose mgdl concentration synovial fluid nearly equal serum cytological biochemical analysis human synovial fluid began around using cadaverderived fluid comparing characteristics instance bovine synovial mucin clot test old approach determining inflammatory infiltrate present test acetic acid added synovial fluid specimen normal specimen lead congealing hyaluronic acid forming mucin clot inflammation present mucin clot formed hyaluronic acid lactate elevated septic arthritis usually mgdl complement factors decreased rheumatoid arthritis lupus arthritis microscopic analysis synovial fluid performed evaluate cell count crystals crystals include monosodium urate crystals calcium pyrophosphate hydroxyapatite corticosteroid monosodium urate crystals seen gout gouty arthritis appear needleshaped negatively birefringent crystals varying length μm negative birefringence crystals appear yellow parallel light blue perpendicular light calcium pyrophosphate crystals seen pseudogout also known calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease cppd crystals rodshaped rhomboids varying length μm positive birefringence blue parallel light yellow perpendicular light hydroxyapatite crystals small negatively birefringent usually detectable alizarin red stain corticosteroid crystals may seen following therapeutic corticosteroid injection joint space appear blunt jagged show variable two articulating surfaces synovial joint separated one volume within joint capsule increased negative pressure results volume synovial fluid within joint insufficient fill expanding volume joint gases dissolved synovial fluid mostly carbon dioxide liberated quickly fill empty space leading rapid formation process known cavitation cavitation synovial joints results high frequency cracking term synovia sɪˈnoʊviə came english around anglicized form synovial first recorded mid century neolatin coined perhaps paracelsus greek συν latin ovum egg ia resembles egg white consistency external term synovium much recent pseudolatin coinage less confusingly called synovial membrane recorded general dictionaries medical dictionaries explain meaning etymology apparently derived term synovia ie obfuscated etymology mixed greek latin elements singular term synovia misunderstood word erroneously reinterpreted plural previously nonexistent term synovium perhaps analogy plural terms liquids waters amniotic fluid one insists using pseudolatin term synovium synovial membrane nonlatinate plural synoviums better less confusing synovia httpsenwikipediaorgwikisynovialfluid
