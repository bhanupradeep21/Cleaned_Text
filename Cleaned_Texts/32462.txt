carpometacarpal cmc joints five joints wrist articulate distal row carpal bones proximal bases five metacarpal bones cmc joint thumb first cmc joint also known trapeziometacarpal tmc joint differs significantly four cmc joints therefore described separately carpometacarpal joint thumb pollex also known first carpometacarpal joint trapeziometacarpal joint tmc connects trapezium first metacarpal bone plays irreplaceable role normal functioning thumb important joint connecting wrist metacarpus osteoarthritis tmc severely disabling condition twenty times common among elderly women pronationsupination first metacarpal especially important action movements first cmc limited shape joint capsuloligamentous complex surrounding joint balance among involved muscles first metacarpal fails sit well saddle example hypoplasia first cmc joint tends subluxated ie slightly displaced towards capsule sufficiently slack allow wide range movements distraction roughly mm reinforcing ligaments tendons give stability joint slightly thicker dorsal side first carpometacarpal joint frequent site osteoarthritis postmenopausal description number names ligaments first cmc varies considerably anatomical literature imaeda et al describe three intracapsular two extracapsular ligaments important stabilizing early anatomically correct drawings ligaments first carpometacarpal
