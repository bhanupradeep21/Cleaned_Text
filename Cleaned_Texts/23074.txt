cannibalism poultry act one individual poultry species consuming part another individual species food commonly occurs flocks domestic hens reared egg production although also occur domestic turkeys pheasants poultry poultry create social order dominance known pecking pressure occurs within flock pecking increase aggression escalate cannibalism occur consequence feather pecking caused denuded areas bleeding birds cannibalism cause large mortality rates within flock large decreases production due stress causes vent pecking sometimes called cloacal cannibalism considered separate form cannibalistic pecking occurs wellfeathered birds cloaca several causes lead cannibalism light overheating crowd size nutrition injurydeath genetics learned research conducted attempt understand poultry engage behaviour totally understood known methods control reduce cannibalism crowd size control beak trimming light manipulation perches selective genetics eyewear poultry species exhibit cannibalism omnivores example hens wild often scratch soil search seeds insects even larger animals lizards young although mainly herbivorous feather pecking often initial cause injury attracts cannibalistic pecking birds perhaps redirected foraging feeding behaviour close confines modern farming systems increased pecking attention easily observed multiple birds join attack often escape attempts cannibalised bird attract pecking attention high intensity light prolonged exposure lead cannibalism poultry captivity due increase stress overheating causes poultry social hierarchy crowds close together dominant birds fight often obtain sustain dominance increase risk increase crowd size also plays factors larger crowd less space pen allows less feeding space therefore means dominant birds take majority food supply leaving less dominant birds susceptible becoming underweight easier targets dominant birds optimal flock size either large flock greater group large recognize established dominant bird social hierarchy breaks small group size social order easily organize intermediate group sizes cause confusion among flock leads higher aggression different birds attempting become dominant one therefore leading increased risk particular diet low protein high energy shown lead less aggressive behaviours despite diet lacking protein component amino acid methionine shown
