cimetidine sold brand name tagamet among others histamine receptor antagonist inhibits stomach acid mainly used treatment heartburn peptic development proton pump inhibitors omeprazole approved indications cimetidine available overthecounter formulation prevent heartburn acid indigestion along cimetidine developed came commercial use cimetidine approved united kingdom needed approved united states food drug administration cimetidine used inhibit stomach acid production used treatment heartburn peptic ulcersmedical citation needed reported side effects cimetidine include diarrhea rashes dizziness fatigue constipation muscle pain usually mild reported mental confusion may occur hormonal effects cimetidine rarely may cause sexual dysfunction including loss libido erectile dysfunction gynecomastia males longterm rarely interstitial nephritis urticaria angioedema reported cimetidine cimetidine also commonly associated transient raised aminotransferase activity hepatotoxicity may ranitidine withdrawn cimetidine appears safe overdose producing symptoms even massive overdoses eg due nonselective inhibition cytochrome enzymes cimetidine numerous drug interactions examples specific interactions include following mechanism action cimetidine antacid histamine receptor found bind receptor kd cimetidine potent inhibitor certain cytochrome cyp including drug appears primarily inhibit described moderate notable since three cyp isoenzymes involved cypmediated drug however also involved oxidative metabolism many commonly used result cimetidine potential large number pharmacokinetic cimetidine reported competitive reversible inhibitor several cyp although mechanismbased suicide irreversible inhibition also identified cimetidines inhibition reversibly inhibits cyp enzymes binding directly complexed hemeiron active site via one imidazole ring nitrogen atoms thereby blocking oxidation cimetidine found possess weak antiandrogenic activity high directly competitively antagonizes androgen receptor ar biological target androgens like testosterone dihydrotestosterone however affinity cimetidine ar weak one study showed affinity anabolic steroid metribolone human ar ki μm nm case sufficiently high doses cimetidine demonstrated weak significant antiandrogenic effects animals including antiandrogenic effects rat ventral prostate mouse kidney reductions weights male accessory glands like prostate gland seminal vesicles rats elevated gonadotropin levels male rats due reduced negative feedback hpg axis addition ar antagonism cimetidine found inhibit estradiol via inhibition enzymes involved metabolic inactivation estradiol resulting increased estrogen medication also reported reduce testosterone biosynthesis increase prolactin levels individual case reports effects might secondary increased estrogen typical therapeutic levels cimetidine either effect causes small increases circulating testosterone concentrations increases testosterone levels cimetidine attributed loss negative feedback hpg axis results due ar typical clinical dosages used treat peptic ulcer disease incidence gynecomastia breast development cimetidine low less one survey patients taking cimetidine gynecomastia frequent endocrinerelated complaint reported high doses however used treat syndrome may higher incidence gynecomastia one small study incidence gynecomastia observed male patients duodenal ulcers treated mgday symptoms appeared months treatment regressed within month following discontinuation another small study cimetidine reported induced breast changes erectile dysfunction men treated adverse effects completely resolved cases men switched cimetidine study united kingdom general practice research database contains men found relative risk gynecomastia cimetidine users relative people taking dosage cimetidine greater equal mg showed times risk gynecomastia risk highest period time months starting gynecomastia associated cimetidine thought due blockade ars breasts results estrogen action unopposed androgens tissue although increased levels estrogens due inhibition estrogen metabolism another possible cimetidine also associated oligospermia decreased sperm count sexual dysfunction eg decreased libido erectile dysfunction men research hormonally related accordance weak nature ar antagonistic activity cimetidine shown minimal effectiveness treatment androgendependent conditions acne hirsutism excessive hair growth hyperandrogenism high androgen levels use indications cimetidine rapidly absorbed regardless route oral bioavailability cimetidine onset action cimetidine taken orally peak levels occur within cimetidine widely distributed throughout able cross barrier produce effects central nervous system eg headaches dizziness volume distribution cimetidine lkg adults lkg plasma protein binding said without pharmacological cimetidine undergoes relatively little metabolism excreted metabolized liver

drugcitation needed tagamet largely replaced proton pump inhibitors treating peptic ulcers available overthecounter medicine heartburn many evidence suggests cimetidine could effective treatment
