neurogenic bowel dysfunction nbd inability control defecation due deterioration injury nervous system resulting faecal incontinence common people spinal cord injury sci multiple sclerosis ms spina gastrointestinal tract complex control relies coordinated interaction muscular contractions neuronal faecal incontinence constipation occurs problem normal bowel functioning could variety reasons normal defecation pathway involves contractions colon order help mix contents absorb water propel contents along intestine results faeces moving colon presence stool rectum causes reflexive relaxation internal anal sphincter contents rectum move anal canal causes conscious feeling need defecate suitable time brain send signals causing external anal sphincter puborectalis muscles relax voluntary control allows defecation take spinal cord injury neurological problems mostly affect lower gi tract leading symptoms incontinence constipation however upper gi tract may also affected patients neurogenic bowel often present multiple research shows high prevalence upper abdominal complaints example study showed approximately sci patients reported feeling bloated sci patients experienced abdominal neurogenic bowel dysfunction impact persons life often leads difficulties selfesteem personal relationships social life also reduce persons also evidence studies showing faecal incontinence increase risk depression different neurological disorders affect gastrointestinal tract different ways bowel dysfunction caused spinal cord injury vary greatly depending severity level spinal cord lesion complete spinal cord injury sensory motor functions completely lost level lesion loss voluntary control loss sensation need incomplete spinal cord injury one may still sensation motor function level colorectal dysfunction due spinal cord injury classified two types upper motor neuron lesion lower motor neuron lesion problems upper motor neuron neurogenic bowel results hypertonic spastic bowel defecation reflex centre causes involuntary contraction muscles rectum anus remains however nerve damage results disruption nerve signals therefore inability relax anal sphincters defecate often leading upper motor neuron lesion one conus medullaris spinal cord therefore vertebral level hand lower motor neuron lesion cause areflexia flaccid external anal sphincter commonly leading incontinence lower motor neuron lesions damage nerves level conus medullaris vertebral level however upper lower motor neuron disorders lead constipation patients spina bifida neural tube failed completely form commonly lower back area region conus medullaris cauda equina therefore affects bowel similarly spinal cord injury affecting lower motor neuron resulting flaccid unreactive rectal wall means anal sphincter doesnt contract close therefore leading stool patients spina bifida also hydrocephalus result intellectual deficits contribute faecal variety symptoms associated condition caused loss myelin insulating layer surrounding neurones means nerve signals interrupted slower cause muscle contractions fewer irregular resulting increased colon transit faeces colon longer time mean water absorbed leading harder stools therefore increasing symptoms constipation neurological problem also lead reduced sensation rectal filling weakness anal sphincter weak muscular contraction cause stool patients multiple sclerosis constipation faecal incontinence often coexist acute chronic intermittent due fluctuating pattern damage defecation centre within medulla oblongata brain lead bowel dysfunction stroke acquired brain injury may lead damage centre brain damage defecation centre lead loss coordination rectal anal contractions also loss awareness need condition differs affects extrinsic enteric nervous systems due decreased dopamine levels results less smooth muscle contraction colon increasing colon transit reduced dopamine levels also causes dystonia striated muscles pelvic floor external anal sphincter explains parkinsons disease lead twenty percent people diabetes mellitus experience faecal incontinence due irreversible autonomic neuropathy due high blood glucose levels time damaging nerves lead impaired rectal different types neurons involved innervating lower gi tract include enteric nervous system located within wall gut extrinsic nervous system comprising sympathetic parasympathetic enteric nervous system directly controls gut motility whereas extrinsic nerve pathways influence gut contractility indirectly modifying enteric almost cases neurogenic bowel dysfunction extrinsic nervous supply affected enteric nervous supply remains intact exception parkinsons disease affect enteric extrinsic defecation involves conscious subconscious processes extrinsic nervous system damaged either affected conscious processes controlled somatic nervous system voluntary movements example contraction striated muscle external anal sphincter instructed brain sends signals along nerves innervating subconscious processes controlled autonomic nervous system involuntary movements contraction smooth muscle internal anal sphincter colon autonomic nervous system also provides sensory information could level distension within colon order correctly manage neurogenic bowel dysfunction important accurately diagnose done variety methods commonly used would taking clinical history carrying physical examinations may include abdominal neurological rectal examinations patients may use bristol stool chart help describe characterise morphological features stool useful gives indication transit objective method used evaluate motility colon help diagnosis colon transit another helpful test diagnose condition may abdominal x ray show distribution faeces show abnormalities colon example methods used diagnosis may vary depending patient incontinent constipatedcitation needed management treatment neurogenic bowel dysfunction depends symptoms biomedical diagnosis cause general practitioners often refer patients gastroenterologist effectively manage neurogenic bowel dysfunction research conducted variety therapy treatments neurogenic bowel dysfunction including diet modification laxatives magnetic electrical stimulation manual evacuation feces abdominal massage enemas pulsed irrigation evacuation efficacy studies pulsed irrigation evacuation piemed demonstrated favorable results removing stool patients used ineffective bowel routine symptomatic impaction asymptomatic severe cases neurogenic bowel dysfunction induced fecal impaction surgical interventions like colostomy used disrupt dense mass httpsenwikipediaorgwikineurogenicboweldysfunction
