aperiodic crystal contained genetic information configuration covalent chemical bonds idea stimulated enthusiasm discovering chemical basis genetic inheritance although existence form hereditary information hypothesized since role reproduction helical shape still unknown time schrödingers lecture retrospect schrödingers aperiodic crystal viewed wellreasoned theoretical prediction biologists

initial book published based lectures delivered auspices dublin institute advanced studies trinity college dublin february attended éamon de valera time although dna known constituent cell nuclei yet identified certainty molecular basis inheritance concept heredity molecule strictly theoretical various candidates one successful branches physics time statistical physics schrödinger one founding fathers quantum mechanics theory also statistical nature max delbrücks thinking physical basis life important influence however long publication life american geneticist hermann j muller would later win nobel prize article variation due change individual already laid basic properties heredity molecule yet known dna schrödinger rederived first principles life including aperiodicity molecule properties muller specified refined additionally article gene basis muller wrote letter journalistcitation needed regarding life whatever book got right hereditary molecule already published schrödingers wrong speculations muller also named two famous geneticists including delbrück knew every relevant publication contact schrödinger dna molecule heredity became foremost oswald averys bacterialtransformation experiments published experiments proteins considered likely candidates dna confirmed molecule question experiment conducted chapter schrödinger explains physical laws large scale due chaos small scale calls principle orderfromdisorder example mentions diffusion modeled highly ordered process nevertheless caused random movement atoms molecules number atoms reduced behaviour system becomes increasingly random states life greatly depends order naïve physicist may assume master code living organism consist large number atoms chapter ii iii summarizes known time hereditary mechanism importantly elaborates role mutations play biological evolution concludes carrier hereditary information small size permanent time contradicting naïve physicists expectation contradiction resolved classical physics chapter iv schrödinger presents molecules indeed stable even consist atoms solution even though molecules long known exist stability could explained classical physics due discrete nature quantum mechanics furthermore mutations directly linked quantum leaps continues explain chapter v true solids also permanent composed highly ordered crystals stability molecules crystals due principles molecule might called germ solid hand amorphous solid without crystalline structure regarded liquid high viscosity schrödinger writes heredity material likely molecule unlike crystal repeat calls aperiodic crystal aperiodic nature allows encode almost infinite number possibilities small number atoms finally compares picture known facts finds accordance chapter vi schrödinger states living matter eluding laws physics established date likely involve laws physics hitherto unknown however revealed form integral part science former anticipates statement open misconception tries clarify main principle involved orderfromdisorder second law thermodynamics according entropy increases closed system universe schrödinger explains living matter evades decay thermodynamical equilibrium homeostatically maintaining negative entropy open system chapter vii maintains orderfromorder absolutely new physics fact even simpler plausible nature follows orderfromdisorder exceptions predictable movement celestial bodies behaviour mechanical devices clocks even influenced thermal frictional forces degree system functions mechanically randomly depends temperature sufficiently heated clock melts puddle randomly moving molecules conversely temperature approaches absolute zero system behaves mechanically systems clocks approach mechanical behaviour even room temperature schrödinger concludes chapter book philosophical speculations determinism free mystery human consciousness attempts see whether draw correct noncontradictory conclusion following two premises body functions pure mechanism according laws nature yet know incontrovertible direct experience directing motions foresee effects may fateful allimportant case feel take full responsibility possible inference two facts think widest meaning word say every conscious mind ever said felt person controls motion atoms according laws nature schrödinger states insight new upanishads considered insight atman brahman represent quintessence deepest insights happenings world schrödinger rejects idea source consciousness perish body finds idea distasteful also rejects idea multiple immortal souls exist without body believes consciousness nevertheless highly dependent body schrödinger writes reconcile two premises possible alternative simply keep immediate experience consciousness singular plural unknown one thing seems plurality merely series different aspects one intuitions consciousness plural says illusions schrödinger sympathetic hindu concept brahman individuals consciousness manifestation unitary consciousness pervading universe corresponds hindu concept god schrödinger concludes person controls motion atoms according laws nature however also qualifies conclusion necessarily subjective philosophical implications final paragraph points meant collection experienced events namely canvas upon collected hypnotist succeeds blotting earlier reminiscences writes would loss personal existence ever world governed second law thermodynamics isolated systems expected approach state maximum disorder entropy irreversible state thermodynamic equilibrium free energy longer available work argued since life approaches maintains highly ordered state violates aforementioned second law implying paradox however since biosphere isolated system paradox increase order inside organism paid increase disorder outside organism loss heat environment mechanism second law obeyed life maintains highly ordered state sustains causing net increase disorder universe order increase complexity life energy needed case provided
