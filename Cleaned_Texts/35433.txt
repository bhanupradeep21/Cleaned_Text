immortal dna strand hypothesis proposed john cairns mechanism adult stem cells minimize mutations hypothesis proposes instead segregating dna mitosis random manner adult stem cells divide dna asymmetrically retain distinct template set dna strands parental strands division retaining set template dna strands adult stem cells would pass mutations arising errors dna replication nonstem cell daughters soon terminally differentiate end mitotic divisions become functional cell passing replication errors would allow adult stem cells reduce rate accumulation mutations could lead serious genetic disorders cancer although evidence mechanism exists whether mechanism acting adult stem cells vivo still controversial two main assays used detect immortal dna strand segregation labelretention labelrelease pulsechase assays labelretention assay goal mark immortal parental dna strands dna label tritiated thymidine bromodeoxyuridine brdu types dna labels incorporate newly synthesized dna dividing cells phase pulse dna label given adult stem cells conditions yet delineated immortal dna strand conditions adult stem cells either dividing symmetrically thus division new immortal strand determined least one stem cells immortal dna strand marked dna label adult stem cells yet determined thus precursors dividing symmetrically differentiate adult stem cells choose immortal strand immortal strand already marked experimentally adult stem cells undergoing symmetric divisions growth wound healing yet determined neonatal stages immortal dna strand labelled adult stem cell begun resumed asymmetric divisions dna label chased symmetric divisions mitotic cells dna segregating randomly dna label diluted levels detection five divisions however cells using immortal dna strand mechanism labeled dna continue cosegregate adult stem cell five divisions still detected within adult stem cell cells sometimes called labelretaining cells lrcs labelrelease assay goal mark newly synthesized dna normally passed daughter nonstem cell pulse dna label given adult stem cells conditions dividing asymmetrically conditions homeostasis adult stem cells dividing asymmetrically number adult stem cells maintained tissue compartment pulsing long enough label newly replicated dna dna label chased dna replication incorporates unlabeled nucleotides adult stem cells assayed loss dna label two cell divisions cells using random segregation mechanism enough dna label remain cell detected however adult stem cells using immortal dna strand mechanism obligated retain unlabeled immortal dna release newly synthesized labeled dna differentiating daughter cells two divisions scientists combined two first using one dna label label immortal strands allowing adult stem cells begin dividing asymmetrically using different dna label label newly synthesized dna thus adult stem cells retain one dna label release within two divisions evidence immortal dna strand hypothesis found various systems one earliest studies karl lark et al demonstrated cosegregation dna cells plant root plant root tips labeled tritiated thymidine tended segregate labeled dna daughter cell though labeled dna segregated daughter amount thymidinelabeled dna seen daughter less label corresponded amount would arisen sisterchromatid later studies christopher potten et al using pulsechase experiments tritiated thymidine found longterm labelretaining cells small intestinal crypts neonatal mice researchers hypothesized longterm incorporation tritiated thymidine occurred neonatal mice undeveloped small intestines pulsing tritiated thymidine soon birth mice allowed immortal dna adult stem cells labeled formation longterm cells demonstrated actively cycling demonstrated incorporation release since cells cycling continued contain brdu label dna researchers reasoned must segregating dna using immortal dna strand mechanism joshua merok et al lab james sherley engineered mammalian

brief period time using two brdu analogs label template newly synthesized dna strands saw half dividing cells regenerating muscle sort older immortal dna one daughter cell younger dna keeping stem cell hypothesis undifferentiated daughter typically inherited chromatids older dna differentiated daughter inherited younger dna experimental evidence immortal strand hypothesis sparse one study researchers incorporated tritiated thymidine dividing murine epidermal basal followed release tritiated thymidine various chase periods pattern release consistent immortal strand hypothesis although found labelretaining cells within putative stem cell compartment increasing lengths time chase periods labelretaining cells located farther putative stem cell compartment suggesting labelretaining cells moved however finding conclusive evidence immortal strand hypothesis proven difficult dna template strand segregation studied developing larval development rapid depletion older dna template strands stem cell niches retina brain using high resolution microscopy evidence asymmetric template strand segregation cell pairs found making improbable developing zebrafish asymmetric dna segregation avoids mutational burden proposed immortal strand cairns first proposed immortal dna strand mechanism theory undergone several updated refinements proposed addition using immortal dna
