environment although genetic link leading acute severe asthma still symptoms include chest tightness rapidly progressive dyspnea shortness breath dry cough use accessory respiratory muscles fast andor labored breathing extreme wheezing lifethreatening episode airway obstruction considered medical emergency complications include cardiac andor respiratory arrest increasing prevalence atopy asthma remains unexplained may due infection respiratory exacerbation attack asthma experienced worsening asthma symptoms breathlessness cough often worse night acute severe asthma breathlessness may severe

interventions include intravenous iv medications eg magnesium sulfate aerosolized medications dilate airways bronchodilation eg albuterol ipratropium bromidesalbutamol positivepressure therapy
