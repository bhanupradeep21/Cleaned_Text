vocalizing gives infant advantages increased care allows entire family coordinate activities without seeing siblings also participate infant care infant marmosets require attention family members

carrying infants backs second male carry offspring beneficial marmoset litters often twins decreases physiological cost particular male daily range pygmy marmosets however relatively small decreases rate male female pygmy marmosets show differences foraging feeding behavior although male female dominance aggressive behavior vary within species males less time search food sources forage due constraints infantcaring responsibilities predator vigilance without infant carry female pygmy marmosets greater freedom forage giving apparent feeding priority may serve compensate mothers energetic costs carrying lactating two offspring time since breeding priority also given females without offspring argument weakened instead female feeding priority may evolved sexual selection females may
