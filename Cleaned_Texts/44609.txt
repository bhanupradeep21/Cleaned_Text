apollo mission moon three days exploration lunar surface david scott james irwin command module pilot cmp al worden busy schedule observations apollo first mission carry scientific instrument module sim bay contained panoramic camera gamma ray spectrometer mapping camera laser altimeter mass spectrometer worden operate shutter lenses cameras turn various instruments coast back earth would perform eva retrieve film cassettes cameras many observations far side features seen great detail panoramic camera modified version us air forces camera spy satellites using mm lens particular camera similar used lockheed oxcart blackbird could see features small ft across lunar surface would take long strips mi km surface foot inch cm strips film course mission would take usable images exposing km film film cassette weighed lb kg camera sim bay mapping camera consisted two cameras metric camera stellar camera metric camera took square frames film covering lunar surface resolution using stellar camera r√©seau plates added familiar crosses apollo photographs data provided laser altimeter possible identify exact position lunar surface photograph taken total usable photographs produced laser altimeter could measure height csm lunar surface within one meter used pulsed ruby laser operating nanometers millijoule pulses nanoseconds duration stellar camera used runs laser altimeter night side moon would show exact position laser beam calibration altimeters results first pass landing site landing worden attempted see falcon using times magnification sextant successful refining position site great help mission planners would help refine planning traverses scott irwin also help photographic interpretation surface another experiment performed apollo involved using radio signal endeavour termed downlink bistatic radar experiment find dielectric constant surface material near side pass worden eating dinner spacecraft oriented radio signal would reflect moon received earth strength signal varies angle incidence brewsters angle signal weakest function dielectric constant going sleep worden orientated spacecraft best various experiments sim bay specifically spectrometers gammaray spectrometer detected radiation energies mev mev gamma ray passed cylinder doped sodium iodide would emit light would detected photomultiplier tube another photomultiplier tube detected charged particles passed plastic shield around cylinder end ft boom would deployed retracted periodically mission sat end boom would contaminated spacecraft alpha particle spectrometer measured alpha particles emitted surface specifically gaseous optimized detect particles energies mev built casing xray spectrometer xray spectrometer used investigate properties upper layers lunar surface solar xrays strike surface cause elements fluoresce xrays well defined energies spectrometer could measure determine composition lunar surface wordens first full day solo operations much previous day spent much time switching various experiments acquiring photographs targets interest lunar surface even one day orbit mission scientists extremely pleased data returned spectrometers however due orbital mechanics would get data part moon along orbital track six days lunar orbit moon rotated spacecrafts orbit inclined small amount lunar surface actually covered ideally scientists mission would placed polar orbit month could observe entire lunar surface lunar scientists particularly interested rocks higher concentrations samarium uranium thorium potassium phosphorus gave rocks acronym kreep potassium atomic symbol k rare earth elements ree phosphorus p gammaray spectrometer designed detect types rocks found apollo apollo landing sites apollo site km east apollo site time apollo scientists interested whether kreep rocks found moon region around believed kreeps represent last chemical remnants magma ocean lunar crust formed kreeps floated surface component elements incompatible incorporate compact crystal structures late results lunar prospectors gamma ray spectrometer shows kreepcontaining rocks concentrated mare imbrium rim near side maria highlands near imbrium mare ingenii south poleaitken basin distributed lower level highlands distribution seen lunar prospector supports idea impact formed mare imbrium excavated kreeprich rocks ejected moon south poleaitken basin impact also exposed kreeprich material one personal things worden mission greeted mission control reappearing behind moon orbit farouk elbaz decided use phrase hello earth greetings endeavour different languages ranging arabic spanish problems developed panoramic camera used called voverh sensor measure motion surface beneath worked move camera compensate motion beginning sensor begun play images without blurring would affect camera greatly annoyance one targets particular interest crater aristarchus jim greenacre saw reddish glow region confirmed four observers including thendirector lowell observatory apollo first manned spacecraft pass site time direct sunlight illuminated light reflected earth earthshine worden see glows even though described bright earthshine almost bright seems like sunshine bright crater regular task crew exercise found even short duration flights crews became weakened due lack gravity exergym bungee cord crew would pull keep shoulders arms strong worden would also fold away center couch jog stop exercises crew found could position bulkhead couches kneebends arms technical debrief end mission crew said although planned equal amounts exercise worden twice much weightlessness entire mission two would spend three days onesixth gravity moon pass littrow region worden reported seeing small almost irregular shaped cones said looked like cinder cones observation would become one main reasons going apollo would turn one cinder cones impact crater visited gene cernan harrison schmitt apollo fact seeing young craters dark ejecta blankets evidence emerge volcanic activity shorty orange soil found composed orange glass beads sprayed molten fumarole fire fountain billion years ago third day solo lunar orbit worden began problems mass spectrometer located end boom deployed retracted periodically throughout mission frequently instruments cm indicating failed retract get retract properly cycle retractdeploy switch several times eva return earth inspected housing found guide pins barely coming guide slot found problems retraction always occurred housing shadow spacecraft would retract fully sunlight caused motor stalling implying parts boom deformed thermal expansion stop occurring several modifications made instruments used apollo apollo hours launch worden position spacecraft could take photographs region sky opposite sun hopes seeing gegenschein faint glow thought caused tiny particles interplanetary medium reflecting light back observer due aiming errors useful data returned nonlunar targets zodiacal light corona sun fourth solo day extremely busy one crews scott irwin fivehour leva liftoff moon worden would perform rendezvous docking lm worden perform plane change burn three days orbital path endeavour drifted longer passed landing site without burn rendezvous would complicated burn sps coming endeavour reappeared behind moon orbit worden attempted make sighting falcon surface done provide accurate information new orbit csm help upcoming rendezvous however difficulty due sun risen higher making relief much less surface much brighter
