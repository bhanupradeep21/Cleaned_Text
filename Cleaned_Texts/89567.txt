effective placebo observation without intervention oral propranolol subsequently become firstline systemic medical therapy treatment since time topical timolol maleate addition oral propranalol become common therapy infantile hemangiomas according cochrane therapies demonstrated beneficial effects terms clearance hemangiomas without increase harms addition difference detected two agents ability

tufted interferonalpha given subcutaneous injection shown efficacy may result spastic diplegia treated agents rarely used era betablocker therapy intralesional corticosteroid usually triamcinolone injection used small localized hemangiomas demonstrated relatively safe injection upper eyelid hemangiomas controversial given reported risk retinal embolization possibly related high injection
