february commencement randomized controlled trial zmapp conducted liberia united march november individuals infected ebola virus enrolled trial investigators stopped enrolling new subjects january failed reach enrollment goal due waning ebola outbreak result although lower risk death calculated received zmapp difference statistically significant ultimately could determined whether use zmapp
