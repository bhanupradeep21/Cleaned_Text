inotropehelp inotropic drug substance alters force energy muscular contractions negatively inotropic agents weaken force muscular contractions positively inotropic agents increase strength muscular contraction term inotropic state commonly used reference various drugs affect strength contraction heart muscle however also refer pathological conditions example enlarged heart muscle increase inotropic state whereas dead heart muscle decrease positive negative inotropes used management various cardiovascular conditions choice agent depends largely specific pharmacological effects individual agents respect condition one important factors affecting inotropic state level calcium cytoplasm muscle cell positive inotropes usually increase level negative inotropes decrease however positive negative drugs affect calcium release among mechanism manipulating calcium level differ drug drug often recommended vasopressors given central line due risk local tissue injury medication enters local tissues likely safe given less two hours good peripheral intravenous increasing concentration intracellular calcium increasing sensitivity receptor proteins calcium positive inotropic agents increase myocardial concentrations intracellular calcium increased increasing influx cell stimulating release sarcoplasmic cell calcium pass one two channels ltype calcium channel longlasting ttype calcium channel transient channels respond voltage changes across membrane differently ltype channels respond higher membrane potentials open slowly remain open longer ttype channels properties ltype channels important sustaining action potential ttype channels important initiating increasing intracellular calcium via action ltype channels action potential sustained longer therefore contractility increases positive inotropes used support cardiac function conditions decompensated congestive heart failure cardiogenic shock septic shock myocardial infarction cardiomyopathy examples positive inotropic agents includecitation needed negative inotropic agents decrease myocardial contractility used decrease cardiac workload conditions angina negative inotropism may precipitate exacerbate heart failure short term certain beta blockers eg carvedilol bisoprolol metoprolol believed reduce longterm morbidity mortality congestive heart examples negative inotropic agents include class ia antiarrhythmics class ic antiarrhythmics httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinotrope
