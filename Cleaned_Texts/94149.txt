traumatic brain injury tbi physical trauma brain cause variety complications health effects tbi result risk complications increases severity however even mild traumatic brain injury result disabilities interfere social interactions employment everyday tbi cause variety problems including physical cognitive emotional behavioral complications symptoms may occur concussion minor form traumatic brain injury referred postconcussion syndrome generally six abnormal states consciousness result tbi disorders consciousness affect significant number people severe tbi severe tbi discharged hospital vegetative state number half regain consciousness within one three patients severe tbi recover consciousness experience cognitive disabilities including loss many higherlevel mental skills cognitive deficits follow tbi include impaired attention disrupted insight judgement thought reduced processing speed distractibility deficits executive functions abstract reasoning planning problemsolving memory loss common cognitive impairment among headinjured people occurs people closed head trauma depending posttraumatic amnesia pta confusional state impaired characterized loss specific memories partial inability form store new alzheimers disease ad progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized dementia memory loss deteriorating cognitive abilities research suggests association head injury early adulthood development ad later life severe head injury greater risk developing evidence indicates head injury may interact factors trigger disease may hasten onset disease individuals already risk example headinjured people particular form protein apolipoprotein e naturally occurring protein helps transport cholesterol bloodstream fall increased risk patients moderate severe tbi problems cognitive deficits mild tbi several mild tbis may additive effect one five career boxers affected chronic traumatic brain injury ctbi causes cognitive behavioral physical dementia pugilistica also called chronic traumatic encephalopathy severe form caused repetitive blows head long period condition primarily affects career boxers recently linked contact sports including american football ice hockey well military servicesee ann mckee commonly manifests dementia declining mental ability memory problems parkinsonism tremors lack symptoms begin anywhere years start boxing career average onset years language communication problems common disabilities tbi patients may experience aphasia difficulty understanding producing spoken written language may difficulty subtle aspects communication body language emotional nonverbal signals may problems intonation inflection called prosodic dysfunction problems spoken language may occur part brain controls speech muscles damaged disorder called dysarthria patient think appropriate language easily speak words unable use muscles needed form words produce sounds speech often slow slurred tbi patients may sensory problems especially problems vision may able register seeing may slow recognize objects also tbi patients often difficulty coordination causing seem clumsy unsteady sensory deficits include problems hearing smell taste touch tinnitus ringing roaring ears may occur person damage part brain processes taste smell may perceive persistent bitter taste noxious smell damage part brain controls sense touch may cause tbi patient develop persistent skin tingling itching pain conditions rare difficult tbi may cause emotional behavioral problems changes emotional symptoms follow tbi include emotional instability depression anxiety hypomania mania apathy irritability tbi appears predispose person psychiatric disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder alcohol substance abuse substance dependence dysthymia clinical depression bipolar disorder phobias panic disorder one quarter people tbi develop clinical depression experience prevalence psychiatric illnesses moderate severe tbi mild tbi within year injury compared people tbi continue greater risk psychiatric problems others even years problems may persist two years injury include irritability suicidal ideation insomnia loss ability experience pleasure previously enjoyable behavioral symptoms follow tbi include disinhibition inability control anger impulsiveness lack initiative inappropriate sexual activity changes different behavioral problems characteristic location injury instance frontal lobe injuries often result disinhibition inappropriate childish behavior temporal lobe injuries often cause irritability pain especially headache common complication following unconscious lying still long periods cause blood clots form deep venous thrombosis cause pulmonary serious complications patients unconscious coma vegetative state include pressure sores pneumonia infections progressive multiple organ risk posttraumatic seizures increases severity trauma image right particularly elevated certain types brain trauma cerebral contusions many people penetrating head injuries develop people early seizures occurring within week injury increased risk posttraumatic epilepsy recurrent seizures occurring week initial though seizures appear decade initial injury common seizure type may also change time generally medical professionals use anticonvulsant medications treat seizures tbi patients within first week injury seizures persist neurostorms may occur severe tbi lower glasgow coma score gcs higher chance neurostorming neurostorms occur patients autonomic nervous system ans central nervous system cns sympathetic nervous system sns parasympathetic nervous system psns become severely turn create following potential lifethreatening symptoms increased intracranial pressure icp tachycardia tremors seizures fevers increased blood pressure increased cerebral spinal fluid csf variety medication may used help decrease control neurostorm parkinsons disease motor problems result tbi rare occur parkinsons disease chronic progressive disorder may develop years tbi result damage basal ganglia movement disorders may develop tbi include tremor ataxia uncoordinated muscle movements myoclonus shocklike contractions skull fractures tear meninges membranes cover brain leading leaks cerebrospinal fluid csf tear dura arachnoid membranes called csf fistula cause csf leak subarachnoid space subdural space called subdural csf also leak nose ear tears also allow bacteria cavity potentially causing infections meningitis pneumocephalus occurs air enters intracranial cavity becomes trapped subarachnoid space infections within intracranial cavity dangerous complication tbi may occur outside dura mater dura arachnoid meningitis within brain abscess injuries develop within weeks initial trauma result skull fractures penetrating injuries standard treatment involves antibiotics sometimes surgery remove infected injuries base skull damage nerves emerge directly brain cranial nerves cranial nerve damage may result hydrocephalus posttraumatic ventricular enlargement occurs csf accumulates brain resulting dilation cerebral ventricles increase icp condition develop acute stage tbi may appear later generally occurs within first year injury characterized worsening neurological outcome impaired consciousness behavioral changes ataxia lack coordination balance incontinence signs elevated damage head brain usually results damage vascular system provides blood cells brain body repair small blood vessels damage larger ones result serious complications damage one major arteries leading brain cause stroke either bleeding artery formation blood clot site injury blocking blood flow brain blood clots also develop parts head types vascular complications include vasospasm blood vessels constrict restrict blood flow formation aneurysms side blood vessel weakens balloons fluid hormonal imbalances also complicate treatment hormonal problems result dysfunction
