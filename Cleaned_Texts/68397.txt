maslows hierarchy needs idea psychology proposed american psychologist abraham maslow paper theory human motivation journal psychological maslow subsequently extended idea include observations humans innate curiosity theories parallel many theories human developmental psychology focus describing stages growth humans theory classification system intended reflect universal needs society base proceeding acquired hierarchy needs split deficiency needs growth needs two key themes involved within theory individualism prioritization needs theory usually shown pyramid illustrations maslow never created pyramid represent hierarchy hierarchy needs psychological idea also assessment tool particularly education healthcare social hierarchy remains popular framework example sociology research management higher moreover hierarchy needs used study humans intrinsically partake behavioral motivation maslow used terms physiological safety belonging love social needs esteem selfactualization transcendence describe pattern human needs motivations generally move means according theory motivation arise next stage prior stage must satisfied individual hierarchy used explain effort motivation correlated context human behavior individual levels contains certain amount internal sensation must met order individual complete goal maslows hierarchy attain level stage although widely used researched maslows hierarchy needs lacks conclusive supporting evidence validity theory remains contested one criticism original theory revised newer versions theory original hierarchy states lower level must completely satisfied fulfilled moving onto higher pursuit evidence suggest levels continuously overlap maslows hierarchy needs often portrayed shape pyramid largest fundamental needs bottom need selfactualization transcendence top words idea individuals basic needs must met become motivated achieve higherlevel despite fact ideas behind hierarchy maslows pyramid exist anywhere maslows original fundamental four layers pyramid contain maslow called deficiency needs dneeds esteem friendship love security physical needs deficiency needs met except fundamental physiological need may physical indication individual feel anxious tense deprivation causes deficiency one unmet needs motivates fulfill maslows idea suggests basic level needs must met individual strongly desire focus motivation upon secondary higherlevel needs maslow also coined term metamotivation describe motivation people go beyond scope basic needs strive constant human brain complex system parallel processes running time thus many different motivations various levels maslows hierarchy occur time maslow spoke clearly levels satisfaction terms relative general primarily instead stating individual focuses certain need given time maslow stated certain need dominates human thus maslow acknowledged likelihood different levels motivation could occur time human mind focused identifying basic types motivation order would tend physiological needs base hierarchy needs biological component human survival according maslows hierarchy needs physiological needs factored internal motivation according maslows theory humans compelled satisfy physiological needs first pursue higher levels intrinsic advance higherlevel needs maslows hierarchy physiological needs must met first means person struggling
