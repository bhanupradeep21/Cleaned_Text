assortative mating also referred positive assortative mating homogamy mating pattern form sexual selection individuals similar phenotypes genotypes mate one another frequently would expected random mating majority phenotypes subject assortative mating body size visual signals eg color pattern sexually selected traits crest opposite assortative disassortative mating several hypotheses proposed explain phenomenon assortative assortative mating evolved combination different factors vary across different assortative mating respect body size arise consequence intrasexual competition species size correlated fecundity females therefore males choose mate larger females larger males defeating smaller males courting examples species display type assortative mating include jumping spider phidippus clarus leaf beetle diaprepes cases larger females better equipped resist male courtship attempts largest males able mate themcitation needed assortative mating times arise consequence social competition traits certain individuals may indicate competitive ability allows occupy best territories individuals similar traits occupy similar territories likely mate one another scenario assortative mating necessarily arise choice rather proximity noted western bluebirds although definite evidence major factor resulting color dependent assortative mating different factors may apply simultaneously result assortative mating given speciescitation needed assortative mating animals observed respect body size color sizerelated assortative mating prevalent across many species vertebrates invertebrates found simultaneous hermaphrodites land snail bradybaena pellucida one reason occurrence reciprocal intromission ie individuals provide male female gametes single mating happens species therefore individuals similar body size pair one another facilitate exchange moreover known larger individuals hermaphroditic species produce eggs mutual mate choice another factor leading assortative mating evidence sizerelated assortative mating also found mangrove snail littoraria ardouiniana japanese common toad bufo second common type assortative mating occurs respect coloration type assortative mating common socially monogamous bird species eastern bluebirds sialia sialis western bluebirds sialia mexicana species brightly colored males mated brightly colored females less brightly colored individuals paired one another eastern bluebirds also mate assortatively territorial aggression due fierce competition limited number nesting sites tree swallows two highly aggressive individuals better equipped protect nest encouraging assortative mating assortative mating respect two common color morphs striped unstriped also exists polymorphic population eastern redbacked salamanders plethodon assortative mating also found many socially monogamous species birds monogamous species often involved biparental care offspring since males equally invested offspring mother genders expected display mate choice phenomenon termed mutual mate choice mutual mate choice occurs males females searching mate maximize fitness birds female male ornamentation indicate better overall condition individuals might better genes better suited assortative mating humans widely observed studied broken two types human assortative mating arecitation needed genetic assortative mating well studied documented pearson colleagues reported strong correlations height span arms length left forearm husband wife assortative mating regards appearance end males prefer female faces resemble provided images three women one image modified resemble however result apply females selecting male genetically related individuals cousin level exhibit higher fitness unrelated assortative mating based genomic similarities plays role human marriages united states spouses genetically similar two randomly chosen probability marriage increases roughly every increase genetic similarity however researchers argue assortative mating caused purely population stratification fact people likely marry within ethnic subgroups time individuals display disassortative mating genes major histocompatibility complex region chromosome individuals feel attracted odors individuals genetically different region promotes mhc heterozygosity children making less vulnerable pathogens apart humans disassortative mating regards mhc coding region widely studied mice also reported occur addition genetic assortative mating humans also demonstrate patterns assortative mating based sociological factors well sociological assortative mating typically broken three categories mate choice based socioeconomic status mate choice based racial ethnic background mate choice based religious assortative mating based socioeconomic status broadest general categories includes tendency humans prefer mate within socioeconomic peers similar social standing job prestige educational attainment economic background tendency always present society historical area individuals preferred sort actually sorted negatively couples matched randomly along still tendency weaker generations others instance century western world late boomers weaker aggregate preferences educational homogamy early boomers young adults also members early generationx typically much less picky spousal education members late generationx trend evidenced search criteria online dating site another form sociological assortative mating assortative mating based racial ethnic background mentioned context genetically similar preferring mate one another form assortative mating take many varied complicated forms tendency mentioned exist people tend marry genetically similar especially within racial ethnic group trend change various ways common example barriers intermarriage general population experienced minority population decrease numbers minority population increase assimilation reduces prevalence form assortative mating however growth minority population necessarily lead decreased barriers intermarriage seen sharp increase nonwhite hispanic population united states correlated sharp decrease percentage nonwhite hispanics intermarrying general religious assortative mating tendency individuals marry within religious group tendency prevalent observable changes according three main factors first proportion available spouses area already follow religion person searching mate areas religious beliefs already similar people always high degrees religious inbreeding second social distance intermarrying religious groups physical proximity social interactivity groups finally third factor personal views one holds towards marrying outside religion greatly value adherence religious tradition may likely averse marrying across religious although necessarily religious good example humans mating assortatively based belief structure found tendency humans marry based levels charitable giving couples show similarities terms contributions public betterment charities attributed mate choice based generosity rather phenotypic assortative mating also seems widespread among people mental assortative mating reproductive consequences positive assortative mating increases genetic relatedness within family whereas negative assortative mating accomplishes opposite effect either strategy may employed individuals species depending upon strategy maximizes fitness enables individuals maximally pass genes next generation instance case eastern bluebirds assortative mating territorial aggression increases probability parents obtaining securing nest site offspring turn increases likelihood survival offspring consequently fitness birds whose coloration represents well fecundity bird positive assortative mating color increases chances genes passed offspring good condition also positive assortative mating behavioral traits allows efficient communication individuals cooperate better raise offspringcitation needed hand mating individuals genotypes similar allows accumulation harmful recessive alleles decrease fitness mating genetically similar individuals termed inbreeding result emergence autosomal recessive disorders moreover assortative mating aggression birds lead inadequate parental care alternate strategy disassortative mating one individual aggressive guards nest site individual nurturing fosters young however risks breakdown coadapted gene complexes leading outbreeding depression division labor increases chances survival offspring classic example case whitethroated sparrow zonotrichia albicollis bird exhibits two color morphs white striped tan striped sexes white striped birds aggressive territorial whereas tan striped birds engaged providing parental care therefore disassortative mating birds allows efficient division labor terms raising protecting offspringcitation needed positive assortative mating key element leading reproductive isolation within species turn may result speciation sympatry time sympatric speciation defined evolution new species without geographical isolation speciation assortative mating occurred middle east blind mole rat cicadas european corn borercitation needed like animals humans also display genetic results assortative mating makes humans unique however tendency towards seeking mates similar genetics appearances similar economically socially educationally culturally tendencies toward using sociological characteristics select mate many effects lives livelihoods choose marry one another well children future generations within generation assortative mating sometimes cited source inequality mate assortatively would marry people similar station thus amplifying current debate however whether growing preference educational occupational similarities spouses due increased preferences traits shift workload occurred women entered concentration wealth families also perpetuates across generations parents pass wealth children successive generation inheriting resources parents combined resources parents allow give child better life growing combined inheritances parents place even greater advantage would superior education childhoods enormous impact development social economic structure related concept assortative matching developed within economics relates efficiencies
