reference genome also known reference assembly digital nucleic acid sequence database assembled scientists representative example set genes one idealized individual organism species assembled sequencing dna number individual donors reference genomes accurately represent set genes single individual organism instead reference provides haploid mosaic different dna sequences donor example one recent human reference genomes assembly derived genomic clone reference genomes multiple species viruses bacteria fungus plants animals reference genomes typically used guide new genomes built enabling assembled much quickly cheaply initial human genome project reference genomes accessed online several locations using dedicated browsers ensembl ucsc genome length genome measured multiple different ways simple way measure genome length count number base pairs golden path alternative measure length omits redundant regions haplotypes pseudoautosomal usually constructed layering sequencing information physical map combine scaffold information best estimate genome look like typically includes gaps making longer typical base pair reference genomes assembly requires reads overlapping creating contigs contiguous dna regions consensus gaps contigs filled scaffolding either contigs amplification pcr sequencing bacterial artificial chromosome bac filling gaps always possible case multiple scaffolds created reference scaffolds classified types placed whose chromosome genomic coordinates orientations known unlocalised chromosome known coordinates orientation unplaced whose chromosome number contigs scaffolds well average lengths relevant parameters among many others reference genome assembly quality assessment since provide information continuity final mapping original genome smaller number scaffolds per chromosome single scaffold occupies entire chromosome greater continuity genome related parameters length contigsscaffolds assembly found fragments length greater number contigsscaffolds whose length higher value lower value vice versa indicating high continuity human mouse reference genomes maintained improved genome reference consortium grc
