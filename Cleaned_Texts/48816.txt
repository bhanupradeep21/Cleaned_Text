orthostatic hypotension also known postural medical condition wherein persons blood pressure drops standing sitting primary orthostatic hypotension also often referred neurogenic orthostatic drop blood pressure may sudden vasovagal orthostatic hypotension within minutes classic orthostatic hypotension gradual delayed orthostatic defined fall systolic blood pressure least mmhg diastolic blood pressure least mmhg mins standing occurs predominantly delayed absent constriction lower body blood vessels normally required maintain adequate blood pressure changing position standing result blood pools blood vessels legs longer period less returned heart thereby leading reduced cardiac output inadequate blood flow brain mild occasional orthostatic hypotension common occur briefly anyone although prevalent particular among elderly known low blood pressure severe drops blood pressure lead fainting possibility injury moderate drops blood pressure cause confusioninattention delirium episodes ataxia chronic orthostatic hypotension associated cerebral hypoperfusion may accelerate pathophysiology whether causative factor dementia numerous possible causes orthostatic hypotension include certain medications eg alpha blockers autonomic neuropathy decreased blood volume multiple system atrophy agerelated bloodvessel stiffness apart addressing underlying cause orthostatic hypotension may treated recommendation increase salt water intake increase blood volume wearing compression stockings sometimes medication fludrocortisone midodrine others salt loading dramatic increases salt intake must supervised doctor cause severe neurological problems done aggressively orthostatic hypotension characterized symptoms occur standing lying sitting particularly done rapidly many report lightheadedness feeling one might faint sometimes severe even actual fainting associated fall chronic orthostatic hypotension condition effects may worsen even fainting many symptoms become less frequent generalized weakness tiredness may also occur also report difficulty concentrating blurred vision tremulousness vertigo anxiety palpitations awareness heartbeat unsteadiness feeling sweaty clammy sometimes nausea person may look people may experience severe orthostatic hypotension symptoms confusion extreme fatigue chronic severe orthostatic hypotension may present fluctuating cognitiondeliriumcitation needed women pregnant also susceptible orthostatic disorder may associated addisons disease atherosclerosis buildup fatty deposits arteries diabetes pheochromocytoma certain neurological disorders including autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy multiple system atrophy forms dysautonomia also associated syndrome anorexia nervosa also present many patients parkinsons disease lewy body dementias resulting sympathetic denervation heart side effect dopaminomimetic therapy rarely leads fainting unless person developed true autonomic failure unrelated heart problemcitation needed another disease dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency also thought underdiagnosed causes loss sympathetic noradrenergic function characterized low extremely low levels norepinephrine excess quadriplegics paraplegics also might experience symptoms due multiple systems inability maintain normal blood pressure blood flow upper part bodycitation needed causes orthostatic hypotension include neurodegenerative disorders low blood volume eg caused dehydration bleeding use diuretics drugs cause vasodilation types drugs notably narcotics marijuana discontinuation vasoconstrictors prolonged bed rest immobility significant recent weight loss vitamin deficiency recent bariatric orthostatic hypotension side effect certain antidepressants monoamine oxidase inhibitors marijuana tetrahydrocannabinol occasion produce marked orthostatic alcohol potentiate orthostatic hypotension point orthostatic hypotension also side effect blockers adrenergic blocking agents blockers inhibit vasoconstriction normally initiated baroreceptor reflex upon postural change subsequent drop antihypertensive medications may also cause orthostatic hypotension addition anticholinergics dopaminergic drugs opiates psychoactive patients prone orthostatic hypotension elderly post partum mothers bed rest people anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa often develop orthostatic hypotension common side effect consuming alcohol may also lead orthostatic hypotension due dehydrating effectscitation needed orthostatic hypotension happens gravity causes blood pool lower extremities turn compromises venous return resulting decreased cardiac output subsequent lowering arterial pressure example changing lying position standing loses ml blood thorax decrease systolic diastolic blood overall effect insufficient blood perfusion upper part bodycitation needed normally series cardiac vascular neurologic muscular neurohumoral responses occurs quickly blood pressure fall much one response vasoconstriction baroreceptor reflex pressing blood body often mechanism exaggerated diastolic blood pressure bit higher person standing compared person horizontal position therefore factor inhibits one responses causes greater normal fall blood pressure required factors include low blood volume diseases medicationscitation needed orthostatic hypotension confirmed measuring persons blood pressure lying flat minutes minute standing minutes orthostatic hypotension defined fall systolic blood pressure least mmhg diastolic blood pressure least mmhg supine reading upright reading also heart rate measured positions significant increase heart rate supine standing may indicate compensatory effort heart maintain cardiac output related syndrome postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome pots diagnosed least bpm increase heart rate occurs little change blood pressure tilt table test may also orthostatic hypotension postural hypotension drop blood pressure upon standing one definition aafp calls systolic blood pressure decrease least mm hg diastolic blood pressure decrease least mm hg within minutes common first symptom lightheadedness upon standing possibly followed severe symptoms narrowing loss vision dizziness weakness even syncope faintingcitation needed orthostatic hypotension subcategorized three groups initial classic initial orthostatic hypotension frequently characterized systolic blood pressure decrease mmhg diastolic blood pressure decrease mmhg within seconds blood pressure spontaneously rapidly returns normal period hypotension symptoms short continuous beattobeat bp measurement active standingup maneuver document classic orthostatic hypotension frequently characterized systolic blood pressure decrease mmhg diastolic blood pressure decrease mmhg seconds min delayed orthostatic hypotension frequently characterized sustained systolic blood pressure decrease mm hg sustained diastolic blood pressure decrease mm hg beyond minutes standing upright tilt table apart treating underlying reversible causes eg stopping reducing certain medications treating autoimmune causes several measures improve symptoms orthostatic hypotension prevent episodes syncope fainting even small increases blood pressure may sufficient maintain blood flow brain dysautonomic patients diagnosis high blood pressure drinking liters fluid day taking g salt improve symptoms maximizing amount fluid another strategy keeping head bed slightly elevated reduces return fluid limbs kidneys night thereby reducing nighttime urine production maintaining fluid various measures used improve return blood heart wearing compression stockings exercises physical counterpressure maneuvers pcms undertaken standing eg leg crossing medication midodrine benefit people orthostatic main side effect piloerection goose fludrocortisone also used although based limited droxidopa shown effective mostly mild side effects number measures slight evidence support use indomethacin fluoxetine dopamine antagonists metoclopramide domperidone monoamine oxidase inhibitors tyramine produce severe hypertension oxilofrine potassium chloride robotic devices erigo medical device proven help orthostatic hypotension patients machines adjust patients position degrees degrees progressive increments allowing blood pressure adjust orthostatic hypotension may cause accidental also linked increased risk cardiovascular disease heart failure also observational data suggest orthostatic hypotension middle age increases risk eventual dementia
