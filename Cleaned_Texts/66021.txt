matriphagy consumption mother behavior generally takes place within first weeks life documented species insects nematode worms pseudoscorpions arachnids well caecilian specifics matriphagy occurs varies among different species however process best described desert spider stegodyphus lineatus mother harbors nutritional resources young food consumption mother regurgitate small portions food

drums frequently keep offspring however relentlessly continue attempting get onto mother feels ready presses body onto offspring allows consume via sucking consume also release poison body causing quick mothers body kept weeks nutritional interestingly matriphagy species dependent developmental stage offspring currently offspring older four days given unrelated mother refuse consume however younger offspring given unrelated mother readily consume additionally mother loses offspring able produce another clutch mothers one particular australian species crab spider australomisidia ergandros

desert spider stegodyphus lineatus rely solely upon mother provide food nutrients mother regurgitating bodily fluids contain mixture nutrients feed behavior begins mating mating causes increase
