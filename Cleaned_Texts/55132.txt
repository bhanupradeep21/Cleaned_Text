industry funding academic research united states one two major sources research funding academia along government support currently private funding research accounts majority research development funding united states overall federal industrial sources contribute similar amounts research industry funds vast majority development majority industry research performed inhouse major portion private research funding directed research nonprofit academic industrial sources accounted estimated billion academic research funding however little governmental oversight tracking industry funding academic science figures scale industry research often estimated selfreporting surveys somewhat unreliable much industry funding academic research directed toward applied research however accounts industry may even fund basic research united states federal funding basic research falling although figure consider research role funding academic research industrial sources received much attention historical contemporary practice received extensive political praise scholarly criticismcitation needed research us prior world war ii heavily relied funding private sources without major organized federal research programs either scientists associates personal funds wwii governmental investment research widely regarded major contributor military success support research politically following federal research funding europe us increased terms relative percent funding research absolute overall growth industrial research funding greatly outpaced public research funding growth us governmental research funding increasing average annually industrial research funding increased average annually since industry funding science consistently represented second largest source funding academic industry funding academic science expand following passing act variety state federal proposals increase funding joint industry academic small retraction industry funding academic science overall industry rd funding however industry funding may broadening scope industry funding basic science increasing dramatically period much funding remains culturally attitudes towards industrial funding academic research changed time within universities commercial activities industry funding often spurned recently commercializing scientific activity viewed favorably extensive political university support translating scientific discovery economic output however within research community public industrial funding research remains controversial universality tangled industry academic governmental exchange funding research adventures led researchers term model rd triple universityindustry partnerships take variety forms smallest scale individual research labs researchers partner industry sources funding details partnerships differ substantially number motives ranging academic lab testing previously developed products performing early stage basic research related industry research objectives even individual researchers supporting salary consulting related research problems many partnerships exist due informal nature resulting lack record difficult track extensive impactful relationships relying surveys selfreporting measures closest approximation according research value mapping survey academics major us research universities report receive grants industry sources supporting far extensively many fields countries narrow majority academic scientists report soft industry relationships primarily informal industry academic relationships longstanding tradition served major source funding individual labs prior many cases expected researchers would pursue relationships expected major source funding researcher despite greatly expanded federal support research called soft money salary support industry remains large growing aspect academic research larger scale numerous attempts create collaborative universityindustry research centers uircs jointly host academic industry researchers address industry problems direct large scale collaborative centers early forms uircs started formation research parks industry sponsors multiple proposals federal level us help fund expand early uircs however funding fell multiple first uircs experienced difficulties bridging differences academic industrial culture one attempt occurred cal tech cal tech researchers partnered xerox ibm silicon structures industry academic partners concerned cultures found structure frustrations difficult secure partners continue expanding uircscitation needed late rpi created two three new

unprecedented industry centers generally regarded highly successful made expansion governmental support joint industry academic ventures favorable early states began contributing funding uircs industryacademic partnerships encourage local economic growth innovation federal government expanded financial support mixed governmental industry support uircs likely successful time successful governmentally funded uircs could become independent government support demonstrable successes could continue incentivize industry contribute funding uircs coupled early seeding state federal government continued greatly expand early eventually receiving nearly industry funding academic research incentivizing tripling industry funding academic research contract research also drawn increasing industry funding particularly contract research organizations cros biotech pharmaceutical contract research popular form outsourcing research industry industry influence study conducted either uircs traditional academic grants cros specifically designed function drawn substantial industry clinical research funding away academia growing much discussion placed effects industrial research funding behavior academic research scientists concerns center whether researchers remain impartial funded forprofit potentially motivated industrial source funding gives private sources oversized impact research directions pursued potential negative effects industrial funding openness multitude studies found pharmaceutical studies funded industry organizations significantly likely publish results favor product could part due fact usually academic accepts industry funding particularly working existing product researchers sign nondisclosure agreements often prevent publication negative results inhibit openness could serve significantly bias scientific results diminish public trust sciencecitation needed additionally many scholars considered advantages industrially funded academic research generally increased industry funding may increase academic industry interaction prompting greater efficiency translating commercializing science research increased commercialization activity academics could serve economic societal boost economy could bolstered new products hitting market society could benefit directly increased access fruits scientific production supporting academic science funded industry sources result patents per dollar increased licensing patents even citations per published paper research supported sources including federal university california germany also appears applied research funded industry sources results significant increase patent citations could correspond serious increase translation applied increase commercialization translation research could provide social economic however difficult determine whether increase apparent impact due industry funding read industry funds target work tends produce citations per publication well
