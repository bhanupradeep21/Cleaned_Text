reproduce sexually asexually different species may able reproduce one planarians hermaphrodites sexual reproduction mating generally involves mutual insemination thus one gametes combine gamete another planarian planarian transports secretion planarian giving receiving sperm eggs develop inside body shed capsules weeks later eggs hatch grow adults asexual reproduction planarian fissions fragment regenerates missing tissues generating complete anatomy restoring asexual reproduction similar regeneration following injury requires neoblasts adult stem cells proliferate produce

planarian exclusively asexual whereas reproduce sexually cases sexual reproduction involve two individuals auto fecundation rarely reported eg cura neoblasts abundant adult stem cells found planarian parenchyma across planarian small round cells µm characterized large nucleus surrounded little neoblasts required regenerating missing tissues organs continuously replenish tissues producing new neoblasts selfrenew generate progenitors different cell types contrast adult vertebrate stem cells eg hematopoietic stem cell neoblasts pluripotent ie producing somatic cell moreover give rise
