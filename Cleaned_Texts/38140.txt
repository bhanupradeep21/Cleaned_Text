acute kidney injury aki previously called acute renal failure sudden decrease kidney function develops within shown increase serum creatinine decrease urine output causes aki classified either prerenal due decreased blood flow kidney intrinsic renal due damage kidney postrenal due blockage urine prerenal causes aki include sepsis dehydration excessive blood loss cardiogenic shock heart failure cirrhosis certain medications like ace inhibitors intrinsic renal causes aki include glomerulonephritis lupus nephritis acute tubular necrosis certain antibiotics chemotherapeutic postrenal causes aki include kidney stones bladder cancer neurogenic bladder enlargement prostate narrowing urethra certain medications like diagnosis aki made based persons signs symptoms along lab tests serum creatinine measurement urine output tests include urine microscopy urine electrolytes renal ultrasound obtained postrenal cause suspected kidney biopsy may obtained intrinsic renal aki suspected cause aki seen people admitted hospital people admitted intensive care unit aki may lead number complications including metabolic acidosis high potassium levels uremia changes body fluid balance effects organ systems death people experienced aki increased risk developing chronic kidney disease management includes treatment underlying cause supportive care renal replacement therapy clinical presentation often dominated underlying cause various symptoms acute kidney injury result various disturbances kidney function associated disease accumulation urea nitrogencontaining substances bloodstream lead number symptoms fatigue loss appetite headache nausea marked increases potassium level lead abnormal heart rhythms severe fluid balance frequently affected though blood pressure high low pain flanks may encountered conditions clotting kidneys blood vessels inflammation kidney result stretching fibrous tissue capsule surrounding kidney injury result dehydration may thirst well evidence fluid depletion physical physical examination may also provide clues underlying cause kidney problem rash interstitial nephritis vasculitis palpable bladder obstructive prerenal causes aki prerenal azotemia decrease effective blood flow kidney cause decrease glomerular filtration rate gfr kidneys need affected one kidney still adequate normal kidney function notable causes prerenal aki include low blood volume eg dehydration low blood pressure heart failure leading cardiorenal syndrome hepatorenal syndrome context liver cirrhosis local changes blood vessels supplying kidney latter include renal artery stenosis narrowing renal artery supplies kidney blood renal vein thrombosis formation blood clot renal vein drains blood kidneycitation needed intrinsic aki refers disease processes directly damage kidney intrinsic aki due one kidneys structures including glomeruli kidney tubules interstitium common causes glomerulonephritis acute tubular necrosis atn acute interstitial nephritis respectively causes intrinsic aki rhabdomyolysis tumor lysis certain medication classes calcineurin inhibitors eg tacrolimus also directly damage tubular cells kidney result form intrinsic

acute dialysis quality initiative adqi group aid assessment severity persons acute kidney injury acronym rifle used define spectrum progressive kidney injury seen deterioration kidney function may signaled measurable decrease urine output often diagnosed basis blood tests substances normally eliminated kidney urea creatinine additionally ratio bun creatinine used evaluate kidney injury tests disadvantages instance takes hours creatinine level rise even kidneys ceased function number alternative markers proposed ngal cystatin c none established enough replace creatinine marker kidney diagnosis aki made testing often required determine underlying cause useful perform bladder scan post void residual rule urinary retention post void residual catheter inserted urinary tract immediately urinating measure fluid still bladder ml suggests neurogenic bladder dysfunctioncitation needed may include urine sediment analysis renal ultrasound andor kidney biopsy indications kidney biopsy setting aki include medical imaging acute changes kidney often examined renal ultrasonography firstline modality ct scan magnetic resonance imaging mri used followup examinations us fails demonstrate abnormalities evaluation acute changes kidney echogenicity renal structures delineation kidney renal vascularity kidney size focal abnormalities ct preferred renal traumas us used followup especially patients suspected formation urinomas ct scan abdomen also demonstrate bladder distension hydronephrosiscitation needed renal ultrasonograph acute pyelonephritis increased cortical echogenicity blurred delineation upper renal ultrasonograph renal failure surgery increased cortical echogenicity kidney size biopsy showed acute tubular renal ultrasonograph renal trauma laceration lower pole subcapsular fluid collection acute kidney injury diagnosed basis clinical history laboratory data diagnosis made rapid reduction kidney function measured serum creatinine based rapid reduction urine output termed oliguria less mls urine per hourscitation needed aki caused systemic disease manifestation autoimmune disease eg lupus nephritis crush injury contrast agents antibiotics aki often occurs due multiple processes common cause dehydration sepsis combined nephrotoxic drugs especially following surgery contrast agentscitation needed causes acute kidney injury commonly categorized prerenal intrinsic postrenal acute kidney injury occurs patients following cardiac mortality increases postcardiopulmonary bypass patients go require renal replacement therapy preoperative creatinine greater mgdl combined valve bypass procedures emergency surgery preoperative intraaortic balloon pump risk factors strongly correlated postcardiopulmonary bypass acute kidney injury wellknown minor risk factors include female gender congestive heart failure chronic obstructive pulmonary disease insulinrequiring diabetes depressed left ventricular ejection volatile anesthetic agents shown increase renal sympathetic nerve activity rsna causes retention salts water diminished renal blood flow rbf increase serum renin levels antidiuretic hormone management aki hinges identification treatment underlying cause main objectives initial management prevent cardiovascular collapse death call specialist advice nephrologist addition treatment underlying disorder management aki routinely includes avoidance substances toxic kidneys called nephrotoxins include nsaids ibuprofen naproxen iodinated contrasts used ct scans many antibiotics gentamicin range monitoring kidney function serial serum creatinine measurements monitoring urine output routinely performed hospital insertion urinary catheter helps monitor urine output relieves possible bladder outlet obstruction enlarged prostatecitation needed prerenal aki without fluid overload administration intravenous fluids typically first step improving kidney function volume status may monitored use central venous catheter avoid underreplacement fluidcitation needed low blood pressure persists despite providing person adequate amounts intravenous fluid medications increase blood pressure vasopressors norepinephrine certain circumstances medications improve hearts ability pump known inotropes dobutamine may given improve blood flow kidney useful vasopressor evidence suggest dopamine specific benefit may fact myriad causes intrinsic aki require specific therapies example intrinsic aki due vasculitis glomerulonephritis may respond steroid medication cyclophosphamide cases plasma exchange toxininduced prerenal aki often responds discontinuation offending agent ace inhibitors arb antagonists aminoglycosides penicillins nsaids use diuretics furosemide widespread sometimes convenient
