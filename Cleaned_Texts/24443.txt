limbic system also known paleomammalian cortex set brain structures located sides thalamus immediately beneath medial temporal lobe cerebrum primarily various components support variety functions including emotion behavior longterm memory limbic system involved lower order emotional processing input sensory systems consists amygdala mammillary bodies stria medullaris central gray dorsal ventral nuclei processed information often relayed collection structures telencephalon diencephalon mesencephalon including prefrontal cortex cingulate gyrus limbic thalamus hippocampus including parahippocampal gyrus subiculum nucleus accumbens limbic striatum anterior hypothalamus ventral tegmental area midbrain raphe nuclei habenular commissure entorhinal cortex olfactory limbic system originally defined paul broca series cortical structures surrounding boundary cerebral hemispheres brainstem name limbic comes latin word border limbus structures known together limbic studies began

septal nuclei repeatedly pressed lever activating limbic system also interacts basal ganglia basal ganglia set subcortical structures direct intentional movements basal ganglia located near thalamus hypothalamus receive input cerebral cortex sends outputs motor centers brain stem part basal ganglia called striatum controls posture movement recent studies indicate inadequate supply dopamine striatum lead symptoms parkinsons limbic system also tightly connected prefrontal cortex scientists contend connection related pleasure obtained solving problemscitation needed cure severe emotional

one best understood heavily involved limbic interacting structure first widely researched area concerns memory particularly spatial memory spatial memory found many subregions hippocampus dentate gyrus dg dorsal hippocampus left hippocampus parahippocampal region dorsal hippocampus found important component generation new neurons called adultborn granules gc adolescence new neurons contribute pattern separation spatial memory increasing firing cell networks overall causing stronger memory formations thought integrate spatial episodic memories limbic system via feedback loop provides emotional context particular sensory dorsal hippocampus involved spatial memory formation left hippocampus participant recall spatial memories team found studying hippocampal lesions rats left hippocampus critical effectively combining qualities experience compose retrieved memory makes left hippocampus key component retrieval spatial memory however found left hippocampus general concentrated region binding together bits pieces memory composed hippocampus also areas brain recalled later time eichenbaums research also demonstrates parahippocampal area hippocampus another specialized region retrieval memories like left hippocampuscitation needed hippocampus decades also found huge impact learning curlik examined effects neurogenesis hippocampus effects learning researcher team employed many different types mental physical training subjects found hippocampus highly responsive latter tasks thus discovered upsurge new neurons neural circuits hippocampus result training causing overall improvement learning task neurogenesis contributes creation adultborn granules cells gc cells also described research neurogenesis contributions learning creation cells exhibited enhanced excitability dentate gyrus dg dorsal hippocampus impacting hippocampus contribution learning damage related hippocampal region brain reported vast effects overall cognitive functioning particularly memory spatial memory previously mentioned spatial memory cognitive function greatly intertwined hippocampus damage hippocampus may result brain injury injuries sort researchers particularly investigated effects high emotional arousal certain types drugs recall ability specific memory type particular study performed rats given task correctly making way maze first condition rats stressed shock restraint caused high emotional arousal completing maze task rats impaired effect hippocampaldependent memory compared control group second condition group rats injected anxiogenic drugs like former results reported similar outcomes hippocampalmemory also impaired studies reinforce impact hippocampus memory processing particular recall function spatial memory furthermore impairment hippocampus occur prolonged exposure stress hormones glucocorticoids gcs target hippocampus cause disruption explicit attempt curtail lifethreatening epileptic seizures henry gustav molaison underwent bilateral removal almost hippocampus course fifty years participated thousands tests research projects provided specific information exactly lost semantic episodic events faded within minutes never reached longterm memory yet emotions unconnected details causation often retained dr suzanne corkin worked years death described contribution tragic experiment another integrative part limbic system amygdala deepest part limbic system involved many cognitive processes largely considered primordial vital part limbic system like hippocampus processes amygdala seem impact memory however spatial memory hippocampus semantic division episodicautobiographical memory eam networks amygdala research shows encodes stores retrieves eam memories delve deeper types processes amygdala team provided extensive evidence investigations amygdalas main function charge cues mnemonic events specific emotional significance successfully searched within appropriate neural nets reactivated cues emotional events created amygdala encompass eam networks previously mentioned besides memory amygdala also seems important brain region involved attentional emotional processes first define attention cognitive terms attention ability focus stimuli ignoring others thus amygdala seems important structure ability foremost however structure historically thought linked fear allowing individual take action response fear however time gone researchers generalized concept help evidence eeg recordings concluded amygdala helps organism define stimulus therefore respond accordingly however amygdala initially thought linked fear gave way research amygdala emotional processes demonstrated research amygdala involved emotional processes particular ventral hippocampus described ventral hippocampus role neurogenesis creation adultborn granule cells gc cells crucial part neurogenesis strengthening spatial memory learning hippocampus also appear essential component function amygdala deficit cells pessoa predicted studies would result low emotional functioning leading high retention rate mental diseases anxiety disorderscitation needed social processing specifically evaluation faces social processing area cognition specific amygdala study done fmri tasks performed participants evaluate whether amygdala involved general evaluation faces study todorov concluded fmri results amygdala indeed play key role general evaluation faces however study performed researchers team trait trustworthiness particularly examined evaluation faces koscik team demonstrated amygdala involved evaluating trustworthiness individual investigated brain damage amygdala played role trustworthiness found individuals damaged amygdalas tended confuse trust betrayal thus placed trust done wrong furthermore along colleagues expanded idea amygdala critique trustworthiness others performing study examined amygdalas role evaluating general first impressions relating realworld outcomes study involved first impressions ceos rule demonstrated amygdala play role evaluation trustworthiness observed koscik research two years later amygdala also played generalized role overall evaluation first impression faces latter conclusion along todorovs study amygdalas role general evaluations faces kosciks research trustworthiness amygdala solidified evidence amygdala plays
