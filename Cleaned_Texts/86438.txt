stability social expectations addition recent research finds differences gender may possibly explained mechanisms including power sensations seeking example one study found women financially independent higher positions power also likely unfaithful another study tendency sensation seek ie engage risky behaviours controlled gender differences likelihood findings suggest may various factors might influence likelihood individuals engage extradyadic relationships factors may account observed gender differences beyond actual gender evolutionary pressures associated currently debate field evolutionary psychology whether innate evolved sex difference exists men women response act infidelity often called sex difference study published suggested may sex differences posit sex difference

psychologically symons determined sexual jealousy major reason many homosexual men unsuccessful maintaining monogamous suggests men innately disposed want sexual variation difference heterosexual homosexual men homosexual men find willing partners often casual sex thus satisfy innate desire sexual however according view men hard wired sexually jealous therefore gay men could upset sexual

purely sex drive sometimes two brain systems wellconnected enables people become adulterers satisfy libido without regards attachment often gender differences jealousy infidelity attributable cultural factors variation stems fact societies differ view extramarital affairs examination jealousy across seven nations revealed partner relationship serves others primary exclusive source satisfaction attention cultures therefore individual feels jealousy towards another usually sharing primary source attention satisfaction however variation seen identifying behaviors actions betray role primary attention satisfaction giver instance certain cultures individual goes another opposite gender emotions intense jealousy result however cultures behavior perfectly acceptable given much important understand cultural variations come root differing perceptions infidelity many cultures report infidelity wrong admonish tolerant behaviour views generally linked overall liberal nature society instance danish society viewed liberal many cultures correlating liberal views infidelity extramarital according christine harris nicholas christenfeld societies legally liberal extramarital affairs judge less harshly upon sexual infidelity distinct emotional infidelity danish society sex necessarily imply deep emotional attachment result infidelity carry severe negative comparison modernday chinese american societies showed greater distress sexual infidelity us china cultural difference likely due restrictive nature chinese society thus making infidelity salient concern sexual promiscuity prominent united states thus follows american society preoccupied infidelity chinese often single predominant religion influence culture entire nation even within christianity united states discrepancies extramarital affairs viewed instance protestants catholics view infidelity equal severity conception marriage also markedly different roman catholicism marriage seen indissoluble sacramental bond permit divorce even cases infidelity protestant denominations allow divorce remarriage infidelity reasons ultimately seen adults associated religion denomination found view infidelity much distressing affiliated religion participated heavily religions even conservative views research also suggested african american positive correlation infidelity even education attainment controlled research suggests lifetime incidence infidelity differ african americans whites likelihood engage race gender found positively correlated infidelity however case often african american men engaging extramarital needed human mating strategies differ culture culture example schmitt discusses tribal cultures higher pathogen stress likely polygynous marriage systems whereas monogamous mating systems usually relatively lower highpathogen addition researchers also proposed idea high mortality rates local cultures correlated permissive mating hand schmitt discusses demanding reproductive environments increase desire pursuit biparental monogamous strategic pluralism theory focuses environmental factors influence mating strategies according theory people live within environments demanding stressful need biparental care greater increasing survival offspring correspondingly monogamy commitment commonplace hand people live within environments encompass little stress threats viability offspring need serious committed relations lowered therefore promiscuity infidelity sex ratio theory theory explains relationship sexual dynamics within different areas world based ratio number marriageaged men marriageaged women according theory area high sex ratio higher number marriageaged women marriageaged men area low sex ratio marriageaged terms infidelity theory states sex ratios high men likely promiscuous engage sex outside committed relationship demand men higher type behavior desired men accepted hand sex ratios low promiscuity less common women demand since desire monogamy commitment order men remain competitive pool mates must respond desires support theory comes evidence showing higher divorce rates countries higher sex ratios higher monogamy rates countries lower sex infidelity means exclusive certain groups people perception influenced factors furthermore within homogeneous culture like united states factors like community size strong predictors infidelity perceived larger communities tend care less infidelity whereas small towns much concerned patterns observed cultures well example cantina small rural mexican community often viewed place decent married women go semiprivate nature conversely public spaces like market plaza acceptable areas heterosexual interaction smaller population size presents threat publicly recognized infidelity however within larger community mexican society entering bar watering hole would garner different view would deemed perfectly acceptable married unmarried individuals drink bar large city observations paralleled rural urban societies united states ultimately variables societal differences dictate attitudes towards sexual infidelity vary across cultures well within cultures mate poaching phenomenon single person luring person intimate relationship leave partner single person according survey individuals countries david schmitt mate poaching happens significantly frequently middle eastern countries turkey lebanon less frequently east asian countries china parental investment theory used explain evolutionary pressures account sex differences infidelity theory states sex invests less offspring gain indiscriminate sexual behaviour means women typically invest time energy raising offspring months carrying offspring breast feeding etc choosy comes mate selection therefore desire longterm monogamous relationships would ensure viability offspring men hand less parental investment driven towards indiscriminate sexual activity multiple partners activity increases likelihood theory says evolutionary pressures act men women differentially ultimately drives men seek sexual activity outside relationships however still account occurrence extradyadic sexual relationships among women example woman whose husband fertilization difficulties benefit engaging sexual activity outside relationship gain access highquality genes still derive benefit parental investment husband partner unknowingly investing illegitimate evidence development shortterm mating strategy women comes findings women engage affairs typically men higher status dominance physical
