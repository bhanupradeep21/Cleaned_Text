speakers feelings adds also imperative component intended change listeners feelings component greater ayer spoke values fundamental psychological inclinations stevenson speaks attitudes ayer spoke disagreement fact rational disputes application certain values particular case stevenson speaks differences belief concepts terminology aside stevenson interprets ethical statements according two patterns analysis first pattern analysis ethical statement two parts declaration speakers attitude imperative mirror good means approve first half sentence proposition imperative half stevensons translation ethical sentence remains noncognitive one imperatives proved still supported listener understands wholly arbitrary told close door one may ask receive reason drafty noise distracting reasons called proofs dangerously extended sense demonstratively inductively related imperative manifestly support imperative back establish base concrete references purpose supports make listener understand consequences action commanded understand commands consequences determine whether obedience command desirable results imperative used alter hearers attitudes actions supporting reason describes situation imperative seeks alter new situation imperative seeks bring facts disclose new situation satisfy preponderance hearers desires hesitate obey longer generally reasons support imperatives altering beliefs may turn alter unwillingness stevensons second pattern analysis used statements types actions specific actions pattern good meaning qualities relations x z except good well laudatory meaning permits express speakers approval tends evoke approval secondpattern analysis rather judge action directly speaker evaluating according general principle instance someone says murder wrong might mean murder decreases happiness overall secondpattern statement leads firstpattern one disapprove anything decreases happiness overall stevenson moral disagreements may arise different fundamental attitudes different moral beliefs specific cases methods moral argumentation proposed divided three groups known logical rational psychological nonrational psychological forms logical methods involve efforts show inconsistencies persons fundamental attitudes particular moral beliefs example someone says edward good person previously said edward thief thieves good people guilty inconsistency retracts one statements similarly person says lying always wrong might consider lies situations morally permissible examples situations given view shown logically rational psychological methods examine facts relate fundamental attitudes particular moral goal show someone inconsistent logical methods wrong facts connect attitudes beliefs modify former example consider person holds thieves bad people sees edward pocket wallet found public place may conclude thief would inconsistency attitude thieves bad people belief edward bad person thief however may edward recognized wallet belonging friend promptly returned revelation would likely change observers belief edward even attempt reveal facts would count rational psychological form moral nonrational psychological methods revolve around language psychological influence necessarily logical connection listeners attitudes stevenson called primary method persuasive somewhat broadened sense wrote persuasion depends sheer direct emotional impact emotive meaning rhetorical cadence apt metaphor stentorian stimulating pleading tones voice dramatic gestures care establishing rapport hearer audience redirection hearers attitudes sought mediating step altering beliefs exhortation whether obvious subtle crude persuasion may involve use particular emotionladen words like democracy hypothetical questions like everyone thought way would feel utilitarian philosopher richard brandt offered several criticisms emotivism book ethical theory first ethical utterances obviously kind thing emotive theory says prima facie least viewed thinks emotivism explain people historically speaking considered ethical sentences factstating emotive furthermore argues people change moral views see prior views mistaken different make sense attitudes changed suppose instance child person disliked eating peas recalls adult amused notes preferences change age say however former attitude mistaken hand remembers regarding irreligion divorce wicked regards former view erroneous unfounded ethical statements look like kind thing emotive theory says james urmsons book emotive theory ethics also disagreed many stevensons points ethics language work great value serious mistakes led stevenson consistently distort otherwise valuable brandt criticized termed magnetic influence idea stevenson ethical statements meant influence listeners attitudes brandt contends ethical statements including judgments people within listening range made intention alter attitudes others twenty years earlier sir william david ross offered much criticism book foundations ethics ross suggests emotivist theory seems coherent dealing simple linguistic acts recommending commanding passing judgement something happening point time utterance doubt words ought soandso may used ones means inducing person behave certain way justice meaning right ought must take account also modes speech ought soandso ought done soandso case ought done soandso case ought soandso ought soandso judgement obligation referenced either third person person addressed past unfulfilled past condition future treated merely possible speaker plausibility describing judgement according view would make little sense translate statement galileo forced recant heliocentricism command imperative recommendation might require radical change meaning ethical statements criticism would appear emotivist prescriptivist theories capable converting relatively small subset ethical claims imperatives like ross brandt urmson disagrees stevensons causal theory emotive theory moral statements emotive meaning made change listeners incorrect explaining evaluative force purely causal terms urmsons fundamental criticism suggests stevenson would made stronger case explaining emotive meaning terms commending recommending attitudes terms power evoke stevensons ethics language written rosss book brandts urmsons states emotive terms always used purposes example sentence slavery good ancient rome stevenson thinks one speaking past attitudes almost purely descriptive discussions current attitudes agreement attitude taken granted judgment like wrong kill might describe ones attitudes yet emotively inactive real emotive imperative stevenson doubtful sentences contexts qualify normative ethical sentences maintaining contexts typical normative ethics ethical terms function emotive philippa foot adopts moral realist position criticizing idea evaluation superposed fact committal new introduces analogy practical implications using word injury anything counts injury must impairment suppose man wants things injury prevents obtaining fallen old naturalist fallacy may seem way make necessary connexion injury things avoided say used
