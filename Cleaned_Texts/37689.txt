affective forecasting also known hedonic forecasting hedonic forecasting mechanism prediction ones affect emotional state process influences preferences decisions behavior affective forecasting studied psychologists economists broad applications theory moral sentiments adam smith observed personal challenges social benefits hedonic forecasting errors consider poor mans son heaven anger visited ambition begins look around admires condition rich order arrive devotes ever pursuit wealth whole life pursues idea certain artificial elegant repose may never arrive sacrifices real tranquillity times power extremity old age last find respect preferable humble security contentment abandoned last dregs life body wasted toil diseases mind galled ruffled memory thousand injuries disappointments begins last find wealth greatness mere trinkets frivolous yet well nature imposes upon us manner deception rouses keeps continual motion industry mankind early kahneman snell began research hedonic forecasts examining impact decision making term affective forecasting later coined psychologists timothy wilson daniel gilbert early research tended focus solely measuring emotional forecasts subsequent studies began examine accuracy forecasts revealing people surprisingly poor judges future emotional example predicting events like winning lottery might affect happiness people likely overestimate future positive feelings ignoring numerous factors might contribute emotional state outside single lottery event cognitive biases related systematic errors affective forecasts focalism hotcold empathy gap impact bias affective forecasting traditionally drawn attention economists psychologists findings turn generated interest variety fields including happiness research law health care effect decisionmaking wellbeing particular concern policymakers analysts fields although also applications ethics example ones tendency underestimate ones ability adapt lifechanging events led legal theorists questioning assumptions behind tort damage compensation behavioral economists incorporated discrepancies forecasts actual emotional outcomes models different types utility welfare discrepancy also concerns healthcare analysts many important health decisions depend upon patients perceptions future quality life affective forecasting divided four components predictions valence ie positive negative specific emotions experienced duration errors may occur four components research overwhelmingly indicates two areas prone bias usually form overestimation duration immune neglect form impact bias response negative events people fail predict much recovery hastened psychological immune system psychological immune system metaphor system defenses helps feel better bad things happen according average people fairly accurate predicting emotions feel response future however studies indicate predicting specific emotions response complex social events leads greater inaccuracy example one study found many women imagine encountering gender harassment predict feelings anger reality much higher proportion report feelings research suggests accuracy affective forecasting greater positive affect negative suggesting overall tendency overreact perceived negative events gilbert wilson posit result psychological immune affective forecasts take place present moment researchers also investigate future analyze forecasting twostep process encompassing current prediction well future event breaking present future stages allow researchers measure accuracy well tease errors occur gilbert wilson example categorize errors based component affect enter forecasting present phase affective forecasting forecasters bring mind mental representation future event predict respond emotionally future phase includes initial emotional response onset event well subsequent emotional outcomes example fading initial errors occur throughout forecasting process people vulnerable biases biases disable people accurately predicting future emotions errors may arise due extrinsic factors framing effects intrinsic ones cognitive biases expectation effects accuracy often measured discrepancy forecasters present prediction eventual outcome researchers also study time affects affective example tendency people represent distant events differently close events captured construal level finding people generally inaccurate affective forecasters obviously incorporated conceptualizations happiness successful well decision making across findings affective forecasts stimulated philosophical ethical debates example define applied level findings informed various approaches healthcare tort consumer decision measuring see sections economics law health newer conflicting evidence suggests intensity bias affective forecasting may strong previous research indicates five studies including metaanalysis recover evidence overestimation affective forecasting partly due methodology past research results indicate participants misinterpreted specific questions affective forecasting testing example one study found undergraduate students tended overestimate experienced happiness levels participants asked feeling general without reference election compared participants asked feeling specifically reference election findings indicated participants asked general questions misinterpreted clarification tasks participants able accurately predict intensity forecasting errors commonly arise literature cognitive many affective forecasting errors derive often framed cognitive biases closely related overlapping constructs eg projection bias empathy gap list commonly cited cognitive processes contribute forecasting errors one common sources error affective forecasting across various populations situations impact bias tendency overestimate emotional impact future event whether terms intensity tendencies overestimate intensity duration robust reliable errors found affective one study documenting impact bias examined college students participating housing lottery students predicted happy unhappy would one year assigned either desirable undesirable dormitory college students predicted lottery outcomes would lead meaningful differences level happiness followup questionnaires revealed students assigned desirable undesirable dormitories reported nearly levels thus differences forecasts overestimated impact housing assignment future happiness studies specifically address durability bias tendency overestimate length time future emotional responses even people accurately estimate intensity future emotions may able estimate duration durability bias generally stronger reaction negative important people tend work toward events believe cause lasting happiness according durability bias people might working toward wrong similar impact bias durability bias causes person overemphasize root cause happiness impact bias broad term covers multitude specific errors proposed causes impact bias include mechanisms like immune misconstruals pervasiveness impact bias affective forecasts particular concern healthcare specialists affects patients expectations future medical events well patientprovider relationships see health previously formed expectations alter emotional responses event motivating forecasters confirm debunk initial way selffulfilling prophecy lead perception forecasters made accurate predictions inaccurate forecasts also become amplified expectation effects example forecaster expects movie enjoyable upon finding dull like significantly less forecaster major life events huge impact peoples emotions long time intensity emotion tends decrease time phenomenon known emotional evanescence making forecasts forecasters often overlook psychologists suggested emotion decay time predictably like radioactive isotopes mediating factors people psychological processes help dampen emotions psychologists proposed surprising unexpected unlikely events cause intense emotional reactions research suggests people unhappy randomness chaos automatically think ways make sense event surprising unexpected sensemaking helps individuals recover negative events quickly would related immune neglect unwanted acts randomness occur people become upset try find meaning ways cope event way people try make sense situation considered coping strategy made body idea differs immune neglect due fact momentary idea immune neglect tries cope event even happens one study documents sensemaking processes decrease emotional reactions study found small gift produced greater emotional reactions accompanied reason arguably reason facilitated sensemaking process dulling emotional impact gift researchers summarized pleasant feelings prolonged positive situation people uncertain people fail anticipate make sense events way diminish intensity emotional reaction error known ordinization example ecstatic many years boss agrees give raise employee might believe especially employee believes probability raise unlikely immediately request approved employee may thrilled time employees make sense situation eg hard worker boss must noticed thus dampening emotional reaction gilbert et al originally coined term immune neglect immune bias describe function psychological immune system set processes restore positive emotions experience negative immune neglect peoples unawareness tendency adapt cope negative unconsciously body identify stressful event try cope event try avoid bolger zuckerman found coping strategies vary individuals influenced assumed since people generally take coping strategies account predict future events people better coping strategies bigger impact bias greater difference predicted actual outcome example asking someone afraid clowns going circus would feel may result overestimation fear anticipation fear causes body begin coping negative event hoerger et al examined studying college students emotions toward football games found students generally coped emotions instead avoiding would greater impact bias predicting theyd feel team lost game found better coping strategies recovered quickly since participants think coping strategies making predictions actually coped greater impact bias avoided emotions felt closely predicted words students able deal emotions able recover feelings students unaware body actually coping stress process made feel better dealing stress hoerger ran another study immune neglect studied daters nondaters forecasts valentines day would feel days followed hoerger found different coping strategies would cause people different emotions days following valentines day participants predicted emotions would similar shows people realize impact coping feelings following emotional event also found immune neglect create bias negative events also positive ones shows people continually make inaccurate forecasts take account ability cope overcome emotional hoerger proposed coping styles cognitive processes associated actual emotional reactions life variant immune neglect also proposed gilbert wilson regionbeta paradox recovery intense suffering faster recovery less intense experiences engagement coping systems complicates forecasting leading contrarily accurate affective forecasting also promote regionbeta paradox example cameron payne conducted series studies order investigate relationship affective forecasting collapse compassion phenomenon refers tendency peoples compassion decrease number people need help participants experiments read either group children darfur researchers found people skilled regulating emotions tended experience less compassion response stories children darfur compared stories child participants appeared collapse compassion correctly forecasting future affective states proactively avoiding increased negative emotions resulting story order establish causal role proactive emotional regulation phenomenon participants another study read materials encouraged either reduce experience emotions participants instructed reduce emotions reported feeling less upset children presumably increased emotional burden effort required former example regionbeta studies suggest cases accurate affective forecasting actually promote unwanted outcomes collapse compassion phenomenon way regionbeta paradox research suggests accuracy affective forecasting positive negative emotions based distance time forecast finkenauer gallucci van dijk pollman discovered people show greater forecasting accuracy positive negative affect event trigger forecast distant contrarily people exhibit greater affective forecasting accuracy negative affect eventtrigger closer time accuracy affective forecast also related well person predicts intensity emotions regard forecasting positive negative emotions levine kaplan lench safer recently shown people fact predict intensity feelings events high degree finding contrary much affective forecasting literature currently published authors suggest due procedural artifact studies conducted another important affective forecasting bias fading affect bias emotions associated unpleasant memories fade quickly emotion associated positive focalism focusing illusion occurs people focus much certain details event ignoring research suggests people tendency exaggerate aspects life focusing attention wellknown example originates paper kahneman schkade coined term focusing illusion found although people tended believe someone midwest would satisfied lived california results showed equal levels life satisfaction residents regions case concentrating easily observed difference weather bore weight predicting satisfaction many factors could contributed desire move midwest focal point decisions weather various studies attempted defocus participants meaning instead focusing one factor tried make participants think factors look situation different lens mixed results dependent upon methods used one successful study asked people imagine happy winner lottery recently diagnosed hiv patient would researchers able reduce amount focalism exposing participants detailed mundane descriptions persons life meaning information participants lottery winner hiv patient less able focus factors participants subsequently estimated similar levels happiness hiv patient well lotterywinner control participants made unrealistically disparate predictions happiness could due fact information available less likely one able ignore contributory factors time discounting time preference tendency weigh present events future events immediate gratification preferred delayed gratification especially longer periods time younger children example child may prefer one piece candy secondsinfinity candiessecond instead five pieces candy four months bigger candiessecond people like pattern sometimes referred hyperbolic discounting present bias peoples judgements biased toward present economists often cite time discounting source mispredictions future affective forecasters often rely memories past events people report memories past events may leave important details change things occurred even add things happened suggests mind constructs memories based actually happened factors including persons knowledge experiences existing using highly available unrepresentative memories increases impact bias baseball fans example tend use best game remember basis affective forecast game see commuters similarly likely base forecasts unpleasant would feel miss train memory worst time missed various studies indicate retroactive assessments past experiences prone various errors duration decay bias people tend overemphasize peaks ends experiences assessing peakend bias instead analyzing event whole example recalling painful experiences people place greater emphasis discomforting moments well end event opposed taking account overall retroactive reports often conflict presentmoment reports events pointing contradictions actual emotions experienced event memory addition producing errors forecasts future discrepancy incited economists redefine different types utility see section economics another problem arise affective forecasting people tend remember past predictions inaccurately meyvis ratner levav predicted people forget predicted experience would beforehand thought predictions actual emotions people realize made mistake predictions continue inaccurately forecast similar situations future meyvis et al ran five studies test whether true found studies people asked recall previous predictions instead write currently feel situation shows remember thought would feel makes impossible learn event future predicting future emotional states people must first construct good representation event people lot experience event easily picture event people much experience event need create representation event likely example people asked would feel lost one hundred dollars bet gamblers likely easily construct accurate representation event construal level theory theorizes distant events conceptualized abstractly immediate thus psychologists suggestweasel words lack concrete details prompts forecasters rely general idealized representations events subsequently leads simplistic inaccurate example asked imagine good day would like near future people often describe positive negative events asked imagine good day would like year however people resort uniformly positive gilbert wilson call bringing mind flawed representation forecasted event misconstrual framing effects environmental context heuristics schemas affect forecaster conceptualizes future example way options framed affects represented asked forecast future levels happiness based pictures dorms may assigned college students use physical features actual buildings predict case framing options highlighted visual aspects future outcomes overshadowed relevant factors happiness friendly roommate projection bias tendency falsely project current preferences onto future people trying estimate emotional state future attempt give unbiased estimate however peoples assessments contaminated current emotional state thus may difficult predict emotional state future occurrence known mental example college student currently negative mood found failed test college student forecasted much would enjoy party two weeks later current negative mood may influence forecast order make accurate forecast student would need aware forecast biased due mental contamination motivated correct bias able correct bias right direction projection bias arise empathy gaps hotcold empathy gaps occur present future phases affective forecasting characterized different states physiological arousal forecaster fails take example forecasters state hunger likely overestimate much want eat later overlooking effect hunger future preferences projection bias economists use visceral motivations produce empathy gaps help explain impulsive selfdestructive behaviors important affective forecasting bias related projection bias personality neglect personality neglect refers persons tendency overlook personality making decisions future emotions study conducted quoidbach dunn students predictions feelings future exam scores used measure affective forecasting errors related personality found college students predicted future emotions exam scores unable relate emotions dispositional investigate personality neglect quoidbach dunn studied happiness relation neuroticism people predicted future feelings outcome us presidential election barack obama john mccain neuroticism correlated impact bias overestimation length intensity emotions people rated higher neuroticism overestimated happiness response election preferred candidate suggesting failed relate dispositional happiness future emotional term projection bias first introduced paper projection bias predicting

buechel research participants likely overestimate happy would prize achieved goal made affective forecast could still influence whether achieved made affective forecast outcome determined still dark whether knew prize achieved goal economists share psychologists interests affective forecasting insomuch affects closely related concepts decision research affective forecasting errors complicates conventional interpretations utility maximization presuppose make rational decisions people must able make accurate forecasts future experiences whereas economics formerly focused largely utility terms persons preferences decision utility realization forecasts often inaccurate suggests measuring preferences time choice may incomplete concept utility thus economists daniel kahneman incorporated differences affective forecasts later outcomes corresponding types whereas current forecast reflects expected predicted utility actual outcome event reflects experienced utility predicted utility weighted average possible outcomes certain experienced utility refers perceptions pleasure pain associated kahneman thaler provide example hungry shopper case shopper takes pleasure purchase food due current state hunger usefulness purchasing based current experience anticipated pleasure fulfilling hunger affective forecasting important component studying human decision research affective forecasts economic decision making include investigations durability bias predictions public transit relevance durability bias consumers study conducted wood bettman showed people make decisions regarding consumption goods based predicted pleasure duration pleasure goods bring overestimation pleasure duration increases likelihood good consumed knowledge effect aid formation marketing strategies consumer studies regarding predictions public transit satisfaction reveal bias however negative impact consumption due lack experience public transportation car users predict receive less satisfaction use public transportation actually experience lead refrain use services due inaccurate broadly tendencies people make biased forecasts deviate rational models decision rational models decision making presume absence bias favor making comparisons based relevant available information affective forecasting may cause consumers rely feelings associated consumption rather utility good one application affective forecasting research economic policy knowledge forecasts therefore decisions affected biases well factors framing effects used design policies maximize utility peoples approach without critics however also seen justify economic prospect theory describes people make decisions differs expected utility theory takes account relativity people view utility incorporates loss aversion tendency react strongly losses rather researchers suggest loss aversion affective forecasting error since people often overestimate impact future economic definitions happiness tied concepts welfare utility researchers often interested increase levels happiness population economy major influence aid provided welfare programs provides funding programs many welfare programs focused providing assistance attainment basic necessities food may due fact happiness wellbeing best derived personal perceptions ones ability provide necessities statement supported research states basic needs met income less impact perceptions happiness additionally availability welfare programs enable less fortunate additional discretionary discretionary income dedicated enjoyable experiences family outings turn provides additional dimension feelings experience happiness affective forecasting provides unique challenge answering question regarding best method increasing levels happiness economists split offering choices maximize happiness versus offering experiences contain objective experienced utility experienced utility refers useful experience contribution feelings happiness experienced utility refer material purchases experiential purchases studies show experiential purchases bag chips result forecasts higher levels happiness material purchases purchase prediction happiness result purchase experience exemplifies affective forecasting possible increase choices means achieving desired levels happiness predictive increased levels happiness example one happy ability provide choice necessities choice enjoyable experiences likely predict happier forced choose one also people able reference multiple experiences contribute feelings happiness opportunities comparison lead forecast circumstances number choices quantity experienced utility effect affective forecasting makes difficult choose side debate method effective maximizing happiness applying findings affective forecasting research happiness also raises methodological issues happiness measure outcome experience satisfaction experienced result choice made based upon forecast example although professors may forecast getting tenure would significantly increase happiness research suggests reality happiness levels professors awarded tenure case happiness measured terms outcome experience affective forecasting conflicts one also influenced theories hedonic adaptation compares happiness treadmill remains relatively stable despite similar economists drawn attention affective forecasting violates assumptions rationality legal theorists point inaccuracies applications forecasts implications law remained overlooked application affective forecasting related research legal theory reflects wider effort address emotions affect legal system addition influencing legal discourse welfare jeremy blumenthal cites additional implications affective forecasting tort damages capital sentencing sexual jury awards tort damages based compensating victims pain suffering loss quality life however findings affective forecasting errors prompted suggest juries overcompensating victims since forecasts overestimate negative impact damages victims scholars suggest implementing jury education attenuate potentially inaccurate predictions drawing upon research investigates decrease inaccurate affective process capital sentencing juries allowed hear victim impact statements vis victims family demonstrates affective forecasting purpose present victims family impacted emotionally expect impacted future statements cause juries overestimate emotional harm causing harsh sentencing underestimate harm resulting inadequate sentencing time frame statements present also influences affective forecasting increasing time gap crime sentencing time victim impact statements given forecasts likely influenced error immune neglect see immune neglect immune neglect likely lead underestimation future emotional harm therefore results inadequate sentencing tort damages jury education proposed method alleviating negative effects forecasting cases involving sexual harassment judgements likely blame victim failure react timely fashion failure make use services available event sexual harassment prior actual experience harassment people tend overestimate affective reactions well proactive reactions response sexual harassment exemplifies focalism error see focalism forecasters ignore alternative factors may influence ones reaction failure react example study woodzicka lafrance studied womens predictions would react sexual harassment interview forecasters overestimated affective reactions anger underestimating level fear would experience also overestimated proactive reactions study participants reported would refuse answer questions sexual nature report question interviewers supervisor however study actually experienced sexual harassment interview none displayed either proactive juries able recognize errors forecasting may able adjust errors additionally juries educated factors may influence reactions victims sexual harassment intimidation likely make accurate forecasts less likely blame victims affective forecasting implications health decision medical ethics research healthrelated affective forecasting suggests nonpatients consistently underestimate quality life associated chronic health conditions socalled disability paradox states discrepancy selfreported levels happiness amongst chronically ill people versus predictions happiness levels healthy people implications forecasting error medical decision making severe judgments future quality life often inform health decisions inaccurate forecasts lead patients commonly health care refuse lifesaving treatment cases treatment would involve drastic change lifestyle example amputation patient health care agent falls victim focalism would fail take account aspects life would remain losing limb although halpern arnold suggest interventions foster awareness forecasting errors improve medical decision making amongst patients lack direct research impact biases medical decisions provides significant research also indicates affective forecasts future quality life influenced forecasters current state whereas healthy individuals associate future low health low quality life less healthy individuals forecast necessarily low quality life imagining poorer health thus patient forecasts preferences quality life may conflict public notions primary goal healthcare maximizing quality life knowledge patients forecasts potentially inform policy resources doctors suggest research findings affective forecasting errors merit medical others argue although biases exist support changes doctorpatient communication unilaterally diminish decisionmaking capacity used endorse paternalistic debate captures tension medicines emphasis protecting autonomy patient approach favors intervention order correct biases individuals recently experienced emotionally charged life event display impact individual predicts feel happier actually feel event another factor influences overestimation focalism causes individuals
