ultrasoundguided hip joint injection joint injection hip assisted medical ultrasound hip groin pain often presents diagnostic therapeutic challenge differential diagnosis extensive comprising intraarticular extraarticular pathology referred pain lumbar spine knee elsewhere pelvis various ultrasoundguided techniques described hip groin region diagnostic therapeutic purposes ultrasound many
