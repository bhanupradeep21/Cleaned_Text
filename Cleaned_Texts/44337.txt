encyclop√¶dia britannica hallucinatory experience sleep lucid dream may defined one dreamer aware asleep dreaming term lucid dream first used dutch physician frederik van studied dreams type word lucid refers fact subject achieved insight condition rather perceptual quality experience nevertheless one features lucid dreams extremely high quality perceptual realism extent dreamer may spend time examining admiring perceptual environment way appears imitate waking lucid dreams definition occur sleep may regarded hallucinatory experiences way nonlucid dreams vivid perceptual nature may regarded hallucinatory examples experience character sense perception without relevant adequate sensory stimulation false awakening one subject believes heshe woken whether lucid nonlucid dream fact still sometimes experience realistic perceptually sleeper seeming wake bedroom example insight achieved even dreamer really wakes realises occurred hallucinatory experiences seem particularly liable occur deliberately cultivate lucid dreams however may also occur spontaneously associated experience sleep paralysis psychoticlike symptoms hallucinations unusual perceptual experience involve gross alterations experience reality normal perception substantially constructive perceive strongly influenced prior experiences expectancies healthy individuals prone hallucinations scoring highly psychometric measures positive schizotypy tend show bias toward reporting stimuli occur perceptually ambiguous experimental visual detection fastmoving words undergraduate students scoring highly positive schizotypy significantly high rates false perceptions words ie reported seeing words included experimental positive schizotypal symptoms healthy adults seem predict false perceptions laboratory tasks certain environmental parameters perceptual frequency visual critical generation false perceptions detection events becomes either effortless cognitively demanding generation biases auditory hallucinations particular hearing voice thought particularly characteristic people schizophrenia however normal subjects also report auditory hallucinations surprising extent example bentall found many population male students prepared endorse statement past experience hearing persons voice found one add less subjects prepared score item often hear voice speaking thoughts aloud certainly applies latter item usually regarded firstrank symptom schizophrenia green found selfselected subjects reported purely auditory hallucination nearly half involved hearing articulate inarticulate human speech sounds example former would case engineer facing difficult professional decision sitting cinema heard voice saying loudly distinctly cant know adds clear resonant turned looked companion gazing

american college students type experience suggested auditory hallucinations affected culture extent american subjects examined reported hearing stern authoritarian voices violent prohibitive suggestions whereas voices heard india africa tended playful collaborative hypnogogic hypnopompic hallucinations occur people without symptoms considered nonpathologicalcitation needed paradoxical experience person strong feeling presence another person sometimes recognised sometimes unrecognised without apparently justifying sensory stimulus nineteenthcentury american psychologist philosopher william james described experience thus way experience spoken would appear extremely definite positive state mind coupled belief reality object quite strong direct sensation ever gives yet sensation seems connected phenomenon would seem due pure conception becoming saturated sort stinging urgency ordinarily sensations following example type experience husband died june years afterwards church felt standing beside singing hymn felt would see turned head feeling strong reduced tears thinking felt presence feeling day neither happened since experiences kind appear meet one normal criteria hallucination example slade bentall proposed following working definition hallucination perceptlike experience occurs absence appropriate stimulus b full force impact corresponding actual real perception c amenable direct voluntary control experience quoted certainly meets second third three criteria one might add presence case experienced located definite position external physical space

bereaved person clinging object medium hallucinatory wishful recent decades building crosscultural evidence adaptiveness experiences continuing bonds perspective originated klass et al suggested experiences seen normal potentially adaptive western context since number qualitative studies published describing mainly beneficial effects experiences especially made sense spiritual religious experiences tend reported comforting perceiver small percentage people reported disturbing experiences ongoing research example field determine continuing bonds experiences serve adjustment bereavement may detrimental main importance anomalous experiences benign hallucinations theoretical psychology lies relevance debate disease model versus dimensional model psychosis according disease model psychotic states associated schizophrenia manicdepression represent symptoms underlying disease process dichotomous nature ie given subject either disease person either physical disease tuberculosis according dimensional model contrast population large ranged along normally distributed continuum dimension variously labelled psychoticism hjeysenck schizotypy gordon claridge occurrence spontaneous hallucinatory experiences persons enjoying good physical health time drugged unusual physical states transient nature extreme fatigue would appear provide support dimensional alternative view requires one posit hidden latent disease process experiences symptom precursor explanation would appear beg question argument hallucination traditionally one used proponents philosophical theory
