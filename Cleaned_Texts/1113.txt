environments may indicate water contaminated fecal material humans animals fecal coliform bacteria enter rivers direct discharge waste mammals birds agricultural storm runoff human sewage however presence may also result plant material pulp paper mill failing home septic systems allow coliforms effluent flow water table aquifers drainage ditches nearby surface waters sewage connections connected storm drain pipes also allow human sewage surface waters older industrial cities particularly northeast midwest united states use combined sewer system handle waste combined sewer carries domestic sewage stormwater high rainfall periods combined sewer become overloaded overflow nearby stream river bypassing treatment pets especially dogs contribute fecal contamination surface waters runoff roads parking lots yards carry animal wastes streams storm sewers birds significant source fecal coliform bacteria swans geese seagulls waterfowl elevate bacterial counts especially wetlands lakes ponds rivers agricultural practices allowing livestock graze near water bodies spreading manure fertilizer fields wet periods using sewage sludge biosolids allowing livestock watering streams contribute fecal coliform contamination large quantities fecal coliform bacteria water harmful according authorities may indicate higher risk pathogens present waterborne pathogenic diseases may coincide fecal coliform contamination include ear infections dysentery typhoid fever viral bacterial gastroenteritis hepatitis untreated organic matter contains fecal coliform harmful environment aerobic decomposition material reduce dissolved oxygen levels discharged rivers waterways may reduce oxygen level enough kill fish aquatic life reduction fecal coliform wastewater may require use chlorine disinfectant chemicals uv disinfection treatment materials may kill fecal coliform disease bacteria also kill bacteria essential proper balance aquatic environment endangering survival species dependent bacteria higher levels fecal coliform require higher levels chlorine threatening aquatic organisms fecal coliform like bacteria usually inhibited growth boiling water treating
