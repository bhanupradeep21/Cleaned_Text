polytene chromosomes large chromosomes thousands dna strands provide high level function certain tissues salivary glands polytene chromosomes first reported egbalbiani polytene chromosomes found dipteran flies best understood drosophila chironomus rhynchosciara present another group arthropods class collembola protozoan group ciliophora mammalian trophoblasts antipodal suspensor cells insects commonly found salivary glands cells dividing produced repeated rounds dna replication without cell division forms giant chromosome thus polytene chromosomes form multiple rounds replication produce many sister chromatids stay fused together polytene chromosomes interphase seen distinct thick thin banding patterns patterns originally used help map chromosomes identify small chromosome mutations taxonomic identification used study function genes addition increasing volume cells nuclei causing cell expansion polytene cells may also metabolic advantage multiple copies genes permits high level gene expression drosophila melanogaster example chromosomes larval salivary glands undergo many rounds endoreduplication produce large quantities adhesive mucoprotein glue pupation another example within fly tandem duplication various polytene bands located near centromere x chromosome results bar phenotype kidneyshaped interbands involved interaction active chromatin proteins nucleosome remodeling origin recognition complexes primary functions act binding sites rna pol ii initiate replication start nucleosome remodeling short fragments insects polytene chromosomes commonly found salivary glands also referred salivary gland chromosomes large size chromosome due presence many longitudinal strands called chromonemata hence name polytene many stranded mm length μm diameter chromosomal strands formed repeated division chromosome absence cytoplasmic division type division called endomitosis polytene chromosome contains two types bands dark bands interbands dark bands darkly stained inter bands lightly stained nuclear stains dark bands contain dna less rna interbands contain rna less dna amount dna interbands ranges bands polytene chromosomes become enlarged certain times form swellings called puffs formation puffs called puffing regions puffs chromonemata uncoil open form many loops puffing caused uncoiling individual chromomeres band puffs indicate site active genes mrna synthesis takes chromonemata puffs give series many loops laterally loops appear rings called balbiani rings name researcher discovered formed dna rna proteins site transcription

introduced name polytene describe giant chromosome writing seems regard chromosomes corresponding paired pachytene chromosomes meiosis intercalary parts chromomeres stretched separated smaller units instead two threads lying side side even hence polytene rather pachytene however propose use term shall refer multiple polytene chromosomes present secretory tissues dipteran insects malpighian
