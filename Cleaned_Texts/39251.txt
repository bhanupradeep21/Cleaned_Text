four shaped like molars molariform reminiscent lestodon glossotherium differed mylodon upper caniniform teeth receded differing former two rows teeth diverge clearly towards front rather parallel anterior region diverged slightly thus two caninelike anterior teeth displaced laterally outward much closer together addition distinct diastema following first molarlike tooth missing altogether caniniform tooth small thus size already strongly reduced reminded mylodonopsis formed clear difference large teeth lestodon glossotherium cross section possessed rather circular shape following teeth
