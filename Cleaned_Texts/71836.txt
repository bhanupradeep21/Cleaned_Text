pathogenesis behind development phyllodes tumor theories suggest genetic cause literature supports involvement hormone growth factor receptors cell signal transduction pathways cell cycle certain receptors include estrogenprogesterone glucocorticoid wellstudied cell signal transduction pathway includes wnt pathway highly conserved genetic pathway wnt pathway gene transcription via bcatenin highly regulated process proteins including limited cmyc cjun fra cyclin mutation proteins lead unregulated rapid growth characteristic phyllodes addition vascular factors promoting angiogenesis shown promote growth breast proteins include vascular endothelial growth factor vegf hypoxiainducible plateletderived growth factor nitrogen oxide increased expression angiogenic factors reflects increased angiogenesis seen higher grade phyllodes genes associated higher incidence phyllodes tumors include mediator complex subunit exon telomerase reverse transcriptase tert promoter retinoic acid receptor
