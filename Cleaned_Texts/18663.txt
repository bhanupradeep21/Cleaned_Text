wolfgang von kempelens speaking machine manually operated speech synthesizer began development austrohungarian author inventor wolfgang von kempelen year completed far infamous contribution history turk chessplaying automaton later revealed farreaching elaborate hoax due chessplaying humanbeing occupying turks construction completed six months kempelens speaking machine occupied next twenty years two conceptual dead ends first five years research kempelens third direction ultimately led design felt comfortable deeming final functional representational model human vocal kempelens first experiment speech synthesis involved rudimentary elements vocal tract necessary produce speechlike sounds kitchen bellows used stoke fires woodburning stoves invoked set lungs supply airflow reed extracted common bagpipe implemented glottis source raw fundamental sound vocal tract bell clarinet made sufficient mouth despite rigid form basic model able produce simple vowel sounds though additional articulation possible positioning ones hand bell opening obstruct airflow physical hardware constructing nasals plosives fricatives consonants require present however kempelen like many early pioneers phonetics misunderstood source perceived higher frequencies certain sounds function glottis rather function formants entire vocal tract abandoned singlereed design multiplereed second design involved console similar musical organ period operator manned set keys one letter sounds produced common bellows fed air various pipes appropriate shapes obstructions needed produce letter experimentation came find reeds resonant length crucial creation highfrequency components certain vowels fricatives tuned pitch sake consistency letters letters represented point kempelen developed technology required produce vowels several consonants including plosive p nasal thus position begin forming syllables short words however immediately led primary flaw second design parallel nature multiple reeds allowed one letter sounded time process building syllables words sonic overlap referred coarticulation rendered sounds uncharacteristic human speech undermining intention design altogether kempelen comments order continue experiments necessary perfect knowledge wanted imitate make formal study speech continually consult nature conducted experiments way talking machine theory concerning speech made equal progress one serving guide possible following methods id using invent separate letters never combine form syllables absolutely necessary follow nature one glottis one mouth every sound emerges gives unity thus kempelen began work third ultimately final design many ways closeaspossible representation physiology vocal tract third approach followed similar design first conceptually faithful natural design human vocal tract second consisted like bellows reed simulated mouth time made india rubber better creation vowel sounds via manipulation hand also included throat nasal cavity attached complete two nostrils pronouncing nasal consonants well several levers tubes dedicated pronouncing ʃ rod would interfere reeds vibration articulate r separate smaller bellows would allow air pass reed mouth completely closed feature required pronouncing b one point special valve intended simulate f included later removed revealed sound could achieved simply closing orifices machine allowing air leak cracks similarly one point design alternate mouth assembly consisting wooden box pair hinged shutters acted lips inside box resided hinged wooden stringoperated flap acted tongue purpose assembly mimic mouth tongue construction plosives b later removed kempelen recognized without proper tongue machine would never able produce k ɡ found way around entire problem replacing k p ɡ b differed voicing p context familiar word listeners often ignored mispronunciation altogether phenomenon later explored researchers field cognitive science kempelen believed people forgiving errors made machine due frequency reed vocal tract resonant length chose use create resonance much like young child third design unlike completely capable speaking complete phrases french italian english german possible required greater skilllevel operator due frequent use consonants german language greatest limitation bellows although six times capacity human lungs ran empty air much faster human counterpart design based single reed glottal soundsource none problems coarticulation came inherently second design single reed also meant speaking machine monotone kempelen expended time try introduce several prosodic pitchvariation mechanisms reed assembly avail decided leave design improved upon next batch experimenters important additions third design came two decades intensive
