episodic ataxia ea autosomal dominant disorder characterized sporadic bouts ataxia severe discoordination without myokymia continuous muscle movement seven types recognized majority due two recognized ataxia provoked psychological stress startle heavy exertion including exercise symptoms first appear infancy least six loci ea known genes patients ea also migraine progressive cerebellar degenerative disorders symptomatic either familial hemiplegic migraine spinocerebellar ataxia patients respond acetazolamide though others typically episodic ataxia presents bouts ataxia induced startle stress exertion patients also continuous tremors various motor groups known myokymia patients nystagmus vertigo tinnitus diplopia seizurescitation needed various symptoms ea caused dysfunction differing areas ataxia common symptom due misfiring purkinje cells cerebellum either due direct malfunction cells improper regulation cells seizures likely due altered firing hippocampal neurons null mice seizures reasoncitation needed type episodic ataxia characterized attacks generalized ataxia induced emotion stress myokymia attacks disorder also known episodic ataxia myokymia eam hereditary paroxysmal ataxia neuromyotonia isaacsmertens syndrome onset occurs early childhood adolescence persists throughout patients life attacks last seconds minutes mutations gene encodes voltagegated potassium channel responsible subtype episodic ataxia expressed heavily basket cells interneurons form gabaergic synapses purkinje cells channels aid repolarization phase action potentials thus affecting inhibitory input purkinje cells thereby motor output cerebellum example synaptopathy currently mutations associated table figure mutations least partly characterized cell culture based electrophysiological assays wherein mutations demonstrated drastic alterations channel function described table known associated mutations result drastic decrease amount current channels furthermore channels tend activate positive potentials slower rates demonstrated positive shifts values slower τ activation time constants respectively mutations moreover produce channels deactivate faster rates deactivation τ would also result decreased current channels biophysical changes channel properties likely underlie decrease current observed experiments many mutations also seem result misfolded otherwise mistrafficked channels likely major cause dysfunction disease pathogenesis assumed though yet proven decrease mediated current leads prolonged action potentials interneurons basket cells channels important regulation purkinje cell activity likely results increased aberrant inhibitory input purkinje cells thus disrupted purkinje cell firing cerebellum outputcitation needed type

currently mutations associated though characterized electrophysiologically table figure result decreased current channels assumed mutations especially splicing frameshift mutations also result drastic decrease currents though may case mutations heavily expressed purkinje cells cerebellum involved coupling action potentials neurotransmitter release thus decrease entry channels expected result decreased output purkinje cells even though fire appropriate rate tottering mouse widely used model study developed spontaneous homologous mutation early alternatively mutations seen familial hemiplegic migraine result increased entry thereby aberrant transmitter release also result excitotoxicity may occur cases spinocerebellar ataxia episodic ataxia similar often also presents tinnitus vertigo patients typically present bouts ataxia lasting less minutes occurring twice daily attacks also vertigo nausea vomiting tinnitus diplopia attacks sometimes accompanied headaches precipitated
