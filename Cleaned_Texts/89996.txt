costello syndrome also called faciocutaneoskeletal syndrome fcs syndrome rare genetic disorder affects many parts body characterized delayed development intellectual disabilities distinctive facial features unusually flexible joints loose folds extra skin especially hands heart abnormalities common including fast heartbeat tachycardia structural heart defects overgrowth heart muscle hypertrophic cardiomyopathy infants costello syndrome may large birth grow slowly children difficulty feeding later life people condition relatively short stature many reduced levels growth hormones rasopathycitation needed beginning early childhood people specific mutations costello syndrome gene variant increased risk developing certain cancerous noncancerous tumors small growths called papillomas common noncancerous tumors seen condition usually develop around nose mouth frequent cancerous tumor associated costello syndrome soft tissue tumor called rhabdomyosarcoma cancers also reported children adolescents disorder including tumor arises developing nerve cells neuroblastoma form bladder cancer transitional cell carcinoma costello syndrome discovered jack costello new zealand paediatrician credited first reporting syndrome australian paediatric journal volume condition characterized delayed development intellectual disability loose folds skin especially noticeable hands feet unusually flexible joints distinctive facial features including large mouth full lips others also include heart abnormalities infants born condition may large birth grow slowly children difficulty feeding later life people condition relatively short stature many reduced levels growth hormones costello syndrome caused least five different mutations hras gene chromosome gene provides instructions making protein hras helps control cell growth division mutations cause costello syndrome lead production hras protein permanently active instead triggering cell growth response particular signals outside cell overactive protein directs cells grow divide constantly unchecked cell division may predispose affected development benign malignant tumors remains unclear mutations hras cause features costello syndrome many signs symptoms may result cell overgrowth abnormal cell divisioncitation needed hras protooncogene somatic mutations healthy people contribute cancer whereas children costello syndrome typically mutation hras every cell bodies otherwise healthy person tumor caused part hras mutation mutant hras within tumor test mutation cancer tumors also used test children costello syndromecitation needed costello syndrome inherited autosomal dominant manner means one copy altered gene sufficient cause disorder almost cases resulted new mutations occur people history disorder family condition rare april cases reported worldwidecitation needed costello syndrome difficult doctors immediately clinically diagnose similar conditions resemble syndrome physician start assessing childs height size head birth weightcitation needed full genome exome next generation dna testing primary diagnostic tool costello syndromecitation needed american society human genetics meeting francis collins gave presentation treatment devised children affected progeria discussed farnesyltransferase inhibitors ftis affects hras presentation members costello syndrome family network discussed possibility ftis helping children costello syndrome mark kieran presented international costello syndrome research symposium agreed ftis might help children costello syndrome discussed costello advocates learned establishing running progeria clinical trial fti help consider next stepscitation needed another medication affects hras lovastatin planned treatment neurofibromatosis type reported mainstream news costello syndrome professional advisory board asked use costello syndrome research effects lovastatin linked alcino silva presented findings symposium silva also believed medication studying could help children costello syndrome cognitioncitation needed third medication might help children costello syndrome mek inhibitor helps inhibit pathway closer cell nucleuscitation needed spanish researchers reported development costello mouse mutation early although mutation rare among children costello syndrome mouse appear develop tumors expected information mouse models heart may transferable humans italian japanese researchers published development costello zebrafish late also advent animal models may accelerate identification treatment options genetic mutations hras cause costello syndrome first reported mutations along mutations cause cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome found soon surprised geneticists changed genetic syndromes groupedcitation needed geneticists looked new mutations genes mutations caused syndromes similar unknown syndromecitation needed example researchers looked around common noonan syndrome mutation find anything related costello syndrome cardiofaciocutaneous syndromecitation needed first mutation identified one costello syndrome alleles found unexpectedly japanese researchers used dna children costello syndrome control looking another noonan gene geneticists realized syndromes grouping together clinically according signs symptoms related way never realized mutations cause costello syndrome noonan syndrome cardiofaciocutaneous syndromes linked cellular function close gene known mutation cellular function links common signalling pathway brings information outside cell nucleus pathway called rasmapkinase
