music therapy nonfluent aphasia method treating patients lost ability speak stroke accident nonfluent aphasia also called expressive aphasia neurological disorder deprives patients ability express language usually caused stroke lesions broca area languagedominant area responsible speech production left hemisphere however lesions broca area affects patients speech ability ability sing remains since several studies shown right hemispheric regions active music therapy involving melodic elements deemed potential treatment nonfluent aphasia singing might activate patients right hemisphere compensate lesioned left aside singing many music therapy techniques also attempted effectiveness techniques shown although many possible explanations mechanism music therapy underlying mechanism remains unclear studies indicate contradictory common method therapeutic singing guiding patients sing familiar patients led sing along song therapists might adjust tempo volume pitch according individual patient optimise therapy process lyrics patients easily produce repeated several employment singing treatment aphasia novel therapy technique past therapists already noticed patients difficulty speaking still able vocal intonation introduced make aphasic patients intentionally exaggerate intonation daily wellknown application vocal intonation music therapy melodic intonation therapy mit receiving mit patients intone phrases syllables two pitches determined natural prosody stressed syllables intoned higher pitch unstressed syllables intoned lower pitch however various intonation daily conversational phrases may used patients practice communicating different meanings different addition body cues head hand movement may used help patients perceive different pitch vocal dynamically cued singing also used therapists long time therapists guide patients finish incomplete sentence singing name designated object hand therapist points patient hand additionally dynamically cued singing employed together singing familiar therapists may pause end phrase song let patients finish phrase singing technique creates strong interpersonal interaction enhances patients motivation participate also offers circumstance similar real conversation benefits patients skills outside beginning therapists ask patients focus breathing singlesyllable sounds effect technique enhanced therapists guide patients produce sounds natural breathing patterns help relax yawning signing cleaning later patients encouraged develop breathing sounds pitched sounds hand movement may used help patients synchronize syllable sounds usually singlesyllable sounds begin vowels consonants however also suggested procedure bilabial sounds ie b tonguetip sounds ie n tonguebase sounds ie g patients produce conversational phrases melodies patients familiar practice real conversation patients may need daily technique leads successful outcomes original lyrics melodies presented melodies associated conversational method also conducted therapists years ago indicated effective keith aronson recorded stroke patient rehabilitated aphasia singing simple conversational phrases communicate people rhythmic speech cueing one essential components mit requires patients use left hand tap syllable intoned general therapists guide patients clap tap speech rhythm phrases obtained song lyrics conversations resources related immediate instead lefthand tapping clapping beating drum also possible rhythmic cueing speed correspond patients speech speed prosodic rhythms phrases musical rhythms lyrics depending circumstances individual types phrasescitation needed technique aims improve oral motor formation therapists demonstrate mouth tongue movements exaggerated way singing song ask patients imitate exaggerated oral movements patients tend better performance therapists coordinate exaggerated expressions match rhythm lyrics feedback given therapists allow patients imitate movements identically possible repeated practices correction employing technique therapists first hum melody sing words melody tapping patients hand therapists ask patients hear words melody inside patients difficulty understanding asked imagine hearing melody happy birthday parents voice saying homework patients understand concept asked hear singing words inside brain along therapists therapists singing technique patients establish auditory target compare overtly produced phrases covertly produced phrases mastering skill patients able create auditory target phrases transfer phrases expressive speech without much assistance purpose technique inner rehearsal allow patients gain independence assistance technique aims train patients hear difference target phrases sung therapists phrases produced target phrases create using inner rehearsal mastering technique patients able correct production phrases whenever practice singing words effectiveness traditional speech therapy tends limited patients poor attention poor motivation music therapy better therapeutical effects boosting patients willingness participate therapy music therapy also improve nonfluent aphasic patients breathing vocal ability articulation prosody speech verbal nonverbal communicative addition music therapy gives confidence nonfluent aphasic patients reduces frustrated feelings first nonfluent aphasic patients may find difficult accept fact speak previously anymore suffer nevertheless patients discover still able sing sentences receiving music therapy confident less moreover words singing pronounced slowly speaking patients fluent singing words time distinguish phonemes composed although people suffer nonfluent aphasia lose speech ability singing ability usually preserved ability sing might result preserved brain circuit singing suggests singing speaking involve different neural pathway human nonfluent aphasia usually caused lesions patients left hemisphere undamaged right hemisphere regarded researchers reason patients preserve ability sing jeffries et al patients undergo brain imaging scan also show increased right hemispheric activity singing therefore substitution right hemisphere damaged left hemisphere one possible mechanisms music therapy nonfluent terms training right hemisphere music therapy techniques involving melodic components singing vocal intonation always discussed researchers since pitch difference language perceived right hemisphere singing intoning phrases may allow patients use neural pathway right many patients noted improvement speech production receiving therapeutic singing vocal intonation practice researchers suggested techniques able activate right hemispheric regions potentially responsible language although many studies suggest singing music therapy improve nonfluent aphasic patients speech production study stahl et shows rhythm instead singing key element music therapy benefits aphasic patients therefore rhythmic components music therapy might explain music therapy benefit nonfluent aphasic patients one example lefthand tapping used melodic intonation therapy mit since technique also serves way stimulate right hemisphere schlaug et speculate lefthand tapping may favor verbal production indirectly propose hand movements articulation might share mutual neurological network right hemisphere hand movements often tight relationship ones articulation daily life therefore lefthand tapping likely benefit aphasic patients articulation engaging neurological network coordinates hand movement articulatory movement patients right hemispherecitation needed even though many studies proposed possible neural mechanism music therapy nonfluent aphasia many crucial questions still unanswered example contrast idea nonfluent aphasic patients ability sing due undamaged right studies suggest speaking singing words based neural therefore patients better performance singing words might result longterm memories familiar addition spite research results indicating mit activate regions potentially responsible language processing aphasic patients right hemisphere studies obtain completely opposite belin et al showed broca area adjacent regions aphasic patients left hemisphere activated patients received mit activation observed right hemisphere contrarily observed activation patients right hemisphere patients underwent word repetition tasks without mit interpreted right hemispheric activation persistence aphasia instead cortical reorganization unfortunately currently conflicting research results demonstrate underlying mechanism music therapy remains unclear neural mechanism music therapy elucidated effective application techniques remain hard another challenge research music therapy design although many studies illustrated positive effects music therapy nonfluent aphasia studies tend case studies small sample size moreover studies usually lack control conditions randomized design therefore van der meulen et strongly urge article randomized controlled trials rcts needed order examine effectiveness music therapycitation needed sustaining treatment effects music therapy long term also challenge application nonfluent aphasia overcome barrier two techniques inner rehearsal auditorymotor feedback training introduced help patients gain independence assistance music however related studies two techniques still limited future studies required order fully understand efficacy potential applications two techniques httpsenwikipediaorgwikimusictherapyfornonfluentaphasia
