dysexecutive syndrome des consists group usually resulting brain damage fall cognitive behavioural emotional categories tend occur together term introduced alan describe common pattern dysfunction executive functions planning abstract thinking flexibility behavioural control thought baddeleys hypothesized working memory system central executive hypothetical systems impaired syndrome known frontal lobe syndrome however dysexecutive syndrome preferred emphasizes functional pattern deficits symptoms location syndrome frontal lobe often area symptoms des fall three broad categories cognitive emotional behavioural many symptoms seen direct result impairment central executive component working memory responsible attentional control although many symptoms regularly cooccur common encounter patients several symptoms accumulated effects symptoms large impact daily lifecitation needed cognitive symptoms refer persons ability process thoughts cognition primarily refers memory ability learn new information speech reading comprehension deficits within area cause many problems everyday life decisionscitation needed one main difficulties individual des planning reasoning impaired planning reasoning affect individuals ability realistically assess manage problems everyday living new problems situations may especially poorly handled inability transfer previous knowledge new individual des may short attention span due impairment attentional may alter individuals ability focus difficulty reading following storyline instance easily lose track conversations make difficult hold meaningful conversation may result avoiding social individuals des poor working memory short term memory due executive dysfunction dysfunction range mild subtle severe obvious tremendous variability manifestations executive dysfunction strong influences often apparent affected persons personality life experiences individuals des may experience confabulation spontaneous reporting events never happened affect autobiographical thought patients may able assess accuracy memory retrieval therefore elaborate implausible individuals dementia delirium severe psychiatric illnesses combined des often disturbed sleep recognize nighttime may become upset someone tries correct emotional symptoms individuals des experience may quite extreme cause extensive problems may difficulty inhibiting many types emotions anger excitement sadness frustration due multiple impairments cognitive functioning much frustration expressing certain feelings understanding interpret everyday situations individuals des may higher levels aggression anger lack abilities related behavioural control also difficulty understanding others points view lead anger behavioural symptoms evident individuals actions people des often lose social skills judgments insights others may thinking may trouble knowing behave group situations may know follow social norms central executive helps control impulses therefore impaired patients poor impulse lead higher levels aggression anger des also cause patients appear selfcentered utilization behaviour patient automatically uses object appropriate manner inappropriate example pen paper placed front individual des start write deck cards deal patients showing symptom begin behaviour middle conversations auditory tests utilization behaviour thought occur action initiated object seen patients des lack central executive control inhibit acting inappropriate perseveration also often seen patients des perseveration repetition thoughts behaviours actions already instance continually blowing match longer lit example perseveration behaviour three types perseveration continuous perseveration stuckinset perseveration recurrent stuckinset perseveration often seen dysexecutive syndrome type perseveration refers patient get specific frame mind asked name animals name one ask name colours may still give animals perseveration may explain patients appear obsessivecompulsive disordercitation needed des often occurs disorders known comorbidity many studies examined presence des patients schizophrenia results schizophrenic patients behavioural assessment dysexecutive syndrome bads test discussed comparable brain injured results bads shown correlate phases schizophrenia patients chronic phase disorder significantly lower scores logical due similarities executive disruptions make everyday life difficult schizophrenia symptoms form des patients alzheimers disease forms dementia shown exhibit impairment executive functioning effects des symptoms executive functions working memory attentiveness planning remembering recently learned things earliest indicators alzheimers disease dementia lewy bodies studies also indicated chronic alcoholism see korsakoffs syndrome lead mild form des according results frequent cause syndrome brain damage frontal lobe brain damage leading dysexecutive pattern symptoms result physical trauma blow head stroke internal trauma important note frontal lobe damage cause syndrome shown damage lesions areas brain may indirectly affect executive functions lead similar symptoms ventral tegmental area basal ganglia one specific pattern damage leads des multiple affected brain structures locations led one reason term frontal lobe syndrome preferred assessment patients des difficult traditional tests generally focus one specific problem short period time people des fairly well tests problems related integrating individual skills everyday lack everyday application traditional tests known low ecological validity behavioural assessment dysexecutive syndrome bads designed address problems traditional tests evaluate everyday problems arising bads designed around six subtests ends dysexecutive questionnaire dex tests assess executive functioning complex reallife situations improves ability predict daytoday difficulties des dysexecutive questionnaire dex questionnaire designed sample emotional motivational behavioural cognitive changes subject one version designed subject complete another version designed someone close individual relative instructions given participant read statements describing common problems everyday life rate according personal experience item scored scale according frequency never point often cure individuals des therapies help cope symptoms des affect number functions brain vary person person variance suggested successful therapy would include multiple researchers suggest number factors executive functioning need improved including selfawareness goal setting planning selfinitiation selfmonitoring selfinhibition flexibility strategic behaviour one method individuals improve areas help plan carry actions intentions series goals subgoals accomplish therapists teach patients threestep model called general planning first step information awareness patients taught problems shown affects lives patients taught monitor executive functions begin evaluate second stage goal setting planning consists patients making specific goals well devising plan accomplish example patients may decide lunch friend goal taught write friend may going lunch time going get etc subgoals also taught make sure steps go correct order final stage named initiation execution regulation requires patients implement goals everyday initiation taught normal routines first step cue patient go next step plan execution regulation put action reminders proceed something goes wrong behavioural script treatment method resulted improved daily executive functioning however improvements seen formal executive functioning tests since planning needed many activities different techniques used improve deficit patients des autobiographical memories used help direct future draw past experiences know future example want take bus know past experience walk bus stop exact amount change put change slot go find seat patients des seem able use autobiographical memory well normal person training des patients asks think specific time activity previously instructed think accomplished activity example includes would plan holiday patients taught think specific times went holiday think may planned drawing past experiences patients better able make good decisions plans cognitive analytic therapy cat also used help des individuals syndrome trouble integrating information actions often suggested programmed reminders delivered cell phone helps remember behave discontinue inappropriate actions another method reminding patients write letter read letter whenever need help patients remember behave may also create diagram diagram helps organize thoughts shows patient change behaviour everyday use auditory stimuli examined treatment des presentation auditory stimuli causes interruption current activity appears aid preventing goal neglect increasing patients ability monitor time focus goals given stimuli subjects longer performed age group average researchers suggested des mislabelled syndrome possible symptoms exist also distinct pattern damage leads syndrome patients frontal lobe damage des patients damage frontal lobe exhibit necessary pattern led research investigate possibility executive functioning broken multiple processes spread throughout frontal disagreement comes syndrome based baddeley hitchs model working memory central executive hypothetical vagueness aspects syndrome led researchers test nonclinical sample results show dysexecutive behaviours part everyday life symptoms exist varying degrees example absentmindedness lapses attention common everyday occurrences people however majority population inattentiveness manageable whereas patients des experience degree daily tasks
