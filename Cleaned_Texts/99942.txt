rotator cuff muscles also perform multiple functions including abduction internal rotation external rotation shoulder infraspinatus subscapularis significant roles scapular plane shoulder abduction scaption generating forces two three times greater force produced supraspinatus however supraspinatus effective general shoulder abduction moment anterior portion supraspinatus tendon submitted significantly greater load stress performs main functional tendons ends rotator cuff muscles become torn leading pain restricted movement arm torn rotator cuff occur following trauma shoulder occur wear tear tendons commonly supraspinatus tendon found acromion rotator cuff injuries commonly associated motions require repeated overhead motions forceful pulling motions injuries frequently sustained athletes whose actions include making repetitive throws athletes baseball pitchers softball pitchers american football players especially quarterbacks firefighters cheerleaders weightlifters especially powerlifters due extreme weights used bench press rugby players volleyball players due swinging motionscitation needed water polo players rodeo team ropers shot put throwers swimmers boxers kayakers martial artists fast bowlers cricket tennis players due service motioncitation needed tenpin bowlers due repetitive swinging motion arm weight bowling ball type injury also commonly affects orchestra conductors choral conductors drummers due swinging motions progression increases weeks active exercises implemented rehabilitation process active exercises allow increase strength range motion permitting movement shoulder joint without support physical active exercises include pendulum exercise used strengthen supraspinatus infraspinatus external rotation shoulder arm angle

treatment options include intraarticular corticosteroid injections relieve pain shortterm electrotherapy mobilizations home exercise programs longterm pain relief treatment rotator cuff tear include rest ice physical therapy andor review manual therapy exercise treatments found inconclusive evidence whether treatments better placebo however high quality evidence one trial suggested manual therapy exercise improved function slightly placebo weeks little different placebo terms patientimportant outcomes eg overall pain associated relatively frequent mild adverse rotator cuff includes muscles supraspinatus muscle infraspinatus muscle teres minor muscle subscapularis muscle upper arm consists deltoids biceps well triceps steps must taken precautions need made order rotator cuffs heal properly following surgery still maintaining function prevent deteriorating effects muscles immediate postoperative period within one week following surgery pain treated standard ice wrap also commercial devices available cool shoulder also exert pressure shoulder compressive cryotherapy however one study shown significant difference postoperative pain comparing devices standard ice physiotherapy help manage pain utilizing program involves continuous passive motion reduce pain even assisted passive motion low intensity allows tissues stretched slightly without damaging continuous passive motion improves shoulder range enables subject expand range motion without experiencing additional pain easing motions allow person continue working muscles keep undergoing atrophy also still

patient rotator cuff tendiopathy based low moderatequality evidence however strong evidence improving function surgical approaches include acromioplasty part bone removed decrease pressure placed rotator cuff tendons removal bursa inflamed swollen subacromial decompression removal tissue bone damaged order allow space surgery may recommended patients acute traumatic rotator cuff tear resulting substantial weaknesscitation needed surgery performed open arthroscopically although arthroscopic approach become much surgical option selected rehabilitation rotator cuff necessary order regain

consider utilizing orthotherapy daily lives orthotherapy exercise program aims restore motion strength shoulder patients go three phases orthotherapy help manage pain also recover full range motion rotator cuff first phase involves gentle stretches passive around movements people advised go degrees elevation prevent kind second phase regimen requires patients implement exercises strengthen
