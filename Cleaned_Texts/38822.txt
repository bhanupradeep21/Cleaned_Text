show symptoms disease well believed infected coming contact sick dogs following incidence reports virus possibly spreading two canines reporting alarming symptoms made public march cases infection reportedly spread although number thought closer approximately influenza viruses enveloped negative sense singlestranded rna genome analysis shown transferred horses dogs adapted dogs point mutations incubation period two five days viral shedding may occur seven ten days following onset induce persistent carrier statecitation needed late together bordetella bronchiseptica respiratory pathogens

together kennels doggy day care centers changing pet ownership behaviors also led overcrowded animal shelters emptied height infection canine influenza transmitted animal animal almost dogs come contact virus contract makes canine influenza common among dogs also transmitted cats shelter canine influenza airborne disease dog coughs sneezes secrete respiratory droplets inhaled animals causing kennels dog parks grooming parlors things alike high risk areas infected dogs show symptoms usually mild subclinical infections fatality rate greyhounds early outbreaks although overall fatality rate general pet shelter population probably less animals infected canine influenza show symptoms coughing runny nose fever lethargy eye discharge reduced appetite lasting anywhere symptoms mild form include cough lasts days possibly greenish nasal discharge dogs severe form may high fever pneumonia dogs caused influenza virus secondary bacterial infections fatality rate dogs develop pneumonia secondary canine influenza reach given proper necropsies dogs die disease revealed severe hemorrhagic pneumonia evidence presence upper respiratory tract infection dog vaccinated major causes kennel cough increases suspicion infection canine influenza especially areas disease documented serum sample dog suspected canine influenza submitted laboratory performs pcr tests june united states
