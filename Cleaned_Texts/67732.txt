biology coevolution occurs two species reciprocally affect others evolution process natural selection term sometimes used two traits species affecting others evolution well geneculture coevolution charles darwin mentioned evolutionary interactions flowering plants insects origin species although use word coevolution suggested plants insects could evolve reciprocal evolutionary changes
