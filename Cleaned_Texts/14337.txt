hox genes play massive role amphibians reptiles ability regenerate lost limbs especially hoxa hoxd processes involved forming new tissue reverseengineered humans may possible heal injuries spinal cord brain repair damaged organs reduce scarring fibrosis despite large conservation hox genes evolution mammals humans specifically regenerate limbs raises question humans also possess analog genes regrow
