liver tumors also known hepatic tumors abnormal growth liver cells liver several distinct types tumors develop liver liver made various cell liver tumors classified benign noncancerous malignant cancerous growths may discovered medical imaging even different reason cancer diagnosis often confirmed liver signs symptoms liver masses vary asymptomatic patients presenting abdominal mass hepatomegaly abdominal pain jaundice liver dysfunction treatment varies highly specific type liver liver tumors broadly classified benign malignant several types benign liver tumors caused either abnormal growth neoplastic cells response liver injury known regenerative one way categorize benign liver tumors anatomic source hepatocellular biliary cavernous hemangiomas also called hepatic hemangioma liver hemangioma common type benign liver tumor found made blood clusters surrounded endothelial hemangiomas get blood supply hepatic artery tumors common cause liver hemangiomas remains unknown however may congenital genetic known become malignant based available existing liver hemangiomas usually cause usually small sizes size tends remain stable however hemangioma large cause abdominal pain sense fullness right upper abdominal area heart problems coagulation cavernous hemangiomas diagnosed medical imaging usually need biopsy confirm given benign course often asymptomatic nature cavernous hemangiomas typically diagnosed incidentally eg medical imaging obtained another terms management usually monitored periodic imaging well closely person becomes cavernous hemangioma grows quickly patient symptomatic medical intervention therapies include open laparoscopic surgical resection arterial embolization radiofrequency terms complications hepatic hemangiomas rare hepatic

estimates indicating hepatocellular adenomas make liver common women using contraceptives hormone replacement therapies containing estrogen women pregnant people misusing also associated glycogen storage diseases subtypes iii newer studies suggesting diabetes obesity high blood pressure dyslipidemia risk factors hepatic hepatocellular adenomas often asymptomatic often found incidentally however signs symptoms present include nonspecific abdominal pain yellowing skin higher normal gamma glutamyl transferase alkaline phosphatase laboratory cases located right hepatic lobe frequently seen single size ranges difficult diagnosis imaging studies alone hard tell difference hepatocellular adenoma focal nodular hyperplasia hepatocellular molecular categorization via biopsy pathological analysis aids diagnosis understanding prognosis particularly hepatocellular adenomas potential become important note percutaneous biopsy avoided method lead bleeding rupture best way biopsy suspected hepatic adenoma via open laparoscopic excisional hepatocellular adenomas rare clear guidelines best course complications include malignant transformation spontaneous hemorrhage rupture considered determining treatment estimates indicate approximately hepatocellular adenomas undergo spontaneous evidence well elucidated best available data suggests risk hepatocellular adenoma becoming hepatocellular carcinoma malignant liver tumor transformation hepatocellular carcinoma common currently hepatic adenoma cm increasing size symptomatic lesions molecular markers associated hcc

tumor removed laparoscopically requires open surgical hepatocellular adenomas also known decrease size decreased estrogen steroids eg estrogencontaining contraceptives steroids stopped women childbearing age hepatic adenomas previously recommended avoid becoming pregnant altogether however currently individualized approach recommended takes account size adenoma whether surgical resection
