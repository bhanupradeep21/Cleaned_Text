alex benjamin novikoff february january russian empireborn american biologist recognized pioneering works discoveries cell organelles victim american cold war antagonism communism supported also recognized public figure century height mccarthyism original discoveries cell organelles autophagy earned scientists nobel prizes regarded one overlooked scientists get nobel novikoffs important achievements developing histochemical techniques used discovering used studying structures functions cells developed cell fractionation method became possible identify isolate cell organelles first describe lysosome using electron microscopy collaborator christian de duve received nobel prize discovery also first understand process cell eating called cytolysomes known autophagy another nobel prizewinning discovery developed method making liver cancer cells later called novikoff hepatoma paved way cellular experiments cancer studies accused participation communist party disloyalty nation novikoff dismissed university vermont college medicine serving tenured professor upon refusal cooperate disclosing communist friends even denied twice willingness serve us army second world war due lack substantial evidence case dismissed twenty years incident become popularly known novikoff affair notable case macarthyism vermont thirty years banishment university made apology presenting

skeleton skipped four grades completed high school fourteen years graduated bs degree columbia university age even financial constraints family encouraged study medicine however antisemitism time prevented entering medical school therefore pursued open opportunity continuing university study zoology joined graduate school completed still graduate school support studies novikoff worked parttime instructor new brooklyn college initial research focused experimental embryology soon interest shifted cell biology influence arthur age twentythree published first technical paper titled transplantation polar lobe sabellaria awarded phd good terms teachers administration brooklyn college promotion delayed year even new degree postdoc university wisconsin joined university vermont college medicine professor experimental pathology biochemistry expelled institute charges disloyalty nation joined faculty pathology newly established albert einstein college medicine becoming full professor worked rest career vermont novikoff successfully developed technique cell fractionation using separated cell fractions identified six cell organelles along two unidentified fractions christian de duve belgium became interested unknown fractions de duve proposed fraction contained membranebound particle specific enzymatic activity novikoff confirmed enzyme activity two met central park new york city discuss results confident membranous particles cell organelles de duve gave hypothetical name lysosomes reflect digestive year visiting de duves laboratory using histochemical protocol novikoff successfully produced first real images electron micrographs new organelle de duve confirmed location hydrolytic enzymes novikoff established importance lysosomes diseases largely due novikoffs bold imaginative use morphological techniques de duve praised lysosomes come recognized broader biological context de duve went win nobel prize physiology medicine discovery lysosomes novikoffs contributions novikoff described new class membranebound organelles called dense first describe actual lysosomal functions respect degradation mitochondria however thought digestive activities observed due intracellular organelles called ciba foundation symposium lysosomes held london february explained phenomenon organelles endoplasmic reticulum ribosomes mitochondria cell debris degraded autolysis cytolysomes following speaker de duve correctly identified organelles lysosomes named autophagic vacuoles introduced term autophagy process intracellular established first time functional relationship er golgi lysosomes specifically showed smoothsurfaced derivatives er fused golgi membranes golgi membranes turn fused first show gerl responsible vesicular transport synthesis sorting gave functional organisation acronym gerl golgiendoplasmic reticulumlysosome novikoffs works became milestone understanding importance autophagy diseases first establish type liver tumour known honour novikoff sidney goldfischer novikoff developed staining method golgi body using enzyme nucleosidediphosphatase described enzymatic property organelle first developed staining technique alkaline diaminobenzidine dab studied structure another new organelle peroxisome first gave first clearcut distinction lysosomes wife discovered new type peroxisomes intestinal epithelium rat named works cell biology best summed textbook wrote student eric holtzman cells organelles first published novikoff joined communist party working phd inspired scientific attitude marxism towards wellbeing society beside idealistic issues helped writing disseminating party newsletters brooklyn campus centre communist activity area became actively involved teachers union particularly fought stratification junior senior faculty college caused serious antagonism teachers administration new college president novikoff investigated affiliation communist party however action taken second world war voluntarily applied serve us military medical commission applications declined twice objections based allegations previous documents loyalty nation doubtful ironically employed us army war analyse two films enzyme carbohydrate metabolism even doubt loyalty resurfaced appointment terminated soon completed major permanent faculty university vermont college medicine time mccarthyism height

anticommunist even though committee chaired robert joyce voted novikoff remain profession emerson convinced board trustees override committees trustees therefore suspended novikoff july initially month walk talk ultimatum novikoff would return washington reveal names senate committee would dismissed university members universitys chapter american association university professors could convince borgmann august university bylaws suspend novikoff public hearing final hearing convened consisted board review included governor members board trustees several faculty members board meeting august voted recommend dismissal novikoff week later september fifteenmember board trustees confirmed firing university single dissenting vote robert case kept open twenty years found substantiated
