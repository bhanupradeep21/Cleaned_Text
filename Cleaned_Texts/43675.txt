dixeya nasuta species predatory gorgonopsian therapsids late permian east africa known fossils found tanzania species complicated taxonomic history originally named second species genus dixeya considered junior synonym aelurognathus nasuta however moved aelurognathus although instead tentatively referred arctognathus first since recognised belong genus either situation leaves dixeya nasuta without formal genus name proposed belong new distinct genus named njalila informally proposed species phd thesis name yet formally published currently nomen nudum nasuta characterised gorgonopsians combination straight snout profile upturned pinched nose curved jaw margin dixeya nasuta originally named german paleontologist friedrich von huene two skulls collected usili formation formerly known

sigogneaurussell reassigned quadrata aelurognathus quadrata systematic revision gorgonopsian taxonomy thus synonymising two genera however consider von huenes nasuta belong aelurognathus instead tentatively referred species arctognathus arctognathus furthermore sigogneau considered holotype quadrata malawi belong aelurognathus consider two additional specimens referred quadrata von huene tanzania belong species instead suggested may also referable arctognathus addition three tanzanian specimens mzc mzc mzc referred quadrata francis rex parrington nonetheless sigogneau cautious referral nasuta arctognathus previously acknowledged referral resolved matter especially opinion roof skull nasuta well preserved enough later researchers agreed sigogneaus doubts acknowledged nasuta compare well arctognathus eva gebauers unpublished phd thesis argued nasuta distinct gorgonopsians belonged new genus informally proposed nomen nudum njalila named njalila tributary rhuhu river tanzania gebauer proposed novel second species genus n insigna based skull previously referred another gorgonopsian scylacops capensis gebauer differentiated n insigna n nasuta possessing thicker arches skull openings posteriorly wider skull slightly rounded snout paleontologist christian f kammerer also agreed nasuta species arctognathus well tanzanian specimens quadrata likely belonged species however cautious regarding taxonomy noting gebauers proposal novel genus required study material needed rigorously phylogenetically tested first urged taxon referred dixeya nasuta taxonomy relations could resolved reportedly study dixeya nasuta known skull jaws measured roughly centimetres length midsized gorgonopsian relatively short compact snout compared similarly shortsnouted gorgonopsians arctognathus eriphostoma skull wide rear weakly flaring zygomatic arches little constriction snout behind canines skull appears much straightsided viewed also generally wider tall similarly profile skull along top snout also largely straight although tip characteristically turned sharp point nostrils positioned farforwards snout snout also distinctive unusual pinched appearance nasal bones along top snout broad constricted along middle furthermore septomaxilla small bone found around nostrils therapsids bulges strongly outwards behind nostrils rapidly hollows behind either side giving bridge nose pinched behind snout roof skull slightly concave rims orbits noticeably raised orbits proportionately large rounded face laterally temporal fenestra hole skull behind eye socket jaw muscle attachment also large subsequently bony arches surrounding separating openings eg suborbital arch postorbital bar proportionately slender thin parietal foramen third eye opening top skull large surrounded raised boss bone positioned back skull right occiput back face skull tall roughly rectangular shape slightly concave gently gorgonopsians nasuta large bladelike caniniform teeth incisor teeth five premaxilla however smaller related gorgonopsians four five small postcanine jawline maxilla upper jaw notably convex much exaggerated curve toothrow gorgonopsians except arctognathus exaggerated curvature due postcanine teeth housed raised bony flange maxilla behind maxilla also unusual groove postcanine teeth starting shallowly first postcanine running edge bone behind postcanine deepening along length like gorgonopsians nasuta also possessed palatal teeth three palatine two pterygoid bones weakly developed bosses supporting vomer roof mouth broad front narrows rapidly constricted splint halfway length resembles vomer derived rubidgeines narrower vomer earlier gorgonopsians vomer sports three ridges one middle two running along dentary bone lower jaw comparatively slender sloping mandibular symphysis nonetheless bears characteristic chin gorgonopsians reflected lamina angular bone towards back jaw moderately ridged comparison phylogenetic relationships dixeya nasuta njalila analysed gebauer unpublished phd thesis first computerised phylogenetic analysis gorgonopsians ever conducted gebauer found nasuta member family gorgonopsidae classification excluded basal genera gorgonopsians tree regarded plesiomorphic ie representing ancestral condition group within gorgonopsidae nasuta relatively derived member outside clade including giant derived rubidgeinae inostrancevia occupying part evolutionary grade ancestral results gebauer depicted cladogram notes reflecting notable taxonomic nomenclatural changes occurred years aloposaurus cyonosaurus aelurosaurus scylacognathusa eoarctopsb gorgonops njalila nasuta lycaenops arctognathus inostrancevia aelurognathus rubidgea sycosaurus clelandina analysis gebauer first major attempt perform phylogenetic analysis gorgonopsians however results borne subsequent independent analyses namely kammerer regarded gebauers analysis unsatisfactory citing many characters used analysis based upon skull proportions variable within taxa individually ontogenetically ie traits change growth example potential problem created highlighted basal position aloposaurus wastebasket taxon various immature gorgonopsians compared stratigraphically older morphologically basal eoarctops junior synonym eriphostoma found relatively derived nasuta yet included later phylogenetic analyses gorgonopsians kammerer commented generic status phylogenetic relationships amongst gorgonopsians needed study pending full redescription generic assignment could
