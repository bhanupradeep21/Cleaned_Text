likely around µgg whereas dose among users varies µgg blood according methedrone synthetic cathinone related parent compound cathinone methedrone belongs phenethylamine family due presence cyclic

furthermore mice also showed significant increase salivation head weaving stimulation methedrone currently legal drug many jurisdictions however studies show shares major pharmacological properties

methedrone led effects related addiction excessive salivation effect typically reported humans suggested methedrone increases salivation via brain systems primarily regulate autonomic compared mephedrone methylenedioxypyrovalerone mdpv methedrone relatively slow onset thereby increasing risk effects immediately shown could lead accidental overdose could also make drug less popular humans
