disease formerly known systemic disease chronic inflammatory condition characterized tissue infiltration lymphocytes plasma cells various degrees fibrosis scarring usually prompt response oral steroids approximately people disease serum concentrations elevated acute relapsingremitting disease associated tendency mass forming tissuedestructive lesions multiple sites characteristic histopathological appearance whichever site involved inflammation deposition connective tissue affected anatomical sites lead organ dysfunction organ failure even death early detection important avoid organ damage potentially serious treatment recommended symptomatic cases also asymptomatic involving certain anatomical disease described indolent condition although possibly based opinion rather objective assessments symptoms commonly described mild medical spite considerable underlying organ destruction people often described generally well time diagnosis although may give history weight loss pain generally feature inflammation however may occur secondary effect example due either obstruction compression laboratory levels greater moreover diagnosis made due presence painless swellings mass lesions due complications masses eg jaundice due involvement pancreas biliary tree liver symptoms commonly attributed conditions diagnoses may made years diagnosis eg urinary symptoms men attributed common prostate conditions lesions may also detected incidentally radiological images easily misdiagnosed malignanciescitation needed reported cases include significant symptoms findings however involve one multiple sites body multiorgan involvement sites involved affected time synchronously different unrelated periods metachronously several different diseases known many years considered manifestations include type autoimmune pancreatitis interstitial nephritis riedels thyroiditis mikuliczs disease küttners tumor inflammatory pseudotumors various sites body mediastinal fibrosis cases retroperitoneal complete list involve site body affected sites confirmed histology manifestations include hard small adrenal approximately cases exhibit increases blood eosinophil

histopathological features histopathological features associated article histological research cases küttners tumor known sialadenitis identified four distinct stages fibroinflammatory may reflect inflammatory process development fibrosis occurs organs involved diagnosis requires tissue biopsy affected organ characteristic histological findings comprehensive medical history physical examination physician astute new evolving connective tissue diseases serum immunoglobulin often elevated always case however blood lab levels greater considered evolving diagnostic criterion disease suspicion goal treatment induction maintenance remission prevent progression fibrosis organ destruction affected organs international panel experts developed recommendations management concluded cases symptomatic active treatment required cases asymptomatic also require treatment organs tend cause symptoms late stages disease urgent treatment advised certain organ manifestations aortitis retroperitoneal fibrosis proximal biliary strictures tubulointerstitial nephritis pachymeningitis pancreatic enlargement pericarditis untreated patients active disease recommended firstline agent induction remission glucocorticoids unless contraindications exist glucocorticoids characteristically result rapid often dramatic improvement clinical features often resolution radiographic features however advanced fibrotic lesions resulted irreversible damage response glucocorticoids current treatment options may poor even absent although validated yet clinical trials common induction regime prednisolone mg per day weeks gradually tapered months recurrences tapering glucocorticoids frequent however steroidsparing immunosuppressive agents might considered depending local availability drugs use combination glucocorticoids start treatment order reduce sideeffects prolonged glucocorticoid usage steroidsparing agents used include rituximab azathioprine methotrexate cyclophosphamide although trials needed ascertain effectiveness drug following successful induction remission maintenance therapy might given cases example high risk relapse patients organthreatening manifestations common maintenance therapy prednisolone mg per day use steroidsparing agent instead relapses common previous history relapse appears strong predictor future relapse relapse occurs therapy prolonged disease remission following initial glucocorticoid induction relapse usually managed successfully reinduction strategy using glucocorticoids introducing steroidsparing agent might also need considered relapses however none tested prospective controlled studies evidence efficacy beyond offered concomitant glucocorticoid therapy one retrospective cohort study baseline concentrations serum ige blood eosinophils found independently predictive relapse risk following treatment rituximab without glucocorticoids higher baseline values greater relapse risk shorter time organ involvement causes local mechanical problems organspecific interventions may necessary example tumefactive lesion causes obstruction bile duct may necessary insert biliary stent allow bile drain freely similarly ureteral vascular stents surgical resection radiotherapy may considered various different presenting problems research also underway evaluate effect safety plasmablastdirected therapy monoclonal antibody inhibits bcell function without depleting immune targets variable domain fc domain increased affinity recognition relatively recent limited studies epidemiology therefore difficult make accurate estimation prevalence furthermore age onset almost impossible estimate age diagnosis frequently misused age onset study estimated incidence japan population median age onset prior used get mentioned medical literature various different addition number historical reports literature disease associations retrospect likely different manifestations disease example banerjee et reported two patients autoimmune hepatitis febrile panniculitis occasion panniculitis responded increasing doses international symposium diseases archived wayback machine consensus name disease endorsed name already agreed upon consensus name among japanese notably choosing use term systemic might lead malignant tumours organs getting incorrectly diagnosed another manifestation however experts international symposium express reservations naming disease role pathogenesis questionable use serum concentrations biomarker expanded term immunoglobulin disease sometimes used however term never referenced recommendations use would appear erroneous
