lambeosaurines although complete skull known two groups hadrosaurs successively attached different cranial conformation aralosaurus one primitive lambeosaurine didnt crest skull roof latter modified accommodate structure instead hollow structure front orbits however fragment structure preserved size shape unfortunately contrast morphology skull roof arenysaurus clearly shows supported cranial crest arenysaurini crest yet discovered exact morphologies still precise classification canardia among hadrosaurs still uncertain based similarities maxillae canardia aralosaurus prietomarquez colleagues included two genera new group basal lambeosaurines called however different classification proposed longrich colleagues describing genus ajnabia morocco unlike previous studies divided european lambeosaurines different lineages lambeosaurini parasaurolophini tsintaosaurini aralosaurini study longrich et al considers european lambeosaurines form monophyletic clade named arenysaurini also includes newly described north african genus canardia identified particularly close aralosaurus occupies derive phylogenetic analyzes carried prietomárquez colleagues led following aralosaurus

lambeosaurini paleontologists agree probable asian origin european lambeosaurines according prietomarquez colleagues canardia spanish genus pararhabdodon closest relatives asian genera aralosaurus tsintaosaurus respectively respectively million years older presumed european relatives thus canardia pararhabdodon would belong rather archaic groups lambeosaurines time iberoarmorican island would constituted ultimate refuge ancient groups longrich colleagues place canardia european lambeosaurines arenysaurini clade also suggest asian origin paleogeographic lambeosaurines known rich localities late campanian early maastrichtian ages iberoarmorican island suggested ancestors canardia reach island rather late perhaps end early maastrichtian late discovery later spain numerous lambeosaurines remains highest levels lower maastrichtian argues first migration probably carried several stages firstly temporary terrestrial links landmass western asia eastern islands european archipelago
