infection ingesting microorganisms providing enzymes kill process characterizes neutrophils type neutrophils contain neutrophil extracellular traps nets composed granule nuclear constituents play role breaking killing bacteria invaded immune system nets composed activated neutrophils fragile structures consisting smooth stretches globular domains shown via highresolution scanning electron stimulation neutrophil response neutrophils lose shape allowing euchromatin heterochromatin homogenize later resulting mixing net components formation nets happens nuclear envelope granule membrane neutrophils disintegrates nets released cell membrane breaks resulting unique process cell death net structures neutrophils bind grampositive gramnegative bacteria well fungi confers broad specificity
