term autopoiesis greek αὐτo auto self ποίησις poiesis creation production refers system capable producing maintaining creating term introduced publication autopoiesis cognition realization living chilean biologists humberto maturana francisco varela define selfmaintaining chemistry living concept since applied fields cognition systems theory architecture sociology niklas luhmann briefly introduced concept autopoiesis organizational book autopoiesis cognition chilean biologists maturana varela described invented word circumstances analyzed quixotes dilemma whether follow path arms praxis action path letters poiesis creation production understood first time power word poiesis invented word needed autopoiesis word without history word could directly mean takes place dynamics autonomy proper living systems explained autopoietic machine machine organized defined unity network processes production transformation destruction components interactions transformations continuously regenerate realize network processes relations produced ii constitute machine concrete unity space components exist specifying topological domain realization network described space defined autopoietic system selfcontained space described using dimensions define another space refer interactions concrete autopoietic system however project system space manipulations make description autopoiesis originally presented system description said define explain nature living systems canonical example autopoietic system biological cell eukaryotic cell example made various biochemical components nucleic acids proteins organized bounded structures cell nucleus various organelles cell membrane cytoskeleton structures based internal flow molecules energy produce components turn continue maintain organized bounded structure gives rise components autopoietic system contrasted allopoietic system car factory uses raw materials components generate car organized structure something factory however system extended factory include components factorys environment supply chains plant equipment workers dealerships customers contracts competitors cars spare parts total viable system could considered course cells also require raw materials nutrients produce numerous products waste products extracellular matrix intracellular messaging molecules etc autopoiesis biological systems viewed network constraints work maintain concept called organizational constraint closely related study autocatalytic chemical networks constraints reactions required sustain life though others often used term synonym selforganization maturana stated would never use notion selforganization operationally impossible organization thing changes thing moreover autopoietic system autonomous operationally closed sense sufficient processes within maintain whole autopoietic systems structurally coupled medium embedded dynamic changes recalled sensorymotor continuous dynamic

abiogenesis molecules evolved complex cells could support development autopoiesis one several current theories life including tibor gánti hypercycle manfred eigen peter mr robert rosen autocatalytic stuart kauffman similar earlier proposal freeman including autopoiesis found original inspiration erwin schrödingers book first appear little common one another largely authors communicate one another none made reference principal publications theories nonetheless similarities may obvious first sight example gánti almost attempts compare different theories discuss together extensive discussion connection autopoiesis cognition provided evan thompson publication mind basic notion autopoiesis involving constructive interaction environment extended include cognition initially maturana defined cognition behavior organism relevance maintenance however computer models selfmaintaining noncognitive devised additional restrictions needed suggestion maintenance process cognitive involves readjustment internal workings system metabolic process basis claimed autopoiesis necessary sufficient condition thompson wrote distinction may may fruitful matters living systems involve autopoiesis necessary add point cognition noted definition cognition restricted necessarily entail awareness consciousness living system connection autopoiesis cognition necessary living systems cognition objective assessment ascertainable observation living system one question arises connection cognition seen manner consciousness separation cognition consciousness recognizes organism may unaware
