kettlewells experiment biological experiment study evolutionary mechanism industrial melanism peppered moth biston executed bernard kettlewell working research fellow department zoology university oxford investigating cause appearance darkcoloured moth since industrial revolution england century conducted first experiment polluted woodland birmingham second experiment birmingham well clean woods dorset experiment found birds selectively prey peppered moths depending body colour relation environmental background thus evolution darkcoloured body provided survival advantage polluted locality study concluded industrial melanism moths striking evolutionary phenomenon ever actually witnessed organism animal regarded classic demonstration charles darwins natural selection action one

peppered moth manchester end century recorded black moth carbonaria type outnumbered regions natural white ones named conflicting ideas biological basis industrial melanism humidity environment

reproductive cycle year would take generations produce dominant melanic black forms melanic population could dominate entire moth population generations concluded probable explanation intense degree natural university oxford zoologist e b ford supported birdpredation hypothesis experimentally investigate issue recruited bernard kettlewell grant nuffield time kettlewell known england three varieties peppered moth normal typica whitishgrey colour dark speckles wings colour perfect camouflage lightcoloured trees covered lichens new form carbonaria completely black intermediate form called insularia lightcoloured speckled wings distinct typica whitish moths active night rested tree trunks boughs main experiment called markreleaserecapture started summer lasted three years consists two continuous phases kettlewell first devised standard procedure scoring moths necessary determine far apart moths placed indistinguishable backgrounds correct separation would result effective selective predation birds moths close birds would able differentiate even well camouflaged tested scoring method woodlands near birmingham releasing peppered moths consisting typica carbonaria insularia aviary research station madingley cambridge aviary released moths allowed two great tits parus major prey upon found initial procedure failed birds actively looked moth regardless colour background succeeded using freshly captured moths consisting black white types released separately found birds preferentially caught moths according background colour moths first experimental site kettlewell chose christopher cadbury bird reserve near rubery birmingham heavily polluted still inhabited number bird species caught three types peppered moth marked underneath wings cellulose paint would able identify later nonexperimental individuals recapture started capturing moths night june lasted till july total capture selected carbonaria typica insularia male moths released woods within two days moths recaptured carbonaria typica insularia total capture release nonexperimental moths ie bearing paint marks thus survival values respectively shows black moths best survival advantage darkened polluted compare conditions predation different environments kettlewell planned perform similar experiment polluted clean environments surveyed several woodlands including devon cornwall found unsuitable presence carbonaria forms indicated unclean environment finally went deanend wood dorset well covered lichens found white type including insularia form indicating clean environment midjune started experiment brought along carbonaria type several days found total moths eaten birds wild black type white type releaseandrecapture experiment days used moths recapture rate white type black immediately completion headed back birmingham accompanied renowned ethologist niko tinbergen tinbergen responsible filming experiment particularly verify whether birds main predators moths released
