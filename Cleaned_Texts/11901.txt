ameloblastoma rare benign cancerous tumor odontogenic epithelium ameloblasts outside portion teeth development much commonly appearing lower jaw upper recognized type odontogenic neoplasm designated adamantinoma french physician louischarles finally renamed modern name ameloblastoma ivey tumors rarely malignant metastatic rarely spread parts body progress slowly resulting lesions cause severe abnormalities face jaw leading severe disfiguration additionally abnormal cell growth easily infiltrates destroys surrounding bony tissues wide surgical excision required treat disorder aggressive tumor left untreated obstruct nasal oral airways making impossible breathe without oropharyngeal intervention term ameloblastoma early english word amel meaning enamel greek word blastos meaning four types ameloblastoma described previously known solidmulticystic ameloblastoma usually presents multiple large cystic areas ameloblastoma single cyst cavity account around ameloblastomas present younger patients second third decades life often relation unerupted third histologically atypical ameloblastoma rarely lead metastasis usually lung metastasis look histologically identical primary tumour benign peripheral subtype composes ameloblastomas found maxilla mandible although situated mandible posterior ramus area frequent neoplasms often associated presence unerupted teeth displacement adjacent teeth resorption symptoms include slowgrowing painless swelling leading facial deformity swelling gets progressively larger impinge structures resulting loose teeth malocclusion bone also perforated leading soft tissue lesion tendency expand bony cortices slow growth rate lesion allows time periosteum develop thin shell bone ahead expanding lesion shell bone cracks palpated phenomenon referred egg shell cracking crepitus important diagnostic feature maxillary ameloblastomas dangerous even lethal due thin bone weak barriers neoplasm extend sinonasal passages pterygomaxillary fossa eventually cranium rare orbital invasion neoplasm also conventional ameloblastomas cystic solid neoplastic structures solid areas contain fibrous tissue islands epithelium interconnect strands sheets epithelial cells tend move nucleus away basement membrane opposite pole cell process called reverse polarization two main histological patterns often occur follicular plexiform less common histological variants include acanthomatous basal cell granular cell common follicular type outer arrangement columnar palisaded ameloblastslike cells inner zone triangular shaped cells resembling stellate reticulum bell stage tooth plexiform type epithelium proliferates fish net pattern plexiform ameloblastoma shows epithelium proliferating cord like fashion hence name plexiform layers cells proliferating epithelium wellformed desmosomal junctions simulating spindle cell layers ameloblasts cells less large cysts centimetres diameter found follicular type cysts develop stellate reticulum plexiform type cysts caused degeneration connective tissue distinctive histological variant conventional ameloblastoma found near equal frequencies maxilla mandible resemble fibroosseous lesion obvious ameloblasts whilst dominated dense collagenous tissue one center desmoplastic ameloblastomas represented ameloblastomas systematic review showed predilection males predominance fourth fifth decades life desmoplastic ameloblastomas showed mandibular involvement tendency anterior region majority tumours found illdefined margins ameloblastoma tentatively diagnosed radiographic examination must confirmed histological examination radiographically tumour area appears rounded welldefined lucency bone varying size features numerous cystlike radiolucent areas seen larger tumours multilocular giving characteristic soap bubble appearance single radiolucent area seen smaller tumours radiodensity ameloblastoma hounsfield units keratocystic odontogenic tumours however ameloblastomas show bone expansion seldom show high density lingual plate expansion helpful diagnosing ameloblastoma cysts rarely resorption roots involved teeth seen cases unique chemotherapy radiation therapy curettage liquid nitrogen rarely effective cases ameloblastoma surgical resection enucleation remains definitive treatment condition however detailed study patients chemotherapy radiation therapy contraindicated treatment thus surgery common treatment neoplasm case giant ameloblastoma recently reported managed total mandibulectomy pectoralis major myocutaneous flap systematic review found desmoplastic ameloblastoma cases treated resection conservative treatment requires careful case aim treatment surgery remove entire tumour margin surrounding tissue block resection good preferable removal includes normal bone around neoplasm larger ameloblastomas require partial resection jaw bone followed bone evidence treatment conventional ameloblastoma best done bone systematic review found desmoplastic ameloblastoma cases treated smaller mandibular neoplasms enucleated cavity tumour curetted allowing preservation bone cortex lower border mandible although recurrence rate type treatment higher unicystic intraluminal unicystic plexiform unicystic ameloblastomas enucleated epithelium limited inner cyst wall radiation ineffective many cases also reports sarcoma induced result using radiation treat chemotherapy also often however controversy regarding indication ameloblastomas might responsive radiation previously persistent followup examination including radiographs essential managing followup occur regular intervals least follow important recurrences occur within years recurrence common although recurrence rates block resection followed bone graft lower enucleation follicular variants appear recur plexiform unicystic lesions recur less frequently nonunicystic low recurrence rate around seen unicystic recurrence within bone graft following resection original tumor occur less seeding bone graft suspected cause recurrences cases seem stem soft tissues especially adjacent recurrence reported occur many years reduce likelihood recurrence within grafted bone meticulous attention adjacent soft tissues braf gene smo gene mutations found ameloblastomas mutation also seen malignant benign neoplasms activate map kinase pathway required cell division differentiation commonly seen mutation braf mutations found recent study discovered high frequency braf mutations samples conventional ameloblastoma data suggests drugs targeting mutant braf potential novel therapies smo mutations lead activation hedgehog pathway giving similar results less frequently smo mutations found evidence shows suppression matrix may inhibit local invasiveness ameloblastoma however demonstrated also research suggesting integrin may participate local invasiveness people african heritage shown higher incidence compared caucasians site often midline annual incidence rates per million ameloblastomas black males black females white males white females ameloblastomas account one percent oral odontogenic men women equally affected though women average four
