immunohistochemistry ihc common application immunostaining involves process selectively identifying antigens proteins cells tissue section exploiting principle antibodies binding specifically antigens biological ihc takes name roots immuno reference antibodies used procedure histo meaning tissue compare immunocytochemistry albert coons conceptualized first implemented procedure visualising antibodyantigen interaction accomplished number ways mainly either following immunohistochemical staining widely used diagnosis abnormal cells found cancerous tumors specific molecular markers characteristic particular cellular events proliferation cell death immunohistochemistry also widely used basic research understand distribution localization biomarkers differentially expressed proteins different parts biological tissue preparation sample critical maintaining cell morphology tissue architecture antigenicity target epitopes requires proper tissue collection fixation sectioning solution formalin often used fix tissue methods may used tissue may sliced used whole dependent upon purpose experiment tissue sectioning tissue sample may embedded medium like paraffin wax cryomedia sections sliced variety instruments including rotary microtomes vibratomes precisionary instruments leica specimens typically sliced range Î¼mcitation needed slices mounted slides dehydrated using alcohol washes increasing concentrations eg cleared using solvent like xylene imaged microscope depending method fixation tissue preservation sample may require additional steps make epitopes available antibody binding including deparaffinization antigen retrieval formalinfixed paraffinembedded tissues antigenretrieval often necessary involves pretreating sections heat steps may make difference target antigens staining staining depending tissue type method antigen detection endogenous biotin enzymes may need blocked quenched respectively prior antibody staining although antibodies show preferential avidity specific epitopes may partially weakly bind sites nonspecific proteins also called reactive sites similar cognate binding sites target antigen great amount nonspecific binding causes high background staining mask detection target antigen reduce background staining ihc icc immunostaining methods samples incubated buffer blocks reactive sites primary secondary
