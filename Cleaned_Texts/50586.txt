pathophysiology acute respiratory distress syndrome involves fluid accumulation lungs explained heart failure noncardiogenic pulmonary edema typically provoked acute injury lungs results flooding lungs microscopic air sacs responsible exchange gases oxygen carbon dioxide capillaries additional common findings ards include partial collapse lungs atelectasis low levels oxygen blood hypoxemia clinical syndrome associated pathological findings including pneumonia eosinophilic pneumonia cryptogenic organizing pneumonia acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia diffuse alveolar damage dad pathology commonly associated ards dad characterized diffuse inflammation lung tissue triggering insult tissue usually results initial release chemical signals inflammatory mediators secreted local epithelial endothelial cells neutrophils tlymphocytes quickly migrate inflamed lung tissue contribute amplification phenomenon typical histological presentation involves diffuse alveolar damage hyaline membrane formation alveolar walls although triggering mechanisms completely understood recent research examined role inflammation mechanical stress inflammation caused sepsis causes endothelial cell dysfunction fluid leakage capillaries impairs drainage fluid lungs elevated inspired oxygen concentration often becomes necessary stage may facilitate respiratory burst immune cells secondary phase endothelial cell dysfunction causes cells inflammatory exudate enter alveoli pulmonary edema increases thickness layer separating blood capillary space air sacs increases distance oxygen must diffuse reach blood impairs gas exchange leads hypoxia increased work breathing eventually induces scarring air sacs lungscitation needed fluid accumulation lungs decreased surfactant production type ii pneumocytes may cause whole air sacs collapse completely fill fluid loss aeration contributes righttoleft shunt ards traditional righttoleft shunt refers blood passing right side heart left side without traveling capillaries lung oxygen eg seen patent foramen ovale ards lung righttoleft shunting occurs within lungs since blood right side heart enter capillaries exchange gas damaged air sacs full fluid debris ards alveoli contain progressively less gas blood flowing alveolar capillaries progressively less oxygenated resulting massive shunting within lung collapse air sacs small airways interferes process normal gas exchange common see patients mmhg kpa despite mechanical ventilation inspired oxygencitation needed loss aeration may follow different patterns depending upon nature underlying disease factors usually distributed lower lobes lungs posterior segments roughly correspond initial infected area sepsis traumainduced ards infiltrates usually patchy diffuse posterior basal segments always affected distribution even less homogeneous loss aeration also causes important changesvague lung mechanical properties fundamental process inflammation amplification
