current research fields sensory processing multisensory integration aiming hopefully unlock mysteries behind concept brain lateralization research sensory processing much offer towards understanding function brain whole primary task multisensory integration figure sort vast quantities sensory information body multiple sensory modalities modalities independent also quite complementary one sensory modality may give information one part situation another modality pick necessary information bringing information together facilitates better understanding physical world around us may seem redundant provided multiple sensory inputs object necessarily case socalled redundant information fact verification experiencing fact happening perceptions world based models build world sensory information informs models information also confuse models sensory illusions occur models match example visual system may fool us one case auditory system bring us back ground reality prevents sensory misrepresentations combination multiple sensory modalities model create much robust gives better assessment situation thinking logically far easier fool one sense simultaneously fool two senses one earliest sensations olfactory sensation evolutionary gustation olfaction developed together multisensory integration necessary early humans order ensure receiving proper nutrition food also make sure consuming poisonous materialscitation needed several sensory integrations developed early human evolutionary time line integration vision audition necessary spatial mapping integration vision tactile sensations developed along finer motor skills including better handeye coordination humans developed bipedal organisms balance became exponentially essential survival multisensory integration visual inputs vestibular balance inputs proprioception inputs played important role development upright walkers perhaps one studied sensory integrations relationship vision two senses perceive objects world different ways combining two help us understand information vision dominates perception world around us visual spatial information one reliable sensory modalities visual stimuli recorded directly onto retina external distortions provide incorrect information brain true location spatial information reliable visual spatial information example consider auditory spatial input location object sometimes determined solely sound sensory input easily modified altered thus giving less reliable spatial representation auditory information therefore spatially represented unlike visual stimuli one spatial mapping visual information multisensory integration helps bring information visual auditory stimuli together make robust mapping studies done show dynamic neural mechanism exists matching auditory visual inputs event stimulates multiple one example observed brain compensates target distance speaking someone watching something happen auditory visual signals processed concurrently perceived kind multisensory integration lead slight misperceptions visualauditory system form ventriloquism example ventriloquism effect person television appears voice coming mouth rather televisions speakers occurs preexisting spatial representation within brain programmed think voices come another humans mouth makes visual response audio input spatially misrepresented therefore misaligned hand eye coordination one example sensory integration case require tight integration visually perceive object tactilely perceive object two senses combined within brain one would less ability manipulate object coordination tactile sensation context visual system visual system static move around much hands parts used tactile sensory collection freely move around movement hands must included mapping tactile visual sensations otherwise one would able comprehend moving hands touching looking example happening looking infant infant picks objects puts mouth touches feet face actions culminating formation spatial maps brain realization hey thing thats moving object actually part seeing thing feeling major step mapping required infants begin realize move arms interact object earliest explicit way experiencing sensory integration future research sensory integration used better understand different sensory modalities incorporated within brain help us perform even simplest tasks example currently understanding needed comprehend neural circuits transform sensory cues changes motor activities research done sensorimotor system help understand movements understanding potentially used learn make better prosthetics eventually help patients lost use limb also learning different sensory inputs combine profound effects new engineering approaches using robotics robots sensory devices may take
