processing fluency ease information processed perceptual fluency ease processing stimuli based manipulations perceptual quality retrieval fluency ease information retrieved research cognitive neuroscience psychology shown processing fluency influences different kinds judgments instance perceptual fluency contribute experience familiarity fluent processing attributed past repeating presentation stimulus also known priming one method enhancing fluency jacoby dallas argued items past experience processed becomes learned experience throughout lifetime fluent items attributed past therefore people sometimes take fluency indication stimulus familiar even though sense familiarity perceptual fluency literature dominated research posits fluency leads familiarity behavioral measures fluency temporal resolution properly investigate interaction fluency familiarity eventrelated potentials erps method averaging brainwaves successful dissociating different cognitive mechanisms due small time scale brainwaves one study able use manipulation visual clarity change perceptual fluency recognition task manipulation effected erps fluency familiarity different times locations brain leading believe two mechanisms come evidence shown artificial techniques used trick people believing encountered stimulus previously one participants presented symbols consisted highly familiar symbols less familiar symbols novel symbols participants required report whether encountered symbols presented experiment millisecond flash preceded symbol different symbol flashed found brief flash stimulus boosted fluency target item symbol flashed participants ratings encountered symbol previously increased example illustrates fluent processing induce feeling familiarity fluency familiarity shown lead mere exposure effect research found repetition stimulus lead fluent processing leads feeling experiment participants presented unfamiliar faces either three nine times presentation pairs faces shown participants consisting old new face results showed participants gave higher rates liking repeated faces mere exposure effect eliminated fluent processing disrupted topolinski et al explained fluency created pronunciation plays vital role increasing fondness stimulus participants shown unfamiliar adverts cinema control group watched adverts sugar cube mouth therefore interference pronunciation control group experimental group watched adverts whilst eating popcorn meant oral interference one week later participants rated liking products control group mere exposure effect observed old products higher ratings new products experimental group mere exposure effect abolished interfering fluency pronunciation presentation stimulus later research observed high perceptual fluency increases experience positive research psychophysiological methods corroborated positive effect affective experience easytoperceive stimuli judged positively increased activation zygomaticus major muscle socalled smiling notion processing fluency inherently positive led processing fluency theory aesthetic used explain peoples negative reactions towards migrants appear difficult process research relating processing fluency product design shown form product highly unusual becomes difficult process viewed less favourably fluent significant evidence consumers presented multiple choices view objects positively aesthetically pleasing surrounded congruent consumers enjoy moderate source incongruity much disorder unfamiliarity lead feelings fluent product design shown encourage consumers engage approach activities touching spending extended time viewing product studies shown presenting people factual statement manipulations make statement easier mentally totally nonsubstantive changes like writing cleaner font making rhyme simply repeating alter judgment truth statement along evaluation intelligence statements called illusion truth effect multiple studies found subjects likely judge easytoread statements means perceived beauty judged truth common underlying experience namely processing fluency indeed experiments showed beauty used indication correctness mathematical solutions supports idea beauty intuitively seen processing fluency may one foundations aha truth effect induced colour differences statements well participants presented statements true rest false half statements presented high contrast colours half presented low contrast colours independent truth participants judged high contrast statements true participants also quicker make judgements high contrast statements compared low contrast statements contrast differences statements increased fluency fluency shown affect judgements humour one participants presented jokes easy read hard read fonts participants asked rate jokes believed humorous participants gave higher ratings jokes easy read fonts predicted jokes easy read fonts feel fluent easier pronounce results higher fluent processing misattributed humour statement high processing fluency indicates interaction person environment goes person need pay particular attention environment contrast low processing fluency means problems interaction environment requires attention analytical processing style solve problem indeed people process information shallowly processing fluency high employ analytical thinking style processing fluency study demonstrated longknown effect illegible handwriting essay grading mediated lack processing fluency example negative stereotypes related illegible
