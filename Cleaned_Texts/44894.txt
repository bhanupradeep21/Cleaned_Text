satisficing decisionmaking strategy cognitive heuristic entails searching available alternatives acceptability threshold term satisficing portmanteau satisfy introduced herbert simon although concept first posited book administrative simon used satisficing explain behavior decision makers circumstances optimal solution determined maintained many natural problems characterized computational intractability lack information preclude use mathematical optimization procedures observed nobel prize economics speech decision makers satisfice either finding optimum solutions simplified world finding satisfactory solutions realistic world neither approach general dominates continued coexist world management simon formulated concept within novel approach rationality posits rational choice theory unrealistic description human decision processes calls psychological realism referred approach bounded rationality consequentialist theories moral philosophy use concept satisficing sense though call optimization instead decision making satisficing refers use aspiration levels choosing different paths action account decisionmakers select first option meets given need select option seems address needs rather optimal solution crucial determinant satisficing decision strategy concerns construction aspiration level many circumstances individual may uncertain aspiration level another key issue concerns evaluation satisficing strategies although often regarded inferior decision strategy specific satisficing strategies inference shown ecologically rational particular decision environments outperform alternative decision satisficing also occurs consensus building group looks towards solution everyone agree even may best one popular method rationalizing satisficing optimization costs including cost optimization calculations cost getting information use calculations considered result eventual choice usually suboptimal regard main goal optimization ie different optimum case costs choosing taken account alternatively satisficing considered constraint satisfaction process finding solution satisfying set constraints without concern finding optimum satisficing problem formulated equivalent optimization problem using indicator function satisficing requirements objective function formally x denotes set options x denotes set satisficing options selecting satisficing solution element equivalent following optimization problem denotes indicator function solution x optimization problem optimal satisficing option element thus decision theory point view distinction optimizing satisficing essentially stylistic issue nevertheless important certain applications rather substantive issue important determine optimized satisficed following quote jan odhnoffs paper opinion room optimizing satisficing models business economics unfortunately difference optimizing satisficing often referred difference quality certain choice triviality optimal result optimization unsatisfactory result satisficing model best things would therefore avoid general use two words economics satisficing behavior attempts achieve least minimum level particular variable

actions set options us u ie set options yield maximum payoff assume set least one element idea aspiration level introduced herbert simon developed economics richard cyert james march book behavioral theory aspiration level payoff agent aspires agent achieves least level satisfied achieve agent satisfied let us define aspiration level assume u clearly whilst possible someone aspire something better optimum sense irrational require aspiration level optimum payoff define set satisficing options options yield least us clearly since u follows set optimum actions subset set satisficing options agent satisfices choose larger set actions agent optimizes one way looking satisficing agent putting effort get precise optimum unable exclude actions optimum still aspiration equivalent way looking

aspiration level stay unlike optimizing firm would always strive earn highest profits possible however firms earning aspiration try something else get situation attain aspiration level shown economy satisficing leads collusion amongst firms competition firms leads lower profits one firms duopoly means competition unstable one firms fail achieve aspirations hence try something else situation stable one firms achieve aspirations happen firms earn average profits general happen firms earn jointprofit maximizing collusive research suggested satisficingmaximizing decisionmaking strategies
