pollen dna barcoding process identifying pollen donor plant species amplification sequencing specific conserved regions plant dna able accurately identify pollen wide range applications though difficult past due limitations microscopic identification pollen identified using dna barcoding involves specific targeting gene regions found plant species high variation members different species unique sequence base pairs species within target regions used identifying feature applications pollen dna barcoding range forensics food safety conservation fields benefits creation plant barcode

patternrecognition software researchers developed software characterize microscopic pollen images based texture several different regions plant dna used targets genetic barcoding including combination rbcl matk recommended use plant dna barcoding found trnl better degraded dna better differentiating species within able identify pollen especially important study pollination networks made interactions plants animals facilitate identifying pollen carried insects helps scientists understand plants visited insects insects also homologous features making difficult identify sometimes identified genetic usually every insect visits flower necessarily many lack features hairs allowing carry pollen others avoid pollenladen anthers steal nectar pollination networks made accurate including pollen carried insects scientists argue pollination effectiveness pe measured studying germination rates seeds produced flowers visited single animal best way determine animals important though scientists used dna barcoding determine genetic origin pollen found insects argued conjunction traits good indication pollination studying composition structure pollination networks conservationists understand stability pollination network identify species important risk leading pollinator another advantage pollen dna barcoding used determine source pollen found museum specimens records insectplant interactions compared modernday interactions see pollination networks changed due global warming land use change factors accurately able identify pollen found evidence helps forensic investigators identify regions evidence originated based plants endemic addition atmospheric pollen originating illegal cannabis farms successfully detected future could allow law enforcement officials narrow search areas illegal farms due hardy structure pollen evolved survive transported sometimes great distances keeping internal genetic information intact origin pollen found mixed ancient substrates often determined dna barcoding honeybees carry pollen well nectar used production honey food quality safety concerns important understand plant providence humanconsumed bee products
