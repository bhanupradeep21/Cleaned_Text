herd social group certain animals species either wild domestic form collective animal behavior associated called herding animals known gregarious animals term herd generally applied mammals particularly grazing ungulates classically display behaviour different terms used similar groupings species case birds example word flocking flock may also used mammals particularly sheep goats large groups carnivores usually called packs nature herd classically subject predation pack hunters special collective nouns may used particular taxa example flock geese flight sometimes called gaggle theoretical discussions behavioural ecology generic term herd used kinds assemblagecitation needed word herd noun also refer one controls possesses care groups animals domesticated examples herds

time occur result planning coordination rather individual choosing behaviour correspondence members possibly imitation possibly responding external circumstances herd contrasted coordinated group individuals distinct roles many human groupings army detachments sports teams show coordination differentiation roles animal groupings eusocial insects coordinated pheromones forms animal communication herd definition relatively unstructured however may animals tend imitated bulk herd others animal role called control animal since behaviour predict herd whole assumed however control animal deliberately taking leadership role control animals necessarily socially dominant conflict situations though often group size important characteristic social environment gregarious species reason animals form herds always stated easily since underlying mechanisms diverse complex understanding social behaviour animals formation groups fundamental goal field sociobiology behavioural ecology theoretical framework focused costs benefits associated living groups terms fitness individual compared living solitarily living groups evolved independently multiple times various taxa occur benefits outweigh costs within evolutionary timescale thus animals form groups whenever increases fitness compared living following includes outline major effects determining tradeoffs living groups perhaps studied effect herds socalled dilution effect key argument risk preyed upon particular individual smaller within larger group strictly due fact predator decide individual attack although dilution effect influenced socalled selfish herding primarily direct effect group size instead position within herd greater group sizes result higher visibility detection rates predators relation directly proportional saturates point risk attacked individual directly proportional group size thus net effect individual group concerning predation risk whenever groups shoals fish synchronize movements becomes harder predators focus particular individuals however animals weak slower periphery preferred predators certain positions within group better others see selfish herd theory fit animals group vulnerable individuals may thus decrease chance preyed upon even effect collective vigilance social groups widely studied within framework optimal foraging theory animal decision making animals risk predation feeding resting stay vigilant watch predators could shown many studies especially birds increase group size individual animals less attentive overall vigilance suffers little many eyes effect means food intake activities related fitness optimized terms time allocation animals stay however details concepts remain unclear first detect predators react accordingly advantageous implying individuals may fully able rely group moreover competition food lead misuse warning calls observed great tits food scarce monopolized dominant birds birds mainly subordinates use antipredatory warning calls induce interruption feeding gain access another study concerning flock geese suggested benefits lower vigilance concerned central positions due fact possibly vulnerable individuals flocks periphery greater need stay attentive implies decrease overall vigilance arises simply geese edge flock comprise smaller group groups get large special case collective vigilance groups sentinels individuals take turn keeping guard others participate thus strength social bonds trust within groups much higher former cases hunting together enables groupliving predators wolves wild dogs catch large prey unable achieve hunting alone working together significantly improves foraging efficiency meaning net energy gain individual increased animals feeding collectively example group spinner dolphins able corral fish smaller volume makes catching easier less opportunity fish escape furthermore large groups able monopolize resources defend solitary animals smaller groups different species shown larger groups lions tend successful protecting prey hyenas smaller able communicate location type food group members may increase chance individual find profitable food sources mechanism known used bees via waggle dance several species birds using specific vocalisations indicate food terms optimal foraging theory animals always try maximize net energy gain feeding positively correlated fitness energy requirement fixed additional energy increasing fitness use little time foraging possible time minimizers hand time allocated foraging fixed animals gain fitness related quantity quality resources feeds energy since foraging may energetically costly searching hunting handling etc may induce risk predation animals groups may advantage since combined effort locating handling food reduce time needed forage sufficiently thus animals groups may shorter searching handling times well increased chance finding monopolizing highly profitable food makes foraging groups beneficial time minimizers energy maximizers obvious disadvantage foraging groups scramble direct competition group members general clear amount resources available individual decreases group size resource availability critical competition within group may get intense animals longer experience benefits living groups however relative importance within betweengroup competition determines optimal group size ultimately decision individual whether stay since animals groups stay near interact frequently infectious diseases parasites spread much easier compared solitary animals studies shown positive correlation herd size intensity infections extent sometimes drastic reduction fitness governs group size structure still however animals found countermeasures propolis beehives grooming social animals staying together groups often brings energetic advantages birds flying together flock use aerodynamic effects reduce energetic costs eg positioning v shaped similar effect observed fish swim together fixed formations another benefit group living occurs climate harsh cold staying close together animals experience better thermoregulation overall surface volume ratio reduced consequently maintaining adequate body temperatures becomes less energetically collective force group mobbing predators reduce risk predation significantly flocks raven able actively defend eagles baboons collectively mob lions impossible individuals alone behaviour may based reciprocal altruism meaning animals likely help conspecifics animals living groups likely find mates living solitary
