nuclear dimorphism term referred special characteristic two different kinds nuclei cell many differences types nuclei feature observed protozoan ciliates like tetrahymena foraminifera ciliates contain two nucleus types macronucleus primarily used control metabolism micronucleus performs reproductive functions generates macronucleus compositions nuclear pore complexes help determine properties macronucleus nuclear dimorphism subject complex epigenetic controls nuclear dimorphism continuously studied understand exactly mechanism works beneficial cells learning nuclear dimorphism beneficial understanding old eukaryotic mechanisms preserved within unicellular organisms evolve multicellular ciliated protozoan tetrahymena useful research model studying nuclear dimorphism maintains two distinct nuclear genomes micronucleus macronucleus macronucleus micronucleus located cytoplasm however micronucleus genome contains five chromosomes undergo mitosis micronuclear division meiosis conjugation sexual division micronucleus macronuclear genome broken catabolized per life cycle conjugation allowing sitespecific new macronucleus differentiates mitotic descendant conjugated differences division overall processes show functionally structurally different molecules differences play active role activities functions cells located macronuclei micronuclei differ functions even though located within cell micronucleus globally repressed vegetative state serves diploid germline nucleus whereas known vegetative gene expression happens macronucleus polyploid somatic micronucleus divides micronucleus state vegetative growth macronucleus active transcription also aids activity control cytoplasm along nuclear events happen within cell micronucleus chromatin densely packed well absence micronucleus forms zygotic nuclei meiosis conjugation zygotic nuclei follow process differentiate macronucleus micronucleus cells macronucleus cells hand differentiate changes dna leads macronucleus cells huge compared micronucleus cells hence naming macro recent research shown nuclear pore complexes binucleated ciliate may distinct composition leads differences seen micronucleus macronucleus nuclear pore complex made nucleoporins proteins nucleoporins nups specific type nucleus leads structural differences seen two types since nuclei made components different amounts components added order provide structural differences necessary functions nuclear pore complex involved molecules move across nuclear envelope trying reach nucleus cytoplasm process called nucleocytoplasmic nuclear pore complexes found important transport macronucleus micronucleus since different processes happening two different nuclei different times differences transport apparatuses two nuclei lead vast differences micronucleus previously mentioned research done involving tetrahymena unicellular eukaryote eukaryote interesting mechanisms impact function research done investigate mechanisms led new discoveries properties eukaryote general properties nuclear dimorphism tetrahymena two major parts life cycle asexual reproduction stage involving binary fission well nonreproductive sexual stage called conjugation conjugation stage micronucleus cell undergoes meiosis binary fission macronucleus divides amitotically micronucleus cell divides mitotically differences play role differences macronucleus micronucleus cells well provide difference vegetative genomes conjugation nuclei selected nuclei destroyed via mechanism called programmed nuclear since conjugation different steps leads differences micronucleus macronucleus towards end conjugation changes remain throughout unique biological biochemical differences micronucleus macronucleus three ways genetic information distributed nuclear division include meiosis micronucleus cells amitosis micronucleus cells mitosis micronucleus cells micronucleus cell meiosis involves stretching genome outside cell macronucleus cell amitosis involves random distribution recent research focused causes differences micronucleus macronucleus functional differences micronucleus macronucleus attributed selectivity transport across nuclear membrane time continues topic interest research along continuing research molecules pass depends nuclear pores macronucleus micronucleus macronucleus pores allow bigger molecules enter compared micronucleus pores difference thought attributed makeup proteins nuclear pore complex arrangement two nuclei another recently experimentally tested difference micronucleus macronucleus specificity comes specific proteins different nucleoporins contributes structural differences two nuclei turn causes functional tetrahymena continue explored researched order understand work manage complex biological processes ciliates eukaryotes similar helps explain old eukaryotic mechanisms conserved since unicellular ciliates represent last common ancestor eukaryotes also helps explain mechanisms peaks interest mechanisms preserved disappeared much researched discovered nuclear dimorphism still room research enhance current knowledge enhancing previous studies
