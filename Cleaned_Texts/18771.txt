solnhofen limestone shales bavaria germany generic name references skuld norn norse mythology münster recognize sculda mantis shrimp instead considered isopod partly characteristic raptorial appendages mantis shrimps preserved buria rugosa described c g giebel new genus species isopod believing distinct sculda pennata based number segments head shape found buria similar different several extant atlantic isopods variety thirty years genus first named kunth publishes study redescribing sculda pennata well naming two additional species referred genus spinosa pusilla studied material loaned berlin university collection münchen paleontological collection including specimens pennata specimens spinosa single specimen pusilla originate solnhofen limestone addition kunth finds material named buria rugosa identical sculda pennata thus former name discarded declared junior synonym schlüter records discovery new fossil mantis shrimp lebanon names sculda laevis illustrate describe fossil decade later dames would publish review previous work fossil mantis shrimps erects new genus pseudosculda moves laevis type species renaming pseudosculda laevis addition dames also assigns new species sculda syriaca genus sculda based two specimens found hakel lebanon discusses characteristics sculda great detail comparing species one another however conclusions made based illustrations older literature dames study actual specimens pennata spinosa haug et al published numerous fossils sculda found solnhofen limestone noted often difficult distinguish whether specimen belonged pennata spinosa due incomplete preservation thus several fossils referred sculda pennataspinosa keep open terminology addition two specimens assigned pusilla first specimens referred species since named years however haug haug found two specimens actually represent new genus named tyrannosculda declared pusilla nomen sculda small crustacean exceeding mm length type species pennata ranges mm length spinosa smaller three specimens analysed kunth measuring mm carapace shield sculda dorsoventrally flattened prominent almost spinelike grooves ridges running front back shield like mantis shrimps genus
