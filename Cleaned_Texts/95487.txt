locality remains indicated latin suffix ensis meaning original description nundasuchus nesbitt et al tested phylogenetic position using two comprehensive early archosaur phylogenetic datasets available first dataset used version brusatte et als archosaur updated butler et al study anatomy second dataset comprehensive widely accepted study archosaur relationships created nesbitt analyses found nundasuchus pseudosuchian meaning archosaur closely related crocodilians dinosaurs identification primarily based traits ankle shared nundasuchus pseudosuchians brusatte et dataset placed basal pseudosuchian although name crurotarsi used group less crownward crocodilians even nesbitt et al application nesbitt dataset placed nundasuchus crownward compared position brusatte et als results nesbitt considered crocodylomorphs crocodilian ancestors descended taxa traditionally identified rauisuchians since rauisuchia typically omits crocodylomorphs would therefore paraphyletic results nesbitt decided scrap name replacing monophyletic clade paracrocodylomorpha clade allied swiss suchian ticinosuchus based primarily similarities nundasuchus added dataset placed sister taxon ticinosuchus paracrocodylomorpha clade justified three traits heartshaped spine tables groove proximal side femoral head staggered nesbitt et al questioned results due fact nundasuchus possesses many plesiomorphic archosaurian traits ie typical basal archosaurs appear autapomorphies unique features truly member pseudosuchia include palatal teeth short pubis calcaneal tuber strongly deflected backwards thus performed analyses certain relationship constraints forcing nundasuchus outside archosauria closer phytosauria analyses revealed little change relationships apart constraints major changes traits associated relationships changing traits considered diagnose pseudosuchia archosauria clades therefore clear whether nundasuchus suchian convergences far basal archosaurs two phylogenetic analyses suggest archosauriform closely related archosauria features convergent morphology advanced paracrocodylomorphs however support placement nundasuchus weaken away placed
