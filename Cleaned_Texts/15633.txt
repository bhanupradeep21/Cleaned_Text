biosocial criminology interdisciplinary field aims explain crime antisocial behavior exploring biocultural factors contemporary criminology dominated sociological theories biosocial criminology also recognizes potential contributions fields behavioral genetics neuropsychology evolutionary environment significant effect genetic expression disadvantaged environments enhance antisocial gene expression suppress prosocial gene action prevent realization genetic genes environments operating tandem interacting required produce significant antisocial behavior neither powerful enough produce independent children genetically risk antisocial behavior reared positive family environments display antisocial behavior children genetic risk become antisocial adverse family one approach studying role genetics crime calculate heritability coefficient describes proportion variance due actualized genetic effects trait given population specific environment specific time according kevin beaver anthony walsh heritability coefficient antisocial behavior estimated methodology often used biosocial criminology twin studies criticized producing inflated heritability though biosocial criminologists maintain criticisms criminal justice researchers brian boutwell jc barnes argue many sociological studies control genetic inheritance risk factors misleading unreliable another approach examine relationship neurophysiology criminality one example measured levels neurotransmitters serotonin dopamine associated criminal behavior another neuroimaging studies give strong evidence brain structure function involved criminal behaviors limbic system creates emotions anger jealousy ultimately may cause criminal behavior prefrontal cortex involved delaying gratification impulse control moderates impulses limbic system balance shifted favor limbic system may contribute criminal behavior terrie moffitts developmental theory crime argues lifecoursepersistent offenders make population
