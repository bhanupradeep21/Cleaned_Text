swine flu pandemic vaccines influenza vaccines developed protect pandemic virus vaccines either contained inactivated killed influenza virus weakened live virus could cause influenza killed virus injected live virus given nasal spray types vaccine produced growing virus chicken eggs around three billion doses produced delivery november update studies vaccinewhich appeared effective providing strong protective immune response similar safety profile usual seasonal influenza however people already immunity virus vaccine conferring greatest benefit young people since many older people already immune exposure similar viruses vaccine also provided crossprotection flu pandemic early results december observational cohort individuals scotland showed vaccine effective preventing influenza effectiveness confidence intervals influenzarelated hospital admissions confidence intervals developing testing manufacturing sufficient quantities vaccine process takes many months according keiji fukuda world health organization theres much greater vaccine capacity years ago enough vaccine capacity instantly make vaccines entire worlds population nasal mist version vaccine started shipping october update two types influenza vaccines available tiv works putting bloodstream parts three strains flu virus body uses create antibodies laiv works inoculating body three strains modified form cause illness laiv recommended individuals age age might comparatively effective among children age inactivated vaccines virus grown injecting along antibiotics fertilized chicken eggs one two eggs needed make dose virus replicates within allantois embryo equivalent placenta mammals fluid structure removed virus purified fluid methods filtration centrifugation purified viruses inactivated killed small amount disinfectant inactivated virus treated detergent break virus particles broken capsule segments released proteins concentrated centrifugation final preparation suspended sterile phosphate buffered saline ready vaccine mainly contains killed virus might also contain tiny amounts egg protein antibiotics disinfectant detergent used manufacturing process multidose versions vaccine preservative thimerosal added prevent growth bacteria versions vaccine used europe canada arepanrix fluad adjuvant also added contains squalene vitamin e emulsifier called polysorbate make live vaccine virus first adapted grow grown temperature loses ability cause illness humans requires virus grow normal human body temperature multiple mutations needed virus grow cold temperatures process effectively irreversible virus lost virulence become attenuated regain ability infect attenuated virus grown chicken eggs viruscontaining fluid harvested virus purified filtration step also removes contaminating bacteria filtered preparation diluted solution stabilizes virus solution contains monosodium glutamate potassium phosphate gelatin antibiotic gentamicin different method producing influenza virus used produce novartis vaccine optaflu vaccine virus grown cell culture instead method faster classic eggbased system produces purer final product traces egg proteins final product safe people egg prior outbreak recommended vaccines northern hemispheres flu season contain virus stocks made however strain seasonal flu vaccine different pandemic strain offered immunity us centers disease control prevention cdc characterized new viruses may used concern second deadlier wave new strain appear northern autumn producing pandemic vaccines ahead time could turn serious waste resources vaccine might effective would also shortage seasonal flu vaccine available production facilities switched new seasonal flu vaccine made may although vaccine makers would ready switch making swine flu vaccine many questions remained unanswered including really make swine flu vaccine base vaccine current virus since flu viruses change rapidly vaccine current virus might far less effective changed virus wait see virus changes vaccine production doesnt start soon swine flu vaccine wont ready costs producing vaccine also became issue us lawmakers questioning whether new vaccine worth unknown benefits representatives phil gingrey paul broun instance convinced us spend billion produce one gingrey stating cant let spending reaction mediadriven responding panic dont get katrinaed important talking discuss appropriateness spending billion produce vaccine may never used important decision country fact fairleigh dickinson university publicmind poll found october majority new jerseyans planning getting vaccine pandemic declared said pandemic declared would attempt make sure substantial amount vaccine available benefit developing countries vaccine makers countries standing orders us number european countries would asked according officials share developing countries moment first batches ready vaccine made pandemic global body stated wanted companies donate least production offer reduced prices poor countries could otherwise left without vaccines sudden surge gennady onishchenko russias chief doctor said june swine flu aggressive enough cause worldwide pandemic noting current mortality rate confirmed cases mexico united states stated press conference far unclear need use vaccines flu virus circulating throughout europe north america pandemic nature opinion vaccine could produced said preparing vaccine would considered practice since world would soon need new vaccine new virus whats sick people flu season day become ill moscow alone meeting may pharmaceutical companies said ready begin making swine flu vaccine according news reports whos experts would present recommendations directorgeneral margaret chan expected issue advice vaccine manufacturers sixtysecond world health whos keiji fukuda told reporters enormously complicated questions something anyone make single meeting flu vaccine companies make seasonal flu vaccine pandemic flu vaccine time production takes months impossible switch halfway health officials make mistake swine flu mutates scientists arent sure effective vaccine made current strain rather wait decision however countries europe decided go ahead early vaccine may ap reported manufacturers wont able start making swine flu vaccine midjuly earliest weeks later previous predictions according expert panel convened take months produce vaccine large quantities swine flu virus growing fast laboratories making difficult scientists get key ingredient need vaccine seed stock virus case mass producing pandemic vaccine would gamble would take away manufacturing capacity seasonal flu vaccine flu kills people year experts wondered whether world really needs vaccine illness far appears another option proposed cdc earlier rollout seasonal vaccine according cdcs daniel jernigan said cdc would work vaccine manufacturers experts see would possible desirable flu vaccination usually starts september united states peaks november vaccine experts agree would better launch second round vaccinations new strain instead trying add seasonal flu vaccine replacing one three components new australian company csl said developing vaccine swine flu predicted suitable vaccine would ready however john sterling editor chief genetic engineering biotechnology news said june take five six months come entirely novel influenza vaccine great deal hope biotech pharma companies might able something ready september vaccine expected available starting november production three billion doses per expected
