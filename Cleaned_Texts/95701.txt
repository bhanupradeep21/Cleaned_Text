whale feces excrement whales vital role ecology earning whales title marine ecosystem engineers significant ecological role stems nutrients compounds found whale feces farreaching effects marine life nitrogen iron chelate released cetacean species offer significant benefits marine food chain contribute longterm carbon sequestration additionally whale feces contains wealth information health natural history ecology individual animals groups source information includes dna hormones toxins various chemicals studying whale feces provides valuable insights lives marine creatures aiding scientists understanding behaviors diets overall wellbeing furthermore nutrients released whale feces play vital role marine ecosystems supporting phytoplankton growth enhancing food chain contributing overall health oceans addition feces digestive system sperm whales produces ambergris solid waxy flammable substance dull grey blackish color found floating sea washed whales excrete plumes liquid feces flocculent nature consisting loose aggregations feces often found floating sea surface excreted underwater dissociates contain undigested hard objects squid fecal samples characterized color odor texture buoyancy providing valuable information health ecology flatulence recorded whales transport nitrogen feces gulf maine rivers system combined briana one crucial roles whale feces nutrient cycling particularly nitrogen circulation ocean whales transport nitrogen feces certain regions rivers combined enriching primary secondary productivity additionally ironrich feces krilleating whales encourage phytoplankton growth benefiting marine food chain sequestering carbon dioxide extended periods southern ocean rich nutrients irondeficient experiences increased phytoplankton blooms due whale feces acting significant carbon sink phenomenon whales defecating near waters surface reverses typical flow nutrients oceans biological pump contributing whale pump whales feed deeper levels krill found fecal matter rich iron rises surface action enhances phytoplankton productivity supports fish populations whales along krill form positive feedback loop populations contribute recycling iron boosting phytoplankton growth study gulf maine extrapolated modern levels nitrogen recycling sea due marine mammals cetaceans seals prior advent commercial culling estimating former level thrice supply nitrogen fixed atmosphere even today despite reduction marine mammal populations increase nitrogen uptake atmosphere nitrogen pollution local clustering marine mammals plays significant role maintaining productivity regions enrichment primary productivity also secondary productivity form abundance fish study assumes whales tend defecate commonly upper part water column frequent breathing additionally feces tend float whales feed deeper levels ocean krill fecal action whales thus reverses usual flow nutrients oceans biological pump due downward flow marine snow detritus surface bottom phenomenon termed whale gulf maine study also found view whales marine mammals competitors fishing advocated nations incorrect whales play vital role maintaining productivity phytoplankton consequently fish culling marine mammal populations threatens nutrient supply productivity fishing addition feces krilleating whales rich release iron whale feces encourages growth phytoplankton benefits marine food chain also sequesters carbon long periods phytoplankton consumed lifetime perishes descends euphotic zone settles depths sea phytoplankton sequesters estimated billion tons carbon dioxide ocean year causing ocean become sink carbon dioxide holds estimated sequestered southern ocean amongst largest ranges phytoplankton characteristic nutrientrich terms phosphate nitrate silicate irondeficient increases nutrient iron results blooming phytoplankton whale feces million times richer iron surrounding sea water plays vital role providing iron required maintaining phytoplankton biomass iron defecation strong sperm whale population southern ocean results sequestration tonnes atmospheric carbon per study southern ocean found whales recycled iron concentrations vital phytoplankton also formed along krill major source sequestered iron ocean iron held surface waters southern ocean whales formed part positive feedback loop whale populations allowed recover southern ocean greater productivity phytoplankton result larger amounts iron recycled accordingly whales referred marine ecosystem study conducted fernando de noronha archipelago

melichthys niger could even discern postures dolphins assumed prior voiding positioned effective feeding offal eating fish species recorded plankton eaters considered type feeding may represent change usual diet ie drifting whales along large animals play significant role transport nutrients global ecological cycles population reduction whales large animals severely affected efficacy pump
