syndrome prs rare disease characterized progressive shrinkage degeneration tissues beneath skin usually one side face hemifacial atrophy occasionally extending parts autoimmune mechanism suspected syndrome may variant localized scleroderma precise cause pathogenesis acquired disorder remains unknown reported literature possible consequence sympathectomy syndrome higher prevalence females

facial changes usually involve area face covered temporal buccinator muscles disease progressively spreads initial location resulting atrophy skin adnexa well underlying subcutaneous structures

findings usually become apparent first early second decade life average age onset nine years majority individuals experience symptoms years age disease may progress several years eventually going remission abruptly neurological abnormalities common roughly people syndrome also trigeminal neuralgia severe pain tissues supplied ipsilateral trigeminal nerve including forehead eye cheek nose mouth
