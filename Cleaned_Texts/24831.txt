dyschronometria condition cerebellar dysfunction individual accurately estimate amount time passed ie distorted time perception associated cerebellar cerebellum damaged function fullest ability lesions cerebellum cause dyssynergia dysmetria dysdiadochokinesia dysarthria ataxia stance dyschronometria result autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia common signs dyschronometria often generic cerebellar ataxia including lack spatial awareness poor short term memory inability keep track timecitation needed defining symptoms completely understood involve time perception example asked wait thirty seconds tap every second gone affected able perform task short time become derailed result loss focus however often individual affected longer tell become often takes form forgetting basic time keeping unless timer set cooking example dyschronometria affect circadian rhythm sustained different biological processcitation needed common cause cerebellar ataxia extension dyschronometria cerebellar damage form trauma disease genetics examples trauma include car accident stroke epilepsy head traumas especially detrimental children elderly due decreased brain matter increasing risk trauma may damage cerebellum also explains dyschronometria seen commonly elderly due deterioration physical brain matter age probable causes deterioration brain matter elderly include increased supranational activation decreased cerebellar activation consistent frontocerebellar interesting case dyschronometria dyslexia dyslexia studied within children found dyslexic children often stressed well mentally exhausted children would place little importance present state behavior would continue remains unclear whether dyslexia symptom dyschronometria cause bothcitation needed dementia huge effect dyschronometria one main sources dyschronometria discovered studies dementia cause effect dyschronometria completely fact dementia brain constantly rewiring thus information becomes lost causing person dementia become confused well disoriented cases completely unaware passage timecitation needed cause dyschronometria causes person become disoriented completely unaware time thus making bits pieces brain involving memory become lost ultimately leading dementia long despite dyschronometrias easily recognizable symptoms fact may also present cerebellar ataxias make diagnosis difficult ataxias may also symptoms affect gait speech thought process spatial awareness time orientation used diagnoses covering fact patients also dyschronometria common ataxias dyschronometria seen evident dyssynergia dysmetria dysdiadochokinesia dysarthria well ataxias effecting stance gait dyslexia another problem individuals affected dyschronometria however uncertain whether dyslexia developed worsened opposite dyslexia increases chance developing dyschronometria another problem dyschronometria faces detection relatively new term side effect precursor dementia compared cerebellar ataxias mentioned even dyschronometria detected usually progressed point reversed benefit taking testing medication either slow dyschronometria process dementia setting dyschronometria signal however greatest error diagnosing dyschronometria cerebellar ataxia hides symptoms signs signs seen diagnosed dyschronometria obvious often mistaken cerebellar ataxias dementia medical professionals addition medical professionals usually expect see circadian rhythm disrupted noting sleeping cycles patterns logical sense nothing dyschronometria errors diagnosing dyschronometria include idea dyschronometria speech impediment experience delusions bordering psychosis impairment long term memory complete loss conscious understanding time misconceptions mostly stem fact cerebellar ataxia rarely diagnosed without seen dementia another testing diagnosing dyschronometria also shown ineffective dementia caught late despite signals seeming obvious psychological tests try catch signs dementia dyschronometria helpful tests bell curves formed statistical analysis wide range among normal test takers ensure patients extremely abnormal tests given positive diagnosis cases often already obvious diagnosis dyschronometria also difficult due lack research professional concentrating cerebellar ataxia neuroscientists beginning conduct research lack awareness keeping time science tests specialized dyschronometria researched greater depth sensitivity future tests conducted likely yield insights phenomenoncitation needed determined role drugs may play treatment cerebellar ataxia research done trouillas lyon france pharmacology cerebellar ataxia examined manipulating key components found nerve level within cerebellum inferior olive done mostly modification gaba dopamine serotonin receptors seem show positive results primary stages experimentation clinical benefits presented study justifying prescription better benserazide patients certain cerebellar ataxias including dyschronometria present stated best indication treatment cerebellar cortical atrophies even still important stress response treatment may slow previously neuroplasticity used rehabilitation method considered potential treatment dyschronometria however studies developed since current techniques research neuroscience community still viable option eliminate cerebellar ataxia slow progress
