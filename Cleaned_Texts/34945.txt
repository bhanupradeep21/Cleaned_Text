developmental concerns significant variation severity due variation breakpoints reported individuals distal current research focused establishing genotypephenotype correlations enable predictive heart

growth hormone responded well microcephaly also common people distal hypothyroidism reported people distal several people distal diagnosed low iga levels resulting increased incidence infections increased incidence psychiatric conditions occurs within distal population one study nearly depressive symptoms symptoms anxiety disorder manic symptoms psychotic however study included young patients many young exhibit signs certain psychiatric conditions typical age onset many conditions appears teen years thus results study may actually underestimate true incidence psychiatric conditions within

include midfacial hypoplasia short downward upwardslanting palpebral fissures epicanthic folds lowset ears prominent antihelix distal deletion long arm chromosome majority deletions breakpoints tip chromosome common breakpoints thus size deletions vary largest deletion reported mb smallest deletion reported cause clinical phenotype suspicion chromosome abnormality typically raised due presence developmental delays birth defects diagnosis distal usually made blood sample routine chromosome analysis karyotype usually used make initial diagnosis although may also made microarray analysis
