kidneys grown renal cell linesrenal tissue first successful artificial kidney developed willem kolff netherlands early kolff first construct working dialyzer kidneys paired vital organs located behind abdominal cavity bottom ribcage corresponding levels spine vertebrae perform dozen physiologic functions fairly easily damaged functions include filtration excretion metabolic waste products regulation necessary electrolytes fluids stimulation red blood organs routinely filter liters blood day produce liters urine composed wastes excess kidney failure results slow accumulation nitrogenous wastes salts water disruption bodys normal ph balance failure typically occurs long period time patients renal function declines enough course disease commonly known end stage renal disease esrd also known level kidney disease depending whether dialysis renal replacement therapy used detecting kidney disease kidneys start shut uncommon high blood pressure decreased appetite symptoms indicate diabetes high blood pressure seen common causes kidney experts predict demand dialysis increase prevalence diabetes second world war kidney failure generally meant death patient several insights kidney function acute kidney failure made one three american adults risk developing kidney million american adults kidney disease aware kidney failure large population individuals kidney failure drives continuing advancements technology artificial kidneys people access treatmentscitation needed home hemodialysis become rare disadvantages expensive timeconsuming space inefficient dialysis population home hemodialysis proportion dropped according report organization economic cooperation development united states america secondhighest rate dialysis among advanced countries united states highest mortality rate among patients esrd average american esrd patients die annually twice growth dialysis facilities united states result americans developing endstage renal disease number increased citizens americans form ten years later number increased result chronic conditions developing diabetes americans dependent hemodialysis treatment kidney failure according data usrds americans endstage kidney disease intriguing investigations groups london ontario toronto ontario suggested dialysis treatments lasting two three times long delivered frequently conventional thrice weekly treatments may associated improved clinical implementing sixtimes weekly allnight dialysis would overwhelm existing resources countries well scarcity donor organs kidney transplantation prompted research developing alternative therapies including development wearable implantable hemodialysis method removing waste products creatinine urea well free water blood kidneys kidney failure mechanical device used clean patients blood called dialyser also known artificial kidney modern dialysers typically consist cylindrical rigid casing enclosing hollow fibers cast extruded polymer copolymer usually proprietary formulation combined area hollow fibers typically square meters intensive research conducted many groups optimize blood dialysate flows within dialyser order achieve efficient transfer wastes blood dialysatecitation needed implantable artificial kidney second project codeveloped nephrologist named william h fissell iv md vanderbilt university medical center professor shuvo roy university california san francisco fissell colleagues working implantable artificial kidney decade recently received grant november continue research development project goal project create biohybrid device imitate functions healthy kidney removing enough waste products keep patient needing dialysis treatment key success device use silicon nanotechnology microchip porous act natural filter fissell team designed pore filter perform specific function task microchips also act platform living kidney cells reside grow around filters goal imitating natural functions kidney biohybrid device reach bodys immune response allows protected rejected patients body device designed small enough fit inside patients body successfully operate patients natural blood flow fissell research team continue make progress expected implantable artificial kidney would enter human trials wearable artificial kidney wearable dialysis machine person endstage kidney disease could use daily even continuously wearable artificial kidney wak available research teams process developing device goal develop portable device able imitate functions regular kidney device would allow patient treated twentyfour hours day development miniature pumps hope effective wearable hemodialysis device become realizable patients already receive continuous peritoneal dialysis treatment allows remain ambulatory however small portion dialysis patients use peritoneal dialysis treatment requires large amounts dialysate stored disposed healthy individuals kidneys filter blood hoursday hoursweek compared individual endstage renal disease whose dialysis treatment plan approximately hours week treatment results lower quality life well higher mortality rate patients end stage renal disease esrd therefore need aroundtheclock device allow esrd patients receive dialysis continuously maintaining normal fda approved first human clinical trial united states wearable artificial kidney designed blood purification technologies inc prototype wak device powered ninevolt batteries connects patient via catheter use less designed run continuously batteries allowing patients remain ambulatory wearing device leading greater quality life device designed improve physiological aspects patients health improved volume control decreased hypertension sodium retention well decreased rate cardiovascular disease wearable artificial kidney wak constantly modified throughout years better people kidney failure try make wak usable several experiments conducted conducting experiments wak similar goals trying achieved example main goal experiments trying achieve make sure wak function like regular kidneycitation needed one experiment took place included eight people wore wak four eight participants wore wak several outcomes occurred example one outcome experiment fluid removal wak controlled correctly ultrafiltration another outcome took place experiment needle connected wak ended disconnecting happened wak able recognize blood stopped blood stopped pumping needle could reinserted without body losing large amount research conducted argued using ultrafiltration pump may best pump wak example research found using peristaltic pump instead would allow person know blood flow rate without sensor needed ultrafiltration pump used experiment mentioned change type pump used wak may crucial could help make device cheaper reliable public lot research wak several research questions answered example researchers found wak work without outlet able function ninevolt although argued researchers using ninevolt batteries effective enough wak power device long enough indirectly makes wak less affordable constantly change due energy sources explored example researchers seeing fuel cells wireless transmission energy active source harvesting energy environment would better ways power wak longer periods several questions answered wak many research questions still left unanswered researchers still trying figure wak energy efficient affordable reuse small amounts currently viable bioengineered kidneys exist although great deal research underway numerous barriers exist however
