gastrointestinal wall gastrointestinal tract made four layers specialised tissue inner cavity gut lumen outwards mucosa innermost layer gastrointestinal tract surrounds lumen tract comes direct contact digested food chyme mucosa made three epithelium digestive absorptive secretory processes occur lamina propria layer connective tissue muscularis mucosae thin layer smooth muscle submucosa contains nerves including submucous plexus also called meissners plexus blood vessels elastic fibres collagen stretches increased capacity maintains shape intestine muscular layer surrounds submucosa comprises layers smooth muscle longitudinal circular orientation also helps continued bowel movements peristalsis movement digested material along gut two layers muscle lies myenteric plexus also called auerbachs plexus serosaadventitia final layers made loose connective tissue coated mucus prevent friction damage intestine rubbing tissue serosa present tissue within peritoneum adventitia

intestinal wall digestive enzymes small intestine villi folds mucosa increase surface area intestine villi contain lacteal vessel connected lymph system aids removal lipids tissue fluids microvilli present epithelium villus increase surface area absorption take place numerous intestinal glands pocketlike invaginations present underlying tissue large intestines villi absent flat surface thousands glands observed underlying epithelium lamina propria contains myofibroblasts blood vessels nerves several different immune cells muscularis mucosa layer smooth muscle aids action continued peristalsis catastalsis along gut lining mucosa called epithelium differs along gastrointestinal epithelium described stratified consists multiple layers cells simple made one layer cells terms used describe

layer connective tissue blood vessels lymphatics nerves branching mucosa muscular layer contains submucous plexus enteric nervous plexus situated inner surface muscular muscular layer also known muscularis consists two layers muscle inner outer layer muscle inner layer arranged circular rings around tract whereas muscle outer layer arranged longitudinally stomach extra layer inner oblique muscular two muscle layers myenteric auerbachs plexus controls peristalsis activity initiated pacemaker cells interstitial cells cajal gut intrinsic peristaltic activity basal electrical rhythm due selfcontained enteric nervous system rate course modulated rest autonomic nervous system layers truly longitudinal circular rather layers muscle helical different pitches inner circular helical steep pitch outer longitudinal helical much shallower pitch coordinated contractions layers called peristalsis propels food tract food gi tract called bolus ball food mouth stomach stomach food partially digested semiliquid referred chyme large intestine remaining semisolid substance referred faeces circular muscle layer prevents food travelling backward longitudinal layer shortens tract thickness muscular layer varies part tract outermost layer gastrointestinal wall consists several layers connective tissue either adventitia regions gastrointestinal tract within peritoneum called intraperitoneal covered serosa structure consists connective tissue covered simple squamous epithelium called mesothelium reduces frictional forces digestive movements intraperitoneal regions include stomach first part duodenum small intestine caecum appendix transverse colon sigmoid colon rectum sections gut clear boundary gut surrounding tissue parts tract mesentery regions gastrointestinal tract behind peritoneum called retroperitoneal covered adventitia blend surrounding tissue fixed position example retroperitoneal section duodenum usually passes transpyloric plane retroperitoneal regions include oral cavity esophagus pylorus stomach distal duodenum ascending colon descending colon anal canal gastrointestinal wall affected number conditions ulcer something thats eroded
