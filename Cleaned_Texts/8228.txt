evolutionary psychology evolutionary anthropology dual strategies theory states humans increase status social hierarchies using two major strategies known dominance prestige suggested rather represent two unique strategies dominance prestige seen two distinct groups strategies different substrategies within two major distinct two strategies enable people gain social standing maintain time distinction two social rank prestige freely conferred group members case henrich gilwhite built social exchange theory develop idea prestige conveyed social status respect exchange expertise contrasted dominance social status taken rather freely two strategies distinct pathways equally viable routes gain status human social oldest two strategies dominance identified desire authority control power associated tactics include use force threat selfish withholding resources general dominance status gaining strategy observed many species including primates particularly chimpanzees one closest primate species genetically humans dominance also associated negative personality traits hubristic less focus others reduction prosocial dominance less stable prestige human followers resist

grandstanding order gain higher social prestige linked positive traits authentic prestige appears unique humans development prestige linked development larger intricate social prestige based leadership stable long term produces mutually beneficial outcomes followers analogous maledominated hierarchies species primates human women prefer mate highstatus human men resulting men higher status gaining sexual access women compared men lower contributed existence polygyny around world throughout human history mating system typically consists highstatus men kings emperors tribal chiefs married multiple wives sexual relations multiple modern westernized societies embrace monogamy highstatus men take advantage increased sexual access women form cheating multiple shortterm sex partners serial various studies married men score higher social dominance admit extramarital link mans social status sexual access women remained highly consistent throughout human history despite changes culture civilization suggests powerful evolutionary pressure behind tendency men engage statusseeking behavior frequently men higher incomes status tend frequent sex higher number study found men supervisory positions businesses children compared even within universities study found male academics high status positions children compared male gangs predominately male social groups organized hierarchies consist members defending territory controlling resources often illegal purposes gangs often come violent conflict gangs gang members display ferocity battles enemy gangs often experience

tradeoff women known strategic pluralism women must find optimum dominance prestige highstatus men dominance prestige hierarchies naturally occurring human groups status gained domain specific may transferable across different particular marked preference allocating prestige based specific domain expertise suggesting status earned prestige grounds specific domain earned largely transferable dominance prestige interact punishment punished group members various bidirectional ways high status dominant leaders punished severely transgressions group organizational norms high status prestige types similar whereas ability willingness punish others group increases perceptions punishers dominance among group members making punishing others strategic tool one open high status costs associated

bidirectionally dominant leaders likely attempt stay close group members see potential threats power order monitor control behavior less likely occur dominant leader feel position similarly leaders high dominance whose position internal threat may prioritize retaining power interests group tactics withholding information group excluding able subordinates potential rivals preventing skilled group members influence group tasks face external outgroup threat high dominance leaders stop prioritizing self interest group goals behaviors dominance based leaders use social influence tactics rather exclusively coercive range complaisant tactics often part general divide conquer strategy selectively building relationships using reason convince targeted feeling threatened dominance based leaders generate divisions work cooperation among subordinates undermine efficient group functioning order preserve leader status power tactics used damage group cohesion include leaders restricting amount communication among subordinates physically isolating skilled subordinates preventing subordinates bonding one another behavior targeted highly skilled subordinates seen potential rivals leader dominant leader tendency attack group cohesion removed threat leader direct response coercive unethical behavior dominant style leaders evidence employees certain circumstances take collective action minimize impact even dethrone dominant style prestige based leaders likely prioritize decisions preferred followers rather feel best course action group performance suggesting prestige leaders

work hard benefit group members servant leadership imply leader demonstrating competence prestige motivation also differentiating factor servant leaders sacrificing group compassionate love whereas prestige based leaders may sacrifice order gain status group another key difference servant leadership linked narcissism whereas prestige leadership linked narcissism even prestige based leader likely
