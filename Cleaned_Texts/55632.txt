asepsis state free diseasecausing microorganisms pathogenic bacteria viruses pathogenic fungi two categories asepsis medical modern day notion asepsis derived older antiseptic techniques shift initiated different individuals century introduced practices sterilizing surgical tools wearing surgical gloves goal asepsis eliminate infection achieve ideally surgical field sterile meaning free biological contaminants eg fungi bacteria viruses cause disease putrefaction even aseptic state condition sterile inflammation may develop term often refers practices used promote induce asepsis operative field surgery medicine prevent modern concept asepsis evolved century multiple individuals ignaz semmelweis showed hand washing prior delivery reduced puerperal fever despite many hospitals continued practice surgery unsanitary conditions surgeons taking pride bloodstained operating reading findings louis pasteur joseph lister introduced use carbolic acid antiseptic reduced surgical infection lawson tait shifted movement antisepsis asepsis instilling practices strict notalking policy within operating room drastically limiting number people come contact patients ernst von bergmann also introduced autoclave device used practice sterilization surgical everything operating room uniforms gloves pioneered william halsted preceding modernday scrubs attire halsted implemented street clothes policy operating room opting wear completely white sterile uniform consisting duck suit tennis shoes helped prevent introduction infections open additionally halsted would sterilize operation site alcohol iodine disinfectants use drapes cover areas except department johns hopkins hospital enforced extreme hand washing ritual consisting soaking harmfully strong chemicals like permanganate mercury bichloride solution well scrubbing stiff damage surgical nurses hands compelled create earliest form surgical gloves goodyear rubber gloves became part aseptic surgery standard dr joseph colt bloodgood several others began wearing particular line antisepsis asepsis interpreted differently depending context past antiseptic operations occurred peoples homes operating theaters large procedures implementing antisepsis varied among physicians experienced constant late century physicians rejected connection louis pasteurs germ theory bacteria caused diseases antiseptic end century joseph lister followers expanded term antisepsis coined asepsis justification lister initially suggested excluding septic agents wound generally however asepsis seen continuation antisepsis since many values germfree environment around wound patient techniques pioneered names used conjunction asepsis refers procedure performed sterile conditions includes medical laboratory techniques bacterial cultures two types asepsis medical medical clean asepsis reduces number organisms prevents spread surgical sterile asepsis includes procedures eliminate microorganisms area practiced surgical technologists ultimately though successful usage aseptic operations depends combination preparatory example sterile equipment fluids used invasive medical nursing largest manifestation aseptic techniques hospital operating theaters aim keep patients free hospital members surgical team demonstrate good aseptic technique role scrub nurse surgical technologist set maintain sterile prevent crosscontamination patients instruments sterilized autoclaving using disposable equipment suture material xenografts also need sterilized basic aseptic procedures includes hand washing donning protective gloves masks gowns sterilizing equipment medical aseptic techniques also includes curbing spread infectious diseases quarantine specifically isolation procedures based mode disease within contact droplet airborne isolation methods two different procedures emerge strict isolation vs reverse strict isolation quarantines patients prevent infecting others reverse isolation prevents vulnerable patients becoming aseptic conditions chronic lowlevel inflammation known sterile inflammation may develop result trauma stress environmental infections caused pathogens microbes immune response regulated host tissue damage resulting noninfectious means caused damps molecules released injury cell death occurred able stimulate inflammation diseases associated sterile inflammation include alzheimers disease atherosclerosis well cancer tumor growth due immune cell additionally aseptic tissue damage may arise corticosteroid injections drugs used treat musculoskeletal conditions carpal tunnel osteoarthritis though tends result improper aseptic despite efforts preserve asepsis surgery still persists chance surgical site infection infections categorized superficial incisional deep incisional organ first type confined skin second muscles nearby tissues third organs anatomically close operation exact modes infection depend types surgery common bacteria responsible ssis
