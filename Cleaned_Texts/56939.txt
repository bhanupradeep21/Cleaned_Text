avimimus ˌeɪvɪˈmaɪməs ayvimeyeməs meaning bird mimic latin avis bird mimus mimic genus oviraptorosaurian theropod dinosaur named birdlike characteristics lived late cretaceous mongolia around million years ago remains avimimus recovered russian officially described dr sergei kurzanov avimimus fossils initially described come djadokta formation kurzanov however description new specimen watabe colleagues noted kurzanov probably mistaken provenance likely avimimus hailed recent nemegt type species tail found original find kurzanov mistakenly concluded avimimus lacked tail however subsequent avimimus finds containing caudal vertebrae confirmed presence second nearly complete specimen avimimus discovered described watabe colleagues additionally authors identified number small theropod footprints area belonging variety isolated bones attributed avimimus considered distinct portentosus initially referred avimimus team canadian american mongolian paleontologists headed phil currie reported extensive bonebed avimimus sp fossils bonebed nemegt formation meters barun goyot formation gobi desert team reported finding abundant bones least ten individuals avimimus deposit may hold individuals either adult subadult adults showed little variation size suggesting determinate growth team also suggests individuals found together gregarious life providing possible indications avimimus formed agesegregated groups either lekking flocking purposes adults showed greater degree skeletal fusion tarsometatarsus tibiotarsus also prominent muscle scars preservation bonebeds suggest buried rapidly uncovered rapid flow water buried short distance avimimus sp formally described new species avimimus small birdlike dinosaur length skull small compared body though eyes large size bones surrounded brain dedicated protecting also consistent hypothesis avimimus proportionally large jaws avimimus thought form parrotlike beak lacking teeth thorough review holotype specimens anatomy confirmed teeth preserved although series toothlike projections along tip premaxilla however subsequently discovered specimens reported preserve small premaxillary small teeth possible lack thereof avimimus suggests may herbivore omnivore kurzanov however believed avimimus foramen magnum hole allowing spinal cord connect brain proportionally large occipital condyle however small suggestive skulls relative neck long slender composed vertebrae much elongate oviraptorosaurs unlike oviraptorids caenagnathids back vertebrae lack openings air sacs suggesting avimimus primitive animals forelimbs relatively short bones hand fused together modern birds ridge ulna lower arm bone interpreted attachment point feathers kurzanov also reported presence quill chiappe confirmed presence bumps ulna function remained kurzanov convinced attachment points feathers concluded avimimus may capable weak presence feathers widely accepted paleontologists believe avimimus could ilium almost horizontally oriented resulting exceptionally broad hips little known tail hip suggests tail long legs extremely long slender suggesting avimimus highly specialized runner proportions leg bones add weight idea avimimus quick animals shins long comparison trait common among cursorial animals also threetoed feet narrow pointed claws avimimus originally suggested close relative birds given unique suite birdlike features known dinosaurs time fact kurzanov argued avimimus rather famous early bird archaeopteryx close direct ancestor modern birds archaeopteryx closely related birds previously however view supported later phylogenetic analyses dinosaur bird relationships modern scientists find avimimus fact belongs diverse group birdlike dinosaurs primitive archaeopteryx kurzanov placed avimimus family avimimidae sankar chatterjee erected order avimimiformes include avimimus neither group names used frequently paleontologists include single species recent studies shown avimimus best grouped within oviraptoridae within subgroup following cladogram follows analysis phil senter avimimus caenagnathus caudipteryx microvenator oviraptor igm rinchenia citipati chirostenotes elmisaurus
