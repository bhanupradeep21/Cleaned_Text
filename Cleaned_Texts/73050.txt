kernohans notch cerebral peduncle indentation associated forms transtentorial herniation uncal secondary condition caused primary injury opposite hemisphere kernohans notch ipsilateral condition leftsided primary lesion kernohans notch would right side evokes motor impairment left side body rightsided primary injury evokes motor impairment right side seriousness kernohans notch varies depending primary problem causing may range benign brain tumors advanced subdural hematoma kernohans notch phenomenon result compression cerebral peduncle part mesencephalon tentorium cerebelli due transtentorial herniation produces ipsilateral hemiparesis skull incompressible closed space limited volume monrokellie doctrine increased cranial pressure brain shift brain forms towards opening skull foramen magnum thus increase pressure hemisphere brain exists cerebral peduncle opposite hemisphere pushed tentorium separates posterior fossa middle fossa produces visible notch cerebral kernohans notch caused injury creating pressure opposite hemisphere brain characterized false localizing kernohans notch phenomenon unique false localizing sign also ipsilateral samesided left cerebral peduncle contains motor fibers cross right side body thus right hemisphere transtentorial herniation causes kernohans notch left cerebral peduncle results rightsided motor impairment therefore get paradoxically impairment motor function side body herniation caused kernohans notch controlateral kernohans notch secondary phenomenon results major primary injury nontumoral nontraumatic intracranial haemorrhage rarely causes phenomenon wide range serious injuries cause increase intracranial pressure trigger formation kernohans notch general phenomenon occurs patients advanced brain tumor severe head case severe head injury clot occur surface brain often cause shift middle part brain tentorium creates kernohans notch chronic subdural hematomas known familiar cause kernohans mris shown evidence kernohans notch patients traumatic head injury related acute spaceoccupying lesions subdural hematoma epidural hematoma depressed skull fracture spontaneous intracerebral also important note anatomical size tentorial notches vary considerably individuals however little evidence supports narrow notch creates predisposition towards kernohans symptoms directly related kernohans notch commonly paralysis weakness one side body ipsilateral paralysis socalled kernohans sign paralysis weakness known hemiplegia hemiparesis respectively due destruction pressure applied motor fibers located cerebral peduncle rare sign kernohans notch ipsilateral oculomotor nerve however patients come clinic citing symptoms associated primary injury causing kernohans notch since many types head injuries exist virtually symptom brain trauma seen accompanying kernohans notch symptoms may range total paralysis simple headache nausea ipsilateral characteristic kernohans notch diagnosis unique many clinicians assume right sided paralysis corresponds injury left hemisphere brain misdiagnose kernohans despite complication ipsilateral paralysis causes makes easy diagnose coupled imaging techniques example seeing mri blood clot left side brain coupled leftsided paralysis immediately points kernohans notch head trauma cases ct scans standard diagnostic method however ideal imaging small lesions mri used identify kernohans notch important distinguish kernohans notch direct brain stem injuries case studies shown patients chronic subdural hematoma compressive deformity crus cerebri without abnormal mri signal may predict better recovery patients kernohans special treatment kernohans notch since treatment completely dependent injury causing pressure tentorium relieved notch go away however mean damage motor fibers disappears depending severity injury may may persistent damage pressure relief neurological deficits may resolve surgery degree deficit especially motor weakness generally pressure relief unnotch cerebral peduncle may include removal brain tumors blood clots suction blood drilled hole ipsilateral false localizing signs characteristic kernohans notch sometimes cause confusion result misdiagnosis case described account wolf university hospital groningen kernohans notch phenomenon associated ruptured arteriovenous

credit discovery interesting story kernohan woltmans article never support contention ipsilateral finding reported due notching displacement hemisphere containing tumor follows seen fig total supratentorial cases midbrain notching opposite hemisphere bearing lesion however false localizing signs ipsilateral tumor hyperactive reflexes upgoing toes etcthe rest signs therefore logically speaking cause effect relationship notching herniation signs since exactly half notches asymptomatic reason occurrence signs half population affected must laterality hemisphere harboring tumor
