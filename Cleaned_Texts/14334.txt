st petersburg paradox st petersburg paradox involving game flipping coin expected payoff theoretical lottery game approaches infinity nevertheless seems worth small amount participants st petersburg paradox situation na√Øve decision criterion takes expected value account predicts course action presumably actual person would willing take several resolutions paradox proposed including impossible amount money casino would need continue game indefinitely problem invented nicolas stated letter pierre raymond de montmort september however paradox takes name analysis nicolas cousin daniel bernoulli onetime resident saint petersburg published thoughts problem commentaries imperial academy science saint casino offers game chance single player fair coin tossed stage initial stake begins dollars doubled every time tails appears first time heads appears game ends player wins whatever current stake thus player wins dollars heads appears first toss dollars tails appears first toss heads second dollars tails appears first two tosses heads third mathematically player wins k displaystyle dollars k displaystyle k number consecutive tails would fair price pay casino entering game answer one needs consider would expected payout stage probability player wins dollars probability player wins dollars probability player wins dollars assuming game continue long coin toss results tails particular casino unlimited resources expected value thus sum grows without bound expected win infinite amount money considering nothing expected value net change ones monetary wealth one therefore play game price offered opportunity yet daniel bernoulli describing game initial stake one ducat stated although standard calculation shows value players expectation infinitely great admitted fairly reasonable man would sell chance great pleasure twenty robert martin quotes ian hacking saying us would pay even enter game says commentators would apparent paradox discrepancy people seem willing pay enter game infinite expected several approaches proposed solving paradox classical resolution paradox involved explicit introduction utility function expected utility hypothesis presumption diminishing marginal utility money daniel bernoulli determination value item must based price rather utility yields doubt gain one thousand ducats significant pauper rich man though gain amount common utility model suggested daniel bernoulli logarithmic function uw lnw known log utility function gamblers total wealth w concept diminishing marginal utility money built expected utility hypothesis posits utility function exists provides good criterion real peoples behavior ie function returns positive negative value indicating wager good gamble possible event change utility lnwealth event lnwealth event weighted probability event occurring let c cost charged enter game expected incremental utility lottery converges finite value formula gives implicit relationship gamblers wealth much willing pay specifically c gives positive change expected utility example natural log utility millionaire willing pay person pay person borrow pay daniel bernoulli published mathematician geneva gabriel cramer already found parts idea also motivated st petersburg paradox stating mathematicians estimate money proportion quantity men good sense proportion usage may make demonstrated letter nicolas square root function describing diminishing marginal benefit gains resolve problem however unlike daniel bernoulli consider total wealth person gain lottery solution cramer bernoulli however completely satisfying lottery easily changed way paradox reappears aim need change game gives even rapidly increasing payoffs unbounded utility function one find lottery allows variant st petersburg paradox first pointed recently expected utility theory extended arrive behavioral decision models new theories cumulative prospect theory st petersburg paradox appears certain cases even utility function concave nicolas bernoulli proposed alternative idea solving paradox conjectured people neglect unlikely since st petersburg lottery unlikely events yield high prizes lead infinite expected value could resolve paradox idea probability weighting resurfaced much later work prospect theory daniel kahneman amos tversky paul weirich similarly wrote risk aversion could solve paradox weirich went write increasing prize actually decreases chance someone paying play game stating number birds hand worth number birds however rejected theorists point people enjoy risk gambling illogical assume increasing prize lead risks cumulative prospect theory one popular generalization expected utility theory predict many behavioral however overweighting small probability events introduced cumulative prospect theory may restore st petersburg paradox cumulative prospect theory avoids st petersburg paradox power coefficient utility function lower power coefficient probability weighting intuitively utility function must simply concave must concave relative probability weighting function avoid st petersburg paradox one argue formulas prospect theory obtained region less applicable infinitely increasing sums st petersburg paradox classical st petersburg game assumes casino banker infinite resources assumption long challenged alexis fontaine des bertins pointed resources potential backer game importantly expected value game grows logarithmically resources casino result expected value game even played casino largest bankroll realistically conceivable quite modest georgeslouis leclerc comte de buffon calculated rounds play would enough money kingdom france cover casino finite resources game must end resources suppose total resources maximum jackpot casino w dollars generally w measured units half games initial stake maximum number times casino play longer fully cover next bet l assuming game ends casino longer cover bet expected value e lottery following table shows expected value e game various potential bankers bankroll w note game rules specify player wins casinos bankroll paid casino additional expected value less would casino enough funds cover one round ie less player win w must allowed play round additional expected value premise infinite resources produces variety apparent paradoxes economics martingale betting system gambler betting tossed coin doubles bet every loss eventual win would cover losses system fails finite bankroll gamblers ruin concept shows persistent gambler raises bet fixed fraction bankroll wins reduce bet loses eventually inevitably go game positive expected value argued theory rational behavior must correspond rational decisionmaker would real life since reasonable people regularly ignore events unlikely enough rational decisionmaker also ignore rare events estimate threshold ignorability argued since man ignores possibility dying next hours probability according mortality tables events less probability could ignored assuming st petersburg game expected payoff k k k displaystyle sum various authors including jean le rond dalembert john maynard keynes rejected maximization expectation even utility proper rule keynes particular insisted relative riskclarification needed alternative could sufficiently high reject even expectation recently researchers suggested replace expected value median fair early resolution containing essential mathematical arguments assuming multiplicative dynamics put forward william allen explicit link ergodicity problem made peters solutions mathematically similar using kelly criterion logarithmic utility general dynamics beyond purely multiplicative case correspond nonlogarithmic utility functions pointed carr cherubini although paradox three centuries old new arguments still introduced recent years solution involving sampling offered william intuitively fellers answer perform game large number people calculate expected value sample extraction method games infinite number times possible expected value infinity case finite expected value much smaller value paul samuelson resolves arguing even entity infinite resources game would never offered lottery represents infinite expected gain player also represents infinite expected loss host one could observed paying play game would never offered samuelson summarized argument paul never willing give much peter demand contract hence indicated activity take place equilibrium level zero intensity many variants st petersburg game proposed counter proposed solutions example pasadena let n displaystyle n number coinflips n displaystyle n odd player gains units n n displaystyle frac else player loses n n displaystyle frac units utility expected utility game n n n ln displaystyle sum frac however since sum absolutely convergent may rearranged sum number including positive negative infinity suggests expected utility pasadena game depends summation order standard decision theory provide principled way
