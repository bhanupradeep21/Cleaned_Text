olfactory neuroepithelium located roof nasal chambers comprises bipolar receptor cells supporting cells basal cells brush approximately million bipolar sensory receptor neurons whose cell bodies dendrites epithelium axons cells aggregate fascicles called olfactory fila project cribriform plate pia matter axons collectively make olfactory nerve cn serve purpose mediating sense characteristics bipolar receptor neurons include cilia dendritic ends project mucus regeneration basal cells damage receptor neuron also first order neuron first order neurons project axons directly nasal chamber brain first neuron characteristic allows direct exposure environment makes brain vulnerable infection invasion xenobiotic agents supporting cells called sustentacular cells provide metabolic physical support receptors insulating cell regulating composition mucus basal stem cells give rise neurons nonneuronal cells allow constant regeneration receptor cells surrounding olfactory transduction begins movement odorants air phase aqueous phase olfactory mucus odorants transported odorant binding proteins diffuse mucus reach cilia dendritic ends bipolar receptor neurons stimulation causes action

due variety causes symptoms often patients may unsure whether issues smell taste specifically important identify whether distortion applies inhaled odorant odor exists without stimulus distortion odorant presented two types stimuli different one remembers everything similar smell clinical history also help determine kind dysosmia one events respiratory infection head trauma usually indications parosmia phantosmia often occurs spontaneously unfortunately wholly accurate diagnostic tests methods evaluation must done questionnaires medical even though dysosmia often goes away time medical surgical treatments dysosmia patients want immediate relief medical treatments include use topical nasal drops oxymetazoline hcl give upper nasal block air flow cant reach olfactory cleft medications suggested include sedatives antidepressants antiepileptic drugs medications may may work patients side effects may tolerable patients benefit medical treatment surgical treatment required options include bifrontal craniotomy excision olfactory epithelium cuts fila according studies transnasal endoscopic excision olfactory epithelium described safe effective phantosmia bifrontal craniotomy
