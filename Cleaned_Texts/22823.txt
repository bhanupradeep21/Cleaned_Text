limited capacity model motivated mediated message processing explanatory theory assumes humans limited capacity cognitive processing information associates mediated message variables moreover viewers actively engaged processing mediated like many mass communication theories amalgam finds origins psychology specifically theory origins limited capacity model understanding cognitive information processing fundamental assumptions information processing three dimensions cognitive processing three dimensions encoding storage retrieval viewers get presented information heads messages processed

key concepts total resources resources allocated resources required resources remaining resources available total resources refer total resources resource pool resources allocated refer resources actually available processing task resource allocated task may equivalent total resources probably resources required amount resources necessary complete task see totalallocatedrequired resources resources remaining refer difference total resources resources required resources available difference resources allocated resources resources remaining resources available may total resources equivalent resources allocated unlikely case see overall picture mental resources information processing reasons finetuned distinctions several first people may allocate available resources task hand cognitive misers unless highly motivated people tend use resources necessary thus distinction made total resources allocated resources second people allocate resources required task people watching program seen fewer resources may required familiarity program conversely production visual elements programming important resources may required cases amount resources may allocated tv program different amounts actually used leaving allocated resources available one case another third elements environment automatically draw resources example formal features automatically attract attention eg unrelated cuts drawing required resources total pool resources without conscious allocation resources case difference automatic attraction ie required resources total resources leaves remaining resources allocation tasks within model media messages may receive insufficient limited processing two basic reasons ie cognitive overload first may enough resources available process message fully ie required resources exceed total resources example message topic person understand may require many resources perhaps trying retrieve information longterm memory even though resources may allocated task required resources retrieval leave neither remaining available resources attending encoding message second may enough resources available process message resources allocated task reasons insufficient motivation person multitasking eg resources required exceeds resources allocated example person cooking watching tv time may enough resources available process tv program entirely watching tv involves number simultaneous cognitive processes tv viewing often requires people engage processing auditory visual information integrating two channels time auditory visual information include content program well formal features tv act syntax programming viewer must integrate information understand program addition viewers storing new information memory activating existing

treat mediated message like reality brain creates orienting response automatic cognitive response novel response cognitive reaction change measured via implicit measures recognition explicit measures electrochemical reactions cognitive processes automatic case controlled either event next step message engagement process move information storage storage conceptually modeled cognitive subprocessing information general associative associative networks conceptual nodes map brain uses sensor shortterm long term conceptualized site information stored ultimately retrieved normal conditions many

without cued information automatic cognitive responses elicited via cognitive response novel information primary method automatic responses elicited structural cues communication lang et al elaborates controlling structural features discovered relatedness media messages mattered dissected pacing mediated content two categories one used related editing camera angle content another unrelated cuts unrelated information previous information encoded pacing cues important media producers either help reinforce attention memory created low memory retention condition minds message processor inserting edits operationalized process switching cameras transitions visual audio media media producers elicit orienting responses attentive viewers accomplished mechanism allocating resources memory message processing effective low medium high edit therefore retrieval also possible measured via recognition testing however unlike related editing cues unrelated cuts make memory especially cuts coming message processor rapidly important secondarily entire illusion commercially driven media system premised concept advertising sells products importantly articles primary concern instruct media concerned generating public information importance editing cues deleterious uses disparate advertising ineffectiveness methodologically uses three primary sets measures study people allocate resources process information secondary task reaction time strt measure amount resources allocated attention strt involves people engaging primary task watching tv also monitoring second task pressing button whenever cue tone sounds light comes amount resources available ie resources allocated minus resources required demonstrated influence long takes people respond lot resources available people quickly notice light tone quick press button resources low taxed people take longer notice light tone slower respond example cut unrelated scene tends tax resources new information needs processed strt slower critically strt function resources allocated task resources required second set methodological tools involves physiological measures heart rate galvanic skin responses sweating muscle activity heart rate used measure whether orienting response people show aroused response heart rate decelerates seconds returning toward baseline likewise increase skin conductance evidence aroused response thus combined evidence heart rate deceleration increase skin conductance provides convergent evidence orienting response occurred final set methodological tools involves measures memory including recall recognition measures memory used make inferences encoding retrieval processes example messages simple increasing people attention message inclusion formal features orient attention edits results improvements memory message finding suggests available resources ie resources allocated required could diverted encoding processes conversely complex message addition features increase ors tends lead decrements memory suggests ors automatically drew resources away encoding processes resulted worse memory decreased performance memory tests one indication resources required exceeded resources allocated task ability information processing mediated messages limits interference encoding storage retrieval messages especially receiver interested message creates situation required resources needed process information dedicated fewer associative links made available message therefore limits ability process media concern researchers interested studying people encode store information information processors devote appropriate number resources required process information information overload inhibit abilities individuals encode store retrieve additionally ability information processors process messages also limited unique retrieval subprocessing abilities related perceptions compiled timecitation needed thus subprocess retrieval affected two dimensions later retrieval done fact concurrent retrieval real time affect information processing messages
