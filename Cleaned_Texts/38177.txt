communal roosting animal behavior group individuals typically species congregate area hours based external signal return site reappearance environmental signals often responsible grouping including nightfall high tide distinction communal roosting cooperative breeding absence chicks communal communal roosting generally observed birds behavior also seen bats primates size roosts measure thousands millions individuals especially among avian many benefits associated communal roosting including increased foraging ability decreased thermoregulatory demands decreased predation increased conspecific many proposed evolutionary concepts communal roosting evolved specific hypothesis currently supported scientific community whole one adaptive explanations communal roosting hypothesis individuals benefited exchange information communal roosts idea known information center hypothesis ich proposed peter ward amotz zahavi states bird assemblages communal roosts act information hubs distributing knowledge food source location food patch knowledge unevenly distributed amongst certain flock members clueless flock members follow join knowledgeable members find good feeding locations quote ward zahavi evolutionary reasons communal roosts came communal roosts breeding colonies certain bird assemblages evolved primarily efficient exploitation unevenlydistributed food sources serving informationcentres two strategies hypothesis put forth patrick weatherhead alternative popular information center hypothesis hypothesis proposes different individuals join participate communal roosts different reasons based primarily social status unlike ich individuals join roost order increase foraging capabilities hypothesis explains roosts initially evolved due information sharing among older experienced foragers evolution aided benefits experienced foragers gained due fact better foragers acquired status high rank within roost dominant individuals able obtain safest roosts typically highest tree closest center roost roosts less dominant unsuccessful foragers act physical predation buffer dominant individuals similar selfish herd theory states individuals within herds utilize conspecifics physical barriers predation younger less dominant individuals still join roost gain safety predation dilution effect well ability learn experienced foragers already support two strategies hypothesis shown studies roosting rooks corvus frugilegus study roosting rooks ian swingland showed inherent hierarchy exists within rook communal roosts hierarchy dominant individuals shown routinely occupy roosts highest tree pay cost increased energy use keep warm safer terrestrial despite enforced hierarchy lower ranking rooks remained roost indicating still received benefit participation weather conditions worsened dominant rooks forced younger less dominant roosts swingland proposed risk predation lower roosts outweighed gains reduced thermal similar support two strategies hypothesis also found redwinged blackbird roosts species dominant males regularly inhabit roosts thicker brush better hidden predators less dominant individuals forced roost edge tsh makes several assumptions must met order theory work first major assumption within communal roosts certain roosts possess safer beneficial qualities roosts second assumption dominant individuals capable securing roosts finally dominance rank must reliable indicator foraging proposed heinz richner philipp heeb recruitment center hypothesis rch explains evolution communal roosting result group foraging rch also explains behaviors seen communal roosts passing information aerial displays presence lack calls hypothesis assumes factors decrease relative food competition since control food source individual correlated duration richness said passing information acts create foraging group group foraging decreases predation increases relative feeding time cost sharing food source decrease predation due dilution factor early warning system created multiple animals alert increases relative feeding explained decreasing time spent watching predators social recruiting new members food patches benefits successful foragers increasing relative addition new members group benefits group foraging increase group size larger food source able support less successful foragers benefit gaining knowledge food sources aerial displays used recruit individuals participate group foraging however birds display since birds members group part group seeking participants presence patchy resources richner heeb propose simplest manner would form communal roost recruit participants words recruitment foraging groups explains presence communal roosts support rch shown ravens covus corax reviewing previous study john marzluff bernd heinrich colleen marzluff etienne danchin heinz richner demonstrate collected data proves rch instead information center hypothesis supported marzluff et al knowledgeable naïve clueless birds shown make roosts leave time naïve birds led food sources aerial demonstrations shown peak around time discovery new food communities made nonbreeders forage patchily distributed food environments following assumptions made richner sarangi et al shown recruitment centre hypothesis hold study population common mynas acridotheres tristis hence common myna roosts recruitment point time additional scientific evidence excluding rch evidence overwhelming support overlooked rch information may also passed within communal roost increases solidifies birds communal roost reduce impact wind cold weather sharing body heat huddling reduces overall energy demand thermoregulation study guy beauchamp explained blackbilled magpies pica hudsonia often formed largest roosts winter magpies tend react slowly low body temperatures leaving vulnerable predators communal roosting case would improve reactivity sharing body heat allowing detect respond predators much large roost many members visually detect predators easier allowing individuals respond alert others quicker individual risk also lowered due dilution effect states individual large group low probability preyed upon similar selfishherd theory communal roosts demonstrated hierarchy sorts older members better foragers nest interior group decreasing exposure predators younger birds less able foragers located outskirts still demonstrate safety predation due dilution according ich successful foragers share knowledge favorable foraging sites unsuccessful foragers communal roost making energetically advantageous individuals communally roost forage easily additionally greater number individuals roost searching range roost increase improve probability finding favorable foraging also potentially improved mating opportunities demonstrated redbilled choughs pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax portion communal roost dedicated individuals lack mates costly territorial species physically travel roosts leaving territories open takeovers communal roosts may draw attention potential predators roost becomes audibly visibly conspicuous due number members also decrease local food supply greater number members results competition large number roost members also increases exposure droppings causing plumage deteriorate leaving birds vulnerable dying exposure droppings reduce ability feathers shed communal roosting observed numerous avian species previously mentioned rooks corvus frugilegus known form large nocturnal roosts roosts contain anywhere hundred thousand roosts disband daybreak birds return foraging activities studies shown communal roosting behavior mediated light intensity correlated sunset rooks return roost ambient light sufficiently acorn woodpeckers melanerpes formicivorus known form communal roosts winter months roosts two three individuals share cavity winter within tree cavities woodpeckers share body heat therefore decrease thermoregulatory demands individuals within small scale communal roosting winter months also observed green woodhoopoes phoeniculus purpureus winter communal roosts species typically contain around five tree swallows tachycineta bicolor located southeastern louisiana known form nocturnal communal roosts shown exhibit high roost fidelity individuals often returning roost occupied previous night research shown swallows form communal roosts due combined factors conspecific attraction individual swallows likely aggregate around swallows species roost tree swallows form roosts numbering hundreds thousands eurasian crag martins ptyonoprogne rupestris also form large nocturnal communal roosts winter months individuals found roosting communally gorhams cave complex gibraltar tree swallows research shown eurasian crag martins also exhibit high degree fidelity roost individuals returning caves within redbilled choughs pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax roost classified either main roost sub roost main roosts constantly use whereas sub roosts used irregularly individuals lacking mate territory sub roosts believed help improve ability nonbreeding choughs find mate increase territory interspecies roosts observed different bird species san blas mexico great egret ardea alba little blue heron egretta caerulea tricolored heron egretta tricolor snowy egret egretta thula known form large communal roosts shown snowy egret determines general location roost due fact three species rely abilities find food sources roosts often hierarchical system dominant species case snowy egret typically occupy desirable higher interspecies roosts also observed among avian communal roosting also well documented among insects particularly butterflies passionvine butterfly heliconius erato known form nocturnal roosts typically comprising four individuals believed roosts deter potential predators due fact predators attack roosts less often communal roosting behavior also observed neotropical zebra longwing butterfly heliconius charitonius la cinchona region costa rica study roost showed individuals vary roost fidelity tend form smaller sub roosts study observed region communal roosting mediated heavy communal roosting also observed south peruvian tiger beetles subfamily cicindelidae species tiger beetle observed form communal roosts comprising anywhere two nine individuals night disbanding day hypothesized beetles roost high treetops order avoid groundbased observations communal roosting mammals trait seen several species bats little brown bat myotis lucifugus known participate communal roosts thirty seven cold nights order decrease thermoregulatory demands roost disbanding several species bats including hoary bat lasiurus cinereus big brown bat eptesicus fuscus also observed roost communally maternal colonies
