propinquity effect ie tendency people meet spend time share common characteristics plays significant impact spousal similarity convergence refers increasing similarity time although previous research showed greater effect attitude value personality traits however found initial assortment ie similarity within couples beginning marriage rather convergence plays crucial role explaining spousal active assortment refers direct effects choosing someone similar oneself mating preferences data showed greater effect political religious attitudes personality traits followup issue reason finding raised
