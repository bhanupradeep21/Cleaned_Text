haemochromatosis often made following incidental finding routine blood screening elevated serum liver enzymes elevation transferrin saturation elevated serum ferritin arthropathy stiff joints diabetes

measuring ferritin provides crude estimate wholebody iron stores though raised many conditions particularly inflammatory conditions examples causes raised serum ferritin include limited infection
