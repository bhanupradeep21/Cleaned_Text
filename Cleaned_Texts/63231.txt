preorbital gland paired exocrine gland found many species artiodactyls homologous lacrimal gland found humans glands trenchlike slits dark blue black nearly bare skin extending medial canthus eye lined combination sebaceous sudoriferous glands produce secretions contain pheromones semiochemical ungulates frequently deposit secretions twigs grass means communication preorbital gland serves different roles different species pheromonecontaining secretions preorbital gland may serve establish animals dominance especially preparation mark territory simply produce pleasurable sensation critical role scent marking preorbital gland usually considered type scent gland function glands may produce antimicrobial compounds fight skin pathogens antimicrobial compounds found glands may
