sulfotep temephos compound eu regulatory approval use insecticide harmful aquatic environment deemed toxic chlorethoxyfos first registered united states use insecticide registered conditionally united states environmental protection agency since additional studies needed refine risk assessments agency agency decided reassess chlorethoxyfos tolerance conduct occupational risk assessment condition registration compound agency published revised risk assessment forms basis decisions risk management primary target organophosphorus insecticides like chlorethoxyfos insects mammals nervous system inhibiting acetylcholinesterase ache function acetylcholinesterase break neurotransmitter acetylcholine released cholinergic nerve endings response nervous stimuli organophosphorus compounds inhibit acetylcholinesterase forming covalent bond compound active site ache inhibiting acetylcholinesterase acetylcholine accumulates synaptic cleft reaching toxic levels loss ache activity leads excessive nervous stimulation results neuromuscular paralysis may even cause respiratory failure organophosphorus compound really stable hydrolysis active site slow leading longterm toxic organophosphorus insecticides adverse effect nervous system also affect processes body recent studies show organophosphorus insecticides inhibit enzymes take part xenobiotic metabolism example carboxylases cyp enzymes enzymes play role cell signaling like lipases metabolism organophosphates occurs mostly liver also organs like intestine chlorethoxyfos act inhibitor phase enzymes need activate organophosphate phase metabolism involves oxidation hydrolysis oxidative desulfurization cyp enzymes replace sulfur phosphorus oxygen atom oxidation hydrolysis organophosphate esterases takes places detoxification occurs esterase cleaves compound besides processes phase also oxidative removal side chains oxidative cleavage leaving group take place products phase metabolism hydrophilic making easier conjugated phase ii metabolism phase ii detoxification reactions take place reactions compounds excreted via urinecitation needed products metabolism chlorethoxyfos include dichloroacetic acid trichloroacetic acid trichloroethanol due cleavage potetrachloroethoxy important enzymes metabolism organophosphorus compounds first three cytochromes catalyze oxidative desulfuration important oxidative cleavage leaving group detoxificationcitation needed radioactively labelled chlorethoxyfos orally administered mice rats rapidly eliminated seven days exposure radioactive dose recovered urine chlorethoxyfos synthesized chloral phosphorus phosphorus chloride added chloral via addition double bond chloral oxygen bound becomes single bond arising negative point charge oxygen phosphorus pentachloride bind hereby losing one chloride carbon oxygen bound gets positive charge cl bind intermediate appeared reacts hydrogen sulfide order form next intermediate two chlorides replaced double bonded sulfur ethanol added substitute chlorides still bound phosphorus atom happens via substitution mechanism resulting insecticides like chlorethoxyfos designed lethal agents chlorethoxyfos designed less toxic humans insects present toxic hazard extent unstable aquatic environments accidental extraction chlorethoxyfos aquatic environments may result exertion toxic effects aquatic organisms degradation

effects called organophosphorus induced delayed neuropathy toxicity chlorethoxyfos mainly poses risks workers employed application pesticide pesticides like chlorethoxyfos absorbed various types routes like inhalation ingestion dermal absorption repeated prolonged exposure chlorethoxyfos may result effects acute exposure effects include impaired memory concentration disorientation severe depressions irritability confusion headache speech difficulties delayed reaction times nightmares sleepwalking drowsiness next chlorethoxyfos exerting main effects irreversible inhibition ache suggested acute chronic intoxication chlorethoxyfos seem disturb redox processes hereby changing activities antioxidative enzymes causing enhancement lipid peroxidation many organs acute cases exposition induction oxidative stress one main toxic effects thereby may cause many human body disorders affecting liver kidney muscles immune hematological system attack reactive oxygen species chlorethoxyfos causes attack lipids proteins dna leads oxidation membrane damage enzyme inactivation dna damage cell death damage dna leads genomic instability may cause mutagenesis carcinogenesis next use pesticide organophosphorus compounds like chlorethoxyfos may used therapy neurological damages ad parkinsons like organophosphates chlorethoxyfos anticholinesterase activity makes highly
