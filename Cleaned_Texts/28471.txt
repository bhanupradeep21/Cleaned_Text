isotonic contraction tension remains whilst muscles length changes isotonic contractions differ isokinetic contractions isokinetic contractions muscle speed remains constant superficially identical muscles force changes via lengthtension relationship contraction isotonic contraction keep force constant velocity changes isokinetic contraction keep velocity constant force changes near isotonic contraction known auxotonic contraction two types isotonic contractions concentric eccentric concentric contraction muscle tension rises meet resistance remains muscle shortens eccentric muscle lengthens due resistance greater force muscle producingcitation needed type typical exercise external force muscle less force muscle generating shortening contraction effect visible classic biceps curl fact auxotonic resistance torque due weight lifted remain exercise tension highest parallel floor level eases point therefore tension changes well muscle lengthcitation needed two main features note regarding eccentric contractions first absolute tensions achieved high relative muscles maximum tetanic tension generating capacity set much heavier object second absolute tension relatively independent lengthening velocity muscle injury soreness selectively associated eccentric muscle strengthening using exercises involve eccentric contractions lower using concentric however higher levels tension easier attain exercises involve eccentric contractions may generating higher signals muscle strengthening muscle hypertrophy better exercises involve concentric contractions albeit higher level resistancecitation needed almost isotonic contraction fluctuation towards end contraction example hearts ventricles contract expel blood pulmonary artery aorta blood flows previous builtup load decreased hence less force required expel rest blood thus tension reducedcitation needed httpsenwikipediaorgwikiisotoniccontraction
