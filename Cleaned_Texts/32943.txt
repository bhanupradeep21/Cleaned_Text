angiogenesis inhibitor substance inhibits growth new blood vessels angiogenesis angiogenesis inhibitors endogenous normal part bodys control others obtained exogenously pharmaceutical drugs diet angiogenesis critical part wound healing favorable processes certain types angiogenesis associated growth malignant tumors thus angiogenesis inhibitors closely studied possible cancer treatment angiogenesis inhibitors thought potential silver bullet treatment applicable many types cancer limitations antiangiogenic therapy shown currently angiogenesis inhibitors recognized improvement cancer immunotherapy overcoming endothelial cell anergy angiogenesis inhibitors also used effectively treat macular degeneration eye diseases involve proliferation blood tumor stimulates growth new vessels said undergone angiogenic switch principal stimulus angiogenic switch appears oxygen deprivation although stimuli inflammation oncogenic mutations mechanical stress may also play role angiogenic
