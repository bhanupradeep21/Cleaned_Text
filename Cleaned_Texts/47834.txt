dragons egg hard science fiction novel american writer robert l forward story dragons egg neutron star surface gravity billion times earth inhabited cheela intelligent creatures size sesame seed live think develop million times faster humans novel may june chronicles cheela civilization beginning discovery agriculture advanced technology first facetoface contact humans observing hyperrapid evolution cheela civilization orbit around dragons egg typical genre dragons egg attempts communicate unfamiliar ideas imaginative scenes giving adequate attention known scientific principles involved half million years ago lightyears earth star constellation draco turns supernova stars remnant becomes neutron star radiation explosion causes mutations many earth organisms including group hominina become ancestors homo sapiens stars shortlived plasma jets lopsided anomalies magnetic field set course passing within astronomical units sun ad human astronomers detect neutron star call dragons egg send expedition explore star contains half solar mass matter compressed diameter kilometers miles making surface gravity billion times earth outer crust compressed kg per cubic centimeter mainly iron nuclei high concentration overlaid millimeter inches white dwarf star atmosphere mostly iron vapor centimeters inches thick star shrinks slightly cools causes crust crack produce mountains millimeters inches high large volcanoes formed liquid material oozing deep cracks many centimeters high hundred meters diameter eventually collapse causing around bc dragons egg cools enough allow stable equivalent chemistry compounds constructed nuclei bound strong force rather earths atoms bound electromagnetic force stars chemical processes one million times faster earths selfreplicating molecules appear shortly life begins star star continues cool complex life evolves plantlike organisms appear around bc one lineage later became first animals earliest stealing seedpods sessile organisms later lineages becoming adults stars intelligent species called cheela flexion gender number mass adult human however extreme gravity dragons egg compresses cheela volume sesame flattened shape millimeters

dangerous predator november human expedition dragons egg starts building orbital facilities rest story including almost whole history cheela civilization spans may june humans standards day dragons egg seconds typical cheelas lifetime one clan organizes first cheela agriculture brings predictable food supply provokes grumbling repetitive work shortly volcano emerges area clan invents first sledge carry food distant sources however within generations volcano pollutes soil one clan leads population long arduous journey new territory fertile uninhabited although one genius invents mathematics calculate measure bands food supply situation desperate clans survival depends selfsacrifice oldest members course generations cheela come worship humans spacecraft god records satellites movements cause develop writing several generations later cheela build arena accommodate thousands worshippers humans notice novel regular feature conclude intelligent beings inhabit star use laser send simple messages cheela astronomers gradually realize diagrams spaceships satellites crew impossibly spindly creatures communicate frustrating slowness apparently almost long cheelas great arena cheela engineer proposes send messages humans attempts transmit civilizations territory ineffective travels mountain range transmit directly spacecraft conquering fear heights instinctive flattened creatures living billion g humans recognize message realize cheela live million times faster humans since realtime conversations impossible humans send sections expeditions library reading astronomy article cheela realizes supernova half million human years ago created races many cheela generations later hours humans cheelas develop gravity manipulation generations later cheela spacecraft visits human one although still need extreme gravity fields survive cheela control precisely enough races see facetoface safety cheela decided transferring technologies far advanced humans would stunt humanitys development however cheela leave clues several challenging locations going separate ways dragons egg forward describes history development life form cheela evolves surface neutron star highly dense collapsed star km diameter dragons egg title named earth observed near tail constellation draco dragon cheela develop sentience intelligence despite relative small size individual cheela approximately volume sesame seed mass human intense gravity field restricts movement third dimension much book concerns biologic social development cheela subplot arrival human vessel nearby neutron
