triunfosaurus meaning triunfo basin reptile genus somphospondylan sauropod dinosaur early cretaceous brazil contains single species leonardii described carvalho et al genus triunfosaurus distinguished titanosaurs unique proportions ischium initially described basal titanosaur making earliest basal titanosaur known however subsequent research questioned identification taxon titanosaur instead reassigning somphospondyli triunfosaurus distinguished titanosaurs two autapomorphies unique traits distinguish titanosaurs namely part ischium touching pubis half height entire ischium shaft ischium makes angle less acetabular portion contributes hip socket also presents unique combination vertebral characters seen otherwise among titanosaurs described vertebrae near front tail short robust processes prezygapophyses front edges processes also slightly angled upwards horizontal top vertebrae neural spines small bear processes along midlines expanded near top side vertebrae transverse processes placed near back bones also slightly angled upward back half sides centra strongly concave depressions sides vertebrae known pleurocoels rather small internal textures centra spongelike haemal arches bottoms vertebrae near front tail holes form centra haemal canals narrow arches relatively straight bottom ends arches rounded expanded arches connect centra simple facet joints tops bones near middle tail haemal canals smaller height proportionally wider haemal arches overall become flattened including bottom ends arches also slightly concave joints centra situated closer back end base arch back side two small crests form ridgelike holotype triunfosaurus ufrjdg found sandstone layer rio piranhas formation west paraíba state brazil consists partial skeleton including series three middle tail vertebrae subsequently considered vertebrae front three isolated chevrons three isolated neural spines right ischium fossils part collection universidade federal rio de janeiro based correlation using pollen cooccurrence similar rio piranhas formation considered contemporary sousa formation extends berriasian valanginian possibly hauterivian correlating rio da serra early aratu faunal stages study pollen found rio piranhas supports berriasianvalanginian age although presence hauterivian deposits ruled type species triunfosaurus leonardii named described ismar de souza carvalho leonardo salgado rafael matos lindoso hermínio ismael de araújojúnior francisco cézar costa nogueira josé agnelo soares generic name refers triunfo basin paraíba specific name honours paleontologist giuseppe triunfosaurus placed clade titanosauria defined wilson upchurch supported articulations haemal arches two distinct surfaces initially triunfosaurus found rather basal polytomy along mendozasaurus basal position supported tail vertebrae flattened back ends instead convex procoelous configuration derived lithostrotian additionally short shaft ischium indeed proportions bone general quite similar similarly basal however straight vertical neural spines warrant derived position either andesaurus mendozasaurus relative shortness haemal canal relative rest haemal arch

opisthocoelicaudia skarzynskii saltasaurus loricatus neuquensaurus australis topology poorly supported since forcing triunfosaurus nest outside titanosauria would require two additional evolutionary steps support values obtained clades also low oldest basal titanosaurian found date triunfosaurus initially used support hypothesis wider group originated supercontinent gondwana around hauterivian specifically within south nevertheless alternate hypothesis involving dispersal europe remains subsequent redescription somphospondylan austrosaurus steven poropat colleagues raised number objections titanosaurian status triunfosaurus poropat et al noted furrow separating arch two surfaces used carvalho et al assign triunfosaurus titanosauria likewise present nontitanosaur somphospondylans phuwiangosaurus remarked short haemal canal directly contradicts titanosauria defined wilson although feature somewhat additionally assignment caudal vertebrae middle tail also questioned poropat et al features vertebrae unusual middle caudal vertebrae include prominent transverse processes bearing deep diapophyses articulations ribs pronounced prezygodiapophyseal laminae connecting prezygapophyses transverse processes welldeveloped spinoprezygapophyseal laminae connecting prezygapophyses neural spines deep indentations outer margins bottom centra postzygapophyseal facet joints extending backwards midpoint side centra size transverse processes suggests vertebrae actually originate front tail making association ischium questionable due overall small size reasons poropat et al reassigned triunfosaurus somphospondyli unable confidently support titanosaurian affinities due problematic vertebrate fossils triunfo basin tend extremely fragmentary poço county locality fragments crocodylomorph bones found triunfo basin better known presence ichnotaxa individual trackways produced dinosaurs known footprints may made triunfosaurus environment probably consisted alluvial fans
