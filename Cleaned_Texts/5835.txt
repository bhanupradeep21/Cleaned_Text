dolly july february female finndorset sheep first mammal cloned adult somatic cell cloned associates roslin institute scotland using process nuclear transfer cell taken mammary gland cloning proved cloned organism could produced mature cell specific body contrary popular belief first animal employment adult somatic cells lieu embryonic stem cells cloning emerged foundational work john gurdon cloned african clawed frogs approach successful cloning dolly led widespread advancements within stem cell research including discovery induced pluripotent stem dolly lived roslin institute throughout life produced several euthanized age six years due progressive lung disease cause linked disease cloning dollys body preserved donated roslin institute scotland national museum scotland regularly exhibited since dolly cloned keith campbell ian wilmut colleagues roslin institute part university edinburgh scotland biotechnology company ppl therapeutics based near edinburgh funding dollys cloning provided ppl therapeutics ministry born july died february progressive lung disease considered unrelated called worlds famous sheep sources including bbc news scientific cell used donor cloning dolly taken mammary gland production healthy clone therefore proved cell taken specific part body could recreate whole individual dollys name wilmut stated dolly derived mammary gland cell couldnt think impressive pair glands dolly dolly born july three mothers one provided egg another dna third carried cloned embryo created using technique somatic cell nuclear transfer cell nucleus adult cell transferred unfertilized oocyte developing egg cell cell nucleus removed hybrid cell stimulated divide electric shock develops blastocyst implanted surrogate dolly first clone produced cell taken adult production dolly showed genes nucleus mature differentiated somatic cell still capable reverting embryonic totipotent state creating cell go develop part dollys existence announced public february gained much attention media commercial scottish scientists playing sheep aired tv special report time magazine featured science featured dolly breakthrough year even though dolly first animal cloned received media attention first cloned adult dolly lived entire life roslin institute bred welsh mountain ram produced six lambs total first lamb named bonnie born april next year dolly produced twin lambs sally rosie gave birth triplets lucy darcy cotton late age four dolly developed arthritis began walk stiffly treated antiinflammatory february dolly euthanised progressive lung disease severe finn dorset dolly life expectancy around years dolly lived years postmortem examination showed form lung cancer called ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma also known fairly common disease sheep caused retrovirus roslin scientists stated think connection dolly clone sheep flock died lung diseases particular danger sheep kept indoors dolly sleep inside security press speculated contributing factor dollys death could born genetic age six years age sheep one basis idea finding dollys telomeres short typically result aging roslin institute stated intensive health screening reveal abnormalities dolly could come advanced scientists reported defects thirteen cloned sheep including four cell line dolly first study review longterm health outcomes cloning authors found evidence lateonset noncommunicable diseases minor examples osteoarthritis concluded could find evidence therefore detrimental longterm effect cloning scnt health aged offspring among death dollys body preserved via taxidermy currently display national museum scotland edinburgh cloning successfully demonstrated production dolly many large mammals cloned including attempt clone argali mountain sheep produce viable embryos attempt clone banteng bull successful attempts clone mouflon form wild sheep resulting viable reprogramming process cells need go cloning perfect embryos produced nuclear transfer often show abnormal making cloned mammals highly inefficient dolly lamb survived adulthood attempts chinese scientists reported success rates cloning korean company sooam biotech producing cloned embryos wilmut led team created dolly announced nuclear transfer technique may never sufficiently efficient use cloning may uses preserving endangered species may become viable tool reviving extinct january scientists centre food technology research aragon northern spain announced cloning pyrenean ibex form wild mountain goat officially declared extinct although newborn ibex died shortly birth due physical defects lungs first time extinct animal cloned may open doors saving endangered newly extinct species resurrecting frozen july four identical clones dolly daisy debbie dianna denise alive healthy nine years scientific american concluded main legacy dolly cloning animals advances stem cell dolly researchers realised ordinary cells could reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells grown first successful cloning primate species reported january using method produced dolly two identical clones macaque monkey zhong zhong hua hua created researchers china born late january scientists china reported creation five identical cloned geneedited monkeys using method geneediting technique allegedly used jiankui creating first ever genemodified human babies lulu nana monkey clones made order study several medical
