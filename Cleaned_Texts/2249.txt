human voice consists sound made human using vocal tract including talking singing laughing crying screaming shouting humming yelling human voice frequency specifically part human sound production vocal folds vocal cords primary sound source sound production mechanisms produced general area body involve production unvoiced consonants clicks whistling whispering generally speaking mechanism generating human voice subdivided three parts lungs vocal folds within larynx voice box articulators lungs pump must produce adequate airflow air pressure vibrate vocal folds vocal folds vocal cords vibrate use airflow lungs create audible pulses form laryngeal sound muscles larynx adjust length tension vocal folds finetune pitch tone articulators parts vocal tract larynx consisting tongue palate cheek lips etc articulate filter sound emanating larynx degree interact laryngeal airflow strengthen weaken sound source vocal folds combination articulators capable producing highly intricate arrays tone voice may modulated suggest emotions anger surprise fear happiness sadness human voice used express also reveal age sex singers use human voice instrument creating adult men women typically different sizes vocal fold reflecting malefemale differences larynx size adult male voices usually lowerpitched larger folds male vocal folds would measured vertically opposite diagram mm mm female

vestibular fold false vocal cord small sac two folds difference vocal folds size men women means differently pitched voices additionally genetics also causes variances amongst sex mens womens singing voices categorized types example among men bass bassbaritone baritone baritenor tenor countertenor ranging higher among women contralto alto mezzosoprano soprano ranging higher additional categories operatic voices see voice type source difference male female voice men generally speaking larger vocal tract essentially gives resultant voice lowersounding timbre mostly independent vocal folds human spoken language makes use ability almost people given society dynamically modulate certain parameters laryngeal voice source consistent manner important communicative phonetic parameters voice pitch

unrelated muscles altered one actions results change pitch volume timbre tone sound produced sound also resonates within different parts body individuals size bone structure affect somewhat sound produced individual singers also learn project sound certain ways resonates better within vocal tract known vocal resonation another major influence vocal sound production function larynx people manipulate different ways produce different sounds different kinds laryngeal function described different kinds vocal primary method singers accomplish use singers formant shown resonance added normal resonances vocal tract frequency range instruments enables singers voice carry better musical vocal registration refers system vocal registers within human voice register human voice particular series tones produced vibratory pattern vocal folds possessing quality registers originate laryngeal functioning occur vocal folds capable producing several different vibratory vibratory patterns appears within particular vocal range pitches produces certain characteristic occurrence registers also attributed effects acoustic interaction vocal fold oscillation vocal term register somewhat confusing encompasses several aspects human voice term register used refer linguistics register language language combines tone vowel phonation single phonological system within speech pathology term vocal register three constituent elements certain vibratory pattern vocal folds certain series pitches certain type sound speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based physiology laryngeal function vocal fry register modal register falsetto register whistle register view also adopted many vocal vocal resonation process basic product phonation enhanced timbre andor intensity airfilled cavities passes way outside air various terms related resonation process include amplification enrichment enlargement improvement intensification prolongation although strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question main point drawn terms singer speaker end result resonation make better seven areas may listed possible vocal resonators sequence lowest within body highest areas

growths called nodules longer abuse occurs larger stiffer nodules become polyps larger nodules may called names polypoid degeneration reinkes edema polyps caused single occurrence may require surgical
