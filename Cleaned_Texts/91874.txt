patency airway keeping tongue falling back posterior pharyngeal wall occluding airway therefore preventing airway obstruction hypoxia asphyxia nasopharyngeal airways available every center however available nasopharyngeal cannulation favored treatments mentioned article far less invasive allows infant feed without placement nasogastric tube treatment may utilized multiple months jaw grown

called mandibular distraction used correct abnormal smallness one jaws seen patients prs enlargement lower jaw brings tongue forward preventing obstructing upper airway process begins preoperative assessment doctors use threedimensional imaging identify parts patients facial skeleton need repositioning determine magnitude direction distraction may select appropriate distraction device sometimes custom devices fabricated possible intraoral devices used surgery starts osteotomy surgical division sectioning bone followed distraction device placed skin across osteotomy days later two ends bone gradually pulled apart continual adjustments made device parents home adjustments made turning small screw protrudes skin usually rate mm per day gradual distraction leads formation new bone two ends
