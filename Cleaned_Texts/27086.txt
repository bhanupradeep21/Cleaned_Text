sexual selection humans concerns concept sexual selection introduced charles darwin element theory natural affects humans sexual selection biological way one sex chooses mate best reproductive success compete others sex best mate contribute genome future generations shaped human evolution many years reasons humans choose mates fully understood sexual selection quite different nonhuman animals humans feel evolutionary pressures reproduce easily reject role sexual selection human evolution firmly established although neoteny cited caused human sexual suggested sexual selection played part evolution anatomically modern human brain ie structures responsible social intelligence underwent positive selection sexual ornamentation used courtship rather survival developed ways outlined ronald fisher fisherian runaway fisher also stated development sexual selection favourable hypotheses evolution human brain argue sexually selected trait would confer enough fitness relative high maintenance costs fifth quarter energy oxygen consumed current consensus evolutionary development human brain accepts sexual selection potential contributing factor maintains human intelligence ability store share cultural knowledge would likely carried high survival value sexual selections role human evolution definitively established features may result equilibrium among competing selective pressures involving sexual selection others natural selection others pleiotropy richard dawkins argued charles darwin described sexual selection depending advantage certain individuals others sex species solely respect darwin noted sexual selection two kinds concluded kinds operated sexual struggle two kinds one individuals sex generally male sex order drive away kill rivals females remaining passive whilst struggle likewise individuals sex order excite charm opposite sex generally females longer remain passive select agreeable charles darwin conjectured male beard well hairlessness humans compared nearly mammals results sexual selection reasoned since bodies females nearly hairless loss fur due sexual selection females remote prehistoric time males overwhelming selective power nonetheless affected males due genetic correlation sexes also hypothesized contrasts sexual selection acting along natural selection significant factors geographical differentiation human appearance isolated groups believe natural selection alone provided satisfactory answer although explicit observation khoisan women posterior part body projects wonderful manner known implies sexual selection characteristic descent man selection relation sex darwin viewed many physical traits vary around world trivial concluded input sexual selection required account presence noted variation features among various peoples world meant human matechoice criteria would also quite different focus similar doubted reports indicating ideals beauty fact vary way around world effects human brain formation puberty directly linked hormones changes mismatch timing biological puberty age social maturity western society psychological expectation puberty men generally hairier women darwin opinion hairlessness related sexual selection however several explanations advanced explain human hairlessness leading one loss body hair facilitated idea closely relates suggested need increased photoprotection part mostcommonlyaccepted scientific explanation evolution pigmentary sexual dimorphism suggests presence sexual selection earliest homininae highly dimorphic tendency lessened course human evolution suggesting humans become monogamous contrast gorillas living harems exhibit much stronger sexual dimorphism see theory sexual selection used explain number human anatomical features include rounded breasts facial hair pubic hair penis size breasts primates flat yet able produce sufficient milk feeding young breasts nonlactating human females filled fatty tissue milk thus suggested rounded female breasts signals richard dawkins speculated loss penis bone humans present primates may due sexual selection females looking clear sign good health prospective mates since human erection relies hydraulic pumping system erection failure sensitive early warning certain kinds physical mental ill homo thicker penis great apes though average longer suggested evolution human penis towards larger size result female choice rather sperm competition generally favors large however penis size may subject natural selection rather sexual selection due larger penis efficiency displacing sperm rival males sexual intercourse model study showed displacement semen directly proportional depth pelvic thrusting efficient semen displacement variety factors drive sexual selection humans current available research indicates selection preferences biologically display phenotypic traits consciously unconsciously evaluated opposite sex determine health fertility potential process affected however social factors including cultures arranged marriage practiced psychosocial factors valuing certain cultural traits mate including persons social status perceived ideal partner various factors affect females select potential mates reproduction include voice pitch facial shape muscular appearance several studies suggest link hormone levels partner selection among humans study measuring female attraction males varying levels masculinity established women general masculinity preference mens voices preference masculinity greater fertile phase menstrual cycle nonfertile evidence study fertile stages menstrual cycle women also preference masculine traits body size facial shape dominant behavior indicators fertility study exclude males feminine traits selected however feminine traits men indicate higher probability longterm relationship may one several evolutionary research also backs idea using phenotypic traits means assessing potential mates fitness reproduction well assessing whether partner high genetic another factor affecting selection process environment person inhabits biological terms certain environmental conditions may bring demands disregarding certain traits one example preference males whose facial structure indicates certain hormonal ratios testosteronecortisol levels sex stress hormones research shows example countries varying human development index hdi levels females different preferences sexstress hormone ratios expressed males face royal society research showed significant correlation measure societal development preferences indication lower testosterone levels manifested facial features interaction preferences testosterone concluded societallevel ecological factors impact valuation traits combinations sex study reported women tend find man attractive mans previous relationships ended mutually less attractive man like female counterparts males also use visual information potential mate well voice body shape assortment factors selecting partner research shows males tend prefer feminine womens faces voices opposed women masculine features furthermore males also evaluate skin coloration symmetry apparent health means select partner reproductive males particularly attracted femininity womens faces testosterone levels highest level attraction femininity may fluctuate hormone levels studies men also done show effects exogenous testosterone effects attraction femininity results concluded throughout several studies men shown decreased preference feminine female faces longterm context given exogenous testosterone difference occur sexual selection preferences general terms mating reproductive process understood one article states sexual selection essence process favors sexual displays attraction aggressiveness dominance size strength ability exclude competitors force necessary using resources male female use voice face physical assess potential mates ability reproduce well together visual chemical signals crucial characteristics likely enhance ability produce offspring well longterm survival prospects assessed selections contest competition form sexual selection mating obtained using force threat force exclude samesex competitors male contest competition favors large body size seen sexual dimorphism human males living hominid species males muscular allowing strength power human males overall muscle mass compared greater muscle mass allows males gain greater acceleration speed powerful striking compared females human males exhibit samesex aggression peaks young male contest competition also often favors threat displays allow one competitor submit without costly low vocalization fundamental frequencies perceived vocal pitch increase perception threat among human controlling body size lower male fundamental frequency relative females tends evolve polygynous anthropoid primates males compete intensely chimpanzees humans greatest sexual dimorphism fundamental frequency males also likely engage physical risks front competitors males take physical risks perceived status badges facial hair generally related men perceived facial hair makes jaw appear prominent shows emotions like anger clearly makes male appear dominance associated increased male mating often contest competition produces anatomical weapons antlers large canine teeth however hominids lack canine weaponry typical reduced canine size may due bipedalism adaptations bipedalism common trait yet many species like great apes stand hind legs fighting increases power behind hominin hands adapted gripping tools hurling objects like bipedalism utilizing handheld objects weapons may aided early hominins contest competition reducing sexual selection pressures maintaining large canine several traits human males may selected contest competition males exhibit robust face compared may provided protection blows face contest competitions areas skull increased robusticity parts likely suffer additionally lefthanded males although lefthandedness heritable associated survival disadvantages rarity lefthandedness may given ancestral males fighting advantage competitions keeping trait gene pool via negative frequencydependent many combat sports boxing higherthanchance frequencies lefthanded individuals among top human males also able tolerate pain longer females especially higher pain tolerance allows males remain aggressive contests along increased aerobic males oxygen capacity rate higher aerobic capacity increases puberty males sexually maturing preparing human males engage withingroup contest competition coalitional latter form competition may supported males tending contribute group task competing groups discriminate strongly outgroup traits evolve contest competition large body size physical aggression often costly produce traits may therefore indicators male genetic quality andor ability provide resources direct consequently human females may evolve preferences traits comprise additional selection pressure however secondary sexual characteristics human males always enhance overall attractiveness traits human males function contests body size strength weaponry usage may also selected aid however contest competition observed great apes thus likely preceded hunting selective human female mating competition complex multifaceted varies across cultures societies females may compete highquality mates possess traits indicate underlying genetic quality possibly including physical attractiveness material resources enhance survival reproductive success female females may also compete leadership reputation social alliances networks provide support protection mating human females compete females sometimes including cowives obtain retain investment mates managing cooperative samesex human evolution cost aggressive physical contests females may high given females primary caregivers protectors offspring mothers death greatly impacts infant behaviors mothers competing females similar life stage resources include selfpromotion competitor however maternal competition remains understudied compared male aggression female aggression tends indirect females tend engage subtle indirect aggression gossip competitive tool harm samesex rivals social partake competitor derogation prevent female rivals getting male gossip derogation social exclusion grant aggressor chance go undetected avoid retaliation derogation example eliminate samesex rivals reducing ability compete found girls suicide attempts associated amount indirect peer victimization whereas frequent indirect peer victimization associated boys suicide furthermore samesex harassment nonhuman animals impacted females ovulation capabilities suggests human females reproductive success could influenced stress induced indirect direct peer males pursue sexually attractive faithful longterm partners might source female mating competition greatly revolving around denigrating samesex rivals attractiveness reputation accusations promiscuity competitive women likely spread reputationharming information women suggesting reputation manipulation form female competition romantic women likely compete desirable mates maternal investment levels high social groups largely composed women living closer together looking similar resources benefit survival female physical aggression although less frequent less harmful males occurs societies appears driven least part competition due males physical advantages ancestral females less able monopolize mates contests consequently male mate choice likely played dominant role ancestral womens mating females compete attract mates possess traits appear shaped male mate choice rather contest traits include features like gracile facial features
