tricyclic antidepressants tcas class medications used primarily antidepressants tcas discovered early marketed later named chemical structure contains three rings atoms tetracyclic antidepressants tecas contain four rings atoms closely related group antidepressant compounds although tcas sometimes prescribed depressive disorders largely replaced clinical use parts world newer antidepressants

psychopharmacology early story begins synthesis chlorpromazine december rhônepoulencs chief chemist paul charpentier synthetic antihistamines developed rhônepoulenc psychiatric effects first noticed hospital paris first widely used psychiatric drug already generating significant revenue research chemists quickly began explore derivatives chlorpromazine first tca reported treatment depression imipramine dibenzazepine analogue chlorpromazine codenamed originally targeted treatment depression drugs tendency induce manic effects later described patients quite disastrous paradoxical observation sedative inducing mania led testing depressed patients first trial imipramine took place first report antidepressant effects published swiss psychiatrist roland kuhn testing geigys

preferred medications tcas among older adults due reduced anticholinergic effects diminished cardiac toxicity linear many years tcas first choice pharmacological treatment major depression although still considered highly effective increasingly replaced antidepressants improved safety sideeffect profile ssris newer antidepressants novel reversible maoi moclobemide however tricyclic antidepressants possibly effective treating melancholic depression antidepressant drug newer antidepressants thought fewer less severe side effects also thought less likely result injury death used suicide attempt doses required clinical treatment potentially lethal overdose see therapeutic index far wider comparison nonetheless tcas commonly prescribed treatmentresistant depression failed respond therapy newer antidepressants also tend fewer emotional blunting sexual side effects ssri considered addictive somewhat preferable monoamine oxidase inhibitors maois side effects tcas usually come prominence therapeutic benefits depression andor anxiety reason may potentially somewhat dangerous volition increased possibly giving patient greater desire attempt commit tcas used past clinical

beneficial effects tcas behave like class antiarrhythmics theoretically terminate ventricular fibrillation decrease cardiac contractility increase collateral blood circulation ischemic heart muscle naturally overdose cardiotoxic prolonging heart rhythms increasing myocardial irritability new research also revealed compelling evidence link longterm use anticholinergic medications like tcas although many studies investigated link first study use longterm approach seven years find dementias associated anticholinergics may reversible even years drug use anticholinergic drugs block action acetylcholine transmits messages nervous system brain acetylcholine involved learning memory antidepressants general may produce withdrawal however since term withdrawal linked addiction recreational drugs like opioids medical profession pharmaceutical public relations prefer different term used hence discontinuation discontinuation symptoms managed gradual reduction dosage period weeks months
