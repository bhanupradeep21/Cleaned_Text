later revised marsh successively assigning older older strata culminating proposed early jurassic even late triassic age around time marsh took notice hallopus anatomy speculated fit within dinosauria marsh coined family hallopodidae suborder hallopoda placing within dinosauria publications marsh casts doubt however growing doubtful prior hypothesis arriving conclusion hallopus may link typical dinosaurs considered primitive forms aetosaurs crocodilians phytosaurs retains hallopoda within theropoda regardless hallopus received full detailed description figuring type material later expanded

vague describing size fox later likening rabbits size using proportions various sphenosuchians especially pedeticosaurus walker estimates total body length approximately cm like typical crocodylomorphs hallopus possessed two sacral vertebrae holotype firmly ossified leaving trace suture previous authors hypothesized presence third sacral however walker deems unlikely partly due
