meaning anchiceratops described named american paleontologist barnum brown believed dinosaur represented transitional form closely related monoclonius triceratops intermediate closest development skull frill latter hence generic name meaning near ceratops type valid species known today anchiceratops ornatus whose name refers ornate margin another specimen nmc cmn collected sternberg lacks

anchiceratops assigned decades lull romer russell chamney molnar agreed assignment ceratopsidae peter dodson phil currie placed phylogenetic analysis conducted ryan et al confirmed modern cladistic analyses usually recover anchiceratops advanced position within chasmosaurinae closer arrhinoceratops mallons study concluded however anchiceratops closely related chasmosaurus triceratops suggesting genus less derived previously cm sternberg originally designated smaller skull type specimen new species anchiceratops longirostris size horns significantly slender point forward instead upward later however paleontologists concluded size form skull falls within expected range variation seen ornatus probably member species mallon removed specimen nmc fossil material anchiceratops frill elements associated could determined certainty whether material belonged taxon related arrhinoceratops known formation comparable frill surface structure according mallon cm sternberg referred material anchiceratops unaware arrhinoceratops described march year correct would mean unequivocal postcrania skeletal elements posterior skull anchiceratops anchiceratops rare compared ceratopsians area usually found near marine sediments horseshoe canyon dinosaur park formations indicates anchiceratops may lived estuaries ceratopsids live flowering plants increasingly common still rare compared conifers cycads ferns probably made majority ceratopsian diets brown suggested distinctive frill horn form anchiceratops caused sexual selection intraspecies recognition could explain differences taxa difference defence wann langston jr suggested anchiceratops engaged semiaquatic lifestyle long snout would allowed animal cross deeper swamps walking catching breath waters surface heavy frill would acted counterbalance help point beak later paleontologists tended reject notion emphasizing dinosaurs general land animals mallon suggested semiaquatic lifestyle like modern hippopotamus least specimen nmc would explanation robustness extreme musculature limbs mallon admitted small tail thomas lehman proposed anchiceratops sexually dimorphic genus skull longirostris represents female anchiceratops skulls larger robust much longer horns point vertically proposed represent preliminary statistical analysis anchiceratops specimens mallon revealed variations skull form actually fall two distinct morphs likely represent individual variation forcing reject hypothesis two species likewise proof sexual jordan cole mallon ea pointed anchicertops ornatus species exceptionally longlived ceratopsid species typically last hundred thousand years several possible explanations given decreased competition related species less habitat fragmentation recession western interior seaway
