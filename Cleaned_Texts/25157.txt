human nature comprises fundamental dispositions ways thinking feeling humans said naturally term often used denote essence humankind means human usage proven controversial dispute whether essence actually exists arguments human nature central focus philosophy centuries concept continues provoke lively philosophical concepts distinct one another discussions regarding human nature typically
