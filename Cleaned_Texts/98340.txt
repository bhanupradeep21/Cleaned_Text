intraguild predation igp killing sometimes eating potential competitor different interaction represents combination predation competition species rely prey resources also benefit preying upon one another intraguild predation common nature asymmetrical one species feeds upon symmetrical species prey upon dominant intraguild predator gains dual benefits feeding eliminating potential competitor igp interactions considerable effects structure ecological communities intraguild predation classified asymmetrical symmetrical asymmetrical interactions one species consistently preys upon symmetrical interactions species prey equally upon intraguild predation also age structured case vulnerability species predation dependent age size juveniles smaller individuals one predators fed upon wide variety predatory relationships possible depending symmetry interaction importance age structure igp interactions range predators incidentally eating parasites attached prey direct predation two apex intraguild predation common nature widespread across communities intraguild predators must share least one prey species usually occupy trophic guild degree igp depends factors size growth population density predators well population density behavior shared creating theoretical models intraguild predation competing species classified top predator intermediate predator species likely preyed upon theory intraguild predation stable top predator benefits strongly killing feeding intermediate predator intermediate predator better competitor shared prey ecological effects intraguild predation include direct effects survival distribution competing predators well indirect effects abundance distribution prey species species within community common igp interactions important structuring intraguild predation may actually benefit shared prey species lowering overall predation pressure particularly intermediate predator consumes shared intraguild predation also dampen effects trophic cascades providing redundancy predation one predator removed ecosystem still consuming prey asymmetrical igp particularly strong influence habitat selection often intermediate predators avoid otherwise optimal habitat presence top behavioral changes intermediate predator distribution due increased risk predation influence community structure direct mortality caused top intraguild predation well documented terrestrial arthropods insects hemipteran insects larval lacewings prey upon aphids competing predators cause high enough mortality among lacewings effectively relieve predation upon several species centipede considered intraguild among dramatic examples intraguild predation large mammalian carnivores large canines felines mammal groups often involved igp larger species lions gray wolves preying upon smaller species foxes north america coyotes function intraguild predators gray foxes bobcats may exert strong influence population distribution gray
