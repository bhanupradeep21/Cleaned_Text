eoraptor ˈiːoʊˌræptər genus small lightly built basal sauropodomorph dinosaur one earliestknown dinosaurs one earliest members sauropod family lived approximately million years late triassic western gondwana region northwestern argentina type species eoraptor lunensis first described known almost complete wellpreserved skeleton several fragmentary ones eoraptor multiple tooth shapes suggests

ilium supported three sacral vertebrae atypical plesiomorphic two sacrals basal unlike coeval herrerasaurus supported two sacrals basal eoraptor vertebral centra hollow feature present ancestors bonaparte interpreted relatively large orbital opening skull juvenile trait ronald tykoski agreed suggested certain skull features type specimen suggested young specifically skull bones completely fused relatively large orbits short paul sereno et al supported notion eoraptor adult specimen based closure sutures vertebral column partial fusion according sereno et al eoraptor distinguished based fact premaxillary anterior maxillary teeth leafshaped external nares slightly enlarged premaxilla observed slender posterolateral max langer michael benton noted eoraptor distinguished based fact proximal part fibula extremely transversely paul sereno colleagues described named eoraptor determined one earliest age determined several factors least lacked specialized features major groups later dinosaurs including lack specialized predatory features sereno posited eoraptor earliestrecorded theropod closest hypothetical dinosaurian condition dinosaurian precise placement eoraptor within dinosauria unstable opinion often varying basal saurischian basal first described sereno forster regarded theropod based functionally tridactyl hand anatomical study conducted hansdieter sues sterling j nesbitt david berman amy c henrici featuring description daemonosaurus also concluded enough fossil evidence confidently classify eoraptor study noted transitional suite character states recently discovered dinosaurs daemonosaurus tawa support eoraptor basal theropod basal saurischian basal hand several studies onward recovered eoraptor early sauropodomorph rather citations following phylogenetic tree illustrates relationships eoraptor among major theropod groups based various studies conducted tetanurae philip currie found eoraptor anatomically closer would considered ancestral morphotype saurischian ornithischian martinez et al team described eodromaeus found eoraptor basal sauropodomorph characteristic features michael benton expressed hesitation claimed quite shift remove eoraptor theropoda place subsequent study apaldetti martinez alcober pol published found eoraptor saurischian close sauropodomorphs theropods though unable resolve two branches either fell sereno et al redescribed holotype skeleton concluded eoraptor theropod basal sauropodomorph consistent earlier observation made martinez et al large phylogenetic analysis early dinosaurs matthew baron david norman paul barrett found eoraptor earliest diverging member theropoda within larger clade phylogenetic analysis published description new buriolestes remains based langer et al placed eoraptor clade early sauropodomorphs alongside buriolestes panphagia pampadromaeus eoraptor thought although dentition quite similar buriolestes considered swift sprinter upon catching prey would use claws teeth tear prey apart unlike later carnivorous dinosaurs lacked sliding joint articulation lower jaw hold large prey furthermore teeth curved sawedged unlike mouths later theropods heterodont dentition eoraptor consists serrated recurved teeth upper jaw like teeth theropods leafshaped teeth lower jaw like teeth basal eoraptor teeth premaxilla teeth maxilla dental formula dissimilar herrerasaurus late triassic period ischigualasto formation volcanically active floodplain covered forests warm humid subject seasonal variations including strong vegetation consisted ferns horsetails giant conifers formed highland forests along banks herrerasaurus remains appear common among carnivores ischigualasto sereno noted eoraptor found close association therapsids rauisuchians archosaurs saurosuchus
