ultrasonic duplex scanning multidetector coronary tomography mdct angiography exercise testing simplistic noninvasive method diagnosing intermittent claudication blood pressure measurements suspected area taken exercise symptoms appear strenuous commonly treadmill setting mph slope utilized subjects asked walk treadmill maximum minutes moderate pain felt time pain maximal walking duration recorded compared baselines healthy individuals maintain systolic blood pressures normal range exercise becomes intense may temporary fall systolic pressure quickly returns normal rest however intermittent

subsequent diseases cad compared invasive xray treatment arterial occlusion varies depending extent blockage severe cases surgical intervention needed remove blockage affected artery currently types surgical approaches including surgical bypass endarterectomy embolectomy surgery required bloodthinning medication may prescribed surgical bypass procedure performed treat cad procedure involves
