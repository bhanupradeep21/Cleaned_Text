ratbite fever rbf acute febrile human illness caused bacteria transmitted rodents cases passed rodent human rodents urine mucous secretions alternative names ratbite fever include streptobacillary fever streptobacillosis spirillary fever bogger epidemic arthritic erythema rare disease spread infected rodents caused two specific types bacteria cases diagnosed patients exposed urine bodily secretions infected animal secretions come mouth nose eyes rodent majority cases due animals bite also transmitted food water contaminated rat feces urine animals infected disease including weasels gerbils squirrels household pets dogs cats exposed animals also carry disease infect humans person bitten rodent important quickly wash cleanse wound area thoroughly antiseptic solution reduce risk infection symptoms different every person depending type ratbite fever person infected spirillary streptobacillary ratbite fever individual symptoms although symptoms shared streptobacillosis commonly found united states spirillary ratbite fever generally diagnosed africa ratbite symptoms visually seen cases include inflammation around open sore rash also spread around area appear red symptoms associated streptobacillary ratbite fever include chills fever vomiting headaches muscle aches joints also become painfully swollen pain experienced back skin irritations ulcers inflammation develop hands feet wounds heal slowly symptoms possibly come go course months symptoms associated spirillary ratbite fever include issues lymph nodes often swell become inflamed reaction infection common locations lymph node swelling neck groin symptoms generally appear within two ten days exposure infected animal begins fever progresses rash hands feet within two four days rash appears body form rarely causes joint pain two types gramnegative facultatively anaerobic bacteria cause infection ratbite fever transmitted gramnegative coiled rod spirillum minus also known spirillum minor rarer found often asia japan disease called sodoku symptoms manifest two four weeks exposure organism wound entered exhibits slow healing marked inflammation fever lasts longer recurring months cases rectal pain gastrointestinal symptoms less severe absent penicillin common treatment streptobacillosis form ratbite fever known alternative names haverhill fever epidemic arthritic erythema severe disease caused streptobacillus moniliformis transmitted either rat bite ingestion contaminated products haverhill fever incubation period days haverhill fever begins high prostrating fevers rigors shivering headache polyarthralgia joint pain soon exanthem widespread rash appears either maculopapular flat red bumps petechial red purple spots arthritis large joints seen organism cultivated blood articular fluid disease fatal untreated cases due malignant endocarditis meningoencephalitis septic shock treatment penicillin tetracycline doxycycline condition diagnosed detecting bacteria skin blood joint fluid lymph nodes blood antibody tests may also get proper diagnosis ratbite fever different tests run depending symptoms experienced diagnosis streptobacillary ratbite fever blood joint fluid extracted organisms living cultured diagnosis spirillary rat bite fever direct visualization culture spirilla blood smears tissue lesions lymph eliminating exposure important comes disease handling rodents cleaning areas rodents contact hand mouth hands face washed contact scratches cleaned antiseptics applied effect chemoprophylaxis following rodent bites scratches disease unknown vaccines available diseases improved conditions minimize rodent contact humans best preventive measures animal handlers laboratory workers sanitation sewer workers must take special precautions exposure wild rodents dead alive touched pets must allowed ingest rodents living inner cities overcrowding poor sanitation cause rodent problems risk disease half cases reported children living conditions treatment antibiotics types infection condition responds penicillin allergies occur erythromycin tetracyclines used proper treatment provided patients ratbite fever prognosis positive without treatment infection usually resolves although may take year particular strain ratbite fever united states progress cause serious complications potentially fatal antibiotics used many cases resulted death left untreated streptobacillary ratbite fever result infection lining heart covering spinal cord brain lungs tissue organ throughout body may develop ratbite fever rbf zoonotic directly transmitted rats gerbils mice vectors humans either bite scratch passed rodent causative bacterial agent rbf also observed squirrels ferrets dogs common reservoir disease rats nearly domestic wild rats colonized causative bacterial agent streptobacillus moniliformis notably black rat rattus rattus norwegian rat rattus norvegicus recognized potential reservoirs due common use laboratory animals kept bacteria streptobacillus moniliformis found rats upper respiratory tract rats harbor disease asymptomatically signs symptoms rarely estimated bites rat result developing person also risk acquiring bacteria touching contaminated surfaces open wound mucous ingestion contaminated water food rodent feces though referred haverhill fever epidemic arthritic erythema rbf contagious disease transferred directly person researchers challenged understanding prevalence rbf one factor limits known number cases rbf united states reportable disease rbf classified notifiable disease means required state reported however state mandated provide information united states centers disease control identification rbf also hindered due presence two different etiological bacterial agents streptobacillus moniliformis spirillum rbf caused sp minus commonly found asia termed sodoku whereas st moniliformis found often united states western although cases rbf reported world majority cases documented caused st moniliformis primarily united states approximately cases identified due increasing population density illness seen frequently humans increased contact animals zoonotic diseases cases disease reported densely populated regions big populations risk broadened due fact domestic rats become common household pet united states estimated children years younger risk receiving total exposure followed laboratory personnel pet store groups increased risk people years old immunocompromised individuals pregnant symptoms rbf include sudden high temperature fevers rigors vomiting headaches painful jointsarthritis red bumpy rash develops subjects symptoms rbf develop days weeks symptoms differ streptobacillary spirillary rbf types exhibit incubation period symptoms due symptoms rbf often misdiagnosed clinicians leading lingering symptoms worsening conditions patients left untreated mortality rate death rate rbf even treated rbf lead migratory polyarthralgia persistent rash fatigue
