alagille syndrome algs genetic disorder affects primarily liver heart problems associated disorder generally become evident infancy early childhood disorder inherited autosomal dominant pattern estimated prevalence alagille syndrome every every live births named french pediatrician daniel alagille first described condition severity disorder vary within family symptoms ranging mild go unnoticed severe heart andor liver disease requires uncommon alagille syndrome lifethreatening disease mortality rate majority deaths algs typically due heart complications chronic liver needed signs symptoms arising liver damage alagille syndrome may include yellowish tinge skin whites eyes jaundice itching pruritus pale stools acholia enlarged liver hepatomegaly enlarged spleen splenomegaly deposits cholesterol skin liver biopsy may indicate bile ducts bile duct paucity cases complete absence bile ducts biliary atresia bile duct paucity results reduced absorption fat fatsoluble vitamins e k may lead rickets failure thrive cirrhosis eventual liver failure fairly common among algs patients severe hepatic manifestations require liver hepatocellular cancer reported small number cases extremely common signs alagille syndrome include congenital heart problems varying heart murmurs significant structural abnormalities tetralogy fallot pulmonary stenosis overriding aorta ventricular septal defect right ventricular hypertrophy common amongst alagille patients patients may also present ventricular septal defect atrial septal defect patent ductus arteriosus coarctation aorta mortality rate tetralogy fallot untreated ranges age age however complete surgical repair significantly improve longevity quality life patients alagille syndromecitation needed presentations alagilles syndrome include butterfly vertebrae ophthalmic defects distinct facial structures butterfly vertebrae detected xray typically symptoms abnormality skeletal defects common algs patients spina bifida fusion ophthalmological defects affect anterior chamber eyeball including axenfelds anomaly rieger anomaly retina pigment changes also anomalies beneficial diagnosing alagille syndrome many people algs similar facial features including broad prominent forehead deepset eyes small pointed chin distinct facial features often presented algs patients features presumably due alagille syndrome characteristic patients intrahepatic cholestatic liver facial characteristics extremely common algs patients many patients experience extreme liver complications liver failure caused disease kidneys may also affected mutations often lead renal dysplasia deformed proximal tubules lipidosis caused hindrance lipid algs caused loss function mutations either notch homolog majority people algs gene mutation occurs gene mutation either intragenic found chromosome deletion entire mutations much less likely cause alagille syndrome primary type algscausing mutation missense missense mutation point mutation changes one nucleotide results codon codes wrong amino acid alagille syndrome inherited autosomal dominant pattern means one copy altered gene sufficient cause disorder autosomal aspect disease means gene mutation occurs autosome one chromosomes human body sex chromosome chromosome x although majority cases due autosomal dominant gene reports rare autosomal recessive version autosomal recessive case algs patient must inherit two mutated genes one parent although mutations inherited affected parents cases result new acquired mutations caused environmental factors mutate one copy environmental factors result gene mutations may include radiation ultraviolet rays sun chemicals benzene found cigarette cases occur people familial history disordercitation needed encode proteins crucial notch cascade specifically encodes surfacebinding ligand regulates notch signaling pathway plays crucial role cell signaling embryonic development pathway disrupted due mutations infant develop alagille syndrome causes bile duct paucity characterized narrow malformed bile ducts bile duct paucity causes bile build liver resulting scarring liver hinders livers normal functions like blood filtration drug notch cascade also important recognition involves gene regulation mechanisms control multiple cell differentiation processes embryonic adult life specially important forcitation needed alagille syndrome extremely difficult diagnose people born algs almost always diagnosed later childhood diagnosis difficult severity disease varies widely among common clinical tests run order diagnose disease include vertebral xrays heart exams detect defects heart murmur liver biopsy detect liver disease precursors patient presents multiple symptoms jaundice heart murmur characteristic facial features discussed deep set eyes broad brow etc likely diagnosed alagille calculated specific diagnosis done genetic testing nextgeneration sequencing utilized detect single nucleotide polymorphisms snps affected genes multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification mlpa detect large deletions andor insertions microarray comparative genomic hybridization used improve accuracy early treatment possible disease diagnosed treatments alagille syndrome typically involve medications therapies andor surgical procedures treatments aim improve bile excretion liver reduce pain caused disease help improve nutritional diet also crucial factor improving quality life living algscitation needed several medications used improve bile flow including ursodiol actigall medications differ rates success certain drugs may used reduce itching pruritus cholestyramine rifampin medications reduce pruritus itching often reduced bile flow improved via ursodiol liver many patients alagille syndrome nutritional andor malabsorption issues often hinders normal growth patients benefit vitamin e k supplements reduced bile flow makes difficult absorb utilize vitamins highcalorie diet important often requires gastrostomy tube maintain high caloric intakecitation needed maralixibat livmarli approved medical use united states september surgery common severe cases alagille syndrome especially patients liver disease endstage liver failure liver transplants either complete liver transplant deceased organ donor partial transplant living liver transplants difficult algs patients heart defects common along liver failure intense surgeries dangerous cardiac patients handle stress surgery general anesthesiacitation needed partial biliary diversion used significantly reduce pruritus jaundice xanthoma caused poor bile flow patients bile duct paucity portion bile produced liver directed surgically created stoma plastic pouch patients lower right abdomen pouch periodically drained fills bile patients biliary atresia may require kasai procedure improve bile drainage however later liver transplantation still often necessarycitation needed article incorporates
