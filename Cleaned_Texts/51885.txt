occasionally associated inflammatory tissue reaction local treatment choice dermatologists safe inexpensive oral medication griseofulvin secondary metabolite fungus penicillium griseofulvin compound fungistatic inhibiting growth reproduction fungi works affecting microtubular system fungi interfering mitotic spindle cytoplasmic microtubules recommended pediatric dosage mgkgday weeks although may

effective allows drug penetrate hair shaft fungus lives effective therapy rate treatment generally high range oral antifungal treatments tinea capitis also frequently reported literature include terbinafine itraconazole fluconazole drugs advantage shorter treatment durations metaanalysis randomized controlled trials found terbinafine itraconazole fluconazole least equally effective griseofulvin children infected trichophyton terbinafine effective griseofulvin children tonsurans however concerns raised possibility rare side effects like liver toxicity interactions drugs furthermore newer drug treatments tend expensive september us food drug administration stated lamisil terbinafine hydrochloride novartis ag new treatment approved use children aged years older antifungal granules sprinkled childs food treat lamisil carries hepatotoxic risk cause metallic taste mouthcitation needed tinea capitis caused species microsporum trichophyton contagious disease endemic many countries affecting primarily prepubertal children years common males females rarely disease persist past age spread thought occur direct contact affected individuals large outbreaks known occur schools places children close quarters however indirect spread contamination infected objects fomites may also factor spread infection us tinea capitis thought occur pediatric population onethird households contact infected person may harbor disease without showing fungal species responsible causing tinea capitis vary according geographical region may also change time example
