somatic fusion also called protoplast fusion type genetic modification plants two distinct species plants fused together form new hybrid plant characteristics somatic hybrids produced either different varieties species eg nonflowering potato plants flowering potato plants two different species eg wheat triticum rye secale produce triticale uses somatic fusion include making potato plants resistant potato leaf roll somatic fusion crop potato plant solanum tuberosum yield severely reduced viral disease transmitted aphid vector fused wild nontuberbearing potato solanum brevidens resistant disease resulting hybrid chromosomes plants thus similar polyploid plants somatic hybridization first introduced carlson et al nicotiana somatic fusion process occurs four procedure seed plants describe fusion moss protoplasts initiated without electric shock use polyethylene glycol peg moss protoplasts need phytohormones regeneration form instead regenerating moss protoplasts behave like germinating moss note sodium nitrate calcium ion high ph used although results variable depending somatic cells different types fused obtain hybrid cells hybrid cells useful variety ways eg chromosome mapping somatic cell hybridization essentially based fusion human mouse somatic cells generally human fibrocytes leucocytes fused mouse continuous cell lines human mouse cells cells two mammalian species species mixed spontaneous cell fusion occurs low rate cell fusion enhanced times addition ultraviolet inactivated sendai parainfluenza virus polyethylene glycol peg agents adhere plasma membranes cells alter properties way facilitates fusion fusion two cells produces heterokaryon ie single hybrid cell two nuclei one cells entering fusion subsequently two nuclei also fuse yield hybrid cell single nucleus generalized scheme somatic cell hybridization may described follows appropriate human mouse cells selected mixed together presence inactivated sendai virus peg promote cell fusion period time cells mixture man mouse hybrid cells plated selective medium eg hat medium allows multiplication hybrid cells several clones derived single hybrid cell hybrid cells thus isolated subjected cytogenetic appropriate biochemical analyses detection enzyme proteintrait investigation attempt made correlate presence absence trait presence absence human chromosome hybrid clones perfect correlation presence absence human chromosome trait hybrid clones gene governing trait taken located concerned chromosome hat medium one several selective media used selection hybrid cells medium supplemented hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine hence name hat medium antimetabolite aminopterin blocks cellular biosynthesis purines pyrimidines simple sugars amino acids however normal human mouse cells still multiply utilize hypoxanthine thymidine present medium salvage pathway ordinarily recycles purines pyrimidines produced degradation nucleic acids hypoxanthine converted guanine enzyme hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase hgprt thymidine phosphorylated thymidine kinase tk hgprt tk enzymes salvage pathway hat medium cells active hgprt hgprt tk tk enzymes proliferate deficient enzymes hgprr andor tk divide since produce purines pyrimidines due aminopterin present hat medium using hat medium selective agent human cells used fusion must deficient either enzyme hgprt tk mouse cells must deficient enzyme pair thus one may fuse hgprt deficient human cells designated tk hgprr tk deficient mouse cells denoted tk hgprt fusion products hybrid cells tk due human gene hgprt due mouse gene multiply hat medium man mouse cells fail experiments selective media planned similar fashion note table lists examples many crosses possibilities technology great however species easily put protoplast culture table reference httpsenwikipediaorgwikisomaticfusion
