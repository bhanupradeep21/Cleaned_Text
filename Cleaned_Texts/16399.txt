conformity act matching attitudes beliefs behaviors group norms politics norms implicit specific rules guidance shared group individuals guide interactions others people often choose conform society rather pursue personal desires often easier follow path others made already rather forging new one thus conformity sometimes product group tendency conform occurs small groups andor society whole may

submitting group pressures individuals may find facing one several responses conformity types responses conformity vary degree public agreement versus private agreement individual finds position publicly agree groups decision yet privately disagrees groups consensus experiencing compliance acquiescence also referenced apparent conformity type conformity recognizes behavior always consistent beliefs attitudes mimics leon festingers cognitive dissonance theory turn conversion otherwise known private acceptance true conformity involves publicly privately agreeing groups decision case private acceptance person conforms group changing beliefs attitudes thus represents true change opinion match another type social response involve conformity majority group called convergence type social response group member agrees groups decision outset thus need shift opinion matter addition forsyth shows nonconformity also fall one two response categories firstly individual conform majority display independence independence dissent defined unwillingness bend group pressures thus individual stays true personal standards instead swaying toward group standards secondly nonconformist could displaying anticonformity counterconformity involves taking opinions opposite group believes type nonconformity motivated need rebel status quo instead need accurate ones opinion conclude social responses conformity seen vary along continuum conversion anticonformity example popular experiment conformity research known asch situation asch conformity experiments primarily includes compliance

people ie guards experiment transformed perpetrators evil healthy people ie prisoners experiment subject pathological reactions aspects also traceable situational forces experiment also demonstrated notion banality evil explains evil something special rare something exists ordinary peoplecitation needed harvard psychologist herbert kelman identified three major types although kelmans distinction influential research social psychology focused primarily two varieties conformity informational conformity informational social influence normative conformity also called normative social influence kelmans terminology correspond internalization compliance respectively naturally two three variables society influential human psychology conformity notion varieties conformity based upon social influence ambiguous indefinable context according deutsch gérard conformity results motivational conflict fear socially rejected wish say think correct leads normative influence cognitive conflict others create doubts think leads informational informational social influence occurs one turns members ones group obtain accept accurate information person likely use informational social influence certain situations situation ambiguous people become uncertain likely depend others answer crisis immediate action necessary spite panic looking people help ease fears unfortunately always right knowledgeable person valuable resource thus people often turn experts help people must careful experts make mistakes informational social influence often results internalization private acceptance person genuinely believes information normative social influence occurs one conforms liked accepted members group need social approval acceptance part state addition know people conform group therefore deviants less liked even punished normative influence usually results public compliance saying something without believing experiment asch one example normative influence even though john turner et al argued post experimental interviews showed respondents uncertain correct answers cases answers might evident experimenters participants experience subsequent studies pointed fact participants known therefore pose threat social rejection see normative influence vs referent informational influence reinterpretation original data experiments hodges geyer found aschs subjects conformist experiments provide powerful evidence peoples tendency tell truth even others also provide compelling evidence peoples concern others views closely examining situation aschs subjects find find situation places multiple demands participants include truth ie expressing ones view accurately trust ie taking seriously value others claims social solidarity ie commitment integrate views self others without deprecating addition epistemic values multiple moral claims well include need participants care integrity wellbeing participants experimenter worth scientific research deutsch gérard designed different situations variated asch experiment found participants writing answer privately giving correct normative influence function social impact theory three number people group surprising effect number increases person less impact groups strength important group person groups value generally social influence immediacy close group time space influence taking place psychologists constructed mathematical model using three factors able predict amount conformity occurs degree baron colleagues conducted second eyewitness study focused normative influence version task easier participant five seconds look slide instead one second high low motives accurate results reverse first study low motivation group conformed time similar aschs findings high motivation group conformed less results show accuracy important better get wrong answer risk social disapproval experiment using procedures similar aschs found significantly less conformity sixperson groups friends compared sixperson groups friends already know accept may less normative pressure conform situations field studies cigarette alcohol abuse however generally demonstrate evidence friends exerting normative social influence although conformity generally leads individuals think act like groups individuals occasionally able reverse tendency change people around known minority influence special case informational influence minority influence likely people make clear consistent case point view minority fluctuates shows uncertainty chance influence small however minority makes strong convincing case increases probability changing majoritys beliefs minority members perceived experts high status benefited group past also likely succeed another form minority influence sometimes override conformity effects lead unhealthy group dynamics review two dozen studies university washington found single bad apple inconsiderate negligent group member substantially increase conflicts reduce performance work groups bad apples often create negative emotional climate interferes healthy group functioning avoided careful selection procedures managed reassigning positions require less social stanley milgram found individuals norway collectivistic culture exhibited higher degree conformity individuals france individualistic similarly berry studied two different populations temne collectivists inuit individualists found temne conformed inuit exposed conformity bond smith compared studies metaanalysis found positive correlation countrys level collectivistic values conformity rates asch bond smith also reported conformity declined united states time influenced writings western travelers scholars diplomats visited japan basil hall chamberlain george trumbull ladd percival lowell well ruth benedicts influential book chrysanthemum sword many scholars japanese studies speculated would higher propensity conform japanese culture american culture however view formed basis empirical evidence collected systematic way rather basis anecdotes casual observations subject variety cognitive biases modern scientific studies comparing conformity japan united states show americans conform general much japanese situations even psychology professor yohtaro takano university tokyo along eiko osaka reviewed four behavioral studies found rate conformity errors japanese subjects manifested asch paradigm similar manifested study published robert frager university california santa cruz found percentage conformity errors within asch paradigm significantly lower japan united states especially prize condition another study published compared level conformity among japanese ingroups peers college clubs found among americans found substantial difference level conformity manifested two nations even case societal norms often establish gender differences researchers reported differences way men women conform social example alice eagly linda carli performed metaanalysis studies influenceability found women persuadable conforming men group pressure situations involve eagly proposed sex difference may due different sex roles women generally taught agreeable whereas men taught independent composition group plays role conformity well study reitan shaw found men women conformed participants sexes involved versus participants sex subjects groups sexes apprehensive discrepancy amongst group members thus subjects reported doubted sistrunk mcdavid made argument women conformed methodological argued stereotypes used studies generally male ones sports cars female ones cooking fashion women feeling uncertain conformed confirmed results research noted age differences conformity example research australian children adolescents ages discovered conformity decreases another study examined individuals ranged ages results revealed similar trend older participants displayed less conformity compared younger participants way gender viewed corresponding status age also argued status implications berger rosenholtz zelditch suggest age status role observed among college students younger students first year college treated lowerstatus individuals older college students treated higherstatus therefore given status roles would expected younger individuals low status conform majority whereas older individuals high status would expected conform researchers also reported interaction gender age eagly chrvala examined role age years vs years older gender surveillance anticipating responses shared group members vs anticipating responses shared conformity group opinions discovered among participants years older females conformed group opinions males surveillance ie anticipated responses would shared group members however gender differences conformity among participants years age surveillance conditions also gender differences participants surveillance subsequent research article eagly suggests women likely conform men lower status roles women society suggests submissive roles ie conforming expected individuals hold low status still eagly chrvalas results conflict previous research found higher conformity levels among younger rather older individuals although conformity pressures generally increase size majority increases aschs experiment stated increasing size group additional impact beyond majority size brown byrnes study described possible explanation people may suspect collusion majority exceeds three gerards study reported linear relationship group size conformity group size ranges two seven according latanes study number majority one factor influences degree conformity factors like strength moreover study suggests effects group size depend type social influence means situations group clearly wrong conformity motivated normative influence participants conform order accepted group participant may feel much pressure conform first person gives incorrect response however conformity pressure increase additional group member also gives incorrect research found different group situation factors affect conformity accountability increases conformity individual trying accepted group certain preferences individuals likely conform match similarly attractiveness group members increases conformity individual wishes liked group increasingly likely accuracy also effects conformity accurate reasonable majority decision likely individual mentioned earlier size also effects individuals likelihood larger majority likely individual conform majority similarly less ambiguous task decision likely someone conform tasks ambiguous people less pressured conform task difficulty also increases conformity research found conformity increases task difficult also research also found individuals become aware disagree majority feel pressure hence likely conform decisions likewise responses must made faceface individuals increasingly conform therefore conformity increases anonymity response group decreases conformity also increases individuals committed group making conformity also shown linked cohesiveness cohesiveness strongly members group linked together conformity found increase group cohesiveness similarly conformity also higher individuals committed wish stay group conformity also higher individuals situations involving existential thoughts cause anxiety situation individuals likely conform majoritys stanley milgram published study utilized aschs conformity paradigm using audio tones instead lines conducted study norway found substantially higher levels conformity asch participants conforming time france time norway critical trials milgram also conducted experiment told participants results study would applied design aircraft safety signals conformity estimates norway france suggesting individuals conformed slightly less task linked important issue stanley milgrams study demonstrated aschs study could replicated stimuli case tones high degree evidence found involvement posterior medial frontal cortex pmfc area associated memory decisionmaking example klucharev et revealed study using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation pmfc participants reduced tendency conform group suggesting causal role brain region social conformity neuroscience also shown people quickly develop similar values things opinions others immediately change brains reward response ventral striatum receiving losing object question proportion susceptible person social influence similar opinions others also generate reward amygdala hippocampus also found recruited individuals
