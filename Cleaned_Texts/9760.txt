cardiomyocyte proliferation refers ability cardiac muscle cells progress cell cycle continue divide traditionally cardiomyocytes believed little ability proliferate regenerate although types cells gastrointestinal epithelial cells proliferate differentiate throughout cardiac tissue contains little intrinsic ability proliferate adult human cells arrest cell however recent paradigm shift occurred recent research demonstrated human cardiomyocytes proliferate small extent first two decades also cardiomyocyte proliferation regeneration demonstrated occur various neonatal mammals response injury first week current research aims understand biological mechanism underlying cardiomyocyte proliferation hopes turn capability back adults order combat heart disease adult zebrafish remarkable ability completely regenerate cardiac muscle similar genes zebrafish humans control development phenomenal ability zebrafish cardiomyocytes proliferate response injury made popular research model approximately ventricle resected adult zebrafish cardiac muscle completely regenerates injury stimulates subset cardiomyocytes zebrafish heart able proliferate cardiomyocytes zebrafish mononucleated cardiomyocyte proliferation regeneration demonstrated occur zebrafish resection various animal models utilized order explore whether mammals also innate ability porrello et al demonstrated neonatal mice able regenerate heart muscle since many research groups explored cardiomyocyte regeneration cardiomyocytes neonatal also able undergo proliferation response injury first week life dr jonas fris√©ns research group used technique implementing carbondating cardiomyocytes propose human adult cardiomyocytes proliferate slow also case reports suggest cardiomyocytes newborns able proliferate response paper demonstrated small number cardiomyocytes mitosis cytokinesis humans age highest percentage present complete biological mechanism underlying cardiomyocyte proliferation fully elucidated however various transcription factors signaling cascades thought important cardiomyocytes shown encouraged exit cell cycle cyclindependent kinases downregulated cell cycle inhibitors many signals cell receives phase determine whether cell undergo proliferation cyclindependent kinases cyclindependent kinase inhibitors play key roles one gene jumonji jmj shown start increasing expression embryonic day mice proposed help cease proliferation cardiomyocytes repressing expression cyclin jumonji believed recruit glp methyltransferases cyclin promoter thought methylate histones repress cyclin transcription factor family also thought important regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation transcription factors influence cellular proliferation help control apoptosis cardiomyocytes transfected adenoviruses expressing cyclins e upregulated cardiomyocytes cessation cardiomyocyte cell cycle believed regulated transcription factors cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors although exact mechanism remains one transcription facet shown key process shown necessary activation cyclindependent kinase inhibitors knockout experiments demonstrated length cardiomyocyte proliferation extended deleted shown play role regulation anaerobic particularly interesting cardiomyocytes undergo shift metabolism development cardiomyocytes rely glycolytic metabolism switch relying oxidative one research group demonstrated neonatal transgenic mice deficient fatty acids longer time span cardiomyocytes able proliferate response furthermore oxygen metabolism thought play role cardiomyocyte proliferation using mouse model myocardial infarction induce cardiac tissue damage adult mice exhibited increase proliferation cardiomyocytes put hypoxic mice born switch hypoxic intrauterine environment environment rich oxygen one research group shown oxidative dna damage cells cellular response damage increases first week life correlates time point mammalian cardiomyocytes start lose ability intrauterine environment cardiomyocytes limited exposure oxygen little damage reactive oxygen species time cardiomyocytes proliferating utero neonatal mice exposed hypoxic environment ischemic heart damage cardiomyocytes encouraged enter mitosis another signaling pathway thought important ability cardiomyocytes proliferate hippo pathway previously shown regulate organ size fruit fly key proteins hippo pathway inactivated mouse model embryos exhibit cardiomyocyte proliferation cardiomegaly hippo thought interact wnt signaling pathway limit size heart encourage cessation cardiomyocyte heart disease continues one leading causes death united progression coronary artery disease lead weakened heart muscle heart failure atherosclerosis progresses point occluding coronary artery myocardial ischemia damage occur resulting irreversible cardiomyocyte understanding biological mechanism underlying cardiomyocyte proliferation demonstrated adult zebrafish neonatal mice rats piglets could provide insight may possible encourage cardiomyocyte proliferation heart regeneration patients ischemic heart disease patients heart httpsenwikipediaorgwikicardiomyocyteproliferation
