errors introduced particularly often process dna replication polymerization second strand errors also induced organism cellular processes hypermutation mutations affect phenotype organism especially occur within protein coding sequence gene error rates usually error every million proofreading ability dna without proofreading error rates thousandfold higher many viruses rely dna rna polymerases lack proofreading ability experience higher mutation rates processes increase rate changes dna called mutagenic mutagenic chemicals promote errors dna replication often interfering structure basepairing uv radiation induces mutations causing damage dna chemical damage dna occurs naturally well cells use dna repair mechanisms repair mismatches breaks repair sometimes fails return dna original sequence organisms use chromosomal crossover exchange dna recombine genes errors alignment meiosis also cause errors crossover especially likely similar sequences cause partner chromosomes adopt mistaken alignment making regions genomes prone mutating way errors create large structural changes dna inversions deletions entire regions accidental exchanging whole parts different chromosomes called translocation mutation result several different types change dna sequences either effect alter product gene prevent gene functioning studies fly drosophila melanogaster suggest mutation changes protein produced gene probably harmful percent mutations damaging effects remainder either neutral weakly due damaging effects mutations cells organisms evolved mechanisms dna repair remove therefore optimal mutation rate species tradeoff costs high mutation rate deleterious mutations metabolic costs maintaining systems reduce mutation rate dna repair viruses use rna genetic material rapid mutation advantage since viruses evolve constantly rapidly thus evade defensive responses eg human immune mutations involve large sections dna becoming duplicated usually genetic duplications major source raw material evolving new genes tens hundreds genes duplicated animal genomes every million genes belong larger families genes shared novel genes produced several methods commonly duplication mutation ancestral gene recombining parts different genes form new combinations new domains act modules particular independent function mixed together produce genes encoding new proteins novel example human eye uses four genes make structures sense light three color vision one night vision four arose single ancestral another advantage duplicating gene even entire genome increases redundancy allows one gene pair acquire new function copy performs original types mutation occasionally create new genes previously noncoding selection process heritable traits make likely organism survive successfully reproduce become common population successive generations sometimes valuable distinguish naturally occurring selection natural selection selection manifestation choices made humans artificial selection distinction rather diffuse natural selection nevertheless dominant part selection natural genetic variation within population organisms means individuals survive successfully others current environment factors affect reproductive success also important issue charles darwin developed ideas sexual selection natural selection acts phenotype observable

selection remains primary explanation adaptive evolution genetic drift change relative frequency gene variant allele occurs population due random sampling alleles offspring population random sample parents chance role determining whether given individual survives reproduces populations allele frequency fraction percentage gene copies compared total number gene alleles share particular genetic drift evolutionary process leads changes allele frequencies time may cause gene variants disappear completely thereby reduce genetic variability contrast natural selection makes gene variants common less common depending reproductive changes due genetic drift driven environmental adaptive pressures may beneficial neutral detrimental reproductive success effect genetic drift larger small populations smaller large populations vigorous debates wage among scientists relative importance genetic drift compared natural selection ronald fisher held view genetic drift plays minor role evolution remained dominant view several decades motoo kimura rekindled debate neutral theory molecular evolution claims changes genetic material caused genetic predictions neutral theory based genetic drift fit recent data whole genomes well data suggest frequencies neutral alleles change primarily due selection linked sites rather due genetic drift means sampling gene flow exchange genes populations usually examples gene flow within species include migration breeding organisms exchange pollen gene transfer species includes formation hybrid organisms horizontal gene transfer migration population change allele frequencies well introducing genetic variation population immigration may add new genetic material established gene pool population conversely emigration may remove genetic material barriers reproduction two diverging populations required populations become new species gene flow may slow process spreading genetic differences populations gene flow hindered mountain ranges oceans deserts even manmade structures great wall china hindered flow plant depending far two species diverged since recent common ancestor may still possible produce offspring horses donkeys mating produce hybrids generally infertile due two different sets chromosomes unable pair meiosis case closely related species may regularly interbreed hybrids selected species remain distinct however viable hybrids occasionally formed new species either properties intermediate parent species possess totally new importance hybridization developing new species animals unclear although cases seen many types gray tree frog particularly wellstudied hybridization however important means speciation plants since polyploidy two copies chromosome tolerated plants readily polyploidy important hybrids allows reproduction two different sets chromosomes able pair identical partner polyploid hybrids also genetic diversity allows avoid inbreeding depression small horizontal gene transfer transfer genetic material one organism another organism offspring common among medicine contributes spread antibiotic resistance one bacteria acquires resistance genes rapidly transfer horizontal transfer genes bacteria eukaryotes yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae adzuki bean beetle callosobruchus chinensis may also example largerscale transfers eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers appear received range genes bacteria fungi viruses also carry dna organisms allowing transfer genes even across biological largescale gene transfer also occurred ancestors eukaryotic cells prokaryotes acquisition chloroplasts gene flow transfer alleles one population another migration population may responsible marked change allele frequencies immigration may also result addition new genetic variants established gene pool particular species population number factors affect rate gene flow different populations one significant factors mobility greater mobility individual tends give greater migratory potential animals tend mobile plants although pollen seeds may carried great distances animals wind maintained gene flow two populations also lead combination two gene pools reducing genetic variation two groups reason gene flow strongly acts speciation recombining gene pools groups thus repairing developing differences genetic variation would led full speciation creation daughter species example species grass grows sides
