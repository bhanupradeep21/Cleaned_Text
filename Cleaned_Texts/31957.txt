global aphasia severe form nonfluent aphasia caused damage left side brain receptive expressive language skills needed written oral language well auditory visual acquired impairments communicative abilities present across language modalities impacting language production comprehension patients global aphasia may able verbalize short utterances use nonword overall production ability ability repeat words utterances phrases also due preservation right hemisphere individual global aphasia may still able express facial expressions gestures type aphasia often results large lesion left perisylvian cortex lesion caused occlusion left middle cerebral associated damage brocas area wernickes area insular regions associated aspects common onset global aphasia occur thrombotic stroke trunk middle cerebral artery varying general signs symptoms include inability understand create repeat speech difficulties also persist reading writing auditory comprehension verbal language typically consists recognizable utterances words eg hello overlearned phrases eg expletives eg curse however affected global aphasia may express using facial expressions intonation extensive lexical vocabulary impairment possible resulting inability read simple words global aphasia may accompanied weakness right side face right hemiplegia occur without hemiparesis additionally common individual global aphasia one following additional impairments apraxia speech alexia pure word deafness agraphia facial apraxia persons global aphasia socially appropriate usually attentive able respond yesno questions

may manifest persons global aphasia may recognize location names common objects names singlewords rejecting pseudowords real incorrect global aphasia typically results occlusion trunk middle cerebral artery affects large portion perisylvian region left global aphasia usually result thrombotic stroke occurs blood clot forms brains blood addition stroke global aphasia also caused traumatic brain injury tbi tumors progressive neurological large areas anterior brocas posterior wernickes area brain either destroyed impaired separate branches mca supplied arterial lesions usually result extensive damage language areas left hemisphere however global aphasia result damage smaller subcortical well known lesion cortex cause aphasia however study kumar et al suggests lesions subcortical regions cortex thalamus basal ganglia internal capsule paraventricular white matter also cause speech language deficits due fact subcortical regions closely associated language centers brain kumar et al state lesions subcortical regions could cause certain types aphasia lesion regions would rarely cause global study performed ferro found five different brain lesion locations linked locations include frontotemporoparietal lesions anterior suprasylvian frontal lesions large subcortical infarcts posterior suprasylvian parietal infarcts double lesion composed frontal temporal suspected brain injury occurred patient undergoes series medical imaging could include mrimagnetic resonance imaging ct computed tomography diagnosis brain injury speech language pathologist perform variety tests determine classification additionally boston assessment severe aphasia basa commonly used assessment diagnosing basa used determine treatment plans strokes lead symptoms aphasia tests gestural verbal cognitive functions assessed using cognitive test battery global aphasia cobaga appropriate measure assess person severe aphasia require verbal responses rather manipulative answers cobaga assesses cognitive

using global aphasic neuropsychological battery test assesses attentionconcentration memory intelligence visual auditory nonverbal recognition results study helped researchers determine varying levels severity among individuals global speech language therapy typically primary treatment individuals aphasia goal speech language therapy increase person communication abilities level functional daily life goals chosen based collaboration speech language pathologists patients goals individualized based person aphasia symptoms communicative needs wallace et al found following outcomes commonly prioritized therapy communication life participation physical emotional wellbeing normalcy health support however available research inconclusive specific approach speech language therapy effective treating global aphasia therapy either group individual group therapies integrate use visual aids allow enhanced social communicationskill group therapy sessions typically revolve around simple preplanned activities games aim facilitate social one particular therapy designed specifically treatment aphasia visual action therapy vat nonverbal gestural output program phases total program teaches unilateral gestures symbolic representations real life objects research effectiveness vat limited one important therapy technique includes teaching family members caregivers strategies effectively communicating loved ones research offers strategies including simplifying sentences using common words gaining persons attention speaking using pointing visual cues allowing adequate response time creating quiet environment free research supporting efficacy pharmacological treatments aphasia limited date large scale clinical trials proven benefits pharmacological evaluating prognosis patient main contributing participant factors influence extent neuroplasticity brains ability change age lesion location preexisting cognitive status motivation overall health interaction amongst brain damage initial signs global aphasia may appear within first two days due brain swelling cerebral edema time natural recovery impairment presentation may progress expressive aphasia commonly receptive due size location lesion associated global aphasia prognosis language abilities research shown prognosis longterm language abilities determined initial severity level aphasia within first four weeks result poor prognosis persons retain diagnosis aphasia one month due limited initial language nonetheless first year poststroke patients global aphasia showed improvement western aphasia battery wab scores baseline compared individuals broca wernicke anomic conduction types aphasia broca aphasia showed best rate extent improvement followed global aphasia rate improvement language function highest first four weeks although prognosis persons diagnosed global aphasia poor improvement varying aspects language possible example ferro performed research studied recovery individuals acute global aphasia resulting five different lesion first lesion site frontotempoparietal region brain patients lesions location saw least amount gains participants study often never recovered global however second lesion site anterior suprasylvian frontal part brain third lesion site subcortical infarcts fourth lesion site posterior suprasylvian parietal participants lesions two three four often recovered less severe form aphasia brocas fifth lesion site double lesion frontal temporal infarcts patients lesions site showed slight however studies show spontaneous improvement happens occurs within six months complete recovery studies shown persons global aphasia improved verbal nonverbal speech language skills speech language one study examined recovery group individuals classified global aphasia months poststroke individuals received intensive speech language intervention results study illustrated patients showed improvement greatest area improvement auditory comprehension least use propositional speech months poststroke individuals showed increased use gestures communicate communication skills remained severely therapy progress seen within first years possible language abilities continuously improve steady rate due longterm intensive language improvement language abilities possible intervention percent persons diagnosed global aphasia achieve
