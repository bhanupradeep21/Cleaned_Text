xenohormones environmental hormones produced outside human body exhibit endocrine hormonelike properties may either natural origin phytoestrogens derived plants synthetic origin compounds able activate endocrine receptors natural counterparts thus frequently implicated endocrine commonly occurring xenohormones xenoestrogens mimic effects estrogen xenohormones include xenoandrogens anabolicandrogenic steroids xenohormones used variety purposes including contraceptive hormonal therapies agriculture however exposure certain xenohormones early childhood development lead host
