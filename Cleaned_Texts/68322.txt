selfanointing animals sometimes called anointing anting behaviour whereby nonhuman animal smears odoriferous substances substances often secretions parts entire bodies animals plants animal may chew substances spread resulting saliva mixture body may apply source odour directly appendage tool rubbing body functions selfanointing differ species may act repel parasites provide camouflage aid communication make animal poisonous several primate species selfanoint various items millipedes leaves fruit sometimes drool capuchin monkeys squirrel monkeys perform urine washing deposit small quantity urine onto palm hand rub sole opposite foot thought multiple functions including hygiene thermoregulation response irritation biting ectoparasites ticks strepsirrhines new world monkeys also selfanoint body urine wild wedgecapped capuchin monkeys cebus olivaceus selfanoint millipedes orthoporus dorsovittatus chemical analysis revealed millipedes secrete two benzoquinones compounds known potently repellent secretions thought provide protection insects particularly mosquitoes bot flies transmit rainy season millipede secretion avidly sought monkeys four share single millipede anointment must also involve risks since benzoquinones toxic carcinogenic however likely capuchins immediate benefits selfanointment outweigh longterm secretions millipedes also elicit selfanointing captive male female tufted capuchin c apella whitefaced capuchin c capucinus wild cebus anoint plant parts including fruits whereas wild sapajus anoint ants arthropods whitefaced capuchins particular use plant species site anointing compared capuchins may specialize anointing activity independent foraging whereas capuchin species tend eat substances use anointing wild cebus anoint higher frequency

behaviour lasted approximately minutes european starlings also performed similar behaviour anting birds rub insects feathers usually ants secrete liquids containing chemicals formic acid act insecticide miticide fungicide bactericide make insects edible removing distasteful acid possibly also supplements birds preen oil although suggested anting acts way reducing feather parasites mites controlling fungi bacteria little convincing support cases anting involved use millipedes puss moth caterpillars known release powerful defensive another suggested function based observation blue jays bird makes insects edible discharging harmful acid onto feathers birds found show anting behaviour ants full acid sac subjects whose acid sacs experimentally removed behaviour finally also suggested anting related feather moulting metabolic products ants may soothe skin irritated unusually rapid feather however correlation may also attributed greater activity ants birds like antbirds flickers wear ants also consume ants important part diet opportunist anteating birds include sparrows wrens grouse owl monkeys aotus spp anoint groups two rubbing bodies one another selfanointing social
