interactions among underrepresented dominant group members cocultural communication argues three preferred outcomes cocultural communication process assimilation eg becoming integrated mainstream culture accommodation gaining acceptance space society achieving cultural pluralism without hierarchy separation maintaining culturally distinct identity intercultural also notes three communication approaches nonassertive individuals constrained nonconfrontational putting needs others first avoid conflicts assertive individuals express feelings ideas rights ways consider needs others aggressive individuals express feelings ideas rights ways ignore needs different combinations three preferred outcomes three communication approaches result nine communication although various groups considered muted within society silenced dominant groups also exist within group example anita taylor j hardman posit feminist movements also present dominant subgroups mute groups within movement thus members within oppressed groups diverse opinions one become dominant mute researchers would consider men dominant group mgt however scholars like radhika chopra asserted men also part muted group considering nurturing fathers chopra pointed discourse mothering devalued fathers presence absence contrast handson vital involvement according chopras opinion early american colonial period fathers quite involved nurturance kids therefore sex gender distinction taken consideration talk mgt sex like biological category people put male female whereas gender like social category based peoples behaviors identity masculinity edwin ardener saw mgt pragmatic well analytical edwin ardener always maintained mgt even primarily women although women comprised conspicuous case point fact also drew personal experience sensitive boy among hearty boys allboys london secondary school result early encounters boys identified groups society selfexpression another prominent criticism mgt assumes men women essentially groups difference men women among men women therefore groups misunderstood addition deborah tannen theorist created genderlect theory criticizes feminist scholars like kramarae assuming men trying control women tannen acknowledges differences male female communication styles sometimes lead imbalances power unlike kramarae willing assume problems caused primarily men womens different styles tannen warns readers bad feelings imputation bad motives bad character come intention dominate wield kramerae thinks tannens opinion naïve believes men belittle ignore women whenever speak muted also pointed political educational religious legal media systems support gender race class theorists believe muting involved see different standpoints whats carol gilligan presented another reasoning concerning women men perceive reality differently posited instead men presumably dominant sources languages voices women men different means formulating sense self according gilligan womens moral domain carebased means women perceive reality based relations others whereas men forge identity separation focusing selfassessment individual achievement two approaches eventually lead women men
