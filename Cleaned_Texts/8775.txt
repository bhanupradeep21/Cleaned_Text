traumatic cardiac arrest tca condition heart ceased beat due blunt penetrating trauma stab wound thoracic medical emergency always result death without prompt advanced medical care even prompt medical intervention survival without neurological complications recent years protocols proposed improve survival rate patients traumatic cardiac arrest though variable causes condition well many coexisting injuries make protocols difficult traumatic cardiac arrest complex form cardiac arrest often derailing advanced cardiac life support sense emergency team must first establish cause traumatic arrest reverse effects example hypovolemia haemorrhagic shock due penetrating injurycitation needed traumatic cardiac arrest occur patients following severe blunt penetrating injury chest following traumatic event heart ceases pump blood body unlike medical cardiac arrest several potentially reversible causes may result cardiac arrest setting trauma clinicians rapidly assess causes interventions directed specific blunt penetrating trauma massive internal external bleeding may decrease volume blood available pumped heart body considered preload dependent tension pneumothorax caused air able enter space lung chest wall able escape increasing pressure within chest cavity prevents blood returning body fill heart hemothorax occurs injury chest results bleeding thoracic cavity similar tension pneumothorax increasing pressure prevents return blood circulation heart setting trauma cardiac tamponade results acute pericardial effusion accumulation blood within sac surrounds heart sac filled fluid pressure heart increased chambers heart unable fill blood inability maintain oxygenation trauma patients may result airway compromise due mechanical injury obstruction due loss respiratory drive cervical spine peripheral nerve conditions result hypoxia may lead cardiac arrest patients present following traumatic event often pulseless electrical activity pea patients exhibit low blood pressure pulses palpated patients progress asystole underlying condition reversed nonspecific signs symptoms associated impending traumatic cardiac arrest may include sweating altered mental status rapid slow breathing signs trauma bruising laceration fractures diagnosis traumatic cardiac arrest initially made electrocardiogram ems emergency department clinicians also order diagnostic testing may include chest xray bedside ultrasound echocardiogram blood gas levels type cross ordered match patient receive blood transfusion necessary workup involved diagnosis trauma patient may include efast rush exam cbc pelvic xray ct head neck chest abdomen pelvis treatment traumatic cardiac arrest guided advanced trauma life support guidelines standard advanced cardiac life support guidelines inappropriate use traumatic cardiac arrest directed primarily treating pathology originating within heart clinicians begin intervene simultaneously seek reversible causes arrest management begins establishing multiple points iv access evaluating patients airway breathing interventions may include thoracostomy thoracotomy well treatment underlying cause arrest basic life support commonly initiated bystanders first responders role basic life support traumatic cardiac arrest unclear basic life support targeted maintain oxygenation circulation throughout body lifesaving cases medical cardiac arrest address frequent large volume blood loss encounters many cases traumatic cardiac chest compressions considered important initial intervention cases medical cardiac arrest however studies evaluating efficacy excluded patients traumatic cardiac arrest chest compressions work replace cardiac function pumping blood throughout body however cases heart either unable fill blood total blood volume depleted intervention may ineffective additionally many interventions targeted specific causes arrest centered around procedures performed around patients chest head neck compressions may interfere definitive current guidelines tailored treatment specific causes traumatic cardiac arrest improved outcomes patients however guidelines may difficult apply standardized manner due differences prehospital care wide variety causes traumatic cardiac arrest compared medical cardiac evolving algorithms directed quickly identifying incidences cardiac arrest traumatic source rapidly intervening address reversible historically traumatic cardiac arrest thought lead invariably death recently evolutions advanced trauma life support guidelines improved understanding underlying causes traumatic cardiac arrest improved outcomes recent studies suggest survival rate traumatic cardiac arrest similar allcause cardiac wide variability estimated survival rate based factors include initiation prehospital care
