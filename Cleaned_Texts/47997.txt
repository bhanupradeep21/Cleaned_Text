styracocephalus platyrhynchus greek spikedhead extinct genus dinocephalian therapsid existed midpermian throughout south africa mainly karoo basin often referred single known species styracocephalus platyrhynchus dinocephalia clade consisted largest land vertebrates herbivores early midpermian period often also referred guadalupian epoch approximately million years although multiple styracocephalus skulls recovered yet specimen found entire therapsid skeleton majority skulls collected also mature skulls juvenile tapinocephalid skulls identified small nonfused presence enlarged canines pachyostotic cranial boss horns plesiomorphic traits found head ornament meant could recognised distance one striking feature styracocephalus large backwardprotruding tabular around metres ft first styracocephalus fossil discovered lieuwe dirk boonstra tapinocephalus bed farm called boesmans rivier beaufort west original skeleton crushed still showed unique features outward projecting tabular horns shallow snout small temporal opening skull maximum length around mm width upon initial discovery boonstra compared newfound specimen burnetia stating palate like gorgonopsian therapsid boonstra evaluated place therapsid found contain characteristics resembling therocephalia gorgonopsia well first classification styracocephalus h haughton placed new subclade therapsida due unique blend original holotype found called sam although sam holotype used identify many characteristics skull recent specimens sam k specimen helped determine posterior skull sam k specimen twice size original holotype showing variety seen morphological size styracocephalus narrow long snout thickened postorbital bones median nasal boss convex connected extremely pachyostosed interorbital section cranial pachyostosis split four regions medial nasal boss think interorbital skull roof paired posterior postorbital horns squamosal boss flares frontal bone skull roof part dorsal rim orbit instead extends anteriorly parietal nasal skull roof postfrontal large makes contact frontal postorbital tabular found dorsal lateral occiput styracocephalus roughly rectangular known variable size postorbital includes significant amount boss orbital well dorsal surface horn junction postfrontal parietal squamosal two parietals form pair midline triangular shape also containing small pineal occiput rectangularly shaped thickened squamosal crests crests extend ventrally single temporal fenestrae also small temporal opening postorbital extending rather significant characteristic skull would tabular horns extend laterally backward horn one distinguishable traits styracocephalus name spikehead refers curved horns stapes skull short distal end slightly basicranial elements known specimens strycacocephalus poorly preserved however portions stapes uniquely distinguishable appear small dumbbellshaped bones contact fenestra quadrate skull viewed posteriorly takes squarelike styracocephalus large nonserrated canines typical tapinocephalids except tapinocaninus also heeled incisors pronounced canines upper lower jaw however styracocephalus specifically bulbous postcanines whereas tapinocephalids often leafshaped typically around eight ten postcanines also lingual heels incisors containing crushing heels like seen tapinocephalidae titanosuchidae dinocephalia presence lingual heels indicates specimen representative dinocephalia later midpermian also crowns relatively blunt indicative grinding plant lower jaw styracocephalus large dentary occupies almost threefourths jaw viewed laterally anterior margin jaw slopes posteroventral forming slight chin anterior side lower jaw angular makes broad surface posterior dentary forms junction prearticular splenial flat medial side jaw resembles shape spindle coronoid elongated lower jaw immediately behind canines also makes contact palate styracocephalus often wellpreserved many specimens two paired pterygoids make flat triangular surface contacts concave dentary interpterygoidal vacuity small midline behind transverse small palatal teeth well paired vomers midline serrations although found styracocephalus found titanophoneus theriodontia palate also exhibit suborbital tapinocephalidae one first earliest groups herbivores seen talon heellike dentition enamel heel dentition many tapinocephalid specimens signs reduced deposition indicating grinding action consuming plant due smaller body size styracocephalus likely consumed smaller vegetative plants based dinocephalian dentition presence large heavy cranium poorly attached fragile mandible makes difficult species consume tough vegetation dry one proposed purpose horns dinocephalians adapt less individualized behavioral pattern cranial ornaments especially horns often used headbutting species demonstrates social grouplike majority dinocephalian fossils styracocephalus found tapinocephalus assemblage zone south african many advanced tapinocephalid fossils exhibit characteristics seen later midpermian dinocephalia often found assemblage however recent recoveries midpermian dinocephalia south america suggesting dispersed various locations across pangea also supports therapsida found global scale early guadalupian including eastern europe south according research conducted karoo basin south africa styracocephalus likely preferred warmer climate conditions fluctuating precipitation basin formed pangea time survived breaking continent likely contributes thorough global presence many tapinocephalid fossils also discovered farms holotype found boesmans rivier farm recent dinocephalian fossils also found farms like klein wolwefontein consistent assumptions made boonstra characteristics dinocephalia inferred styracocephalus spent fair amount time shallow ponds marshlands ratio cranial elements limbs group dinocephalia meant decreased likelihood long land travel much higher probability dwelling marsh areas eating nearby marsh styracocephalus placement long questioned past due debates regarding familial classifications dinocephalia previously thought styracocephalus made dinocephalian family anterosauridae titanosuchidae tapinocephalidae two reduced modern dinocephalian family subclade classifications anteosauria tapinocephalia styracocephalidae
