concerned understanding purchase decisions made products services consumed experienced consumers active decisionmakers decide purchase often based disposable income budget may change preferences related budget range purchase decisions involve long detailed processes include extensive information search select competing purchase decisions consumer practice consumers must make highly complex decisions often based lack time knowledge negotiating impulse buys habitual purchases made almost instantaneously little investment time effort information search purchase decisions made groups families households businesses others made individuals purchase decision made small group household different members group may become involved different stages decision process may perform different roles example one person may suggest purchase category another may search productrelated information yet another may physically go store buy product transport home customary think types decision roles

overall purchase decision parents may act joint deciders performing gatekeeping role vetoing unacceptable alternatives encouraging acceptable alternatives importance children influencers wide range purchase contexts never underestimated phenomenon known pester approach mental processes used purchasing decisions authors employ concept black box represents cognitive affective processes used consumer purchase decision decision model situates black box broader environment shows interaction external internal stimuli eg consumer characteristics situational factors marketing influences

decision model assumes purchase decisions occur vacuum rather occur real time affected stimuli including external environmental stimuli consumers momentary situation elements model include interpersonal stimuli people intrapersonal stimuli within people environmental stimuli marketing marketing stimuli include actions planned carried companies whereas environmental stimuli include

responses first stage purchase decision process begins problem recognition also known category need need arousal consumer identifies need typically defined difference consumers current state desired ideal state simpler way thinking problem recognition consumer decides market product service satisfy need want strength underlying need drives entire decision theorists identify three broad classes problemsolving situation relevant purchase consumers become aware problem variety ways information search evaluation stages consumer works processes designed arrive number brands products represent

analytical study users patterns consumption behaviours habits implication marketers relevant brand information disseminated widely possible included forum consumers likely search product brand information whether traditional media digital media channels thus marketers require rich understanding typical consumers touchpoints consumer evaluation viewed distinct stage alternatively evaluation may occur continuously throughout entire decision process consumers evaluate alternatives terms functional also called utilitarian psychosocial also called valueexpressive symbolic benefits brand image brand personality important psychosocial attribute consumers positive negative beliefs given considerable body research suggests consumers predisposed towards brands personality matches good

including consumers prior experience effects selective perception distortion retention consumers less knowledgeble category tend evaluate brand based functional characteristics however consumers become knowledgeable functional attributes diminish consumers process abstract information brand notably selfrelated marketing organisation needs deep understanding benefits valued consumers therefore attributes important terms consumers purchase decision also needs monitor brands customers consideration set optimise planning brand evaluation alternatives consumer ranks assesses relative merits different options available universal evaluation process used consumers across allbuying instead consumers generate different evaluation criteria depending unique buying situation social media enables consumers share views peers product looking way consumers gauge positive negative sides alternative decide even conveniently best product buy thus relevant evaluation attributes vary according across different types consumers purchase contexts example attributes important evaluating restaurant would include food quality price location atmosphere quality service menu selection consumers depending geographic demographic psychographic behavioural characteristics decide attributes important potential patrons seeking pleasant dining experience may willing travel distances patronise finedining venue compared wanting quick meal utilitarian eatery evaluating different product attributes consumer ranks attribute benefit highly important least important priorities directly related consumers needs thus consumer arrives weighted score product brand represents consumers subjective assessment individual attribute scores weighted terms importance using scores arrive total mental score rank productbrand alternatives evaluated consumer firms resolve proceed actual purchase example consumer might say themself yes buy brand x one day self instruction make purchase known purchase intent purchase intentions strong yet imperfect predictor sales sometimes purchase intentions simply translate actual purchase signal marketing instance consumer may wish buy new product may unaware retail outlets stock purchase proceed extent purchase intentions result actual sales known sales conversion organisations use variety techniques improve conversion rates provision easy credit payment terms may encourage purchase sales promotions opportunity receive premium enter competition may provide incentive buy rather defer purchases later date advertising messages strong calltoaction yet another device used convert calltoaction device designed encourage immediate typically calltoaction includes specific wording advertisement selling pitch employs imperative verbs buy dont wait types callstoaction might provide consumers strong reasons purchasing immediately offer available limited time eg offer must expire soon limited stocks available special deal usually accompanied time constraint eg order midnight receive free gift order two price one first callers additionally service convenience saving effort way minimises activities customers may bear buy goods key powerful calltoaction provide consumers compelling reasons purchase promptly rather defer purchase decisions consumers approach actual purchase decision likely rely personal sources reason personal sales representatives must well versed giving sales pitches tactics used close sale methods used might include social evidence salesperson refers previous success satisfaction customers buying product scarcity attraction another technique salesperson mentions offer limited forces consumer make quicker decision therefore spend less time evaluating following purchase experiencing product service consumer enters final stage namely postpurchase evaluation foxall suggested postpurchase evaluation provide key feedback marketers influences future purchase patterns consumption post purchase stage consumer examines compares product features price functionality quality post purchase evaluation viewed steps taken consumers correlate expectations perceived value thus influence next purchase decision good example consumer buys new phone postpurchase evaluation positive encouraged purchase brand company future also known postpurchase contrary consumer dissatisfied new phone may take actions resolve dissatisfaction consumer actions instance could involve requesting refund making complaint deciding purchase brand company future even spreading negative product reviews friends acquaintances possibly via social media acquisition consumption disposition consumers may feel uncertainty regards decision made generating cases regret postdecision also known cognitive dissonance feeling anxiety occurs post purchase stage well uneasy feelings concerns whether correct decision made consumers instance may regret purchase one brands considering type anxiety affect consumers subsequent behaviour may implications repeat patronage customer loyalty consumers use number strategies reduce post purchase dissonance typical strategy look peers significant others validation purchase choice customers always led opinions friends family nowadays corroborated social media likes reviews testimonials marketing communications also used remind consumers made wise choice purchasing brand consumers make unfavorable comparisons chosen option options forgone may feel postdecision regret buyers remorse consumers also feel shortterm regret avoid making purchase decision
