bartter syndrome bs rare inherited disease characterised defect thick ascending limb loop henle results low potassium levels increased blood ph alkalosis normal low blood pressure two types bartter syndrome neonatal classic closely associated disorder gitelman syndrome milder subtypes bartter syndromecitation needed cases neonatal bartter syndrome seen weeks gestation excess amniotic fluid polyhydramnios birth infant seen urinate drink excessively polyuria polydipsia respectively lifethreatening dehydration may result infant receive adequate fluids infants dispose excess amounts calcium urine hypercalciuria kidneys nephrocalcinosis may lead kidney stones rare occasions infant may progress kidney patients classic bartter syndrome may symptoms first two years life usually diagnosed school age later like infants neonatal subtype patients classic bartter syndrome also polyuria polydipsia tendency dehydration normal slightly increased urinary calcium excretion without tendency develop kidney stones patients also vomiting growth retardation kidney function also normal disease occasionally patients proceed endstage kidney failure bartter syndrome consists low levels potassium blood alkalosis normal low blood pressures elevated plasma renin aldosterone numerous causes syndrome probably exist diagnostic pointers include high urinary potassium chloride despite low serum values increased plasma renin hyperplasia juxtaglomerular apparatus kidney biopsy careful exclusion diuretic abuse excess production prostaglandins kidneys often found magnesium wasting may also occur homozygous patients experience severe hypercalciuria bartter syndrome caused mutations genes encoding proteins transport ions across renal cells thick ascending limb nephron also called ascending loop specifically mutations directly indirectly involving cotransporter key cotransporter involved electroneutral transport one sodium one potassium two chloride ions across apical membrane tubule basolateral calciumsensing receptor ability downregulate activity transporter upon activation transported tubule cells sodium ions actively transported across basolateral membrane nakatpases chloride ions pass facilitated diffusion basolateral chloride channels potassium however able diffuse back tubule lumen apical potassium channels returning net positive charge lumen establishing positive voltage lumen interstitial space charge gradient obligatory paracellular reabsorption calcium magnesium ionscitation needed proper function transporters necessary normal ion reabsorption along thick ascending limb loss component result functional inactivation system whole lead presentation bartter syndrome loss function reabsorption system results decreased sodium potassium chloride reabsorption thick ascending limb well abolishment lumenpositive voltage resulting decreased calcium magnesium reabsorption loss reabsorption sodium also undesired effect abolishing hypertonicity renal medulla severely impairing ability reabsorb water later distal nephron collecting duct system leading significant diuresis potential volume depletion finally increased sodium load distal nephron elicits compensatory reabsorption mechanisms albeit expense potassium excretion principal cells resulting hypokalemia increased potassium excretion partially compensated Î±intercalated cells expense hydrogen ions leading metabolic alkalosiscitation needed bartter gitelman syndromes divided different subtypes based genes people bartter syndrome present symptoms identical patients loop diuretics like furosemide given loop diuretics target exact transport protein defective syndrome least type bartter syndrome subtypes syndrome involve mutations transporters result functional loss target transporter patients often admit personal preference salty clinical findings characteristic bartter syndrome hypokalemia metabolic alkalosis normal low blood pressure findings may also caused conditions may cause confusion diagnosing bartters syndrome following conditions must ruled possible causes symptomatologycitation needed patients bartter syndrome may also elevated renin aldosterone prenatal bartter syndrome associated however bartter syndrome also characterized high renin high aldosterone hypercalciuria abnormal transporter thick ascending limb loop henle whereas gitelman syndrome causes hypocalciuria due abnormal thiazidesensitive transporter distal pseudobartters syndrome syndrome similar presentation bartter syndrome without characteristic genetic defects pseudobartters syndrome seen cystic well excessive use medically supervised sodium chloride potassium supplementation necessary spironolactone also used reduce potassium free unqualified access water necessary prevent dehydration patients maintain appropriate thirst response severe cases supplementation alone maintain biochemical homeostasis nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids used reduce glomerular filtration useful although may cause gastric irritation administered alongside stomach acid suppression therapies angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors also used reduce glomerular filtration rate young babies children low threshold check serum electrolytes periods illness compromising fluid intake surveillance renal ultrasound employed monitor development nephrocalcinosis common complication augments urinary concentrating limited prognostic information available suggests early diagnosis appropriate treatment infants young children classic bartter syndrome may improve growth perhaps intellectual development hand sustained hypokalemia hyperreninemia cause progressive tubulointerstitial nephritis resulting endstage kidney disease kidney failure early treatment electrolyte
