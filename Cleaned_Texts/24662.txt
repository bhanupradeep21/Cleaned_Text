keystroke logging often referred keylogging keyboard capturing action recording logging keys struck typically covertly person using keyboard unaware actions monitored data retrieved person operating logging program keystroke recorder keylogger either software hardware programs many designed allow employers oversee use computers keyloggers often used stealing passwords confidential keylogging also used study keystroke humancomputer interaction numerous keylogging methods exist ranging hardware softwarebased approaches acoustic cryptanalysis soviet union developed deployed hardware keylogger

computers business networks families businesspeople use keyloggers legally monitor network usage without users direct knowledge microsoft publicly stated windows builtin keylogger final version

softwarebased keyloggers run affected users computer reading keyboard inputs directly user types technical perspective several categories since keystroke logging established research method study writing different programs developed collect online process data writing including inputlog scriptlog translog ggxlog keystroke logging used legitimately suitable research instrument several writing contexts include studies cognitive writing processes include keystroke logging used research writing specifically also integrated educational domains second language learning programming skills typing

keyloggers network monitors also known reversefirewalls used alert user whenever application attempts make network connection gives user chance prevent keylogger phoning home typed information automatic formfilling programs may prevent keylogging removing requirement user type personal details passwords using keyboard form fillers primarily designed web browsers fill checkout pages log users accounts users account credit card information entered program automatically entered forms without ever using keyboard clipboard thereby reducing possibility private data recorded however someone physical access machine may still able install software intercept information elsewhere operating system transit network transport layer security tls reduces risk data transit may intercepted network sniffers proxy tools using onetime passwords may prevent unauthorized access account login details exposed attacker via keylogger password invalidated soon used solution may useful someone using public computer however attacker remote control computer simply wait victim enter credentials performing unauthorized transactions behalf session active use smart cards security tokens may improve security replay attacks face successful keylogging attack accessing protected information would require hardware security token well appropriate passwordpassphrase knowing keystrokes mouse actions display clipboard etc used one computer subsequently help attacker gain access protected resource security tokens work type hardwareassisted onetime password system others implement cryptographic authentication improve security manner conceptually similar one time passwords smartcard readers associated keypads pin entry may vulnerable keystroke logging socalled supply chain attacker substitutes card readerpin entry hardware one records users pin onscreen keyboards onscreen keyboard comes windows xp send normal keyboard event messages external target program type text software key loggers log typed characters sent one program keystroke interference software also programs attempt trick keyloggers introducing random keystrokes although simply results keylogger recording information needs attacker task extracting keystrokes security mechanism specifically well stands cryptanalysis unclear similar onscreen keyboards speechtotext conversion software also used keyloggers since typing mouse movements involved weakest point using voicerecognition software may software sends recognized text target software users speech processed many pdas lately tablet pcs already convert pen also called stylus movements touchscreens computer understandable text successfully mouse gestures use principle using mouse movements instead stylus mouse gesture programs convert strokes userdefinable actions typing text similarly graphics tablets light pens used input gestures however becoming less commontimeframe potential weakness speech recognition applies technique well help many programs seemingly meaningless text expanded meaningful text time contextsensitively eg enwikipediaorg expanded web browser window focus biggest weakness technique programs send keystrokes directly target program however overcome using alternating technique described ie sending mouse clicks nonresponsive areas target program sending meaningless keys sending another mouse click target area eg password field switching backandforth alternating typing login credentials typing characters somewhere else focus cause keylogger record information needs could easily filtered attacker similarly user move cursor using mouse typing causing logged keystrokes wrong order eg typing password beginning last letter using mouse move cursor subsequent letter lastly someone also use context menus remove cut copy paste parts typed text without using keyboard attacker capture parts password larger key space attack choose execute bruteforce attack another similar technique uses fact selected text portion replaced next key typed eg password secret one could type dummy keys asdf dummy characters could selected mouse next character password e typed replaces dummy characters asdf techniques assume incorrectly keystroke logging software directly monitor clipboard selected text form take screenshot every time keystroke mouse click occurs may however effective hardware keyloggers
