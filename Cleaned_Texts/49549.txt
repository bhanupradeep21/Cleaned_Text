gilmoreosaurus meaning charles whitney gilmores lizard name given genus dinosaur cretaceous asia type species gilmoreosaurus mongoliensis believed hadrosaur iguanodont iren dabasu formation inner mongolia dating ago additional specimens described distinct species including g atavus khodzhakul formation uzbekistan ago g arkhangelskyi bissekty formation ago however based fragmentary remains classification dubious additional species g kysylkumense also bissekty formation sometimes included though also referred related genus bactrosaurus early twentieth century american museum natural history amnh conducted series palaeontological expeditions deserts asia one geologic formation work conducted expeditions iren dabasu formation inner mongolia fieldwork done field team led walter nobody among specialists dinosaurs instead amnh sent mostly geologists mammal palaeontologists many dinosaur remains discovered nature would remain unknown discovers experts back america examined initial excavations dinosaur fossils iren dabasu took place three days april may conducted extensive digs year later april june several new genera species discovered formation among two new types hadrosaur two would later prove significant among first remains group continent preceded mandschurosaurus amurensis tanius sinensis remains turkestan saurolophus krischtofovici validity latter species already material would eventually come known gilmoreosaurus discovered george olsen member grangers two different quarries kilometre mi apart around kilometres mi northeast town erenhot far border several individuals represented skeleton found material disarticulated pieces belonged individual possible determine arrived back new york mongolian material given barnum brown study brown renowned field collection dinosaurs busy attend asian expeditions extensive work material prepared names new species unknown reasons ceased work project completion instead fossils sent smithsonian would described named new species charles w gilmore smithsonian little terms dinosaur fossil collection gilmore reliant literature first hand comparisons studies despite work field considered high published findings describing hadrosaurs well several dinosaurs one hadrosaurs thought lambeosaur novel genus bactrosaurus second known least four individuals thought hadrosaurine named new species mandschurosaurus mongoliensis choice made tentatively gilmore mindful possibility species may later require genus currently feel sufficient difference amurensis gilmores description species anatomy rather brief would prove inadequate understanding taxon decades later provided clear diagnosis list traits establish species different relatives another issue caused gilmores work material individuals catalogued singular specimen number later palaeontologists thus recatalogue elements modern following original naming gilmores species would remain poorly understood received limited attention despite occasions discussed often brought major taxonomic one persistent issue surrounding taxonomy iren dabasu hadrosaurs nature cranial material found bactrosaurus gilmore assumed based association rest bactrosaurus material must belong genus elements site inconsistent one species present perplexed however lack hollowcrest something thought universal among lambeosaurs consider possibility belonged mongoliensis also noted resemblance specimens genus tanius eventually discarded c c young revived latter idea assigned material tanius regarding mandschurosaurus agreed gilmores referral species genus went say possible actually represents species anatoly k rozhdestvensky considered different solution bactrosaurus fact hadrosaurine lambeosaurine furthermore thought mongoliensis merely synonym hadrosaurine bactrosaurus position would continue hold future future authors would disagree reaffirming two hadrosaurs distinct bactrosaurus next major change taxonomy would come michael k process revision entire hadrosaur firstly provided novel diagnosis species masters however brettsurman considered mandschurosaurus amurensis dubious therefore thought necessary give gilmores species new generic name coined genus gilmoreosaurus honouring gilmore created new combination gilmoreosaurus considered gilmores two hadrosaurs great importance something elaborated short described anatomy gilmoreosaurus partly iguanodont partly hadrosaurine saw ancestral form hadrosaurine bactrosaurus likewise seen ancestral based part two species well probactrosaurus concluded hadrosaurs originated one thing interested brettsurman greatly similarity asian fauna later fauna north american two medicine gilmore paper made similar comments nature asian american paper noted lot additional material iren dabasu never described gilmore especially material pertaining juvenile material brettsurman reported john r horner work investigating material form complete understanding formations fauna referring concluded paper saying although expeditions possible mongolia time light shed natural history dinosaurs scientific expeditions basement natural history halszka osmólska teresa maryańska published paper focused saurolophus angustirostris also provided comments asian hadrosaurs whole among comments returned issue skull material disagreed otherwise monospecific nature quarry ie one species seeming present stronger evidence discordant anatomy material revived youngs model tentatively assigned material tanius felt fit closely noted skull may prove belong either gilmoreosaurus bactrosaurus additional would come horner david b weishampel would reexamine material iren dabasu genera well material gilmore never described indicated brettsurman osmólska provided feedback study relevant new material frontal remains authors considered clearly lambeosaurine nature referrable bactrosaurus could possibly fit skull material concluded said material wasnt genus instead decided congruent seemingly hadrosaurine nature belonged gilmoreosaurus end paper reaffirmed importance genera best record early issue would finally put rest pascal godefroit colleagues published study describing newly discovered bactrosaurus material returned original position gilmore possibility two taxa bactrosaurus type quarry extremely remote skull material belonged gilmoreosaurus bactrosaurus reasoning paradoxical nature anatomy bactrosaurus lambeosaur even hadrosaurid instead primitive form hadrosauroid merely convergent later relatives remarked would informative test phylogenetic affinities gilmoreosaurus well poorly described allow modern review species considered direly seeking finally resolve longstanding issue albert prietomárquez mark norrel began work thorough redescription gilmoreosaurus published resolving phylogenetic position priority ultimate motive behind endeavor known material genus examined study one thing allowed redescription modern diagnosis g mongoliensis one found lacking also specifically touched idea two iren dabasu hadrosaurs could synonyms rozhdestvensky thought idea rejected numerous differences two studies since redescription able
