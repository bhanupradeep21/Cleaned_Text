fish possess highly developed sense organs nearly daylight fish color vision least good humans see vision fish many fish also chemoreceptors responsible extraordinary senses taste smell although ears many fish may hear well fish sensitive receptors form lateral line system detects gentle currents vibrations senses motion nearby fish sharks sense frequencies range hz lateral fish orient using landmarks may use mental maps based multiple landmarks symbols fish behavior mazes reveals possess spatial memory visual vision important sensory system species fish fish eyes similar terrestrial vertebrates like birds mammals spherical lens retinas generally rod cells cone cells scotopic photopic vision species colour vision fish see ultraviolet see polarized light amongst jawless fish lamprey welldeveloped eyes hagfish primitive fish vision shows adaptation visual environment example deep sea fishes eyes suited dark environment fish aquatic animals live different light environment terrestrial species water absorbs light increasing depth amount light available decreases quickly optic properties water also lead different wavelengths light absorbed different degrees example light long wavelengths eg red orange absorbed quite quickly compared light short wavelengths blue violet though ultraviolet light even shorter wavelength blue absorbed quite quickly besides universal qualities water different bodies water may absorb light different wavelengths salts chemicals water hearing important sensory system species fish example family batrachoididae males use swim bladders make advertisement calls females use localize males hearing threshold ability localize sound sources reduced underwater speed sound faster air underwater hearing bone conduction localization sound appears depend differences amplitude detected bone aquatic animals fish specialized hearing apparatus effective fish sense sound lateral lines otoliths ears fishes species carp herring hear swim bladders function rather like hearing hearing welldeveloped carp weberian organ three specialized vertebral processes transfer vibrations swim bladder inner ear although hard test sharks hearing may sharp sense hearing possibly hear prey many miles small opening side heads spiracle leads directly inner ear thin channel lateral line shows similar arrangement open environment via series openings called lateral line pores reminder common origin two vibration sounddetecting organs grouped together acousticolateralis system bony fish tetrapods external opening inner ear lost lateral line fish aquatic forms amphibians detection system water currents consisting mostly vortices lateral line also sensitive lowfrequency vibrations used primarily navigation hunting schooling mechanoreceptors hair cells mechanoreceptors vestibular sense hearing hair cells fish used detect water movements around bodies hair cells embedded jellylike protrusion called cupula hair cells therefore seen appear surface skin receptors electrical sense modified hair cells lateral line system fish aquatic amphibians detect hydrodynamic stimuli via lateral line system consists array sensors called neuromasts along length fishs neuromasts freestanding superficial neuromasts within fluidfilled canals canal neuromasts sensory cells within neuromasts polarized hair cells contained within gelatinous cupula stereocilia hairs hair cells moved certain amount depending movement surrounding water afferent nerve fibers excited inhibited depending whether hair cells arise deflected preferred opposite direction lateral line neurons form somatotopic maps within brain informing fish amplitude direction flow different points along body maps located medial octavolateral nucleus mon medulla higher areas torus pressure detection uses organ weber system consisting three appendages vertebrae transferring changes shape gas bladder middle ear used regulate buoyancy fish fish like weather fish loaches also known respond low pressure areas lack swim bladder aquatic equivalent smelling air tasting water many larger catfish chemoreceptors across entire bodies means taste anything touch smell chemicals water catfish gustation plays primary role orientation location salmon strong sense smell speculation whether odours provide homing cues go back hasler hypothesised vicinity estuary entrance birth river salmon may use chemical cues smell unique natal stream mechanism home onto entrance hasler students convincingly showed way salmon locate home rivers precision indeed could recognise characteristic smell demonstrated smell river becomes imprinted salmon transform smolts migrate homecoming salmon also recognise characteristic smells tributary streams move main river may also sensitive characteristic pheromones given juvenile conspecifics evidence discriminate two populations sharks keen olfactory senses located short duct fused unlike bony fish anterior posterior nasal openings species able detect little one part per million blood sharks ability determine direction given scent based timing scent detection similar method mammals use determine direction sound attracted chemicals found intestines many species result often linger near sewage outfalls species nurse sharks external barbels greatly increase ability sense prey mhc genes group genes present many animals important immune system general offspring parents differing mhc genes stronger immune system fish able smell aspect mhc genes potential sex partners prefer partners mhc genes different electroreception ability detect electric fields currents fish catfish sharks organs detect weak electric potentials order fish like south american electric fishes gymnotiformes produce weak electric currents use navigation social communication sharks ampullae lorenzini electroreceptor organs number hundreds thousands sharks use ampullae lorenzini detect electromagnetic fields living things helps sharks particularly hammerhead shark find prey shark greatest electrical sensitivity animal sharks find prey hidden sand detecting electric fields produce ocean currents moving magnetic field earth also generate electric fields sharks use orientation possibly among teleosts electric catfish uses electroreception navigate muddy waters fish make use spectral changes amplitude modulation determine factors shape size distance velocity conductivity abilities electric fish communicate identify sex age hierarchy within species also made possible electric fields ef gradients low found saltwater weakly electric several basal bony fishes including paddlefish polyodon spathula possess electroreceptors paddlefish hunts plankton using thousands tiny passive electroreceptors located extended snout rostrum paddlefish able detect electric fields oscillate hz large groups plankton generate type magnetoreception ability detect direction one facing based earths magnetic field researchers found iron form single domain magnetite resides skulls sockeye salmon quantities present sufficient salmon regularly migrate thousands miles breeding salmon spend early life rivers swim sea live adult lives gain

close river use sense smell home river entrance even natal spawning experiments done william tavolga provide evidence fish pain fear responses instance tavolgas experiments toadfish grunted electrically shocked time came grunt mere sight scottish scientists university edinburgh roslin institute concluded rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated pain animals bee venom acetic acid injected lips resulted fish rocking bodies rubbing lips along sides floors tanks researchers concluded attempts relieve pain similar mammals would neurons fired pattern resembling human neuronal professor james rose university wyoming claimed study flawed since provide proof fish possess conscious awareness particularly kind awareness meaningfully like rose argues since fish brains different human brains fish probably conscious manner humans reactions similar human reactions pain instead causes rose published study year earlier arguing fish feel pain brains lack however animal behaviorist temple grandin argues fish could still consciousness without neocortex different species use different brain structures systems handle animal welfare advocates raise concerns possible suffering fish
