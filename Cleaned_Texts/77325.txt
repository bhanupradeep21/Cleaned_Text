liaoningvenator meaning liaoning hunter genus troodontid theropod dinosaur early cretaceous china contains single species l curriei named paleontologist phillip j currie shen caizhi colleagues articulated nearly complete skeleton one complete troodontid specimens known shen colleagues found indicative traits placed liaoningvenator within troodontidae traits included numerous small closely packed teeth well vertebrae towards end tail shallow grooves place neural spines top surfaces within troodontidae closest relative liaoningvenator eosinopteryx also closely related anchiornis xiaotingia traditionally placed outside troodontidae phylogenetic analysis conducted shen colleagues offered evidence supporting alternative identification paravians troodontids compared close relatives however liaoningvenator relatively long legs particular femora fifth troodontid known geographically temporally comparable strata liaoningvenator increases diversity chinese troodontids
