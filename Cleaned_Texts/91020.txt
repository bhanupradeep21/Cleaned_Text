dyslexia complex lifelong disorder involving difficulty learning read interpret words letters symbols dyslexia affect general intelligence often codiagnosed least three subtypes dyslexia recognized researchers orthographic surface dyslexia phonological dyslexia mixed dyslexia individuals exhibit symptoms orthographic phonological studies shown dyslexia genetic passed families important note although genetic disorder specific locus brain reading writing human brain language centers spoken gestural communication written language cultural artifact complex one requiring brain regions designed recognize interpret written symbols representations language rapid synchronization complexity system lack genetic predisposition one possible explanation difficulty acquiring understanding written furthermore recent evidence found certain genes responsible causing research also suggests clear genetic basis developmental dyslexia abnormalities certain language areas however also evidence orthography correspondence languages phonemes sound units graphemes characters symbols letters plays significant role type frequency dyslexias psycholinguists believe complexity languages orthography whether high phonemegrapheme correspondence irregular correspondence sounds clearly map symbols affects severity occurrence dyslexia postulating regular system would reduce number cases dyslexia andor severity current psycholinguistic models dyslexia largely developed basis alphabetic writing systems amount research logographic orthographies chinese also fairly significant unfortunately little research done syllabic writing systems crosslinguistic studies acquired dyslexia dysgraphias orthographic dyslexia subtype dyslexia results difficulty decoding encoding skills due slow inaccurate rates storing word letter formations memory orthographic dyslexics difficulty storing mental representation words especially phonetically irregular words word spellings end ight light sight problems underlying type dyslexia related directly memory coding skills allow representation printed letters words poor phonological type dyslexia also termed surface dyslexia people type inability recognize words simply visual basis words misspelled cause readers difficulty attempt sound words looking individual letter rather word reader might read word cat pronounce c hard c read word ice pronounce c hard c well sounding individual phoneme rather recognizing word ice entirety despite intervention children orthographic dyslexia continually lower achievement reading levels compared peers additionally children show greater difficulty throughout schooling spelling words irregular unusual orthographies compared children research also shows dyslexic children primary difficulties phonological processing secondary difficulties orthographic processing aiding distinction two complexity languages orthography directly related difficulty learning read language orthographic complexity also contributes dyslexia manifests readers different deep orthographies writing systems english arabic onetoone correspondence sounds phonemes letters graphemes represent shallow orthographies italian finnish close relationship graphemes phonemes spelling words consistent shallow orthographies new readers problems learning decode words result children learn read relatively quickly dyslexic readers shallow orthographic systems learn decode words relative ease compared dyslexics using deep orthographies though continue difficulty reading fluency hallmark system dyslexia shallow orthography comparatively slow speed rapid automatized naming languages relatively deep orthographies english french readers greater difficulty learning decode new words languages shallow orthographies result childrens reading achievement levels research shown hallmark symptoms dyslexia deep orthography deficit phonological awareness difficulty reading words grade dyslexic readers learning decode words may take long deepest orthographies distinctive symptom dyslexia inability read word many dyslexic readers fewer problems fluency comprehension level decoding mastered studies english german shallower orthography english languages shown greater depth english orthography marked adverse effect reading skills among children dyslexia though dyslexics studies still mostly underperformed compared control research however suggested children dyslexia still reading difficulties despite different orthographies including reading speed deficit slow decoding findings suggest orthographic differences significantly impact main difficulties dyslexia experience number different types writing systems orthographies necessarily depend neurological skill result certain dyslexic deficits may pronounced orthographies others example alphabetic languages phonological awareness highly predictive reading ability chinese logographic system orthographic awareness motor programming highly predictive reading current research dyslexia focuses alphabetic alphabetic writing systems vary significantly depth orthography english french considered deep orthographies comparison spanish italian shallow orthographies deep orthography like english letters letter combinations reliably map specific phonemessound units ambiguous terms sounds represent whereas transparent shallow orthography symbols uniquely map sounds ideally onetoone correspondence least limited clearly signified accent marks distinguishing features variation literacy studies shown even children without reading difficulties like dyslexia transparent orthography learned quickly easily true across language systems syllabic alphabetic logographic shallow deep alphabetic crosslanguage studies aro wimmer report differences developmental reading skills across several alphabetic orthographies among tested english children achieved accuracy pseudoword testing end first grade attain high accuracy fourth grade however test french german dutch spanish swedish finnish children achieved scores approaching grade grade research provides evidence orthographic irregularities complex graphemephoneme relations found english present significant difficulties reading development however little evidence regular orthographic system would significantly diminish number dyslexia cases also visual aspect dyslexia affected children often show symptoms mirror letter reversal eg confusing b manifest language regardless orthographic depth logographic writing systems chinese characters cuneiform differ significantly alphabetic systems graphemes logographic system logograms written characters represent meaning morphemes rather sounds phonemes result logographic systems require comparatively large number unique characters means development reading writing skills logographic systems depends heavily visual memorization alphabetic systems thus dyslexics often rely grapheme memorization cope phonological awareness may show reduced difficulty acquiring language uses logographic however logograms offer fewer phonological cues alphabets irregular orthographygraphemetophoneme correspondence compared transparent system like alphabet syllabary literacyreadability studies children without reading difficulties shown children take longer demonstrate literacy logographic systems children syllabic systems alphabetic systems differences proficiency diminish age increases findings suggest transparent systems easier learn primary languages chinese children exhibit severe difficulties due dyslexia compared using alphabetic script chinese dyslexic children phonologically disadvantage visiospatial processing disorder prevents activation semantic alphabetic writing systems phonological awareness plays central role reading acquisition phonological awareness chinese much less important rather reading chinese strongly related childs writing skills depend orthographic awareness motor memory handling alphabetic languages deep orthographies child must cope one spelling represent sound spoken chinese single syllable used many different words chinese child must cope many written characters represent complicating chinese writing system chinese character made strokes subcharacter components substantially increasing visual complexity thus orthographic processing important aspect reading deficient orthographytomeaning mapping lead reading disability key strategy teaching children read children repeatedly write samples single characters thus building childs awareness characters internal structure orthographic rapid naming one best single predictors dyslexia languages tested including alphabetic characterbased writing evidence means deciphering characters differs logographic alphabetic writing systems differclarification needed brain logographic systems echo mapreading skills syllabary written characters represent spoken syllables whereas alphabetic systems use charactersletters represent separate symbol syllabary typically canonical shape consonantvowel cv combination japanese syllabaries hiragana katakana nearly onetoone correspondence morae characters transparency syllabaries reason use first teaching japanese children read advancing complex logographic system kanji age five prior official reading education japanese children read majority hiragana syllabary orthographies like english orthography also irregular symbol could mean one sentence symbol could mean e different sentence preceded different symbolclarification increase difficulty reading people dyslexia however little research done dyslexia presents syllabic systems one possible reason different ways dyslexia present ie visuospatial systems affected chinese dyslexics logographic system affected defectsabnormalities visuospatial processing regions likely since written language cultural artifact genetic predispositions existing structures must adapted handle languageclarification needed disorder may go unnoticed recognized literacy study children without reading disabilities found syllabic scripts like japanese katakana hiragana transparent orthographically learned quickly better proficiency orthographically opaque languages followed ease use learning shallow alphabetic scripts also many phonological cues complex alphabetic scripts
