hyperphantasia condition extremely vivid mental opposite condition aphantasia mental visual imagery experience hyperphantasia common described vivid real hyperphantasia constitutes five senses within vivid mental imagery although literature subject dominated visual mental imagery research lack research four research hyperphantasia commonly completed selfreport questionnaires vividness visual imagery questionnaire vviq developed david marks evaluates vividness individuals mental imagery score individuals scoring deemed hyperphantasics estimated constitute around reliably specific mental imagery cortical network formation mental imagery involves many regions brain mental imagery shares many common brain regions cognitive neurological evidence shown creation imagery neural activity spans prefrontal parietal temporal visual within neuroscience imagery often split three primary aspects triggering imagery generationmanipulation underlying vividness mechanism underlying vividness imagery may explain disorders like hyperphantasia controversial amongst current findings mechanism hyperphantasia related two regions brain early visual cortex frontal recent research shown relationship size surface area early visual cortex specifically lesser degree negatively predicts imagery strength within relationship evidenced across clinical nonclinical populations see comorbidity contrast positive relationship surface area frontal cortex visual imagery aligns reciprocal relationship size primary visual cortices frontal cortices smaller correlating larger frontal within general principle human cortical organization anatomical tradeoff primary sensory cortices primary visual cortex frontal areas several lines evidence suggest respective sizes areas within individuals predict vividness additionally genetics play part determining surface area suggesting genetics may indirectly contribute beyond size regions evidence lower resting activity excitability levels within primary visual cortex predicts stronger mental imagery vice versa confirmed artificially lowering excitability visual cortex subsequently led increased imagery relationship frontal lobe visual cortex form imagery network ratio size excitability two areas relate imagery strength amongst neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri additionally demonstrated hyperphantasics significantly stronger connectivity prefrontal cortices brodmanns areas particular visual cortex comparison mechanism behind vivid imagery appears come size excitability visualoccipital network frontal areas well strength connectivity brain regions however factors explain variations mental imagery specific mechanisms cause hyperphantasia still well vivid mental imagery observed hyperphantasia impacts peoples ability mental time travel ability remember past events well imagine future hyperphantasics reported sensory details episodic memories future event episodic autobiographical memories reliant sensoryperceptual data visual concepts flashbulb memories powerful autobiographical memories often relive often built vivid visual evidence shown individuals exhibiting increased imagery vividness also often recall autobiographical memories richer descriptions well additionally disorders affect vision visual imagery aphantasia linked autobiographical amnesia depicting importance visual imagery autobiographical relationship imagery vividness improved autobiographical memory recall evidenced across clinical nonclinical lack research impacts vivid mental imagery imagining future events possible scenarios episodic future thinking however research shown increased vivid imagery predict clarity spatial context feeling emotions intensity personal importance events implies hyperphantasics may better planning future predicting events may impact additionally explains vivid imagery helps perceptual acuity research shown higher vviq scores predict rapid precise decisionmaking face hyperphantasia shown associated higher levels openness big five personality traits using neo personality inventory entails openness new experiences broad interests active imagination likelihood experiencing positive negative emotions keenly research shown hyperphantasia may impact occupational preference individuals hyperphantasics significantly likely work traditionally creative roles within arts design entertainment sports media comparison aphantasic hyperphantasia found strong positive correlation vividness creativity several study participants going far using vividness imagery visualized objects minds vivid imagery correlated several mood disorders particularly anxiety major depressive disorder bipolar disorder hyperphantasia may exacerbate symptoms disorders subserving ruminating thoughts well acting emotional amplifier example vivid flash forwards suicidal acts may increase occurrences vividness mental imagery key role development continuation intrusive memories ptsd hyperphantasia substantial risk schizophrenia parkinsons disease also may aggravated hyperphantasia high levels vivid imagery predict severity visual fact possible
