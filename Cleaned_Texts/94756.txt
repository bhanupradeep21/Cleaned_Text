saharastega extinct genus basal temnospondyl lived late permian period around million years ago remains saharastega discovered paleontologist christian sidor moradi formation niger described briefly comprehensively description based skull lacking lower jaws skull somewhat wide gradually narrows towards snout portion skull front orbits eye sockets longer behind centimeters inches length centimeters inches width widest point cranial bones somewhat eroded preserved portions finely textured pits ridges adult temnospondyls lacking unornamented areas adjacent midline characterize edopoids skull lacks lateral line grooves may indicate terrestriality overall size shape akin aquatic temnospondyls numerous teeth broken bases size elliptical nares nostril holes narrow angled almost perpendicular long axis skull unique feature dissimilar nares temnospondyls either circular angled parallel long axis skull orbits small rounded widely separated pineal foramen absent suspensorium jaw joint shifted forwards effect twisting quadrate bones forwards closing squamosal embayments large emarginations along rear skull also known otic arrangement cranial bones generally similar early temnospondyls nasal bones upper surface snout long frontal parietal bones rear skull wide traits related skull proportions lacrimal bones side snout isolated contacting neither nares orbits traits akin cochleosaurid chenoprosopus saharastega lacks characteristic postparietal shape cochleosaurids early temnospondyls later members group saharastega retains intertemporal bone behind eyes likewise supratemporal bone forms portion rear edge skull rather excluded tabular squamosal bones present area tabulars uniquely shaped thick bluntlytipped bones twisted outwards downwards along rear edge skull contrast temnospondyls generally smaller triangular tabulars directed straight braincase complex strongly built though rather shallow owing short height skull unusually among temnospondyls skull possessed large plate bone foramen magnum underlaid system ridges forming inverted shape plate bone may single large supraoccipital rare among paleozoic amphibians likely formed contribution supraoccipital postparietal bones baphetoids portion skull somewhat similar dvinosaurian isodectes exoccipital bones either side foramen magnum stretch downwards underscore braincase rare feature also seen advanced temnospondyls palate roof mouth similar chenoprosopus early temnospondyls bones palate covered small domelike structures known denticles interpterygoid vacuities holes pterygoid bones characteristic temnospondyls relatively small semicircular located halfway towards rear skull small size rearward location means outer edge completely formed pterygoid bones without contribution palatal bones edge skull also small circular pair holes anterior palatal vacuities tip snout elongated rectangular choanae along edge snout premaxilla bones tip snout complex tongueandgroove connection maxilla bones directly behind configuration visible palate seemingly unique saharastega among temnospondyls pterygoid bones narrow bulbous contact parasphenoid bone forms base braincase contact means flexible contrast larger robust connection present later hand palate also several features line advanced temnospondyls small depression known fossa subrostralis media present premaxillae contact along midpoint snout tip depression also known several stereospondylomorphs large platelike vomer bones lie choanae possess single diagonallyoriented row teeth known transvomerine tooth row well large fang vomer fangs palatal fangs general abundant among early tetrapods transvomerine tooth row characteristic advanced temnospondyls rather early taxa first papers discuss describe saharastega considered part group edopoidea early branch temnospondyl amphibians edopoids lived carboniferous saharastega equally unusual contemporary nigerpeton survived late permian relict early temnospondyl saharastega shares seemingly unique features edopoids particularly shape lacrimal bone particularly resembles cochelosaurids also dissimilar edopoids many ways original papers saharastega generally placed base edopoidea regardless clear saharastega basal primitive compared temnospondyls due retention intertemporals absence lateral lines small interpterygoid vacuities narrow contact palate since studies position saharastega controversial pawley placed deeper within edopoids sister taxon informal suggestion australian paleontologist adam yates even proposed temnospondyl rather seymouriamorph based general similarities skull mchugh tentatively placed crownward within temnospondyli ie deeper within temnospondyl family tree placing eryopoid related comprehensive study temnospondyl relations include saharastega due unstable marjanovic laurin utilized saharastega part many reanalyses ruta coates tetrapod study original study include saharastega added along nigerpeton
