laser hair removal process hair removal means exposure pulses laser light destroy hair follicle performed experimentally twenty years becoming commercially available one first published articles describing laser hair removal authored group massachusetts general hospital laser hair removal widely practiced clinics even homes using devices designed priced consumer selftreatment many reviews laser hair removal methods safety efficacy published dermatology r rox anderson melanie discovered possible selectively target specific chromophore laser partially damage basal stem cells inside hair follicles method proved successful first applied united states food drug administration approved tactic hair removal technology continued researched laser hair removal became effective efficient thus common method removing hair long periods time primary principle behind laser hair removal selective photothermolysis sptl matching specific wavelength light pulse duration obtain optimal effect targeted tissue minimal effect surrounding tissue lasers cause localized damage selectively heating dark target matter melanin thereby heating basal stem cells follicle causes hair growth hair follicle heating rest skin light absorbed dark objects reflected light objects water laser energy absorbed dark material hair skin much speed intensity skin without dark adult hair melanin melanin considered primary chromophore hair removal lasers currently market melanin occurs naturally skin gives skin hair color two types melanin hair eumelanin gives hair brown black color pheomelanin gives hair blonde red color selective absorption photons laser light hair color black brown reddishbrown hair dirty blonde removed white hair light blonde strawberry blonde hair respond well laser works best dark coarse hair light skin dark hair ideal combination effective producing best results lasers ndyag laser able target black hair patients dark skin hair removal lasers use since approved permanent hair reduction united states food drug administration fdas definition permanent hair reduction longterm stable reduction number hairs regrowing treatment regime many patients experience complete regrowth hair treated areas years following last treatment means although laser treatments devices permanently reduce total number body hairs result permanent removal laser hair removal become popular speed efficacy although efficacy dependent upon skill experience laser operator choice availability different laser technologies used procedure need touchup treatments especially large areas initial set treatments review article journal lasers medical science compared intense pulsed light ipl epilators alexandrite diode lasers review found statistical difference shortterm effectiveness higher incidence side effects diode laserbased treatment hair reduction six months reported alexandrite lasers diode lasers ipl side effects reported alexandrite lasers diode lasers ipl side effects found temporary even pigmentation changes returned normal within six ipl though technically containing laser sometimes incorrectly referred laser hair removal iplbased methods sometimes called phototricholysis photoepilation use xenon flash lamps emit full spectrum light ipl systems typically output wavelengths nm nm filters applied block shorter wavelengths thereby using longer redder wavelengths ipls offer certain advantages laser principally pulse duration lasers may output trains short pulses simulate longer pulse ipl systems generate pulse widths ms useful larger diameter targets current ipl systems proven successful removal hair blood vessels many electrolysis another hair removal method used like newer laser technology used properly several treatments electrolysis used remove hair area effective hair colors used adequate power level proper technique treatment slow tedious compared typical newer laser hair removal hair may grow certain areas prone hormoneinduced growth eg womans chin neck based individual hormone levels changes therein ones genetic predisposition grow new hair study conducted asvak laser center ankara turkey comparing alexandrite laser electrolysis hair removal patients concluded laser hair removal times faster less painful reliable electrolysis important note type electrolysis performed study galvanic electrolysis rather thermolysis blend two galvanic current requires seconds minute release hair whereas thermolysis blend require much less study thus test capability forms modern synthesis shaving technique one removes hair skin razor shaving popular temporary hair removal technique since least american businessman king gillette invented razor blade sharp thin disposable cheap system widespread success evolved modern disposable razor shaving however temporary lead irritation shaved area waxing another option hair removal method efficient way removing hair longerlasting shaving permanent ancient egyptians developed similar mechanism sugaring one would mix oil honey apply waxing evolved two types waxing one strips already ready use one apply skin peel direction opposite hair growth another one involves heating wax applying skin placing cloth pulling away hair countries including us hair removal unregulated procedure anyone places doctors doctorsupervised personnel cases permission extends

removal state several wavelengths laser energy used hair removal visible light nearinfrared radiation lasers characterized wavelength measured nanometers pulse width duration one important considerations length heating pulse relates directly damage achieved follicle attempting destroy hair follicles main target germ cells live surface hair shaft light energy absorbed melanin within hair heat generated heat conducts towards germ cells long sufficient temperature maintained required time cells successfully destroyed absolutely critical attaining required temperature sufficient unless kept temperature corresponding time determined arrhenius rate achieve conditions laseripl system must able generate required power output main reason hair removal fails simply equipment generate desired temperature correct time spot size width laser beam directly affects depth penetration light energy due scattering effects dermal layer larger beam diameters devices linear results deeper deposition energy hence induce higher temperatures deeper follicles hair removal lasers spot size size fingertip mm fluence energy density another important consideration fluence measured joules per square centimeter important get treated high enough settings heat follicles enough disable producing hair epidermal cooling determined allow higher fluences reduce pain side effects especially darker skin three types cooling developed essence important output parameter treating hair skin conditions power density combination energy spot diameter pulse duration three parameters determine actually happens light energy absorbed tissue chromophore melanin hemoglobin water amount tissue damaged determined temperaturetime combination hair grows several phases anagen telogen catagen laser affect currently active growing hair follicles early anagen hence several sessions needed damage hair phases growth force revert vellus noncolored small multiple treatments depending type hair skin color shown provide longterm reduction hair people need minimum eight treatments current parameters differ device device manufacturers clinicians generally recommend waiting three eight weeks sessions depending area treated number sessions depends various parameters including area body treated skin color coarseness hair reason hirsutism sex certain areas notably mens facial hair may require considerably treatments achieve desired results laser work well lightcolored hair red hair grey hair white hair well fine hair color vellus darker skinned patients black hair longpulsed ndyag laser cooling tip safe effective used experienced practitioner typically shedding treated hairs takes two three weeks hairs allowed fall manipulated patient certain reasons chiefly avoid infections pulling
