genetic variation populations analyzed quantified frequency alleles two fundamental calculations central population genetics allele frequencies genotype genotype frequency population number individuals given genotype divided total number individuals population genetics genotype frequency frequency proportion ie f genotypes population although allele genotype frequencies related important clearly distinguish genotype frequency may also used future genomic profiling predict someones even birth also used determine ethnic diversity genotype frequencies may represented de finetti diagram example consider population fouroclock plants mirabilis jalapa following genotypes calculating allele frequency diploid species remember homozygous individuals two copies allele whereas heterozygotes one example pinkflowered heterozygotes one copy allele whiteflowered homozygotes two copies therefore allele frequency white color allele equals result tells us allele frequency words alleles gene population allele compare genotype frequency lets calculate genotype frequency aa homozygotes whiteflowered plants allele genotype frequencies always sum one law describes relationship allele genotype frequencies population evolving lets examine equation using population fouroclock plants considered allele frequency denoted symbol p allele frequency denoted q example q must words allele frequency equals remaining alleles must together equal gene exists two alleles equation states apply equation flower color gene result tells us allele frequency allele frequency expected genotype frequency aa aa aa httpsenwikipediaorgwikigenotypefrequency
