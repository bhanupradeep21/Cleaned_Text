quadriceps hamstrings effective climbing however lacked foot arches adopt flatfooted stance would made less efficient walking running australopithecus homo may employed bipedal gait long time may predominantly used palm walking nonetheless ramidus still specialized adaptations bipedality robust fibularis longus muscle used pushing foot ground walking big toe though still capable grasping used pushing legs aligned directly ankles instead bowing like nonhuman great reduced canine size reduced skull robustness ramidus males size males females typically correlated reduced conflict increased parental investment assumed ramidus lived society similar bonobos ateline due process self domestication becoming docile allows gracile build similar process thought occurred comparatively docile bonobos aggressive chimps ramidus society may seen increase maternal care female mate selection compared alternatively possible increased male size derived trait instead basal evolved later rather earlier specialized adaptation modern great apes response different physically exerting lifestyle males females rather tied interspecific australian anthropologists gary clark maciej henneberg argued shortening may caused descension well better movement vocal ability significantly pushing back origin language well evolution homo argued self domestication aided development vocalization living prosocial society means nonviolently dealing conflict conceded chimps ramidus likely vocal capabilities said ramidus made use complex vocalizations vocalized level human infant due selective pressure become social would allowed society become complex also noted base skull stopped growing brain end juvenility whereas chimps continues growing rest body adulthood considered evidence switch gross skeletal anatomy trajectory neurological development trajectory due selective pressure sociability nonetheless conclusions highly american primatologist craig stanford postulated ramidus behaved similarly chimps frequent trees ground polygynous society hunt cooperatively technologically advanced however clark henneberg concluded ardipithecus compared chimps similar according french
