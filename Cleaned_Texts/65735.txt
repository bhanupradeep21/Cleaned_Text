immunology antiserum blood serum containing antibodies either monoclonal polyclonal used spread passive immunity many diseases via blood donation plasmapheresis example convalescent serum passive antibody transfusion previous human survivor used known effective treatment ebola infection high success rate patients antisera widely used diagnostic virology laboratories common use antiserum humans antitoxin antivenom treat envenomationcitation needed serum therapy also known serotherapy describes treatment infectious disease using serum animals immunized specific organisms product disease supposedly referablecitation needed emil behring kitasato shibasaburō published first paper serum therapy behring pioneered technique using guinea pigs produce based observation people survived infection diphtheria bacterium never became infected discovered body continually produces antitoxin prevents survivors infections infected agent necessary behring immunize larger animals order produce enough serum protect humans amount antiserum produced guinea pigs little practical horses proved best serum producer serum large animals concentrated enough horses believed carry diseases could transferred humans due first world war large number horses needed military purposes difficult behring find enough german horses serum facility chose obtain horses eastern european countries mostly hungary poland behrings limited financial resources horses selected intended slaughter however usefulness animal others influence production serum serum horses calm wellmannered good health age breed

horses arrived marburg three four weeks recover quarantine facility data recorded perfect medical condition immunization quarantine facility ensured free microbes could infect horses behring facilities horses viewed life savers therefore well treated individual horses used serum production named celebrated service medicine human nonhuman end century every second child germany infected diphtheria frequent cause death children years emil behring saved life young girl diphtheria injecting antiserum first time history serum horses proved saviors diphtheriainfected people subsequently treatment tetanus rabies snake venom developed proactive protective vaccination diphtheria microbial diseases began behring first nobel prize medicine work study diphtheria serum therapy became increasingly prevalent infectious diseases even used treat patients influenza pandemic uses quickly expanded also treat diseases polio measles pneumococcus haemophilus influenza b meningococcus michael heidelberger oswald avery proved antibodies proteins targeted capsule virus bacteria discovery antibiotics diminished interest treating bacterial infections antiserum use viral infections continued development ethanol fractionation blood plasma allowed purified antibodies discovered edwin cohn antisera developed prevent andor treat diphtheria tetanus hepatitis b rabies varicella zoster virus cytomegalovirus botulinum however widely used milstein köhler nobel prize paper described method making murine monoclonal antibodies immortalizing b cells hybridomas another breakthrough occurred new technology allowed heavy light chain immunoglobulin genes amplified human b cells cloned expression vectors method refined greater ability sort cells clone led discovery human monoclonal antibodies fda approved use rsvigiv respigam polyclonal antibody drug inhibit respiratory syncytial virus rsv highrisk newborns considered breakthrough clinical trial proven reduce infant hospitalizations length hospital stays two years product demand began exceed supply plasma synagis first humanized monoclonal antibody approved place monoclonal antibodies became advantageous due decreased variability quality decreased risk bloodborne diseases increased potency enabled large expansion usages antiserum opened door treatment autoimmune diseases past years seen transformation chronic autoimmune diseases e g cancer ulcerative colitis treated chronic monoclonal antibodies approved monoclonal antibodies currently researched treat viral diseases without vaccines hiv sars

antibodies antiserum bind infectious agent immune system recognizes foreign agents bound antibodies triggers robust immune response use antiserum particularly effective pathogens capable evading

immunity snake venom horses infected pathogen vaccinated thrice increasing sizes dose time vaccination varied horse health condition normally horses needed weeks produce serum blood last vaccination even though tried empower immune system horses immunization painstaking care horses experienced appetite loss fever worse cases shock dyspneacitation needed highest immunization risk horses production antiserum snake venom horse immunized types snake poison time always possible know snake species person bitten therefore serum immunize subject venom every snake species order find moment antitoxins blood cells horses produced frequent blood samples taken horses point highest amount antibodies produced five liters blood tenth blood volume horse taken cannula blood collected glass cylinder brought laboratory behring facilities rouleaux formation contained red blood cells serum visible color serum varied milky brown concentration sterility serum checked carefully serum filtered many times protein content decreased order use serum humans blood sampling horses could rest three four weeks received extra food recover blood loss period horses especially weak prone disease infection within
