greatest dissemination acceptance declaration dialogue public stakeholders declaration issued november scientists switzerland germany united kingdom france sweden signatories commit accepting greater responsibility animal experiments intensive cooperation public form dialogue prejudice time demand essential animal experiments obtaining research results remain permitted future basel declaration researchers seeking achieve impartial approach scientific issues public trusting reliable cooperation national international decision makers signatories basel declaration actively seeking show science animal welfare diametrically opposed make constructive contribution dialogue taking place society example incorporation new eu directive september protection animals used scientific purposes national revised eu directive provides use fewer laboratory animals scientific purposes future better reconciles needs research protection animals without making research difficult eu member states must incorporate directive national law within two years apply national regulations january animal experiments remain necessary biomedical research foreseeable future constantly working refine methods animal welfare mind signatories declaration commit amongst things use animal experiments research concerns fundamentally important knowledge alternative methods available part commitment twoday conference november ended affirmation allegiance principle reduction refinement replacement principle replace reduce refine origins william russell rex l burch published principles humane experimental technique principles regarded internationally guideline avoiding reducing animal experiments suffering laboratory animals participants symposium adopted basel declaration unanimously agreed science must take clear stand regard responsible handling laboratory animals also show greater transparency toward make motivation methods comprehensible public decision makers researchers aim cooperate closely politicians media schools future give greater importance communication science authors basel declaration acknowledge need greater discussion animal experiment issues public also risks research approaches possible misuse new technological developments addition declare intention communicate results und scientific controversies also processes approval procedures science process order foster deeper understanding regard improvement information public research involving experiments signatories basel declaration commit following modern medicine based discoveries basic biological research implementation applied research initial signatories basel declaration see tendency restrict animal experiments especially field basic research major risk maintain stage research neither basic applied research must categorically excluded purposes animal experiments deemed permissible apart difficulty differentiating two stages field medical research applied research generally inconceivable without basic research basic research end serves basis consideration basic applied research part continuum biomedical research assignment research project one part often rather arbitrary hand categorization experiment basic research yet justify use animals per se demonstration animal experiment indispensable necessary weighing interests animal welfare benefits according research objective genetically modified animals represent important instrument modern biomedical research many cases species higher evolutionary scale animal experiments replaced use simpler organisms bred means gene technology fruit flies laboratory worms fish plays major part helping promote principles replacement reduction refinement animal experiments disease models genetically modified animals mainly rodents mice rats however adequately depict human physiology cases research animal models using mammals eventoed ungulates especially animal health rare cases also monkeys remains necessary according participants

predict increased need research using nonhuman primates future eg personalized medicine neurodegenerative diseases aging society continuing need also reflected eu directive animals used scientific purposes recognized research nonhuman primates remain irreplaceable foreseeable future biomedical research divided basic research applied research continuum includes basic studies normal functions
