insect pheromones neurotransmitters serve chemical communication individuals insect species thus differ kairomones words neurotransmitters transmit information nonspecies organisms insects produce pheromones special glands release environment pheromone receptors sensory cells recipient produce nerve stimulus even low concentrations ultimately leads behavioral response intraspecific communication insects via substances takes place variety ways serves among things find sexual partner maintain harmony colony socially living insects mark territories find nest sites food sources german biochemist nobel prize winner adolf butenandt identified synthesized unsaturated fatty alcohol bombycol sex pheromone domestic silk moth bombyx mori first known insect pheromone sex pheromones female butterflies mostly mono bisolefinic fatty acids esters fatty alcohols esters corresponding aldehydes male butterflies use wide range chemicals sex pheromones example pyrrolizidine alkaloids terpenes aromatic compounds benzaldehyde research chemical communication insects expanding understanding locate food sources places lay eggs example beekeepers use artificially produced nasanov

mating disruption expected insect pheromones also contribute way control insectborne infectious diseases malaria dengue fever african trypanosomiasis adolf butenandt peter karlson proposed term

goal coin internationally understandable scientific term class substances based clear definition short word could spoken many languages ending mone served suffix occurs words hormone kairomone allomone thus emphasizing term pheromone replaced term ectohormone homoiohormone albrecht bethe already proposed bethes term accepted according butenandt terms ecto hormone mutually exclusive
