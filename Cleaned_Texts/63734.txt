sobrarbesiren meaning siren sobrarbe genus extinct sirenian lived eocene million years ago type species cardieli known multitude specimens spanish pyrenees sobrarbesiren mediumsized animal ft long still retaining pairs limbs although initially thought amphibious later studies instead suggest would fully aquatic selective sea grass browsers unlike modern dugongs manatees likely lacked tail fluke

conducted díazberenguer colleagues recovered sobrarbesiren basal sirenian outside dugongidae derived prorastomids found paraphyletic protosirenids note strange sobrarbesiren shows anatomy much better

priscosiren atlantica caribosiren turneri hydrodamalinae dugonginae several characteristics sobrarbesiren initially used suggest still capable supporting weight land could moved quadrupedally tall neural spines could helped keep head upright pubes sacroiliac joints would made quadrupedal locomotion possible initially argued differentiated sobrarbesiren protosirenids likely incapable supporting restricted movement like modern pinnipeds however despite anatomical features sobrarbesiren still clearly adapted life water shown anatomy sacral vertebrae differs terrestrial pezosiren taking account adaptations aquatic life dense broad ribs retracted nares short hindlimbs unfused sacrum dìazberenguer colleagues initially hypothesize sobrarbesiren amphibious animal living land water suggested animal likely fed water may traveled different bodies water matches environment found intertidal however later paper díazberenguer examined hindlimbs pelvis sobrarbesiren closer comparing basal sirenians archaeocete whales conducting microanatomical analysis research concluded hips would allowed wide variety hindlimb movements sacral vertebrae allowed lateral movement authors suggest swimming could moved undulating pelvis additionally paddling feet similar river otters also possible hindlimbs sobrarbesiren complimented flattened tail movement indicated torsion found femur however unlike original description taxa authors doubt animal would able effectively move land point towards advanced osteosclerosis innominate femur much greater seen pinnipeds similar known protocetid whales could rendered bones brittle used terrestrial locomotion conclude internal changes bone would preceded external adaptations explaining superficially appear sufficient enough use water despite note range motion still suggests animal actively used feet swimming degree rostrums sirenians deflect varies genera generally connected diet particular adaptation feeding aquatic plants seafloor extreme cases displaying downturn like seagrassspecialized dugongs downturn sobrarbesiren within range modern manatees range deflection unlike highly specialized dugongs manatees broader diet feeding plants growing fresh saltwater diet previously proposed basal groups prorastomids known coastal river deposits however contrasted isotope analysis suggests even basal groups sea grass made important part diet additionally downturn rostrum width may also play role sirenian feeding habits domning proposes narrow laterally flattened mandibular symphysis rostrum indicative selective feeding mandible sobrarbesiren unknown rostrum compressed would match interpretation combining isotopic morphological data sobrarbesiren inferred selective browser primarily feeding sea grass occasionally floating plant castejón de locality thought channel within tidal zone bay biscay deep marine gulf located iberian peninsula mainland europe eocene fact bones sobrarbesiren well preserved disarticulated widely dispersed interpreted díazberenguer colleagues mean channel containing bones filled sediment single event burying bones instantly fossil foraminifera show sea grasses could found ainsa basin
