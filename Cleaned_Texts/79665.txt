pancreatic islets islets langerhans regions pancreas contain endocrine hormoneproducing cells discovered german pathological anatomist paul pancreatic islets constitute pancreas volume receive blood pancreatic islets arranged density routes throughout human pancreas important metabolism million islets distributed throughout pancreas healthy adult human measures average mm islet separated surrounding pancreatic tissue thin fibrous connective tissue capsule continuous fibrous connective tissue interwoven throughout rest hormones produced pancreatic islets secreted directly blood flow

play significant role diabetes thought destroyed immune assaults beta cells pancreatic islets selectively destroyed autoimmune process type diabetes clinicians researchers actively pursuing islet transplantation means restoring physiological beta cell function would offer alternative complete pancreas transplant artificial islet transplantation emerged viable option treatment insulin requiring diabetes early steady progress following three clinical trials shown insulin independence improved metabolic control reproducibly obtained transplantation cadaveric donor islets patients unstable type people high body mass index bmi unsuitable pancreatic donors due greater technical complications transplantation however possible isolate larger number islets larger pancreas therefore suitable donors islet transplantation involves transfer tissue consisting beta cells necessary treatment disease thus represents advantage whole pancreas transplantation technically demanding poses risk example pancreatitis leading organ another advantage patients require general islet transplantation type diabetes requires potent immunosuppression prevent host rejection donor islets transplanted portal vein implanted risk portal venous branch thrombosis low value islet survival minutes transplantation vascular density site surgery several months lower endogenous islets thus neovascularization key islet survival supported example vegf produced islets vascular endothelial however intraportal transplantation shortcomings alternative sites would provide better microenvironment islets implantation islet transplant research also focuses islet encapsulation cnifree calcineurininhibitor immunosuppression biomarkers islet damage islet donor alternative source beta cells insulinproducing cells derived adult stem cells progenitor cells would contribute overcoming shortage donor organs transplantation field regenerative medicine rapidly evolving offers great hope nearest future however type diabetes result autoimmune destruction beta cells pancreas therefore effective cure require sequential integrated approach combines adequate safe immune interventions beta cell regenerative also demonstrated alpha cells spontaneously switch fate transdifferentiate beta cells healthy diabetic human mouse pancreatic islets possible future source beta cell fact found islet morphology endocrine differentiation directly endocrine progenitor cells differentiate migrating cohesion forming budlike islet precursors peninsulas alpha cells constitute peninsular outer layer beta cells form later
