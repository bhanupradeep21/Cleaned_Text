chemical immunology dean faculty biology director macarthur center parasitology vice president international scientific relations vice president institute addition professor arnon served director institutes macarthur center molecular biology tropical diseases much arnons work development vaccinations cancer research one largest contributions science working alongside professor michael sela develop drug multiple sclerosis called copaxone development copaxone began successful synthesis first synthetic antigen along devorah tietelbaum time doctoral student discovered material synthetically produced lab could suppress disease found animals model multiple sclerosis thirty years research copaxone approved medical arnon served chairperson sciences division israel academy sciences later elected president israel academy also member embo european molecular biology organization arnon served secretarygeneral international union immunological sciences president european federation

washington seattle university california los angeles pasteur institute paris walter elise hall institute melbourne imperial cancer research fund london curie institute paris arnon sela developed new drug application treatment multiple sclerosis called copolymer chemical name glatiramer acetate submitted teva pharmaceutical company fda approval name copaxone june since multiple sclerosis immunological disease cop immunospecific drug surprise arnon focused majority work field immunology specifically aids neuroprotection generation well prevents demyelination axons hallmark diseases multiple sclerosis fact studies arnon et al shown increase myelination result cop article arnon aharoni state glatiramer acetate highly effective suppression experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis various arnon researching universal recombinant influenza vaccination well cancer vaccine paper discusses use viruslike particles vlp induce immune particles replicate possess specific antigenpresenting proteins immune cells use identify viruses therefore vaccine could introduce vlps individuals immune system bring production memory cells arnon benyedidia hypothesize vaccines would effective pandemic virus commonly known bird flu tested various synthetic vaccinations mice observed significant immune response addition put human lymphocytes mice also observed immune research formed basis company biondvax taken universal flu vaccine human clinical trials arnon appointed cochair ukisrael science council alongside prof lord robert winston founding member council since summary ruth rosenberg later arnon youngest three children born tel aviv alexander rosenberg father travelled toulouse family pursue degrees electrical engineering mathematics went work israel electric corporation returned israel father according arnon sparked interest science arnons work mostly focused creation vaccines cancer studies working development copaxone medication multiple sclerosis professor michael sela one significant contributions science copaxones development began successful creation first synthetic antigen discovered substance synthesised lab might inhibit condition observed animals paradigm multiple sclerosis along devorah tietelbaum doctorate student time copaxone licensed medical use thirty years research copolymer novel medication application created arnon sela treatment multiple sclerosis glatiramer acetate chemical name june teva pharmaceutical company submitted fda approval name copaxone cop immunospecific medication makes sense given multiple sclerosis immunological illness arnon spent majority career working field immunology promotes neuroprotection generation also preventing axon demyelination characteristic illnesses like multiple sclerosis fact research arnon et al found cop causes increase myelination currently arnon working recombinant influenza vaccine universal well cancer vaccine use viruslike particles vlp generate immune response discussed research awards recognitions career httpsenwikipediaorgwikirutharnon
