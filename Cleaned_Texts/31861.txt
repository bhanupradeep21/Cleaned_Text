dna condensation refers process compacting dna molecules vitro mechanistic details dna packing essential functioning process gene regulation living systems condensed dna often surprising properties one would predict classical concepts dilute solutions therefore dna condensation vitro serves model system many processes physics biochemistry addition dna condensation many potential applications medicine dna diameter nm length stretched single molecule may several dozens centimetres depending organism many features dna double helix contribute large stiffness including mechanical properties sugarphosphate backbone electrostatic repulsion phosphates dna bears average one elementary negative charge per nm double helix stacking interactions bases individual strand strandstrand interactions dna one stiffest natural polymers yet also one longest molecules persistence length doublestranded dna dsdna measure stiffness flexibility depends dna sequence surrounding environment including factors like salt concentration ph temperature physiological conditions eg nearneutral ph physiological salt concentrations persistence length dsdna generally around nm corresponds approximately base means large distances dna considered flexible rope short scale stiff rod like garden hose unpacked dna would randomly occupy much larger volume orderly packed mathematically noninteracting flexible chain randomly diffusing endtoend distance would scale square root polymer length real polymers dna gives rough estimate important space available dna vivo much smaller space would occupy case free
