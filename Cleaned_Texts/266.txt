progestogen ester ester progestogen progestin synthetic progestogen prototypical progestogen progesterone endogenous sex hormone esterification frequently employed improve pharmacokinetics steroids including oral bioavailability lipophilicity elimination addition intramuscular injection steroid esters often absorbed slowly body allowing less frequent many though steroid esters function prodrugs esterification particularly salient case progesterone progesterone shows poor oral pharmacokinetics thus ineffective taken unmodified elimination halflife minutes almost completely inactivated liver firstpass micronization however allowed progesterone effective orally although oral micronized progesterone developed recent examples important progestogen esters include derivatives medroxyprogesterone acetate megestrol acetate cyproterone acetate hydroxyprogesterone caproate derivative nomegestrol acetate derivatives norethisterone acetate norethisterone enanthate estrogens discovered beginning variety estradiol esters estradiol benzoate estradiol dipropionate introduced clinical testosterone esters testosterone propionate testosterone phenylacetate also introduced around contrast estradiol testosterone progesterone proved difficult fact esterification involves replacement hydroxyl group alkoxy unlike estradiol testosterone progesterone possess hydroxyl actually chemically possible esterify progesterone first progestogen esters introduced esters unlike progesterone hydroxyl group available esterification rather progesterone included caproate delalutin

groups positions reason possible etherify progesterone ethers possible quingestrone enolluteovis progesterone ether specifically ether progesterone marketed italy oral quingestrone variant progesterone improved pharmacokinetics including higher potency oral activity greater lipophilicity longer two progestogens pentagestrone never marketed pentagestrone acetate gestovis gestovister enol ethers acetate respectively progesterone enol ether never marketed enol ether although originally thought progesterone ethers like quingestrone prodrugs progesterone subsequently found case quingestrone instead seems transformed directly corresponding alcohols rather alcohols progesterone metabolites like pregnanolones pregnanediols metabolites instance potent progestogenic activity may
