eisenmenger syndrome eisenmengers syndrome defined process longstanding lefttoright cardiac shunt caused congenital heart defect typically ventricular septal defect atrial septal defect less commonly patent ductus arteriosus causes pulmonary eventual reversal shunt cyanotic righttoleft shunt advent fetal screening echocardiography early life incidence heart defects progressing eisenmenger syndrome

eisenmenger syndrome include one severe common complications eisenmenger syndrome cardiac arrhythmia especially supraventricular arrhythmias approximately patients diagnosed eisenmenger syndrome also found arrhythmias routine ecg screenings arrhythmias worse prognosis patients eisenmenger syndrome compared general population source sudden cardiac number congenital heart defects cause eisenmenger syndrome including atrial septal defects ventricular septal defects patent ductus arteriosus complex types acyanotic heart reason eisenmenger syndrome often presents later life explained alterations normal physiology heart maladaptive responses occur time larger muscular left side heart must generate high pressure required supply blood extensive highresistance systemic circulation contrast smaller right side heart must generate much lower pressure order pass blood lowresistance high compliance circulation lungs lungs able accomplish lowresistance circulation largely due fact length pulmonary circulation smaller much circuitry parallel rather seriescitation needed significant anatomic defect ie hole breach exists two ventral sides heart shunt occur causing blood flow normal pressure gradient left side right side amount blood shunted proportional size defect beattobeat volume blood pumped lefttoright breach percentage anticipated cardiac output co left ventricle clinically low index percentage co ejected shunt harmless high index percentage co ejected lefttoright shunt heralds eisenmengers physiologycitation needed lefttoright shunting blood results abnormally high blood flow pressure directed right heart circulation gradually leading maladaptive changes ultimately result pulmonary hypertension increased rightsided blood volume pressure causes cascade pathologic damage delicate pulmonary capillaries causing incrementally replaced scar tissue scar dead lung tissue contribute oxygen transfer therefore decreasing useful volume pulmonary vasculature scar tissue also provides less flexibility compliance normal lung tissue causing increases pulmonary blood pressure weakened heart must pump harder continue supplying lungs leading damage capillaries maladaptive response onset eisenmenger syndrome damage considered irreversible even underlying heart defect corrected factcitation needed eventually due increased resistance decreased compliance pulmonary vessels elevated pulmonary pressures cause myocardium right heart hypertrophy rvh onset eisenmenger syndrome begins right ventricular hypertrophy causes right heart pressures exceed left heart leading reversal blood flow shunt ie blood moves right side heart left side consequence deoxygenated blood returning body bypasses lungs reversed shunt proceeds directly systemic circulation leading cyanosis resultant organ damagecitation needed defect righttoleft shunt causes reduced oxygen saturation arterial blood due mixing oxygenated blood returning lungs deoxygenated blood returning systemic circulation decreased saturation sensed kidneys resulting compensatory increase erythropoietin production increased production red blood cells attempt increase oxygen delivery bone marrow increases erythropoiesis systemic reticulocyte count risk hyperviscosity syndrome increases reticulocytes less efficient carrying oxygen mature red cells less deformable causing impaired transit capillary beds contributes death pulmonary capillary bedscitation needed person eisenmenger syndrome paradoxically subject possibility uncontrolled bleeding due damaged capillaries high pressure well spontaneous clots due hyperviscosity stasis bloodcitation needed diagnosis eisenmenger syndrome typically conducted via transthoracic echocardiography facilitates identification evaluation shunts anatomical defects ventricular function following diagnosis cases inconclusive diagnosis cardiac catheter may used confirm diagnosis assess patients pulmonary arterial pressure
