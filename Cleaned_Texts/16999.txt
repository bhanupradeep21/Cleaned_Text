positioning theory theory social psychology characterizes interactions individuals position defined alterable collection beliefs individual regards rights duties obligations positioning mechanism roles assigned denied either oneself others theory describes malleable roles storylines determine boundaries future acts meanings people say theory expands upon work psychologist lev vygotsky especially theory zone proximal development zpd emphasizes interdependence positions speech acts storylines arise change one aspect affects two theory provides framework understand persons specific behavior considering social individual moral factors three orders positioning based positions assumed first second thirdorder positioning positioning also classified various types depending specifics situation include self tacit intentional interactive reflexive moral personal indirect malignant positioning positioning theory originated paper titled positioning discursive production selves looked solve problem arose discussion problems inherent use concept role developing social psychology since inception positioning theory developed contributions bronwyn davies rom harré luk van langenhove fathali moghaddam theory provided structure social discourse analysis used study various social situations application extended fields education anthropology communication political science positioning theory provides framework comprehend individuals choose act one specific behavior narrowed set behaviors many possible behaviors positions collection specific beliefs individuals context rights duties obligations open change compared roles fixed constitute basic foundation helping individual determine behave certain way positioning pertains mechanisms roles assigned appropriated also involves forms individuals build others discursive activities oral written expression usage language speech actions based normative moral opportunities people act depend numerous people order perform tasks individuals use cognitive capabilities well capabilities researchers studied narratives used individuals position others studies specifically look positions assumed individuals others based interpretation rights person owed others duties person owes others theory involves conventions speech action changeable questionable contrast role theory roles relatively fixed theory used investigate individual constructs story therein sense self social acts including speech represented story positions rom harré fathali moghaddam suggest positioning theory adds work earlier theorists like lev positioning theory explicitly consistent vygotskian approaches learning teaching applicable educational research emphasis individual social vygotsky theorized positive social support lead individual attaining higher mental vygotskys zone proximal development zpd learner increase performance tasks given support adults collaborating harré moghaddam explain positioning theory fill gap vygotskys work emphasizing variability positions come group might supporting positioning theory highlights individual knowledge participants education contexts role position seem overlap many see positioning another way explaining someones constructs quite different role static position changes depending context davies harré explain difference example role mother general understanding role mother plays someones life missing internalized understanding mother individual person plays role person unique lived experience affects position one may anticipate becoming mother one may never position additionally person could strong poor relationship mother history narratives lived experience determine ones position towards idea mother applied educational contexts looking difference role teacher opposed position diagram used explain social significance positioning acts corners triangle intertwined words one part triangle changes parts change eg changing storyline would affect position harré luk van langenhove explain people function capacities people certain things restrictions imposed upon people certain things intentions people certain harré moghaddam expand upon idea position social individual harré describes position cluster shortterm disputable rights obligations duties person various social rights duties obligations carried characteristics personality traits traditions customs vital sources formation positions sum position establishes individual authorized say socially meaningful action intended movement speech seen act significance jumping example intended action individual may performing action jump object follow physical education instructor exercise model movement another person copy action important identified rules accepted moral social behaviors given meaning context performed appropriate situation instance class physical education meaningful relevant actions example instructor showing jump must come prior action performed jumping student also consequences performed action graded ability one speech act cause another speech act take lead development storylines new positions speech acts occur give meaning accountability speech result speech acts storylines developed social episodes come individual around contribute pattern storylines seen right duty act may act explaining story ones position may result alluding hero whereas another individual may different storyline positions person hence change storyline could alter initial positions involved whilst individuals conversing one another use narratives storylines actions words purposeful significant well social structures seen moral orders set forward rules acceptable behavior speech acts create activate moral orders capacity individuals act independently derived possibilities behave certain moral orders establish new moral orders individual performs action develop personal moral order eg justifying ones behavior one would otherwise deem irresponsible inappropriate personal moral orders sometimes seen stronger moral orders set place people positioning theory brings analysis social situation relates three positioning theory focuses two aspects firstorder positioning refers position individual assumes independent influence secondorder positioning refers changes firstorder positioning interactions others social environment thirdorder positioning individuals outside social environment influenced previous social interactions assume positions based self positioning includes person positions positioning individual positions others codependent order position oneself positions others would need defined vice tacit positioning involved everyday interactions usually first order positioning unintentional nature constitutes inherently learnt internalized time intentional positioning includes positions consciously assumed depending end goal assumed position classified four interactive positioning exhibited person group people position another person based behavior say reflexive positioning positioning oneself response others davies harré use example interaction student principal illustrate concepts student caught wearing hat school principal asks student take student refuses receives twoday suspension principal engaged interactive positioning toward student asked student remove hat positioned rebellious student demonstrated reflexive positioning refused davies harré suggested storylines positions arise specific interactions sometimes carry forward unrelated storylines future instance student may continue positioned rebellious principal future interactions unrelated past moral positioning occurs one behaves accordance rights duties obligations role positions may form professorstudent parentchild grocery clerkcustomer particular role results individual acting responding certain way personal positioning happens based ones individual properties life experiences conform generic expected role instance person studied law might represent court even without law indirect positioning seen use characteristics position individual favorably unfavorably relation oneself ones group desires example could positioning oneself stupid might restrict person correcting cognitive performance pertaining specific tasks beyond certain level could also positioning someone irresponsible could result individual excluded social group taking tasks would require certain level responsibility harré moghaddam use example indirect positioning regard leader nation used position overall nation eg europe using phrase cowboy president reference george w bush also indirectly positioning united states ignorant malignant malevolent positioning discourse individual causes others portray person negative light treat poorly result one may hold critical view person disability example unaware biased positioning theory originated gender studies bronwyn davies professor education university western sydney drew feminist scholars expand upon subjectivity storyline narrative positioning subsequently rom harré luk van langenhove fathali moghaddam contributed development theory early harré van langenhove introduced conceptual refinements theory including differences first secondorder positions moral personal positioning tacit intentional positioning well self theory become framework social discourse analysis used study various social although theory rooted social psychology used fields like communication workplace political identity public relations strategic
