grounding communication concept proposed herbert h clark susan e brennan comprises collection mutual knowledge mutual beliefs mutual assumptions essential communication two successful grounding communication requires parties coordinate content process concept also common philosophy language grounding communication theory described conversation form collaborative grounding communication theory applied mediated communication theory primarily addresses facetoface conversation groups working together ground conversations coming common ground mutual knowledge members utilize knowledge order contribute efficient grounding criterion mutual belief conversational partners everyone involved clear enough understanding concept move clark schaefer found reach state grounding criterion groups use three methods reaching understanding move parties engaging grounding exchange information understand course communication continue clarify concepts agreed grounding criterion generally two phases grounding according theory mere utterance qualifies presentation conversation whereas contribution conversation demands utterance assurance mutual presentation phase become complex meanings embedded repairs made utterances example repair husband car rather messier um husband acceptance phase often clarifies ambiguities grounding acceptance phase completed barbara indicates answer alan accepts valid grounding theory identifies three common types evidence conversation acknowledgements relevant next turn continued acknowledgements refer back channel modes communication affirm validate messages communicated examples include uh huh yeah really head nods act continuers used signal phrase understood conversation move relevant next turn refers initiation invitation respond speakers including verbal nonverbal prompts turntaking conversation questions answers act adjacency first part conversation relevant second part meaning relevant utterance needs made response question order accepted chico revealing understand miss dimples first question corrects phrase realizing chicos utterance wasnt appropriate response continue communicate adjacent pairs continued attention mutual belief addressees correctly identified referent partners involved conversation usually demonstrate eye gaze one capture partners gaze attention beginning utterance attention undisturbed interrupted example positive evidence understanding however one partners turns away looks puzzled signs indicate longer continued attention evidence grounding comes study done dialogue humans robots studied complexity humanrobot dialogue arises difference humans idea robot internalized versus robots actual internal representation real world going grounding process study concluded humanrobot grounding strengthened robot providing information partner internalized information three main factors allow speakers anticipate partner shared visual information also aids anticipation partner knows example responding instruction performing correct action without verbal communication provides indication understanding performing wrong action even failing act signal findings paper using visual information grounding awareness collaborative supports previous experiments show evidence collaborative pairs perform quicker accurately share common view results experiment showed pairs completed task faster given shared visual information value information however depended features task value increased task objects linguistically complex part shared lexicon however even small delay transmission visual information severely disrupted value also ones accepting instructions seen increase spoken contribution giving instructions shared visual information increase activity due fact easier former produce information rather ones giving instruction continuously ask questions anticipate partners understanding phenomenon predicted grounding theory said since communication costs distributed among partners result shift method would efficient pair theory least collaborative effort asserts participants contribution try minimize total effort spent contribution presentation acceptance exact every participant conversation tries minimize total effort spent interactional ideal utterances informative participants conversation refashion referring expressions decrease conversation length interactants trying pick difficult describe shapes set similar items produce agree expression understood accepted process termed following example clark offers conceptualisation refashioned slightly b agreed later repetitions task expression employed reuse agreed conceptualisation progressively became shorter example next one looks like person whos ice skating except theyre sticking two arms front trial gradually shortened next ones ice skater trial eventually became ice skater trial clark wilkesgibbs argue two indicators least collaborative effort example first process refashioning involves less work produce perfect referring expression first time degree effort would needed achieve second decrease length referring expressions concomitant reduction conversation length trials showed participants exploiting increased common ground decrease amount talk needed thus collaborative time pressures errors ignorance problems best remedied mutual understanding thus theory grounding communication dispels theory least collaborative effort instances grounding solution communication lack one characteristics generally forces participants use alternative grounding techniques costs associated grounding change often tradeoff costs one cost increase another decreases also often correlation costs following table highlights several costs change medium communication changes clark brennans theory acknowledges impact medium choice successful grounding according theory computer mediated communication presents potential barriers establishing mutual grounding occurs acknowledgement understanding verbal nonverbal formal informal acknowledgments thus computer mediated communications reduce number channels parties establish clark brennan identify eight constraints mediated communication places communicating parties situation awareness holds visual information helps pairs assess current state task plan future example would friend solving problem know solution could intervene provide hints instructions see friend stuck needs help similarly grounding theory maintains visual information support conversations evidence common ground mutual understanding using example could provide clearer instruction problem see friend stuck therefore extension theories would mean groups timely visual information would able monitor situation clarify instructions common ground communication technique based mutual knowledge well awareness mutual knowledge according barr common ground common knowledge kinds mutual common ground negotiated close gap differences perspective turn would enable different perspectives knowledge psycholinguist herbert h clark uses example day beach son share experiences beach aware mutual knowledge one propose painting room certain shade pink could describe comparing conch shell saw beach make comparison mutual knowledge pink shell well awareness mutual knowledge pink communication technique often found common ground communication critical mitigating misunderstandings negotiations example common ground seen first moon landing apollo mission control since mission control provide assistance instructions crew apollo crew able provide situation context mission control particularly difficult given strict conditions radio system needed function success mission dependent ability provide situation information instructions clearly transcripts show often parties checked ensure party clearly heard say parties needed provide verbal feedback listened constraints difficulties establishing common ground especially using telecommunications technology give rise dispositional rather situational attribution tendency known actorobserver effect means people often attribute behavior situational causes observers attribute actors behavior personality disposition actor example actors common reason late due situational reason traffic observers lack contextual knowledge traffic ie common ground leads attributing lateness due ignorance laziness actors part tendency towards dispositional attribution especially magnified stakes higher situation complex observers relatively calm tendency towards dispositional attribution less another consequence lack mutual understanding disappointment communicating partners fail highlight important points message partner know important points partners message parties never satisfy partners expectations lack common ground damages interpersonal trust especially partners contextual information party behaves way people base decisions contribution based point view lack common ground points views individuals within team misunderstandings occur sometimes misunderstandings remain undetected means decisions would made based ignorant misinformed point views turn lead multiple ignorances team may able find right solution correct representation critiques approaches used explore common ground suggest creation common set mutual knowledge unobservable event hardly accessible empirical research would require omniscient point view order look participants modeling common ground one communication partners perspective model used overcome even difficult distinguish concepts grounding situation distinguishing situation awareness grounding communication provide insights concepts affect collaboration furthering research despite revealing evidence theories exist independently recognizing concepts conversation prove difficult often mechanisms present task example study helpers small field view able see pieces manipulated demonstrates grounding communication however situation awareness also present shared view another criticism common ground inaccurate connotation term name appears relate specific place record things stored however account involved conversation effortlessly understand communication suggestions term common ground revised better reflect people actually come understand grounding communication also described mechanistic style dialogue used make many predictions basic language pickering garrod conducted many studies reveal engaging dialogue production comprehension become closely related process greatly simplifies language processing communication pickering garrods paper toward mechanistic psychology dialogue discuss three points exemplify mechanistic quality language processing another component essential criticism grounding communication successful dialogue coupled well engaged conversation adapt different linguistic levels process allows development communication routines allow process comprehending language
