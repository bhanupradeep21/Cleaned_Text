electromagnetic articulography ema method measuring position parts mouth ema uses sensor coils placed tongue parts mouth measure position movement time speech swallowing induction coils around head produce electromagnetic field creates induces current sensors mouth current induced inversely proportional cube distance computer able analyse current produced determine sensor coils location space ema used linguistics speech pathology study articulation medicine study oropharyngeal dysphagia methods used study articulation ingestion tradeoffs kind amount data available palatography allows study articulations make contact palate lingual consonants unlike ema palatographs provide data sounds make contact vowels fluoroscopy xray microbeam allow investigation noncontact movements mouth like ema
