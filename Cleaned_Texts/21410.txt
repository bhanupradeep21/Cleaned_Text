insecticides pesticides used kill include ovicides larvicides used insect eggs larvae respectively insecticides used agriculture medicine industry consumers insecticides claimed major factor behind increase agricultural nearly insecticides potential significantly alter ecosystems many toxic humans andor animals become concentrated spread along food chain insecticides classified two major groups systemic insecticides travel though plant uptake contact insecticides mode action describes pesticide kills inactivates pest provides another way classifying insecticides mode action important understanding whether insecticide toxic unrelated species fish birds mammals insecticides may repellent nonrepellent social insects ants detect nonrepellents readily crawl return nest take insecticide transfer nestmates time eliminates ants including queen slower methods usually completely eradicates ant insecticides distinct noninsecticidal repellents repel kill systemic insecticides uptake distributed systemically throughout whole plant insects feed plant ingest insecticide systemic insecticides produced transgenic plants called plantincorporated protectants pips instance gene codes specific bacillus thuringiensis biocidal protein introduced corn maize species plant manufactures protein kills insect contact insecticides toxic insects upon direct contact inorganic insecticides metals include commonly used sulfur less commonly used arsenates copper fluorine compounds contact insecticides also organic insecticides ie organic chemical compounds synthetically produced comprising largest numbers pesticides used today natural compounds like pyrethrum neem oil etc efficacy related quality pesticide application small droplets aerosols often improving best known organochloride ddt created swiss scientist paul m√ºller discovery awarded nobel prize physiology ddt introduced functions opening sodium channels insects nerve contemporaneous rise chemical industry facilitated largescale production chlorinated hydrocarbons including various cyclodiene hexachlorocyclohexane compounds organophosphates another large class contact insecticides also target insects

firstly common chemicals losing effectiveness secondly due toxic effects upon many organic compounds already produced plants purpose defending host plant predation turned toward human ends four
