skeletonization state dead organism undergoing skeletonization refers final stage decomposition last vestiges soft tissues corpse carcass decayed dried point skeleton exposed end skeletonization process soft tissue eliminated leaving disarticulated temperate climate usually requires three weeks several years body completely decompose skeleton depending factors temperature humidity presence
