adolescence scfes usually cause groin pain affected side sometimes cause knee thigh pain one five cases involves hips resulting pain sides body scfes occurs slightly commonly adolescent males especially young black males although also affects females whilst occur child major risk factor childhood symptoms include gradual progressive onset thigh knee pain painful limp hip motion limited particularly internal rotation running strenuous activity legs also cause hips abnormally move due condition potentially worsen pain stretching limited usually scfe causes groin pain may cause pain
