sauropelta ˌsɔːroʊˈpɛltə sorohpeltə meaning lizard shield genus nodosaurid dinosaur existed early cretaceous period north america one species edwardsorum named although others may existed anatomically sauropelta one wellunderstood nodosaurids fossilized remains recovered us states wyoming montana possibly utah also earliest known genus nodosaurid remains found section cloverly formation dated million years ago mediumsized nodosaurid measuring metres ft long sauropelta distinctively long tail made half body length although body smaller modern black rhinoceros sauropelta mass weighing metric tons short tons extra weight largely due extensive covering bony armor including characteristically large spines projecting neck sauropelta heavily built quadrupedal herbivore body length approximately metres ft body mass short skull triangular viewed rear end wider tapering snout one skull measured centimeters width widest point behind unlike nodosaurids roof skull characteristically flat domed roof skull thick covered flat bony plates tightly fused appear sutures boundaries like ones seen panoplosaurus pawpawsaurus silvisaurus many ankylosaurs could also artifact preservation preparation ankylosaurs thick triangular scutes projected postorbital bone behind eyes well jugal bone behind typically nodosaurids leafshaped teeth lined upper lower jaws used cutting plant material front end skull unknown would sharp bony ridge tomium end upper lower jaws seen ankylosaurs ridge probably would supported keratinous tail sauropelta characteristically long made nearly half body length one skeleton preserved forty caudal tail vertebrae although missing suggesting true number caudal vertebrae may exceeded fifty ossified tendons stiffened tail along length like ankylosaurs sauropelta wide body broad pelvis ribcage forelimbs shorter hindlimbs resulted arched back highest point hips feet limbs shoulders pelvis stoutly constructed reinforced support great deal like nodosaurids sauropelta covered armor formed bony masses embedded skin osteoderms discovery skeleton body armor preserved situ allowed carpenter scientists accurately describe protection two parallel rows domed scutes ran top neck along anteroposterior axis front back upper surface back tail skin covered small bony nodules ossicles separated larger conical scutes arranged parallel rows along mediolateral axis side side hips ossicles larger domed plates interlocked tightly form structure called sacral shield also found ankylosaurs like polacanthus large pointed spines lined sides neck increasing size towards shoulders decreasing size along side body stopped hips behind hips flat triangular plates lined tail sides pointing laterally outwards decreasing size towards end tail carpenter originally described cervical neck spines caudal plates belonging single row side although recently jim kirkland reconstructed two parallel rows side one upper row cervical spines pointed backwards upwards posterodorsally lower row pointed backwards outwards posterolaterally bases pair cervical spines pair caudal plates fused together greatly restricting mobility neck upper since john ostrom first described sauropelta recognized member family nodosaurids along family ankylosauridae belong within infraorder ankylosauria nodosaurids characterized certain features skull including mandible lower jaw curves downwards end overall nodosaurids narrower snouts ankylosaurids also lacked heavy ankylosaurid tail nodosaurids like ankylosaurids found north america asia europe systematics evolutionary relationships nodosaurids firmly established genera sauropelta silvisaurus pawpawsaurus sometimes considered basal geologically younger nodosaurids like panoplosaurus edmontonia analysis carpenter included former three genera sister clade group containing latter three although found panoplosaurus could belong either clade depending taxa characters early famed dinosaur hunter
