hemipenis pl hemipenes one pair intromittent organs male squamates snakes lizards worm hemipenes usually held inverted within body everted reproduction via erectile tissue much like human penis come variety shapes depending species ornamentation spines hooks hemipenis intromittent organ squamata second largest order vertebrates species distributed around world differ intromittent organs amniotes mammals archosaurs turtles single genital tubercle squamates paired genitalia remaining squamate hemipenes also develop different cell origin originating embryonic cells produce limbs whereas mammalian penises arise embryonic cells develop much debate continues regarding evolutionary origin hemipenes relationship intromittent organs species however embryonic molecular research beginning shed light origin hemipenis theory proposes single unpaired penis ancestral state amniotes trait retained amniotes today look embryonic underpinning hemipenes penises animals suggests fundamental differences developmental stages particularly origin development relative embryonic cloaca specifically hemipenes squamata found develop posterior side paired genitals nonsquamata amniota develop anterior developmentally significant difference suggests two types penises could distinct homologies thought could attributed variance signaling genes embryological hemipenes also used study speciation among squamata especially identifying cryptic diversity understanding taxonomy species one study conducted investigated anole speciation hemipenis variation found anole hemipenial morphology evolved six times faster nongenital morphological studies help researchers understand adaptive radiation recover phylogenetic relationships especially species morphologically similar hemipenes examined living snake lizard gently squeezing tail massaging towards vent cloacal opening underside tail cause hemipenis evert body however method also make difficult identify sex dead specimen damaged dry presence hemipenes indicator specimen male absence immediately inferred specimen female juveniles species may appear similar size mature adults possess littledeveloped hemipenes might easily recognizable also possible misinterpret scent gland papillae cloaca female hemipenis also protrude quite large however smaller male hemipenes visible blood vessels though red tip may hemipenes found variety shapes sizes foundationally general structure made two hemipenises tucked tail side side stacking bottom top lobes exhibiting range ornamentation including spicules hooks hemipenes also outer groove called sulcus spermaticus transports sperm outside rather inside organ structurally different human penis sperm travel inside organ vas deferens urethra surface hemipenes one interesting unique features often covered sharp spines spicules organized formations called rosettes however species relatively smooth hemipene surfaces also exist example hemipenis siamese spitting cobra naja siamensis smooth blunt ends manyspotted cateyed snake boiga multomaculata entirely covered hooked spines spicules yet despite assortment hemipenis designs association found design hemipenes disposition danger animal rather believed hemipenes found squamate world exhibit diverse designs facilitate mating compatibility amongst individuals species theory referred lockandkey mechanism citation needed lockandkey mechanism hypothesis idea genital morphology evolved maintain reproductive isolation species ensuring mating occur male female species idea first postulated french entomologist leon dufour observed diversity genital morphology among dipteran thought physiological differences species prevents hybridization genital lockandkey mechanism operate two ways direct prevention copulation insemination due physical incompatibilities sensory lockandkey induce behavioral responses disrupt mating mechanism found across animal kingdom lepidoptera squamata snakes lizards morphological differences reproductive organs believed exist help male copulate female spikes hooks thought assist male fixing hemipenis place mating made specifically compatible female species example species branched hemipenes females branched cloacas species many spikes females thicker cloacal walls compared species males little spines huge variety among reproductive organs squamata interest taxonomists may able shed light evolutionary relationships among function ornamentation hemipenes still explored researchers one study supports theory spines found many hemipenes trait assist longer hence successful reproduction males surgically removing large basal spine redsided garter snake researchers found males still able mate duration mating depth copulation much shorter unaffected control males indicating spines play crucial role males ability mate successfully females responded male hemipenis strong vaginal contractions prevented longer mating test purpose contractions shorten mating time researchers anesthetized female prevent contractions found mating indeed last longer often times female snakes lizards also ability control whether get pregnant immediately mating account fact ideal time mating may translate optimal time ovulation gestation consequently females store sperm long five years possibly phenomenon known cryptic female choice physiological mechanisms making possible hidden within body female ability influence egg fertilization occurs exact mechanism female controls stored sperm fertilize eggs remains unclear believed specialized pockets found reproductive tract play key result female mate multiple males choose fertilize eggs furthermore females also produce offspring feature genetic material multiple males single clutch mated one male product system males guaranteed successfully reproduce bear offspring single mating therefore interest mate many females possible increase chance passing genetic material one hypothesized reason males two penises instead one hemipenis associated one testis one side used mating second hemipenis functions backup ensures mating continue even one side run sperm important distinguish cryptic female choice facultative parthenogenesis form asexual reproduction due females ability get pregnant long contact male difficult distinguish two ambiguous cases circumstances molecular testing techniques used identify whether offspring share genetic makeup mother research area squamata reproductive organs focused male hemipenis recent studies investigated homologous paired structure females dubbed hemiclitoris pl hemiclitorises researchers first investigated females phymaturus liolaemus lizards discovered structure previously undescribed hemiclitoris observed smaller organs consistently observed lizards study specific functions yet identified study brings attention squamata apomorphy likely continue investigated detail study showed snakes also hemiclitorises widely differing among vertebrates penises found variety shapes sizes structures lymphatic erection mechanism ratites single vascular erectile body one similar organs squamata hemipenes however fourheaded penis one primitive mammals world echidnas possess internal testes like squamata similarly alternate usage sides unlike squamata however singular penis fourheaded many marsupials also exhibit bifurcated penises like squamata suggesting feature may passed common diversity among species reproductive morphology proves extremely helpful understanding mating mechanisms specific species
