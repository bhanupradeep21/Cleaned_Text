developmental neurobiology early work showed seasonal changes specific behavioral patterns paralleled pronounced alterations structure brain neurons control laboratory extensively studied behavior weakly electric fish among others investigations led discovery novel behavioral pattern echo part efforts establish brown ghost knifefish apteronotus leptorhynchus powerful model organisms study behavior neural plasticity laboratory performed collaboration group jeffrey n agar department chemistry chemical biology northeastern university de novo assembly annotation proteomics validation central nervous system transcriptome using electric organ discharge weakly electric fish neuroethological model system zupanc team first employ proteomics approach largescale identification proteins involved development sexual dimorphism results research implications beyond study suggesting astrocytes play important role regulation activity neural oscillators including control sexually dimorphic field neuroendocrinology zupanc collaborators succeeded cloning pharmacological characterization first nonmammalian somatostatin neuropeptide laboratory developed novel vitro technique trace neural connections approach led discovery numerous previously unknown connections brain teleost fish since early zupanc research group pioneered study adult neurogenesis generation new neurons adult central nervous system teleosts wife marianne zupanc introduced labeling mitotic cells brdu research adult since method used numerous investigators working area research group performed first complete mapping proliferation zones adult brain vertebrate species associates introduced zebrafish tilapia model systems study adult neurogenesis provide explanation biological function adult neurogenesis formulated matching hypothesis according hypothesis neurogenesis adult central nervous system result continuous generation new muscle fibers sensory receptor cells maintain constant ratio peripheral motor sensory elements one side central elements numerical change periphery prompts corresponding numerical alteration production loss neurons central nervous system team also demonstrated continued generation new neurons adult central nervous system teleost fish closely linked enormous potential taxon regenerate nervous tissue recover behavioral function brain lesions spinal cord employing proteomics approach zupanc associates performed first largescale analysis teleost fish changes global protein expression brain trauma part effort team succeeded identification large number proteins potentially involved regeneration nervous expansion research adult neurogenesis laboratory zupanc discovered first vertebrate organism lacks hallmarks brain senescence common humans mammalian species examined thus contrast latter brown ghost knifefish apteronotus leptorhynchus exhibit significant agerelated decline stemprogenitor cell proliferation neuronal glial differentiation longterm survival newly generated cells availability first vertebrate model negligible senescence provides unprecedented opportunities better understanding biology aging cellular mechanisms protect brains senescing first investigator field adult neurogenesis zupanc laboratory succeeded generating threedimensional highresolution maps adult stem cells progeny well molecular profiles cells spinal work led development novel mapping approach statistical mapping enables researchers produce global maps central nervous system structures cellular resolution integrating big data set collected experimental work zupanc collaborators iulian ilieş rifat sipahi department mechanical industrial engineering northeastern university succeeded building first mathematical model tissue growth spinal model provides important theoretical framework better understanding tissue growth intact regenerating central nervous system collaboration rifat sipahi zupanc also constructed computational models simulate normal tumorous tissue growth using approach team provided theoretical explanation seemingly paradoxical effect lymphoma prostate cancer celldeathinducing chemotherapy sometimes induces tumors instead suppressing characteristic feature research günther zupanc application multidisciplinary approach techniques concepts used investigations taken wide range disciplines including molecular biology cell
