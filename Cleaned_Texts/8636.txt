investigated neither celecoxib drug indicated smallscale clinical trials highrisk people belonging fap families showed celecoxib prevent polyp growth hence largescale randomized clinical trials

established inside patient many studies going determine whether celecoxib might useful latter however molecular studies laboratory became apparent celecoxib could interact intracellular components besides famous target discovery additional targets generated much controversy initial assumption celecoxib reduces tumor growth primarily inhibition became certainly inhibition paramount antiinflammatory analgesic function celecoxib however whether inhibition also plays dominant role drugs anticancer effects unclear example recent study malignant tumor cells showed celecoxib could inhibit growth cells vitro played role outcome even strikingly anticancer effects celecoxib also obtained use cancer cell types even contain karen seibert colleagues published research showing antiangiogenic antitumor activity celecoxib animal additional support idea targets besides important celecoxibs anticancer effects come studies chemically modified versions celecoxib several dozen analogs celecoxib generated small alterations chemical analogs retained inhibitory activity whereas many others however ability compounds kill tumor cells cell culture investigated antitumor potency depend whether respective compound could inhibit showing inhibition required anticancer one compounds entirely lacks ability inhibit actually displayed stronger anticancer activity
