boa blanchardensis also known mariegalante boa extinct species boa island marie galante lesser antilles lived island late pleistocene approximately years ago became extinct unknown reasons estimated length ft largest terrestrial vertebrate island discoveries fossil bones caves suggest may least occasionally hunted bats fossils boa blanchardensis exclusively known three caves mariegalante guadeloupe archipelago three caves consist cadet cave cadet rock shelter blanchard cave later providing vast majority fossil material within caves boa fossils exclusively found older pleistocene sediments absent dating holocene mariegalante snake fossils identified catalogued various studies described new species bochaton bailon following work henderson powell researchers consider boa blanchardensis distinct species like two extant antillean boas rather subspecies boa constrictor mainland south america holotype specimen basisphenoid bone blanchard cave material also includes number skull bones vertebrae ribs thought stem least four individual snakes stored musée edgard species named blanchard cave vast majority fossil material collected bochaton bailon also suggest two vernacular names mariegalante boa english boa de mariegalante bones mariegalante boa show variety traits clearly set apart species boa basipterygoid processes located basisphenoid weakly developed palatine process maxilla triangular extends weakly medially boa blanchardensis well laterally opening foramen superior dental canal bony outgrowth ectopterygoid bone matches postorbital area ectopterygoid pterygoid meet marked prominent depression bone surrounded four lobes anterior posterior dorsal ventral side posterior end ectopterygoid meanwhile shows slight inwards curve two foramen located anterior end pterygoid palatine bone posteromedial process enlarged extends towards side supratemporal bone almost symmetrical exoccipital high occipital crest incurves towards back compound bone possesses short retroarticular process neural spines trunk vertebrae fairly low state neural spine particular unifies mariegalante boa dominican boa clearly separating continental boa based length vertebral centra specimens boa blancharensis may ranged size cm assuming extreme value average estimation error estimated size range inflated cm despite small size morphology vertebrae well paleohistological analysis indicate examined bones belonged animals already slowed growth however appropriate modern comparison could made authors unable rule fact specimens still growing although much slower rate accordingly specimens outside calculated maximum size range could existed regardless whether discovered specimens reflect largest possible size boa blancharensis largest land vertebrate pleistocene comparing larger vertebrae middle trunk region several traits observed seem vary depending age animal centra vertebrae younger individuals notably shorter bone articular processes less constricted prezygapophyses oriented forward postzygapophyses back neural spines even shorter adults joints individual vertebrae wider high following variable features majority fossil remains found mariegalante represent considered adult morphology however modern boa constrictor individuals trunk vertebrae located back body show similar anatomy juvenile specimens means even bones showing adult morphology may necessarily belong immature specimens regardless bochaton bailon able determine size range calculated could entirely explained position vertebrae subsequently although age smaller specimens could determined still discovered smallest bones could belong individuals responsible maximum size majority reptile fossils found cave deposits mariagalante thought transported prey items raptorial birds evidence suggest case remains boa blancharensis since lack obvious signs digestion breakage instead hypothesized snakes entered caves prey predators potentially feeding roosting bats predation bats known mainland boa constrictor well two species currently inhabiting lesser antilles even boids hunting method restricted smaller boa specimens means nature locality unlikely account small size fossils instead considered much likely mariagalante boa true island dwarf whose size restricted lack large terrestrial prey items according boback dwarf boas commonly adopt arboreal lifestyle larger relatives pleistocene island mariagalante notably larger today drier climate hosting much greater diversity bats addition bats boa blancharensis may also fed various native birds however avian fossil record island mostly boa blancharensis found mariagalante species part larger series island boa species found across lesser antilles today surviving species dominican boa st lucia boa found dominica saint lucia respectively however boas previously widespread across island chain besides pleistocene fossils mariagalante holocene remains discovered island antigua north historical records indicate boas present martinique saint vincent century historical reports martinique additionally supported discovery multiple snake vertebrae appear reworked beads native human population however leaves gaps different island populations notably islands guadeloupe archipelago single bone boa known two main islands specifically western island basseterre vertebrae found archaeological site clearly reworked human hands may originated island leaving record genus main guadeloupe archipelago ambiguous discoveries made another vertebrae indetermined species boa discovered holocene sediments smaller island la désirade case likely originated seeing discovered den owl vertebrae may serve additional indicator boas could present main islands pleistocene la désirade basseterre grandeterre formed single although multitude fossil material present pleistocene sediments mariagalante caves material boa blancharensis could recovered younger holocene layers makes mariagalante boa known reptile island become extinct pleistocene reptile previously thought disappeared island colubrid snake however remains later also discovered precolumbian archaeological site pushing extinction holocene possible extinction boa blancharensis tied change climate towards end pleistocene heavily affected native bat diversity may also influenced local bird population however due fact little known pleistocene avifauna island role birds may played extinction snake speculated another possibility boa blancharensis may survived holocene given data early holocene guadeloupe restricted bochaton bailon argue human influence ruled factor later paper bochaton discusses relationship boas people lesser antilles mentioning saladoid taíno people boas generally mythological significance viewed
