vertebrates gallbladder also known cholecyst small hollow organ bile stored concentrated released small intestine humans pearshaped gallbladder lies beneath liver although structure position gallbladder vary significantly among animal species receives stores bile produced liver via common hepatic duct releases via common bile duct duodenum bile helps digestion fats gallbladder affected gallstones formed material dissolved usually cholesterol bilirubin product hemoglobin breakdown may cause significant pain particularly upperright corner abdomen often treated removal gallbladder called cholecystectomy cholecystitis inflammation gallbladder wide range causes including result impaction gallstones infection autoimmune disease gallbladder hollow greyblue organ sits shallow

gallbladders may coexist either separate bladders draining cystic duct sharing common branch drains cystic duct additionally gallbladder may fail form gallbladders two lobes separated septum may also exist abnormalities likely affect function generally location gallbladder relation liver may also vary documented variants including gallbladders found left side behind detached suspended liver

hepatic diverticulum go become biliary tree second outpouching known cystic diverticulum eventually develop main functions gallbladder store concentrate bile also called gall needed digestion fats food produced liver bile flows small vessels larger hepatic ducts ultimately cystic duct parts biliary tree gallbladder stored one time millilitres us fl oz bile stored within food containing fat enters digestive tract stimulates secretion cholecystokinin cck cells duodenum jejunum response cholecystokinin gallbladder rhythmically contracts releases contents common bile duct eventually draining duodenum bile emulsifies fats partly digested food thereby assisting absorption bile consists primarily water bile salts also acts means eliminating bilirubin product hemoglobin metabolism bile secreted liver stored gallbladder bile secreted gallbladder gallbladder storage bile concentrated removal water electrolytes active transport sodium chloride across epithelium gallbladder creates osmotic pressure also causes water electrolytes function gallbladder appears protection carcinogenesis indicated observations removal gallbladder cholecystectomy increases subsequent cancer risk instance systematic review meta analysis eighteen studies concluded cholecystecomy harmful effect risk rightsided colon another recent study reported significantly increased total cancer risk including increased risk several different types cancer gallstones form bile saturated usually either cholesterol gallstones cause symptoms stones either remaining gallbladder passed along biliary symptoms occur severe colicky pain upper right part abdomen often stone blocks gallbladder inflammation known cholecystitis may result stone lodges biliary system jaundice may occur stone blocks pancreatic duct pancreatitis may gallstones diagnosed using symptomatic gallstone occurs often managed waiting passed given likelihood recurrent gallstones surgery remove gallbladder often medication ursodeoxycholic acid may used lithotripsy noninvasive mechanical procedure used break stones may also known cholecystitis inflammation gallbladder commonly caused obstruction duct gallstones known cholelithiasis blocked bile accumulates pressure gallbladder wall may lead release substances cause inflammation phospholipase also risk bacterial infection inflamed gallbladder likely cause sharp localised pain fever tenderness upper right corner abdomen may positive murphys sign cholecystitis often managed rest antibiotics particularly cephalosporins severe cases metronidazole additionally gallbladder may need removed surgically inflammation progressed far cholecystectomy procedure gallbladder removed may removed recurrent gallstones considered elective procedure cholecystectomy may open procedure laparoscopic one surgery gallbladder removed neck bile drain directly liver biliary tree percent patients may experience degree indigestion following procedure although severe complications much percent surgeries lead chronic condition postcholecystectomy biliary injury bile duct injury traumatic damage bile ducts commonly iatrogenic complication cholecystectomy surgical removal gall bladder also caused operations major trauma risk biliary injury laparoscopic cholecystectomy open cholecystectomy biliary injury may lead several complications may even cause death diagnosed time managed properly ideally biliary injury managed center facilities expertise endoscopy radiology biloma collection bile within abdominal cavity happens bile leak example surgery removing

glands lining surface gallbladder gallstones thought linked formation cancer risk factors include large cm gallbladder polyps highly calcified porcelain cancer gallbladder cause attacks biliary pain yellowing skin jaundice weight loss large gallbladder may able felt abdomen liver function tests may elevated particularly involving ggt alp ultrasound ct scans considered medical imaging investigations cancer gallbladder managed removing gallbladder however prognosis remains cancer gallbladder may also found incidentally surgical removal gallbladder cancers identified way gallbladder polyps mostly benign growths lesions resembling growths form gallbladder associated cancer larger size cholesterol polyps often associated cholesterolosis strawberry gallbladder change gallbladder wall due excess often cause symptoms thus often detected tests used investigate gallbladder disease include blood tests medical imaging full blood count may reveal increased white cell count suggestive inflammation infection tests bilirubin liver function tests may reveal inflammation linked biliary tree gallbladder whether associated inflammation liver lipase amylase may elevated pancreatitis bilirubin may rise obstruction flow bile ca level may taken investigate ultrasound often first medical imaging test performed gallbladder disease gallstones abdominal xray ct scan another form imaging may used examine gallbladder surrounding imaging options include mrcp magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ercp percutaneous intraoperative cholescintigraphy scan nuclear imaging
