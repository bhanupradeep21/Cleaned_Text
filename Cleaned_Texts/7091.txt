neuromeres morphologically molecularly defined transient segments early developing brain rhombomeres segments make rhombencephalon hindbrain controversially argue exist early developmental segments give rise structures midbrain mesomeres forebrain prosomeres neuromeres segments neural tube establish embryonic brain divided carrying different unique genetic traits expressing different features development neuromeres first discovered beginning although researchers long since recognized different signs differentiation embryonic development widely thought neuromeres held relation structure nervous swedish neuroembyrologists bergquist kallen clarified role neuromeres conducting several studies showing neuromeres important development nervous experiments consisted studying brains different vertebrates development period embryonic development neural crest cells neuromere prompt development nerves arteries helping support development craniofacial tissues gene expression goes wrong severe effects developing embryo causing abnormalities like craniofacial clefts also known cleft anatomical boundaries neuromers determined expression unique genes known hox genes particular zone hox genes contain homeobox encodes particular portion hox proteins called homeodomain homeodomain bind portions dna regulate gene expression genes determine basic structure orientation organism embryonic segments neural crest cells found outside given neuromere express proteins cells found inside neural genes expressed fall two categories extracellular signaling proteins intracellular transcription genes able perform different tasks different times depending environment may changing well activated expressed neural crest first discovered wilhelm studying embryo first named zwischenstrang literally translated mean intermediate cord name neural crest develops neural folds embryonic neural plate folds forming neural crest neural crest cells eventually become portions peripheral nervous system development neural tube considered precursore spinal cord rest nervous system eventually becoming central nervous system central nervous system divided three classes neuromeres prosomeres mesomeres forebrain forms six prosomers divided two categories dorsal ventral telencephalon forms dorsal parts becomes olfactory system coincide visual system mesomeres become midbrain contains superior inferior colliculi rhombomeres numbered construct hindbrain myelencephalon made rhombomeres also form medulla rhombomeres also associated neural crest supplies pharyngeal arches set visible tissues line developing brain give rise head neck spinal segments part spinal cord ventral dorsal roots exit form specific pair spinal nerves spinal cord segmented made segments spinal nerves leave deferent segments exists human spinal cord cervical nerves exit segment note creates nerves segments corresponding cervical vertebra nerves exit nerves exit nerves exit originally development two segments fuse nerves case exit coccyx spinal cord main pathway information connecting brain peripheral nervous system length spinal cord much shorter length bony spinal column human spinal cord extends foramen magnum continues conus medullaris near second lumbar vertebra terminating fibrous extension known filum terminale cm long men around cm women ovoidshaped enlarged cervical lumbar regions cervical enlargement located spinal segments sensory input comes motor output goes arms lumbar enlargement located spinal segments handles sensory input motor output coming going legs spinal cord protected three layers tissue called spinal meninges surround canal dura mater outermost layer forms tough protective coating dura mater surrounding bone vertebrae space called epidural space epidural space filled adipose tissue contains network blood vessels arachnoid mater middle protective layer name comes fact tissue spiderweblike appearance space arachnoid underlying pia mater called subarachnoid space subarachnoid space contains cerebrospinal fluid csf medical procedure known lumbar puncture spinal tap involves use needle withdraw cerebrospinal fluid subarachnoid space usually lumbar region spine pia mater innermost protective layer delicate tightly associated surface spinal cord cord stabilized within dura mater connecting denticulate ligaments extend enveloping pia mater laterally dorsal ventral roots dural sac ends vertebral level second sacral vertebra crosssection peripheral region cord contains neuronal white matter tracts containing sensory motor neurons internal peripheral region gray butterflyshaped central region made nerve cell bodies central region surrounds central canal anatomic extension spaces brain known ventricles like ventricles contains cerebrospinal fluid spinal cord shape compressed dorsoventrally giving elliptical shape cord grooves dorsal ventral sides posterior median sulcus groove dorsal side anterior median fissure groove ventral side upper part vertebral column spinal nerves exit directly spinal cord whereas lower part vertebral column nerves pass column exiting terminal portion spinal cord called conus medullaris pia mater continues extension called filum terminale anchors spinal cord coccyx cauda equina horse tail name collection nerves vertebral column continue travel vertebral column conus medullaris cauda equina forms result fact spinal cord stops growing length age four even though vertebral column continues lengthen adulthood results fact sacral spinal nerves actually originate upper lumbar region spinal cord anatomically divided spinal segments based origins spinal nerves segment spinal cord associated pair ganglia called dorsal root ganglia situated outside spinal cord ganglia contain cell bodies sensory neurons axons sensory neurons travel spinal cord via dorsal roots ventral roots consist axons motor neurons bring information periphery cell bodies within cns dorsal roots ventral roots come together exit intervertebral foramina become spinal nerves gray matter center cord shaped like butterfly consists cell bodies interneurons motor neurons also consists neuroglia cells unmyelinated axons projections gray matter wings called horns together gray horns gray commissure form gray h white matter located outside gray matter consists almost totally myelinated motor sensory axons columns white matter carry information either spinal cord within cns nerve cell bodies generally organized functional clusters called nuclei axons within cns grouped tracts spinal cord nerve segments human spinal cord cervical segments forming pairs cervical nerves spinal nerves exit spinal column occiput vertebra nerves exit posterior arch vertebra lamina vertebra spinal nerves ivf corresponding cervica vertebra exception pair exit via ivf vertebra thoracic segments forming pairs thoracic nerves exit spinal column ivf corresponding vertebra lumbar segments forming pairs lumbar nerves exit spinal column ivf corresponding vertebra sacral segments forming pairs sacral nerves exit spinal column ivf corresponding vertebra coccygeal segments joined becoming single segment forming pair coccygeal nerves exit spinal column sacral hiatus fetus vertebral segments correspond spinal cord segments however vertebral column grows longer spinal cord spinal cord segments correspond vertebral segments adult particularly lower spinal cord example lumbar sacral spinal cord segments found vertebral levels spinal cord ends around vertebral level forming structure known conus medullaris although spinal cord cell bodies end around vertebral level spinal nerves segment exit level corresponding vertebra nerves lower spinal cord means exit vertebral column much lower caudally roots nerves travel respective roots point exit vertebral column nerves lower spinal segments form bundle called cauda equina two regions spinal cord enlarges cervical enlargement corresponds roughly brachial plexus nerves innervate upper limb includes spinal cord segments vertebral levels enlargement roughly lumbosacral enlargement corresponds lumbosacral plexus nerves innervate lower limb comprises spinal cord segments found vertebral levels spinal cord made part neural tube development neural tube begins develop notochord begins secrete factor known sonic hedgehog shh result floor
