whipples disease rare systemic infectious disease caused bacterium tropheryma whipplei first described george hoyt whipple commonly considered gastrointestinal disorder whipples disease primarily causes malabsorption may affect part human body including heart brain joints skin lungs weight loss diarrhea joint pain arthritis common presenting symptoms presentation highly variable certain individuals patients standard signs whipples disease significantly common men patients diagnosed recognized treated whipples disease usually cured longterm antibiotic therapy disease left undiagnosed untreated ultimately fatalcitation needed common symptoms diarrhea abdominal pain weight loss joint painsthe joint pains may due migratory nondeforming arthritis may occur many years digestivetract symptoms develop tend involve large joints occur pattern tend damage joint surface point joint becomes deformed fever chills occur small proportion advanced form malabsorption insufficient absorption nutrients diet leads wasting enlargement lymph nodes abdomen neurological symptoms discussed common severe form abdominal disease chronic malabsorptive diarrhea leads poor absorption fat causing steatorrhea fatty offensivesmelling stool flatulence abdominal distension proteinlosing enteropathy may also occur causing depletion albumin blood protein may lead peripheral edema caused lowered oncotic hyperpigmentation skin occurs almost half also skin nodules various eye problems uveitis may occur typically associated deteriorating vision pain affected eye endocarditis infection heart valve reported small number cases sometimes people symptoms whipples disease typically noticed breathlessness leg swelling due fluid accumulation heart unable pump fluid affected whipples disease problems related involvement brain symptoms relate part brain affected common problems dementia memory loss confusion decreased level consciousness eyemovement disturbances myorhythmia rapidly repetitive movements muscles face together referred oculomasticatory myorhythmia highly characteristic whipples disease weakness poor coordination part body headaches seizures number uncommon neurological features present whipplei one actinomycetes distant relative mycobacterium avium complex explaining part whipples disease similar diseases caused mac disease common farmers exposed soil animals suggesting infection acquired individuals susceptible disease decreased ability perform intracellular degradation ingested pathogens particles particularly within macrophages several studies indicate defective tlymphocyte particularly population function may important predisposing factor particular circulating cells also known integrin alpha expressive reduced susceptible individuals vital role activation macrophages destroy intracellularly ingested whipplei common clinical signs symptoms whipples disease include diarrhea steatorrhea abdominal pain weight loss migratory arthropathy fever neurological weight loss diarrhea common symptoms lead identification process may preceded chronic unexplained relapsing episodes nondestructive seronegative arthritis often large endoscopy duodenum jejunum reveal pale yellow shaggy mucosa erythematous eroded patches patients classic intestinal whipples disease small bowel xrays may show thickened folds pathological findings may include enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes hypercellularity lamina propria foamy macrophages concurrent decreased number lymphocytes plasma cells per high power field view biopsycitation needed diagnosis made biopsy usually duodenal endoscopy reveals paspositive macrophages lamina propria containing nonacidfast grampositive immunohistochemical staining antibodies whipplei used detect organism variety tissues polymerase chain reactionbased assay also confirmatory performed blood vitreous fluid synovial fluid heart valves cerebrospinal pcr saliva gastric intestinal fluid stool specimens highly sensitive specific enough indicating healthy individuals also harbor causative bacterium without manifestation whipples disease negative pcr likely indicative healthy treatment penicillin ampicillin tetracycline cotrimoxazole one two treatment lasting less year relapse rate around needed expert opinion whipples disease treated doxycycline hydroxychloroquine hydroxychloroquine increases antibiotic bactericides activity replication bacteria acidic vacuoles macrophages increasing macrophage intraphagosomal sulfonamides sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole may added treatment neurological disease regarded extremely rare incidence new number cases per year one case per million people patients predominantly male survey american patients although countries rate women receiving diagnosis whipples disease increased recent years occurs predominantly caucasian ethnicity suggesting genetic predisposition whipplei appears environmental organism commonly present gastrointestinal tract remains several lines evidence suggest immunity required become possible immunological defect may specific whipplei since disease associated substantially increased risk disease usually diagnosed middle age median years studies germany shown age diagnosis rising since whipple described disease paper nowdefunct bulletin johns hopkins hospital patient medical missionary whipple referred disease intestinal long presumed infectious disease causative organism fully identified doctors johns hopkins hospital together french microbiologist didier raoult applied novel
