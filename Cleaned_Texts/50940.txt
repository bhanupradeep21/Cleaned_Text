persuasive technology broadly defined technology designed change attitudes behaviors users persuasion social influence necessarily technologies regularly used sales diplomacy politics religion military training public health management may potentially used area humanhuman humancomputer interaction selfidentified persuasive technology research focuses interactive computational technologies including desktop computers internet services video games mobile incorporates builds results theories methods experimental psychology humancomputer interaction design persuasive technologies seen particular case design persuasive technologies categorized functional roles b j fogg proposes functional triad classification three basic ways people view respond computing technologies persuasive technologies function tools media social actors one persuasive technologies also categorized whether change attitude behaviors direct interaction mediating persuade example humancomputer interaction hci computermediated communication cmc examples already mentioned former many latter communication technologies persuade amplify persuasion others transforming social providing shared feedback restructuring communication persuasion design design messages analyzing evaluating content using established psychological research theories methods andrew argues persuasive web sites focus making users feel comfortable making decisions helping act decisions clinical encounter clinical decision support tools cdst widely applied improve patients satisfaction towards medical decisionmaking shared comfort user feels generally registered subconsciously previous research also utilized social motivators like competition persuasion connecting user hisher friends persuasive application apply social motivators user promote behavior changes social media facebook twitter also facilitate development systems demonstrated social impact result greater behavior changes case user halko kientz made extensive search literature persuasive strategies methods used field psychology modify healthrelated search concluded eight main types persuasive strategies grouped following four categories category two complementary approaches persuades technology user authoritative agent example strict personal trainer instructs user perform task meet goalcitation needed persuades user neutral agent example friend encourages user meet goals another example instruction style customer reviews mix positive negative reviews together give neutral perspective product persuades user notion cooperating teamwork allowing user team friends complete goalscitation needed persuades user notion competing example users play friends peers motivated achieve goal winning competitioncitation needed persuades user external motivators example winning trophy reward completing taskcitation needed persuades user internal motivators good feeling user would healthy achieving goalcitation needed worth noting intrinsic motivators subject overjustification effect states intrinsic motivators associated reward remove reward intrinsic motivation tends diminish depending reward seen become linked extrinsic motivations instead intrinsic motivations badges prizes award systems increase intrinsic motivation seen reflecting competence merit lepper et al conducted foundational study underscored overjustification team brought magic markers preschool created three test groups children intrinsically motivated first group informed used markers could receive good player award second group incentivized use magic markers reward given reward playing third group given expectations awards received awards week later students played markers without reward students receiving good player award originally showed half much interest began study later psychologists repeated experiment conclude rewards create shortterm motivation undermine intrinsic motivation persuades user removing unpleasant stimulus example brown dying nature scene might turn green healthy user practises healthy behaviorscitation needed persuades user adding positive stimulus example adding flowers butterflies nicelooking elements empty nature scene user practises healthy behaviorscitation needed recently lieto also shown arguments reducible logical fallacies class widely adopted persuasive techniques web mobile technologies techniques also shown efficacy largescale studies persuasive news well field humanrobot report rand corporation shows use logical fallacies one rhetorical strategies used russia agents influence online discourse spread subversive information europe one feature distinguishes persuasion technology familiar forms persuasion individual persuaded often respond kind lack reciprocal equality example conversational agent persuades user using social influence strategies user also use similar strategies persuasive technologies found many domains considerable recent attention focused behavior change health domains digital health coaching utilization computers persuasive technology augment personal care delivered patients used numerous medical numerous scientific studies show online health behaviour change interventions influence users behaviours moreover effective interventions modelled health coaching users asked set goals educated consequences behaviour encouraged track progress toward goals sophisticated systems even adapt users relapse helping get back maintaining behavior change long term one challenges behavior change interventions instance reported chronic illness treatment regimens nonadherence rate high common strategies shown previous research increase longterm adherence treatment include extended care skills training social support treatment tailoring selfmonitoring multicomponent stages however even though strategies demonstrated effective also existing barriers implementation programs limited time resources well patient factors embarrassment disclosing health make behavior change strategies effective researchers also adapting wellknown empirically tested behavior change theories practice prominent behavior change theories implemented various healthrelated behavior change research selfdetermination theory theory planned behavior social cognitive theory transtheoretical model social ecological model behavior change theory analyses behavior change different ways consider different factors less important research suggested interventions based behavior change theories tend yield better result interventions employ theories effectiveness vary social cognitive theory proposed bandura incorporates wellknown construct selfefficacy widely used method behavior change interventions well effective maintaining longterm behavior even though healthcare discipline produced plethora empirical behavior change research scientific disciplines also adapting theories induce behavior change instance behavior change theories also used sustainability saving lifestyle helping people drinking research shown theories already effectively proven useful healthcare equally powerful fields promote behavior changecitation needed interestingly studies showed unique insights behavior change complex chain events study chudzynski et al showed reinforcement schedule little effect maintaining behavior point made study wemyss et al even though people maintained behavior change short term might revert baseline perception behavior change could different still believe maintained behavior change even factually therefore possible selfreport measures would always effective way evaluating effectiveness interventioncitation needed previous work also shown people receptive change behaviors sustainable lifestyles result encouraged researchers develop persuasive technologies promote example green less etc one common technique facilitate peoples awareness benefits performing ecofriendly behaviors example review twenty studies exploring effects feedback electricity consumption home showed feedback electricity consumption pattern typically result besides environmental benefits savings health benefit cost also often used promote ecofriendly despite promising results existing persuasive technologies three main challenges remain present persuasive technologies developed relies selfreport automated systems monitor human behavior using sensors pattern recognition algorithms several studies medical field noted selfreport subject bias recall errors low adherence rates physical world human behavior highly complex ambiguous utilizing sensors machine learning algorithms monitor predict human behavior remains challenging problem especially persuasive technologies require justintime intervention general understanding behavioral changes require longterm studies multiple internal external factors influence changes personality type age income willingness change becomes difficult understand measure effect persuasive technologies furthermore metaanalyses effectiveness persuasive technologies shown behavior change evidence collected far least controversial since rarely obtained randomized controlled trials gold standard causal inference analysis particular due relevant practical challenges perform strict abovementioned empirical trials lifestyles rely voluntary selfselected participants participants systematically adopting desired behaviors already entering trial selfselection biases would occur presence biases would weaken behavior change effects found trials analyses aimed identifying presence extent selfselection biases persuasive technology trials widespread yet study cellina et al appbased behavior change trial mobility field found evidence selfselection however evidence needs collected different contexts different persuasive technologies order generalize confute findingscitation needed question manipulating feelings desires persuasive technology remains open ethical debate usercentered design guidelines developed encouraging ethically morally responsible designs provide reasonable balance pros cons persuasive addition encouraging ethically morally responsible designs fogg believes education journal articles writes panacea concerns ethical challenges persuasive fogg notes two fundamental distinctions regarding importance education engaging ethics technology first increased knowledge persuasive computers allows people opportunity adopt technologies enhance lives choose second knowledge persuasive computers helps people recognize technologies using tactics persuade another ethical challenge persuasive technology designers risk triggering persuasive backfires technology triggers bad behavior designed subjects overlap features
