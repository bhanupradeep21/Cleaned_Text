developmentallymeaningful age groups years working human behavior older children published lecture notes subject arnold gesell creator maturational theory development gesell said development occurs due biological hereditary features genetics children reach developmental milestones ready predictable theory development devised developmental scale used today called gesell developmental schedule gds provides parents teachers doctors pertinent people overview infant child falls developmental spectrum erik erikson neofreudian focused children develop personality identity although contemporary freud larger focus social experiences occur across lifespan opposed childhood exclusively contribute personality identity emerge framework uses eight systematic stages children must pass urie bronfenbrenner devised ecological systems theory identifies various levels childs primary focus theory focuses quality context childs environment bronfenbrenner suggested child grows older interaction various levels environment grows complex due cognitive abilities expanding lawrence kohlberg wrote theory stages moral development extended piagets findings cognitive development showed continue lifespan kohlbergs

also aspect vygotsky jean piaget first psychologist philosopher brand type study cognitive researchers multiple disciplines studied development children piaget often credited first one make systematic study cognitive development gave name main contribution stage theory child cognitive development also published observational studies cognition children created series simple tests reveal different cognitive abilities children piaget believed people move stages development allow think new complex ways first stage piagets stages cognitive development sensorimotor stage stage lasts birth two years old stage behaviors lack sense thought logic behaviors gradually move acting upon inherited reflexes interacting environment goal mind able represent external world end sensorimotor stage broken six substages explain gradual development infants birth age child gains ability mentally represent reality child begins transition preoperational stage child born inherited reflexes use gain knowledge understanding environment examples reflexes include grasping months age children repeat behaviors happen unexpectedly reflexes example childs finger comes contact mouth child starts sucking sensation pleasurable child child attempt recreate infants use initial reflexes grasping sucking explore environment create schemas schemas groups similar actions thoughts used repeatedly response child begins create schemas use accommodation assimilation become progressively adapted assimilation child responds new event way consistent existing schema example infant may assimilate new teddy bear putting things mouth scheme use reflexes make teddy bear go accommodation child either modifies existing schema forms entirely new schema deal new object event example infant may open mouth wider usual accommodate teddy bears months age child experience external stimulus find pleasurable try recreate experience example child accidentally hits mobile crib likes watch spin stops child begins grab object make spin stage habits formed general schemas infant created yet childs point view differentiation means children also focus multiple tasks focus task child may create habit spinning mobile crib still trying find methods reach mobile order get spin way find pleasurable another distraction say parent walks room baby longer focus mobile toys given infants respond childs actions help foster investigative example toy plays song push one button picture pops push another button months old behaviors displayed reason rather chance begin understand one action cause also begin understand object permanence realization objects continue exist removed view example baby wants rattle blanket way baby moves blanket get rattle infant understand object still exists differentiate object experience object according psychologist david elkind internal representation absent object earliest manifestation symbolic function develops gradually second year life whose activities dominate next stage mental months old actions occur deliberately variation example baby drums pot wooden spoon drums floor months age children begin build mental symbols start participate pretend play example child mixing ingredients together spoon pretend use one use another object replace symbolic thought representation objects events mental entities symbols helps foster cognitive development formation according piaget infant begins act upon intelligence rather habit point end product established infant pursued appropriate means means formed schemas known child starting learn use learned first two years develop explore environment preoperational stage lasts years age characterized two somewhat different ways early work developed structuralist theory cognition piaget described childs thoughts period governed principles egocentrism animism similar constructs egocentrism child see certain situation way one comprehend people views perceptions scenarios animism individual gives lifeless object humanlike qualities individual usually believes object human emotions thoughts intentions proposed structuralist theory piaget characterized preoperational child lacking cognitive structures possessed concrete operational child absence structures explains part behaviors piaget previously described egocentric animistic example inability comprehend another individual may different emotional responses similar stage children also become increasingly adept using symbols evidenced increase playing pretending lasts years stage childs cognitive structures characterized reality piaget argues general principles discerned wide range behaviors one bestknown achievements stage conservation typical conservation experiment child asked judge whether two quantities two equal quantities liquid short tall glass preoperational child typically judge taller thinner glass contain concrete operational child judge amounts still ability reason way reflects development principle stage lasts adulthood people advancing logical reasoning concrete examples abstract examples need concrete examples longer necessary abstract thinking used instead stage adolescents also able view future picture ideal life would like pursue theorists believe formal operational stage divided two subcategories early formal operational late formal operation thought early formal operational thoughts may fantasies adolescents advance late formal operational thought life experiences encountered changes fantasy thoughts realistic many piagets claims fallen favor example claimed young children conserve numbers however experiments showed children really understand asked experiment done candies children asked set want rather tell adult show confusion group items piaget argues child conserve numbers understand onetoone piagets theory cognitive development ends formal operational stage usually developed early adulthood take account later stages adult cognitive development described example harvard university professor robert additionally piaget largely ignores effects social cultural upbringing stages development examined children western societies matters certain societies cultures different early childhood experiences example individuals nomadic tribes struggle number counting object counting certain cultures specific activities events common younger age affect aspects object permeance
