trichinella spiralis nematode parasite occurring rodents pigs bears hyenas humans responsible disease trichinosis sometimes referred pork worm due typically encountered undercooked pork products confused distantly related pork tapeworm trichinella species smallest nematode parasite humans unusual life cycle one widespread clinically important parasites small adult worms mature small intestine definitive host pig adult female produces batches live larvae bore intestinal wall enters blood feed lymphatic system carried striated muscle muscle encyst become enclosed capsule humans become infected eating infected pork horsemeat wild carnivores fox cat hyena males spiralis measure mm long flat anteriorly posteriorly anus found terminal end large copulatory pseudobursa females spiralis twice size males anus found terminally vulva located near esophagus single uterus female filled developing eggs posterior portion anterior portion contains fully developed trichinella spiralis live majority adult life intestines humans begin life cycle spiralis adults invade intestinal wall pig produce larvae invade pigs muscles larval forms encapsulated small cystic structure within muscle cell infected host another animal perhaps human eats infected meat larvae released nurse cells meat due stomach ph migrate intestine burrow intestinal mucosa mature juveniles within nurse cells anaerobic facultative anaerobic metabolism become activated adopt aerobic metabolism characteristics female trichinella worms live six weeks time produce larvae spent female dies passes host larvae gain access circulation migrate around body host search muscle cell migration encystment larvae cause fever pain brought host inflammatory response cases accidental migration specific organ tissues cause

symptoms may appear hours two days ingestion infected meat migration adult worms intestinal epithelium cause traumatic damage host tissue waste products excrete provoke immunological resulting inflammation cause symptoms nausea vomiting sweating diarrhea five seven days appearance symptoms facial edema fever may occur ten days following ingestion intense muscular pain difficulty breathing weakening pulse blood pressure heart damage various nervous disorders may occur eventually leading death due heart failure respiratory complications kidney malfunction due larval pigs infection usually subclinical large worm burdens fatal muscle biopsy may used trichinosis detection several immunodiagnostic tests also available typically patients treated either mebendazole albendazole efficacy products uncertain symptoms relieved use analgesics pigs elisa testing possible method diagnosis anthelmintics treat prevent trichinella trichinosis trichinellosis disease caused tissuedwelling roundworms species trichinella spiralis united states national trichinellosis surveillance system documented steady decline reported incidence disease median human cases reported annually including trichinellosisrelated deaths incidence us decreased median cases annually reported deaths decrease largely due improved compliance standards regulations commercial pork united states congress passed federal swine health protection act restricting use uncooked garbage feed stock pigs creating voluntary trichinae herd certification trichinae herd certification program voluntary preslaughter pork safety program provides documentation swine management practices minimize trichinella exposure goal program establish system pork production facilities follow good production practices might certified addition reduction trichinella prevalence commercial pork processing methods also contributed dramatic decline human trichinellosis associated pork productscitation needed us code federal regulations usda created guidelines specific cooking temperatures times freezing temperatures times curing methods processed pork products reduce risk human infection trichinella contaminated pork products meeting guidelines designated certified porkcitation needed reported prevalence human infections trichinella spiralis low united states despite nonexistent meat inspection respect trichinella due strict enforcement regulations applying large meat production facilities cases raw undercooked meat game also reported rate infection trichinella spiralis significantly higher people living parts europe asia southeast asia united states however eu nations employ several strategies detecting meat infected trichinella spiralis tests consistently negative trichinellafree designation applied given meat supply rare outbreaks still occur despite rigorous system france italy poland reported outbreaks due eating raw horsemeat time parasite considered endemic japan china korea recently reported first human cases abattoirs diaphragms pigs routinely sampled detect trichinella postslaughter human exposure also preventable educating consumers simple steps taken kill larvae potentially meat bought local supermarket freezing meat average household freezer days consumption kill species trichinella cooking pork products minimum internal temperature kill species best way ensure meat safe reported political economic changes caused increase prevalence incidence rates parasite many former eastern european countries due weakened veterinary control susceptible complicated meat trade industry within european union countries exportation pork outside result european union associated countries implemented trichinella monitoring program pigs horses wild boar wildlife species european commission implemented new regulation control trichinella meat order improve food safety european consumers illegal pork importation places low safety standards allows spread parasite endemic nonendemic illegal importation new food practices dishes including raw meat resulted human trichinosis outbreaks many european countries including denmark germany italy spain united economic cost detecting trichinosis another cost burden rough global cost estimate per pig detect time countries comprising european union million pigs killed slaughterhouses annually leading estimated economic impact testing million per however depending size specific slaughterhouse actual costs could order magnitude smaller ie less per trichinella
