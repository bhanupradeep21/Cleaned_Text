correct spherical second arecibos receiver platform fixed place support greater weight additional reflectors primary support cables static motorised portion three holddown winches compensated thermal antennas could move along rotating arm platform allow limited adjustment although arecibo limited azimuth zenith angle smaller range motion limited viewing objects within third arecibo could receive higher frequencies finite size triangular panels making fasts primary reflector limits accuracy approximate parabola thus shortest wavelength focus arecibos rigid design allowed maintain sharp focus
