rasagiline azilect azipron irreversible inhibitor monoamine used monotherapy treat symptoms early parkinsons disease adjunct therapy advanced racemic form drug invented aspro nicholas early moussa bh youdim identified potential drug parkinsons disease working collaborators technion israel institute technology israel drug company teva pharmaceuticals identified risomer active form teva brought market partnership lundbeck europe eisai us elsewhere approved europe us rasagiline used treat symptoms parkinsons disease alone combination drugs shown efficacy early advanced parkinsons appears especially useful dealing nonmotor symptoms like rasagiline tested pregnant women pregnancy category c fda label contains warnings rasagiline may cause severe hypertension hypotension may make people sleepy may make motor control worse people may cause hallucinations psychoticlike behavior may cause impulse control disorder may increase risk melanoma upon withdrawal may cause high fever side effects drug taken alone include flulike symptoms joint pain depression stomach upset headache dizziness insomnia taken ldopa side effects include increased movement problems accidental injury sudden drops blood pressure joint pain swelling dry mouth rash abnormal dreams digestive problems including vomiting loss appetite weight loss abdominal pain nausea taken parkinsons drugs ldopa side effects include peripheral edema fall joint pain cough people taking meperidine tramadol methadone propoxyphene dextromethorphan st john wort cyclobenzaprine another mao inhibitor take fda drug label carries warning risk serotonin syndrome rasagiline used antidepressants however risk appears low based multicenter retrospective study people looked serotonin syndrome people pd treated rasagiline plus antidepressants rasagiline without antidepressants antidepressants plus parkinsons drugs either rasagiline selegiline cases risk psychosis bizarre behavior rasagiline used dextromethorphan risk nonselective mao inhibition hypertensive crisis rasagiline used mao rasagiline molecularly propargylamine form brought market teva partners mesylate salt designated chemically parkinsons disease characterized death cells produce dopamine neurotransmitter enzyme called monoamine oxidase mao breaks neurotransmitters mao two forms maoa maob maob generally believed break dopamine however recent evidence suggests maoa may mostly entirely responsible dopamine rasagiline prevents breakdown dopamine irreversibly binding maob dopamine therefore available somewhat compensating diminished quantities made brains people selegiline first selective maob inhibitor partly metabolized levomethamphetamine lmethamphetamine one two enantiomers methamphetamine metabolites may contribute selegilines ability inhibit reuptake neurotransmitters dopamine norepinephrine also associated orthostatic hypotension hallucinations rasagiline metabolizes amphetaminelike neuroprotective properties cells animal selective mao type b type factor rasagiline broken via part cytochrome metabolic path liver contraindicated patients hepatic insufficiency use monitored carefully patients taking drugs alter normal effectiveness metabolic prior discovery rasagiline closely related analog called agn first nmethyl necessary agent considered ring cyclized analog pargyline ca twentytimes however nmethyl compound nonselective racemic rasagiline discovered patented aspro nicholas drug candidate treatment moussa b h youdim biochemist involved developing selegiline drug parkinsons collaboration peter reiderer wanted find similar compound would fewer side effects around time moved london haifa join faculty technion noticed rasagiline could potentially called compound agn youdim collaboration scientists technion us national institutes health using compounds developed teva pharmaceuticals published paper authors wrote inspired racemic nature deprenyl greater activity one stereoisomers ldeprenyl became selegiline explore qualities isomers aspro compound found risomer almost activity compound became called mesylate salt risomer hydrochloride salt teva technion filed patent applications racemically pure compound methods make methods use treat parkinsons disorders technion eventually assigned rights teva began development rasagiline phase iii trials entered partnership lundbeck lundbeck agreed share costs obtained joint right market drug teva partnered eisai giving eisai right jointly market drug parkinsons us codevelop comarket drug alzheimers neurological approved european medicines agency parkinsons us rasagiline tested efficacy people multiple system atrophy large randomized placebocontrolled doubleblind diseasemodification trial drug teva conducted clinical trials attempting prove rasagiline treat symptoms diseasemodifying drug actually prevented death dopaminergic neurons characterize parkinsons disease slowed disease progression conducted two clinical trials called tempo adagio try prove fda advisory committee rejected claim saying clinical trial results prove rasagiline neuroprotective main reason one trials lower dose effective slowing progression higher dose made sense light standard doseresponse httpsenwikipediaorgwikirasagiline
