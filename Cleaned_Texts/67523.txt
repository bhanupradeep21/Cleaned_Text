flange tibial ligaments originally described eodromaeus regarded earliest member theropoda theropods include vast majority carnivorous dinosaurs tyrannosaurus allosaurus velociraptor well living dinosaurs birds eodromaeus considered one basal theropod placed outside group neotheropoda contains coelophysoids posttriassic theropods putative theropods found basal herrerasaurids group relatively large early carnivorous dinosaurs unstable relationship discovery eodromaeus also lead scrutiny regarding contemporary early dinosaur eoraptor eoraptor previously regarded theropod martinez et al instead concluded likely represented one basal sauropodomorphs group includes animals like still small amount debate position eoraptor studies reclaiming theropod alongside studies since continued place eodromaeus basal theropod akin results martinez et al disagreements many subsequent studies consider eodromaeus lie crownward ie advanced relative tawa andor also reject notion herrerasaurids
