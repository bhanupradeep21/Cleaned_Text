another option children cranioplasty allows expansion cranium children ability moulded smoothly less commonly used autografts due brittle nature high infection rate poor ability integrate human bilateral cranioplasties prone complications compared unilateral cranioplasties children may explained larger scalp wound area higher volume blood loss higher complexity duration cranioplasty

use use cadaver allograft disc filling small holes received satisfactory result resurgence use cadaver however cadaver bones allografts general preferred materials modern use methyl methacrylate pmma cranioplasty developed since world war ii material used extensively since high demand cranioplasty due large number injuries becomes malleable exothermic reaction occurs powder form benzoyl peroxide allowing moulded cranial advantages using pmma malleability low cost high strength high durability disadvantages include vulnerable infection bacteria may adhere fibrous layer well brittle nature growth common synthetic materials cranioplasty include titanium hydroxyapatite titanium first used cranioplasty used plate mesh printed porous titanium nonferromagnetic noncorrosive making host free inflammatory also robust thus preventing patients use titanium associated lower infection disadvantages using titanium include high cost poor malleability disruption ct scan hydroxyapatite compound calcium phosphate arranged hexagonal bonds well chemically bones inflicts little inflammatory reaction host good expanded used paediatric moulded smoothly appealing cosmetic however material brittle low tensile strength suitable used small cranial use also associated high infection hydroxyapatite often used titanium mesh prevent fractures better httpsenwikipediaorgwikicranioplasty
