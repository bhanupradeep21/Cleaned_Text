allofeeding type food sharing behaviour observed cooperatively breeding species birds allofeeding refers parent sibling unrelated adult bird feeding altricial hatchlings dependent parental care allofeeding also refers food sharing adults allofeeding occur mates mating rituals courtship egg laying incubation peers species form parental allofeeding evolved different reasons different species birds sagebrush brewers sparrows allofeed reduce predation incubation sichuan jays allofeed increase females nutritional level prior egg laying chinstrap penguins allofeed strengthen bond pair chick parental allofeeding common form parental care among many species birds practice inherently restricted biological parents young often done reasons unrelated wellbeing chicks arabian babblers instance peer allofeed attempt increasing social rank whereas king penguin considers nonbreeders allofeed chicks altruistic highly revered far practical barn owl course peer allofeeds merely reduce sibling rivalrycompetition meal although many species birds exhibit allofeeding species perform allofeeding siberian many species migratory songbirds display allofeeding incubation incubation period male songbird feed mate beaktobeak interaction sits allofeeding behaviour suggested adaptive male indirectly investing male uses energy forage retrieve food feed behaviour male reduces nutritional stress female reduces amount time female spends addition allofeeding behaviour decreases number times female leave nest turn extends incubation period reduces risk nest detected overall allofeeding behaviour contributes increased fitness therefore considered however nolan theorizes allofeeding nonadaptive derived anticipatory parental allofeeding incubation period also transpire male female interchangeably feeding via beaktobeak interactions mate receiving food incubates feeding completed recipient becomes feeder mate foraging incubates eggs example sagebrush brewers sparrows spizella breweri breweri allofeed recent study halley et al examined allofeeding twentyfour nests sagebrush brewers study revealed allofeeding occurred low frequencies nests biparental incubation allofeeding occurred uniparental study suggests allofeeding intraspecific signal required maintain social bonds mates addition increasing nutrition levels females concealment furthermore study found incubation sessions per hour higher biparental nests allofeeding biparental nests without findings indicate allofeeding beneficial reduces risk predation visually oriented predators increased nest concealment maximize fitness males increasing fitness many documented observations allofeeding mates mate however penguins allofeeding mates allofeeding reported chinstrap penguins p antarctica period chick researchers witnessed male feeding female large chick behaviour engaged female frequently pecking side males bill stimulate male regurgitate resulted male regurgitating food females open mouth allofeeding behaviour identical manner chick begs parent notably behaviour female kept attention male chick tried gain males proposed mate allofeeding chinstrap penguins performed strengthen bond allofeeding mates also occur courtship allofeeding occurs half bird subfamilies mainly appears monogamous bird courtship allofeeding hypothesized strengthen bond pairs increase females nutritional level laying example sichuan jay p internigrans females fed one male suggested allofeeding female courtship increases females nutritional level egg behaviour also recorded canada jays p parent feeding nonbiological chick via billtobill interactions form parental allofeeding occurs altricial species birds ensure proper growth development prevent starvation form allofeeding shown form parental care species king penguins king penguins pelagic king penguin chicks form dense groups called crèches winter social thermoregulation food availability formation crèches results parents interchangeably leaving starving chicks gather food study lecomte et al examined allofeeding behaviour king penguins marked white underbellies nonbreeding adults breeding pairs unique dark colouring called dyemark code lecomte et al found marked adults feed chicks crèches revealing allofeeding behaviour common breeding lecomte et al also identified adult king penguins demonstrating allofeeding behaviour unable successfully breed along breeders performing allofeeding behaviour resulted feedings consistent study pierre et al showed allofeeding penguins increases chick growth rate results lecomte et al concluded allofeeding increased survival rate chicks results imply parental allofeeding king penguins altruistic behaviour allofeeding benefits young cost nonbiological notably direct benefits nonbiological parents cost allofeeding nonbiological chicks resulted detrimental effects fitness alloparent cost allofeeding low several grams compared nutritional costs adult king penguin several however suggested allofeeding many chicks may cost chick lost meals cause negative effects fitness allofed addition allofeeding decreases nonbiological parents chinstrap penguin p antarcticus another species penguin displays parental allofeeding chinstrap penguin observed female similar mate allofeeding species offspring female peck side females bill signal female regurgitate food chicks open sichuan jays p internigrans females sex participates allofeeding first week life chicks fed male forages stores food pouch within throat nest male regurgitates semidigested food pouch mouths first week male continues feed chicks female begins feeding female uses method many reported cases allofeeding siblings several species example arabian babblers sqamiceps territorial desertinhabiting species bird participate cooperative species nonbreeders show numerous types cooperative behaviour including adult immature babblers well previous newly fledged babblers frequently engage allofeeding carlisle et al revealed arabian babblers participate peer allofeeding order increase social rank increases allofeeding behaviour supported zahavis individual dominant babbler increase social rank allofeeding subordinate contrary individual subordinate babbler decrease social rank allofed dominant subordinate babblers observed refusing allofed dominant refusal resulted dominant babbler becoming aggressive subordinate hitting chasing dominate babblers also showed aggressive behaviours subordinate tried allofeed another species exhibits peer allofeeding barn owl barn owl nest siblings
