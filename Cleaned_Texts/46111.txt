helicasedependent amplification hda method vitro dna amplification like polymerase chain reaction takes place constant temperature polymerase chain reaction widely used method vitro dna amplification purposes molecular biology biomedical process involves separation doublestranded dna high heat single strands denaturation step typically achieved annealing primers single stranded dna annealing step copying single strands create new doublestranded dna extension step requires dna polymerase requires reaction done thermal cycler benchtop machines large expensive costly run maintain limiting potential applications dna amplification situations outside laboratory eg identification potentially hazardous microorganisms scene investigation point care patient although pcr usually associated thermal cycling original patent mullis et al disclosed use helicase means denaturation double stranded dna thereby including isothermal nucleic acid amplification vivo dna replicated dna polymerases various accessory proteins including dna helicase acts separate dna unwinding dna double hda developed concept using helicase enzyme denature dna strands double stranded dna first separated dna helicase coated single stranded dna ssdnabinding proteins second step two sequence specific primers hybridise border dna template dna polymerases used extend primers annealed templates produce double stranded dna two newly synthesized dna products used substrates dna helicases entering next round reaction thus simultaneous chain reaction develops resulting exponential amplification selected target sequence see vincent et al schematic diagram since publication discovery hda technology used simple easy adapt nucleic acid test detection clostridium applications include rapid detection staphylococcus aureus amplification detection short dna sequence specific advantages hda provides rapid method nucleic acid amplification specific target isothermic temperature require thermal cycler however optimisation primers sometimes buffers required beforehand researcher normally primer buffer optimisation tested achieved pcr raising question need spend extra separate system actual amplification despite selling point hda negates use thermal cycler therefore allows research conducted field much work required detect potentially hazardous microorganisms carried researchhospital lab setting regardless present mass diagnoses great number samples yet achieved hda whereas pcr reactions carried thermal cycler hold multiwell sample plates allows amplification detection intended dna target maximum samples cost purchasing reagents hda also relatively expensive pcr reagents since comes readymade kit httpsenwikipediaorgwikihelicasedependentamplification
