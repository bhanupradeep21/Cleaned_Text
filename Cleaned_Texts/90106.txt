globally estimated million adults living diabetes according data international diabetes diabetes cause mortality globally attributing million deaths annually due diabetes directly kidney disease due primary causes type diabetes diet physical activity contribute increased bmi poor nutrition hypertension alcohol use smoking genetics also diabetes prevalence increasing rapidly previous estimates put

diabetes prevalence rates largely reflect increase risk factors type notably greater longevity overweight prevalence african americans diabetes estimated triple prevalence whites estimated overall prevalence increases age largest increase people years prevalence diabetes america estimated increase million diabetes mellitus occurs throughout world common especially type developed countries greatest increase prevalence however occurring low middleincome including asia africa patients probably found increase incidence developing countries follows trend urbanization lifestyle changes including increasingly sedentary lifestyles less physically demanding work global nutrition transition marked increased intake foods high energydense nutrientpoor often high sugar saturated fats sometimes referred western pattern risk getting type diabetes widely found associated lower socioeconomic position across estimates diabetes resulted million deaths making leading cause however another million deaths worldwide attributable high blood glucose increased risks associated complications eg heart disease stroke kidney failure often result premature death often listed underlying cause death certificates rather burden diabetes type possibility lead complications multiple body systems including nephropathy neuropathy half patients type diabetes die due cardiovascular disease
