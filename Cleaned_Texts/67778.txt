carboxylterminal amino acid sequence amino acids secretin secretin synthesized cytoplasmic secretory granules scells found mainly mucosa duodenum smaller numbers jejunum small secretin released circulation andor intestinal lumen response low duodenal ph ranges depending species acidity due hydrochloric acid chyme enters duodenum stomach via pyloric also secretion secretin increased products protein digestion bathing mucosa upper small secretin release inhibited antagonists reduce gastric acid secretion result ph duodenum increases secretin secretin primarily functions neutralize ph duodenum allowing digestive enzymes pancreas eg pancreatic amylase pancreatic lipase function secretin targets pancreas pancreatic centroacinar cells secretin receptors plasma membrane secretin binds receptors stimulates adenylate cyclase activity converts atp cyclic cyclic amp acts second messenger intracellular signal transduction causes organ secrete bicarbonaterich fluid flows intestine bicarbonate base neutralizes acid thus establishing ph favorable action digestive enzymes small secretin also increases water bicarbonate secretion duodenal brunners glands buffer incoming protons acidic also reduces acid secretion parietal cells least three mechanisms stimulating release somatostatin inhibiting release gastrin pyloric antrum direct downregulation parietal cell acid secretory counteracts blood glucose concentration spikes triggering increased insulin release pancreas following oral glucose secretin modulates water electrolyte transport pancreatic duct liver epididymis epithelial play role vasopressinindependent regulation renal water secretin found magnocellular neurons paraventricular supraoptic nuclei hypothalamus along neurohypophysial tract neurohypophysis increased osmolality released posterior pituitary hypothalamus activates vasopressin also needed carry central effects angiotensin ii absence secretin receptor gene knockout animals central injection angiotensin ii unable stimulate water intake vasopressin suggested abnormalities secretin release could explain abnormalities underlying type syndrome inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion individuals vasopressin release response normal although abnormal renal expression translocation aquaporin suggested secretin neurosecretory hormone posterior pituitary therefore could longsought vasopressin independent mechanism solve riddle puzzled clinicians physiologists secretin receptor found discrete nuclei hypothalamus including paraventricular nucleus arcuate nucleus primary brain
