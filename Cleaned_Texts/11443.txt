influenced factors cell discovery significantly impacted world developmental biology fundamentally changed understanding early development spemannmangold organizer first described hans spemann hilde mangold prior discovery hypothesized multiple groups exists portion developing embryo serves organization center hans spemann showed transplanting presumptive epidermis area presumptive neural tissue would change fate transplanted cells new destination likewise transplanted presumptive neural tissue presumptive epidermis forming spemann also showed transplanting piece upper blastopore lip area presumptive epidermis secondary embryonic primordium formed including secondary neural tube notochord somites additionally splitting embryo half rotating animal pole respect vegetal pole resulted determination spreading lower vegetal pole upper blastopore lip located upper animal half also fused together two identical halves different embryos observed formation neural plate work provided initial evidence support notion existed organization center determined prior embryonic tissue influenced determination surrounding test spemanns hypothesis one phd students hilde mangold performed experiments using embryos triturus cristatus triturus taeniatus undergoing gastrulation experiment performed resembled one done however instead homoplastic transplantation used embryos two species newt closely related one benefits using cristatus taeniatus embryos cristatus embryo cells lacked pigment fate transplant could easily tracked placed among pigmented taeniatus cells piece upper blastopore lip removed cristatus embryo transplanted ventral region presumptive epidermis taeniatus embryo away developing host blastopore following transplant observed formation secondary embryonic primordium consistent previous work secondary embryo normal features primary embryo including structures neural plate notochord although lagged slightly development sectioning embryo showed cells transplant incorporated mesoderm neural plate constituted almost entire notochord secondary embryo shown neural plate almost entirely composed cells host taeniatus embryo experiments concluded piece upper blastopore lip transplanted indifferent tissue another embryo induce host tissue formation secondary embryo therefore implicating transplanted tissue organization discovery spemannmangold
