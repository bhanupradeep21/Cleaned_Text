habitats like deserts tropical habitats like tropical rainforests temperate habitats like coniferous forests deciduous habitats mountains habitats found sea level altitudes adapt well human settlements found villages towns areas housing live densely populated cities like jodhpur population numbering gray langurs diurnal sleep night trees also manmade structures like towers electric poles human resting trees generally prefer highest ungulates like bovine deer eat food dropped foraging langurs preyed upon leopards dholes wolves jackals asian black bears pythons may also prey langurs
