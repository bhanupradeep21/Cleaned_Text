include genus name derived latin root penicillum meaning painters brush refers chains conidia resemble thallus mycelium consists highly branched networks multinucleated usually colourless hyphae pair cells separated septum conidiophores end branch accompanied green spherical constricted units called conidia propagules play significant role reproduction conidia main dispersal strategy sexual reproduction involves production ascospores commencing fusion archegonium antheridium sharing nuclei irregularly distributed asci contain eight unicellular ascospores species penicillium ubiquitous soil fungi preferring cool moderate climates commonly present wherever organic material available saprophytic species penicillium aspergillus among bestknown representatives eurotiales live mainly organic biodegradable substances commonly known america molds among main causes food spoilage especially species subgenus many species produce highly toxic mycotoxins ability penicillium species grow

although many eukaryotes able reproduce sexually much fungal species thought reproduce exclusively asexual means however recent studies revealed sex occurs even supposedly asexual species example sexual capability recently shown fungus penicillium roqueforti used starter blue cheese finding based part evidence functional mating type mat genes involved fungal sexual compatibility presence sequenced genome important genes known involved meiosis penicillium chrysogenum major medical historical importance original presentday industrial source antibiotic penicillin species considered asexual years despite concerted efforts induce sexual reproduction however bohm et finally demonstrated sexual reproduction p chrysogenum findings penicillium species consistent accumulating evidence studies eukaryotic species sex likely present common ancestor furthermore recent results suggest sex maintained even little genetic variability produced prior one fungus one name nomenclature change came effect penicillium used genus anamorph clonal forms fungi talaromyces used teleomorph sexual forms fungi however fungi reclassified based genetic relatedness genera penicillium talaromyces
