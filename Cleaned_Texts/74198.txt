following anchiornis huxleyi small bipedal theropod dinosaur triangular skull bearing several details common dromaeosaurids troodontids primitive avialans like early paravians anchiornis small size long wingbearing arms long legs long tail like paravians covered feathers though also scales certain parts body wings legs tail supported long relatively narrow vaned feathers two types simpler downy plumaceous feathers covered rest body sinornithosaurus feathers made filaments attached bases complex feathers barbs attached along central quill long simple feathers covered almost entire head neck torso upper legs first half tail rest tail bore pennaceous tail feathers long feathers head crown may formed first specimen anchiornis preserved faint traces feathers around preserved portion body many wellpreserved fossils since found studies anchiornis specimens using laser fluorescence revealed details feathers also skin muscle tissue taken together evidence given scientists nearly complete picture anchiornis anatomy additional studies indicate anchiornis body plumage consisted short quills long independent flexible barbs barbs stuck quills low angles two opposing blades also gave feather overall forked shape resulted theropod possessing softer textured shaggier appearing plumage seen modern birds shaggy contour feathers probably influenced thermoregulatory water repellence abilities combination openvaned wing feathers would decreased aerodynamic holotype belonging subadult young adult individual measured centimetres ft long weighed grams largest specimens measured centimetres ft total body nearly centimetres ft wingspan weighed kilogram like early paravians anchiornis large wings made pennaceous feathers attached arm hand wing anchiornis composed primary feathers secondary feathers primary feathers anchiornis long secondaries formed rounded wing wing feathers curved symmetrical central quills small thin relative size rounded tips indicating poor aerodynamic ability related dinosaurs microraptor archaeopteryx longest wing feathers closest tip wing making wings appear relatively long pointed however anchiornis longest wing feathers nearest wrist making wing broadest middle tapering near tip rounded less flightadapted like maniraptorans anchiornis propatagium flap skin connecting wrist shoulder rounding front edge wing anchiornis part wing covered covert feathers smoothed wing covered gaps larger primary secondary feathers however unlike modern birds covert feathers anchiornis arranged tracts arrangement covert feathers also primitive anchiornis birds advanced paravians modern birds coverts usually cover upper portion wing wing surface made uncovered flight feathers anchiornis fossils hand several layers covert feathers seem extend cover wings surface wing essentially made multiple layers feathers rather layer broad feathers bases hidden layers coverts multilayered wing arrangement might helped strengthen wing considering primary secondary feathers narrow wing included three clawed fingers however unlike primitive theropods longest two fingers separate bound together skin tissue forming wing anchiornis functionally bound fingers incorporated postpatagium flap skin tissues helped support bases main wing feathers like toes skin around bottom fingers covered tiny rounded scales unlike toes flesh around underside finger bones twice thick bones lacked distinct pads instead fingers straight smooth without major creases joints scales skin around fingers rarely preserved fossils early pennaraptorans notable exceptions anchiornis caudipteryx similar thick scaly fingers associated addition front wings anchiornis long vaned feathers hind legs led many scientists call anchiornis fourwinged dinosaur along similar animals like microraptor however feathers hind legs anchiornis shape arrangement expected flight feathers likely primary role display rather anchiornis long legs usually indication animal strong runner however extensive leg feathers indicate may vestigial trait running animals tend reduced increased hair feathers like paravians anchiornis four toes foot third fourth toes longest first toe hallux reversed perching hindwings anchiornis also shorter microraptor made flight feathers anchored tibia lower leg tarsus upper foot also unlike microraptor hindwing feathers longest closer body foot feathers short directed downward almost perpendicular foot unlike many paravians feet anchiornis except claws completely covered feathers though much shorter ones making specimens preserved scales toes tarsus even lower leg tibia suggesting scales existed beneath feathers underside toes formed fleshy pads distinct creases joints foot pads covered small pebblelike scales scales also present top feet hard see known team scientists examined numerous points among feathers extremely wellpreserved anchiornis specimen beijing museum natural history survey distribution melanosomes pigment cells give feathers color studying types melanosomes comparing modern birds scientists able map specific colors patterning present anchiornis alive though technique used described isolated

included survey melanosome shapes across feathers contrast study grayblack type melanosomes found even crown feathers examined none rounder rufoustype melanosomes seen scientists conducted second study suggested several possible explanations discrepancy first different preservation melanosomes different investigative techniques might influenced results original study second beijing museum specimen smaller possible rufous color replaced animals aged third possible regional differences even different species anchiornis different color patterns avialae first discovered scientists studied anchiornis conducted phylogenetic analysis concluded early member group avialae along members avialae called avialans closely related modern birds dromaeosaurid troodontid dinosaurs though earliest primitive members three groups extremely similar makes difficult sort exactly three main paravian branches belong second specimen anchiornis complete first preserved several features led hu dongyu colleagues reclassify anchiornis several studies using similar analyses also found anchiornis troodontid though exceptions one study found anchiornis member archaeopterygidae along archaeopteryx considered primitive dromeosaurids troodontids avialans sankar chatterjee placed anchiornis along microraptor fourwinged paravians group called tetrapterygidae outside avialae though supported phylogenetic comprehensive studies suggested anchiornis may avialan though new finds updated versions study later reversed finding concluding anchiornis likely basal member clade paraves outside clade includes dromaeosaurids troodontids reevaluation haarlem archaeopteryx specimen anchiornis found group genera like eosinopteryx xiaotingia placed family anchiornithidae along anchiornis notable proportionally long forelimbs measured total length hindlimbs similar condition early avians archaeopteryx authors pointed long forelimbs necessary flight anchiornis also avian wrist nonavialan theropods authors initially speculated would possible anchiornis fly glide however finds showed wings anchiornis welldeveloped short compared later species like microraptor relatively short primary feathers rounded symmetrical tips unlike pointed aerodynamically proportioned feathers study potential flight performance early paravians concluded juvenile anchiornis specimens may able use wings assist running incline could possibly achieved flapping flight highangle flapping wing stroke used larger adult specimens would gained aerodynamic benefit simply heavy compared total wing area study found flapping wings running would resulted small increase running speed similarly use wings leaping would resulted increase height notably anchiornis seems lacked breastbone sternum may made cartilage rather bone primitive anchiornis hindleg proportions like primitive theropod dinosaurs avialans long legs indicating fastrunning lifestyle however long legs normally indicate fast runner legs even feet toes anchiornis covered feathers including long feathers legs similar hindwings long leg feathers lower legs may slowed running speed anchiornis modern birds especially live ground lower legs tend show reduction even loss hind wings anchiornis smaller made curved symmetrical feathers microraptor suggesting used mainly display rather however might still granted animal kind aerodynamic advantage even primary purpose display skeletal structure anchiornis similar eosinopteryx appears capable runner due uncurved rear claws absence flight feathers tail lower legs anchiornis shared similar body plan ecosystem eosinopteryx suggesting different niches complex picture origin like many modern birds anchiornis exhibited complex pattern coloration different colors speckled patterns across body wings within amongfeather plumage coloration modern birds color patterning used communication display either members species eg mating territorial threat display threaten warn
