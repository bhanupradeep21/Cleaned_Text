guilt would experience upon saying charities may strategically employ categorical donor recognition example charitable organization may distinguish gift title distinct awarded gifts consequence social signaling component warmglow effect extrinsic operationalizations warm glow suggests individuals motivated make minimum donation acquire desired categorical status consistent hypothesis research indicated significant grouping behavior donors around category majority choose give portion wealth charity support multiple different causes rather giving cumulative donations source exists widespread preference distribute funds across warm glow model explains recognizing givers receive multiple warm glows giving multiple causes thus supporting preference make multiple small contributions
