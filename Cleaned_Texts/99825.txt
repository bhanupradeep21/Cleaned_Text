prevalence convergent evolution squamates creates much room interpreting molecular morphological data many studies results often contradicted example completely different phylogenetic results simply adding datasets varying taxa represented resulted various conflicts creating even uncertainty due scientists argued molecular perspective abandoned nevertheless scientists attempted resolve problems
