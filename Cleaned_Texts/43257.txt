nitrous oxide inhaled gas used pain medication together medications common uses include childbirth following trauma part endoflife onset effect typically within half minute effect lasts side effects vomiting shortterm longterm use anemia numbness may always given least recommended people bowel obstruction use early part pregnancy possible continue breastfeeding following nitrous oxide discovered
