anthropogenic hazards hazards caused human action inaction contrasted natural hazards anthropogenic hazards may adversely affect humans organisms biomes ecosystems frequency severity hazards key elements risk analysis methodologies hazards may also described relation impact hazard exists pathway exposure anthropogenic hazards grouped societal hazards criminality civil disorder terrorism war industrial hazards engineering hazards power outage fire hazards caused transportation environmental hazards hazard exists pathway exposure example center earth consists molten material high temperatures would severe hazard contact made core however feasible way making contact core therefore center earth currently poses hazard example distinction hazard disaster earthquake hazard caused san francisco earthquake disaster natural hazards amplified anthropogenic processes eg landuse change drainage certain societal hazards occur inadvertently overlooking hazard failure notice purposeful intent human inaction neglect consequences result little preemptive actions prevent hazard occurring although everything within scope human control antisocial behaviour crimes committed individuals groups prevented reasonable apprehension injury death people commonly report dangerous circumstances suspicious behaviour criminal intentions police authorities investigate intervene riot defined noisy violent public disturbance caused group crowd three people usually protesting another group government policy uk london riot august example started due shooting mark duggan london rioters came together destroying neighbourhoods streets violently damaging property protest polices actions happened days riots increase expenses repair costly damages putting city distress terrorism defined acts violence threats group people property intention intimidating coercing societies governments often ideological political terrorism occurs unexpected attack noncombatants create fear panic detrimental terrorist attacks create massive costly impact society large amount property damage may able repaired also large impact citizens people lose loved ones suffer health impacted terrorist attack twin towers new york city marks one largest attacks united twin towers completely destroyed damaging surrounding buildings well causing loss many lives people suffered health problems inhaling sediments crumbling towers financial social impact still present thirteen years later todays concluded new york city still suffers postdisaster decline financial new york city disaster area due sociological hazard terrorism war defined period conflict carried act hostility armed forces two nations within wars sociological hazard causing disaster areas behavior puts others risk injury death universally regarded criminal breach law appropriate legal authority may impose form penalty imprisonment fine even execution understanding makes individuals act ways put others risk subject much research many developed mitigating hazard criminality dependent time place areas times day posing greater risk others civil disorder broad term typically used law enforcement describe forms disturbance many people involved set upon common aim civil disorder many causes including largescale criminal conspiracy socioeconomic factors unemployment poverty hostility racial ethnic groups outrage perceived moral legal transgressions examples wellknown civil disorders riots poll tax riots united kingdom los angeles riots people died greek riots boy fatally shot police thai political protests bangkok people died behavior hazardous directly involved participants controlling disturbance indirectly involved passersby shopkeepers example great majority staying way disturbance avoids hazard common definition terrorism use threatened use violence purpose creating fear order achieve political religious ideological goal targets terrorist acts anyone including private citizens government officials military personnel law enforcement officers firefighters people serving interests governments definitions terrorism may also vary geographically australia security legislation amendment terrorism act defines terrorism action advance political religious ideological cause intention coercing government intimidating public united states department state operationally describes premeditated politicallymotivated violence perpetrated noncombatant targets sub national groups clandestine agents usually intended influence industrial accidents resulting releases hazardous materials usually occur commercial context mining accidents often environmental impact also hazardous people living proximity bhopal disaster saw release methyl isocyanate neighbouring environment seriously affecting large numbers people probably worlds worst industrial accident date engineering hazards occur structures used people fail materials used construction prove hazardous history construction many examples hazards associated structures including bridge failures tay bridge disaster caused underdesign silver bridge collapse caused corrosion attack original tacoma narrows bridge caused aerodynamic flutter deck failure dams infrequent victorian era dale dyke dam failure sheffield england causing great sheffield flood killed least people failure south fork dam little conemaugh river near johnstown pennsylvania produced johnstown flood killed failures include balcony collapses aerial walkway collapses hyatt regency walkway collapse kansas city building collapses world trade center new york city september attacks several technical hazards one aware pose threat humans values hazards measured terms risk pose community using technical hazards classified source specifically speaking fall automotive emissions medical radiation explosions air pollution environmental hazards quality hazard determines safety precautions taken example hazards risk individual risk population population risk hazard priorities management hazardous material hazardous materials cause illness even death individual address accordingly crucial inform public technical hazards power outage interruption normal sources electrical power shortterm power outages hours common minor adverse effect since businesses health facilities prepared deal extended power outages however disrupt personal business activities well medical rescue services leading business losses medical emergencies extended loss power lead civil disorder new york city blackout rarely power outages escalate disaster proportions however often accompany types disasters hurricanes floods hampers relief efforts electromagnetic pulses voltage spikes whatever cause also damage electricity infrastructure electrical devices recent notable power outages include blackout affected million people india blackouts affected million brazil paraguay blackout affected million people bush fires forest fires mine fires generally started lightning also human negligence arson burn thousands square kilometers fire intensifies enough produce winds weather form firestorm good example mine fire one near centralia pennsylvania started ruined town continues burn today biggest cityrelated fires great chicago fire peshtigo fire great fire london casualties resulting fires regardless source initial cause aggravated inadequate emergency preparedness hazards lack accessible emergency exits poorly marked escape routes improperly maintained fire extinguishers sprinkler systems may result many deaths injuries might occur protections arson setting fire intent cause damage definition arson originally limited setting fire buildings later expanded include objects bridges vehicles private property humaninduced fires accidental failing machinery kitchen stove major cause accidental several thoughts come mind one thinks word nuclear whether basic chemistry highly complex explosives nuclear accidents nuclear incidences nuclear terrorism definitely threat community world matter nuclear terrorism exactly nuclear accident incident act terrorism unpredictable unusual unwanted event involving radiation andor radioactive specifically distinguish three nuclear accidents deliberate viewed acts nature nuclear incidents hand causes include deliberate actions generally nonmalicious nonviolent may due poor judgement wrong information nuclear accidents deliberate viewed acts nature several examples nuclear accidents taken place around world start prime example nuclear accident would palo mares accident january us air force bomber collided midtanker airplane refueled feet two airplanes collided tanker airplane exploded completely killing crew members bomber split half killing small proportion crew airplane split half four bombs dropped sky two detonated causing kilometers land contaminated radioactive plutonium fourth explosive recovered discovered landed sea soil contaminated area removed placed barrels reduce amount pollution caused nuclear explosive nuclear incidents causes include deliberate actions generally nonmalicious nonviolent may due poor judgement wrong information secondary example would johnston atoll incident occurred july decided conduct experiment christmas island johnson atoll set nuclear explosions one missile launches went wrong malfunctioned trying launch leaders decided detonate missile launched detonated entire island covered radioactive plutonium witnesses claimed people suffered radioactive contamination created cancer radioactive related diseases plus present site explosion suffered infertility body deformations aviation incident occurrence accident associated operation aircraft affects could affect safety operations passengers pilots category vehicle range helicopter airliner space shuttle special hazards traveling rail include possibility train crash result substantial loss life incidents involving freight traffic generally pose greater hazardous risk environment less common hazards include geophysical hazards tsunami struck sri lanka people died sri lanka tsunamirail disaster see also list train accidents death toll traffic collisions leading cause death roadbased pollution creates substantial health hazard especially major conurbations space travel presents significant hazards mostly direct participants astronauts cosmonauts ground support personnel also carry potential disaster public large accidents related space travel killed astronauts cosmonauts larger number people ground accidents occur ground launch preparation flight due equipment malfunction naturally hostile environment space additional risk posed unmanned loworbiting satellites whose orbits eventually decay due friction extremely thin atmosphere large enough massive pieces traveling great speed fall earth burning potential damage one worst humanpiloted space accidents involved space shuttle challenger disintegrated claiming seven lives board shuttle disintegrated seconds taking launch pad cape canaveral florida another example space shuttle columbia disintegrated landing attempt texas loss seven astronauts board debris field extended new mexico mississippi ships sink capsize crash disasters perhaps infamous sinking titanic hit iceberg sank resulting one worst maritime disasters history notable incidents include capsizing costa concordia killed least people largest passenger ship sink sinking mv doña paz claimed lives people worst peacetime maritime disaster history environmental hazards hazards effects seen biomes ecosystems rather directly living organisms well known examples include oil spills water pollution slash burn deforestation air pollution ground fissures managing waste many hazardous materials put domestic commercial waste stream part modern technological living uses certain toxic poisonous materials electronics chemical industries use transported usually safely contained encapsulated packaged avoid exposure waste stream waste products exterior encapsulation breaks degrades release exposure hazardous materials environment people working waste disposal industry living around sites used waste disposal landfill general environment surrounding sites organohalogens family synthetic organic molecules contain atoms one halogens materials include pcbs dioxins ddt freon many others although considered harmless first produced many compounds known profound physiological effects many organisms including man many also fat soluble become concentrated food chain many metals salts exhibit toxicity humans many organisms metals include cadmium copper silver mercury many transuranic metals radioactive materials produce ionizing radiation may harmful living organisms damage even short exposure radioactivity may long term adverse health consequences exposure may occur nuclear fallout nuclear weapons detonated nuclear containment systems compromised world war ii united states army air forces dropped atomic bombs japanese cities hiroshima nagasaki leading extensive contamination food land water soviet union mayak industrial complex otherwise known exploded kyshtym disaster kept secret several decades third serious nuclear accident ever recorded least villages exposed radiation resulted least displaced persons former soviet union officially acknowledged accident soviet republics ukraine belarus suffered also reactor chernobyl nuclear power plant meltdown day several small towns city chernobyl remain abandoned uninhabitable due fallout hanford site decommissioned nuclear production complex
