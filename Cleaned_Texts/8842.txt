changed brucella honour bruce accepted valid accordingly disease renamed bruce transferred south africa sent zululand investigate outbreak animal disease natives called nagana europeans fly disease wife found disease prevalent among cattle donkey horses collected blood samples infected animals found parasites bruce identified correctly type haematozoon attributed protozoans blood parasites described report point think convenient give definite description parasite discovered blood animals affected disease bring forward reasons considering proximate exciting cause disease present shall call haematozoon blood parasite fly disease although probability knowledge found identical haematozoon surra called trypanosoma evansi least species belonging also made accurate identification
