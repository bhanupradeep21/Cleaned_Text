miscible embedding light microscopy paraffin wax frequently used embedding paraffin immiscible water main constituent biological tissue must first removed series dehydration samples transferred series progressively concentrated ethanol baths ethanol remove remaining traces dehydration followed clearing agent typically although environmental safe substitutes removes alcohol miscible wax finally melted paraffin wax added replace xylene infiltrate histology histopathology laboratories dehydration clearing wax infiltration carried tissue processors automate infiltrated paraffin tissues oriented molds filled wax positioned wax cooled solidifying block paraffin wax always provide sufficiently hard matrix cutting thin sections especially important electron paraffin wax may also soft relation
