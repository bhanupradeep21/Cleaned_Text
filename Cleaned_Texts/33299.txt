worth noting trade goods particularly narcotics nerve gas weaponry slaves illegal many systems attempting trade result fine police often escalate police attacking paid however often worth risk illegal goods generally carry high price black market frontier substitutes elite arcade flying style one based rigidly newtonian physics momentum must first neutralised bring players craft stop turning effect direction travel previous momentum counteracted craft control largely left player often daytoday tasks navigating hyperspace exitpoint desired planet spacestation docking handed ships autopilot travel within star system occurs across realistic distances realistic speeds therefore even fastest ships capable acceleration intrasystem travel take many hours therefore game provides accelerate time function makes game time pass times normal rate issue interstellar navigation solved use hyperdrive travel stars player select system star map jump provided reasonably far settlement arrive outskirts star system must make way destination ships maximum range calculated according mass small light ships impressively large ranges time taken travel maximum range always exactly one week shorter jumps taking less time unlike rest games travel jumps experienced multiple real time appear almost instantaneous theories range suspended animation extreme time dilation hyperspace jump leaves visible remnant hyperspace cloud entry exit points visible hours afterwards ostensibly making possible pirates assassins track ship hyperspace arrive destination first attack without police intervention sooner later player run enemies likely form space pirates different star systems differing government social structures meaning systems safer others core worlds usually safest anarchic systems hazardous riedquat phekda amongst notorious anarchies game combat handled completely realistically practice means ships taking slingshot thrusts lasers fired constantly one ships destroyed enemy ships
