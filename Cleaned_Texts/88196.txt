interstitial pneumonia hepatitis atopic dermatitis alopecia andor scleroderma several patients also recurrent severe infections fungal infections hypogammaglobulinemia postnatal short stature exhibiting profound growth failure commonly seen earlyonset type diabetes also noted several stereotyped clinical phenotype gof patients differs distinctly associated germline mutations shown confer

lung infections lof gof result immune deficiency gof exhibit infections quite distinct observed lof along far common connective tissue furthermore somatic gainoffunction mutations reported association solid hematologic cancers therefore one would expected germline gof mutations would similar increase risk cancer however patient presented large granular lymphocytic leukemia parent hodgkin germline somatic gainoffunction mutations appear result distinctly different phenotypes gainoffunction mutations identified germline mutations meaning variations lineage germ cells mutations identified de novo meaning originating symptomatic patient inherited either however multiple cases inheritance also identified families family members carrying mutation asymptomatic less severe phenotype indicating carriers mutations display autosomal dominant inheritance incomplete children parent carries gof mutation chance inheriting mutation within family child risk inheriting mutated gene independent

gainoffunction mutations gene maps human chromosome exons encodes amino acid protein part family proteins known stat protein proteins play essential role chemical signaling pathways within cells transcription factor activated moves nucleus binds specific areas dna binding regulatory regions near genes mediates expression variety genes therefore necessary many cellular processes including cell proliferation inflammation differentiation gof patients found germline heterozygous variants various missense mutations identified multiple domains protein including allalpha dnabinding cterminal transactivation domains milner et al genetic model disease gainoffunction means people gof disease gene hyperactive leading intrinsic increase transcriptional activity consequences hyperactivity yet fully understood insights underlying mechanisms identified researchers identified increase suppressor cytokine signaling large number stat gof negatively regulates inhibits stat proteins like important regulatory cell treg differentiation function may explain many stat gof patients low tregs treg abnormalities likely play major role autoimmunity although patients normal tregs also presented autoimmunity additionally partial decrease activation likely participates immune deficiencies data suggest upregulation transcriptional activity may consequences cytokine signaling pathways

moderate tcell lymphopenia hypogammaglobulinemia elevated double negative cells dnts studies required understand discrepancy associated many laboratory manifestations including impaired differentiation among diagnosis made treatment based individual clinical condition may include standard management autoimmunity one patient severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia responded well rituximab blocking activation tocilizumab one patient resulted dramatic improvement two patients exhibiting postnatal short stature treated growth hormone good response hematopoietic stem cell transplant hct
