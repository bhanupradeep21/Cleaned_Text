amphibians particularly devastated amniotes first members sauropsid synapsid groups fared better physiologically better adapted drier amphibians survive cold conditions decreasing metabolic rates resorting overwintering strategies ie spending year inactive burrows logs however effective way deal prolonged unfavourable conditions especially desiccation amphibians must return water lay eggs amniotes eggs membrane retains water allows gas exchange water amphibians limited capacity adapt drier conditions dominated permian environments many amphibian families failed occupy new ecological niches became amphibians also removed scales aquatic ancestors breathed lungs skin long skin kept wet amniotes reevolved scales keratinized allowing conserve water losing cutaneous respiration
