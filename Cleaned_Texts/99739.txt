processes studied according methods cognitive psychology information processing theory according view social cognition level analysis aims understand social psychological phenomena investigating cognitive processes underlie major concerns approach processes involved perception judgment memory social stimuli effects social affective factors information processing behavioral interpersonal consequences cognitive processes level analysis may applied content area within social psychology including research intrapersonal interpersonal intragroup intergroup processes term social cognition used multiple areas psychology cognitive neuroscience often refer various social abilities disrupted cognitive neuroscience biological basis social cognition developmental psychologists study development social cognition social cognition came prominence rise cognitive psychology late early dominant model approach mainstream social common social cognition theories idea information represented brain cognitive elements schemas attributions stereotypes focus cognitive elements processed often employed social cognition therefore applies extends many themes theories paradigms cognitive psychology identified reasoning representativeness heuristic base rate fallacy confirmation bias attention automaticity priming memory schemas primacy recency likely social psychology always cognitive general psychology approach traditionally discussed internal mental states beliefs desires mainstream psychology dominated suggested disciplines social psychology social identity theory social representations may seeking explain largely phenomena social cognition different disciplines might merged coherent integrated parallel paradigm arisen study action termed motor cognition concerned understanding representation action associated process according received view cognitive sciences development human ability process store apply information others begins social learning onset life young organisms cognize social situations social interaction caregivers knowledge developing yet limited essential question studying social cognition ability appears neurophysiological processes underlie organisms sensorimotor stage development simple reflexes maintain bilateral communication michael tomasello introduced psychological construct shared intentionality explain cognition beginning earlier developmental stage unaware collaboration motherchild researchers developed notion observing collaborative interaction different perspectives eg currently one hypothesis attempts explain neurophysiological processes occurring shared intentionality integral complexity level interpersonal dynamics interaction neuronal one theory social cognition social schema theory although basis social cognition studies example see attribution social schema theory builds uses terminology schema theory cognitive psychology describes ideas concepts represented mind categorized according view see think concept mental representation schema activated bringing mind information linked original concept association activation often happens unconsciously result activating schemas judgements formed go beyond information actually available since many associations schema evokes extend outside given information may influence social cognition behaviour regardless whether judgements accurate example individual introduced teacher teacher schema may activated subsequently might associate person wisdom authority past experiences teachers remember consider important schema accessible quickly activated used particular situation two cognitive processes increase accessibility schemas salience priming salience degree particular social object stands relative social objects situation higher salience object likely schemas object made accessible example one female group seven males female gender schemas may accessible influence groups thinking behavior toward female group priming refers experience immediately prior situation causes schema accessible example watching scary movie late night might increase accessibility frightening schemas increasing likelihood person perceive shadows background noises potential threats social cognition researchers interested new information integrated preestablished schemas especially information contrasts existing example student may preestablished schema teachers assertive bossy encountering teacher timid shy social cognition researcher might interested student integrate new information hisher existing teacher schema preestablished schemas tend guide attention new information people selectively attend information consistent schema ignore information inconsistent referred confirmation bias sometimes inconsistent information subcategorized stored away special case leaving original schema intact without alterations referred subtyping social cognition researchers also interested regulation activated schemas believed situational activation schemas automatic meaning outside individual conscious many situations however schematic information activated may conflict social norms situation case individual motivated inhibit influence schematic information thinking social behaviorcitation needed whether person successfully regulate application activated schemas dependent individual differences selfregulatory ability presence situational impairments executive controlcitation needed high selfregulatory ability lack situational impairments executive functioning increase likelihood individuals successfully inhibit influence automatically activated schemas thinking social behaviorcitation needed people stop suppressing influence unwanted thoughts rebound effect occur thought becomes social cognition refers cognitive processes involved perceiving interpreting responding social information plays central role human behavior critical navigating social interactions relationships several examples demonstrate centrality social cognition human experience humans highly attuned detecting recognizing faces even inanimate objects phenomenon known pareidolia thought evolutionary adaptation helps humans quickly identify potential threats allies environment research shown fusiform gyrus region brain involved face processing particularly sensitive perceiving faces nonface pointlight walkers animations people walking created attaching small lights joints recording movements dark room despite lacking details clothing facial features humans able accurately perceive gender emotion identity walker ability highlights importance social cognition recognizing interpreting human movement behavior research shown evolution human brain closely tied development social cognition prefrontal cortex region brain involved higherlevel cognitive processes decisionmaking social behavior undergone significant expansion humans compared expansion thought reflect increased importance social cognition human evolution social exclusion powerful social stressor elicit emotional physiological responses similar physical response highlights importance social connections acceptance human wellbeing underscores centrality social cognition regulating social behavior social psychologists become increasingly interested influence culture social although people cultures use schemas understand world content schemas found differ individuals based cultural upbringing example one study interviewed scottish settler bantu herdsman swaziland compared schemas cattle essential lifestyle bantu people bantu herdsmans schemas cattle far extensive schemas scottish settler bantu herdsman able distinguish cattle dozens others scottish settler cultural influences found shape basic ways people automatically perceive think example number studies found people grow east asian cultures china japan tend develop holistic thinking styles whereas people brought western cultures like australia usa tend develop analytic thinking typically eastern holistic thinking style type thinking people focus overall context ways objects relate example easterner asked judge classmate feeling heshe might scan everyones face class use information judge individual hand typically western analytic thinking style type thinking style people focus individual objects neglect consider surrounding example westerner asked judge classmate feeling might focus classmates face order make nisbett suggested cultural differences social cognition may stem various philosophical traditions east ie confucianism buddhism versus greek philosophical traditions ie aristotle plato research indicates differences social cognition may originate physical differences environments two cultures one study found scenes japanese cities busier us contain objects compete attention study eastern holistic thinking style focus overall context attributed busier nature japanese physical later studies find differences cognitive style explained differences relational mobility relational mobility measure much choice individuals terms form relationships including friendships romantic partnerships work relations relational mobility low cultures subsistence economy requires tight cooperation coordination farming high cultures based nomadic herding urban industrial cultures crosscultural study found relational mobility lowest east asian countries rice farming common highest south american early interest relationship brain function social cognition includes case phineas gage whose behaviour reported changed accident damaged one frontal lobes recent neuropsychological studies shown brain injuries disrupt social cognitive processes example damage frontal lobes affect emotional responses social performance theory mind temporal lobe damage fusiform gyrus lead inability recognize faces people psychological disorders mood posttraumatic stress disorder williams syndrome antisocial personality fragile x turners show differences social behavior compared unaffected peers parents ptsd show disturbances least one aspect social cognition namely joint attention young children laboratoryinduced relational stressor compared healthy parents without however whether social cognition underpinned domainspecific neural mechanisms still open expanding research field examining conditions may bias cognitive processes involved social interaction conversely biases may lead symptoms associated condition development social cognitive processes infants children also researched
