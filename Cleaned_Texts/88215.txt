kadimakara extinct genus early archosauromorph reptile arcadia formation queensland australia seemingly close relative prolacerta carnivorous reptile possessed moderately long neck generic name kadimakara references prehistoric creatures aboriginal myths may inspired iceage megafauna specific name k australiensis relates fact found prolacerta kadimakara closely related archosauriformes successful group includes archosaurs crocodilians pterosaurs kadimakara known parts skull holotype specimen qmf includes rear part skull fragment right lower jaw specimen recovered fossil site kilometers southwest rolleston queensland geology locale belongs rewan group lower arcadia formation also occasionally elevated status formation rewan rewan formation corresponds induan age beginning triassic period million years ago life begun recover permiantriassic additional specimen also recovered site although closely associated holotype specimen qmf consisted portion snout lower jaws none bones preserved specimen overlapped preserved holotype result definitively proven belonged kadimakara however also lack particular inconsistencies would prohibit belonging like animals preserved rewan formation remains kadimakara encrusted hematite carefully prepared thioglycollic kadimakara roughly half size larger relative prolacerta otherwise quite similar based structure preserved skull bones rear skull shown holotype specimen preserves several bones skull roof notably parietal bones form upper surface skull past level eyes paired bones boxy shape contacted midline skull middle suture line contact hole known pineal foramen modern reptiles contains sensory structure colloquially known third eye immediately behind hole rectangular lowered area bone known median fossa median fossa main feature used differentiate kadimakara close relative prolacerta either lacks specific lowered area entire rear part skull slightly lowered depending individual directly eyes pair bones known frontals small portion bones preserved kadimakara holotype however preserved portion seen stretch along outer edges parietal bones means parietals wedgelike shape seen stretched forward far level orbits kadimakara also lacks postparietals additional bones form rear part parietals many different types archosauromorphs parietal features also shared prolacerta presence lack thereof links kadimakara genus family small wedgelike bone known postfrontal formed upper rear corner orbit eye outer edge parietal bone contacts large hole side skull roof holes known supratemporal fenestrae outer edge hole formed multipronged bone although identity bone controversial original describer kadimakara alan bartholomai considered postorbital bone forms rear edge unusually elongated orbit martin ezcurra reinterpreted bone complex forward extension squamosal bone reinterpretation means orbit rounder much less unusual shape bartholomais original reconstruction actual postorbital bone positioned forward skull unfortunately postorbital mostly lost small sliver bone still present specimen nevertheless postorbital sliver seen contact supratemporal fenestra omitting preserved postfrontal bone contact reinterpretation several implications bone identifications rest skull ventral process lower branch squamosal extends onto cheek region skull contacts smaller crescentshaped bone near jaw joint bartholomais interpretation bone fragment jugal cheek bone ezcurra reinterpreted straplike quadratojugal bone near jaw regardless interpretations rear branch jugal would long enough enclose lower temporal fenestra lower temporal fenestra also known infratemporal fenestra typically large hole side skull although completely enclosed many lepidosaurs group reptiles containing lizards snakes tuatara archosauromorphs prolacerta kadimakara reptiles lower temporal fenestra attained archlike shape kadimakara holotype also preserved fragments braincase rear part palate rear part shallow lower jaw also specimen definitively proven belong kadimakara many features may necessarily apply genus however referral kadimakara likely legitimate due fact snout bones closely resemble prolacerta maxilla main toothed bone snout covered shallow longitudinal furrows otherwise conventional design large main body wedgelike prong extending backwards contact jugal bone several teeth also preserved attached maxilla teeth sharp curved flattened side indicating kadimakara carnivorous reptile teeth set deep sockets fused bone several areas rear edge maxilla clearly connects smaller bone known lacrimal forms front edge orbit upper side snout formed pair large bones known nasals presumably contacted frontals area preserved middle part shallow lower jaw also preserved including teeth similar classification kadimakara prolacerta gone much revision past bartholomais original description published time prolacerta undergoing significant analysis prior prolacerta believed eosuchian ancestral modern reptiles however analysis chris gow provided specific explanation arguing teeth prolacerta kadimakara bartholomai notes particularly similar thecodonts group carnivorous reptiles known archosauromorphs subsequent studies published late supported interpretation bartholomais description kadimakara among earliest support gows time cladistic work refined revised group thecodontia replacing welldefined group archosauromorpha refers reptiles closer crocodilians dinosaurs lizards lepidosaurs transition kadimakara prolacerta kept group known prolacertiformes contained longnecked early archosauromorphs protorosaurus macrocnemus changed study david dilkes found prolacertiformes polyphyletic group consisting various reptiles distantly related notably prolacerta found closely related advanced archosauriformes rather protorosaurus long necked basal archosauromorphs collectively termed unfortunately kadimakara omitted analysis well earlier analyses focusing prolacertiformes noureddine jalils description jesairosaurus reasoning behind omissions mainly related incompleteness kadimakara result unknown whether kadimakara legitimately close relative prolacerta simply unrelated basal archosauromorph incorrectly allied case protorosaurs uncertainty magnified several studies late claimed kadimakara simply pair misidentified specimens kadimakara finally featured phylogenetic analyses martin ezcurras broad study archosauromorphs addition ezcurra redescribed reinterpreted genus able find evidence fact synonymous prolacerta study featured three different phylogenetic analyses analysis concerned holotypes sampled reptiles analysis concerned known specimens complete hypodigm analysis identical analysis except fragmentary taxa excluded due uncertainty referred snouts legitimacy kadimakara actually given two different samples one sample consisted holotype sample consisted holotype referred snout result analysis included holotype sample analyses included holotype referred sample three analyses kadimakara placed sister taxon prolacerta two genera forming family prolacertidae positioned near archosauriformes dilkes studies claimed
