wrist arthroscopy used look inside joint wrist minimally invasive technique utilized diagnostic purposes well therapeutic interventions wrist arthroscopy used diagnostic purposes since first introduced however became accepted diagnostic tool around time arthroscopy wrist innovative technique determine whether problem could found wrist years later wrist arthroscopy could also used therapeutic several therapeutic wrist arthroscopy indications article focus tfcclesion sllesion dorsal ganglion resection distal radius fracturecitation needed tfcc fibrous structure covering radiocarpal distal radioulnar joint tears ligament occur commonly person falls secondary wrist fracture abnormalities tfcc classified palmer classification divides tears traumatic degenerative stages tfcc tears treatable arthroscopic intervention although degenerative stage operated according arthroscopic wafer procedure surgeon debrides tfcc limited part ulnar head patient class tfcc tear different arthroscopic technique used damaged tissue debrided fresh edges available arthroscopic good excellent results reported tfcc class repair patients results arthroscopic wafer procedure good initial treatment patients suspected tear scapholunate lunotriquetral interosseous ligament splint wrist pain instability persists one could undergo open surgery reconstruct scapholunate ligament lunotriquetral shear test may also used arthroscopy today experimental stage research suggest near future reasonable alternative open surgery due faster recovery tear lunotriquetral ligament arthroscopic debridement prime treatment loss reduction symptoms dorsal ganglia resolve spontaneously still patients choose undergo cosmetic intervention resection ganglion nonoperative treatment failed examples nonoperative treatment immobilization splint aspiration ganglion without injection steroid cases ganglia associated serious loss wrist function weakness affected finger makes surgical intervention highly resection dorsal ganglion still widely treated open surgery however recent studies show treatment arthroscopic intervention reasonable alternative arthroscopic intervention advantages smaller incisions faster recovery wrist function less pain postoperative overall outcome arthroscopy superior outcome open surgery recurrence rates final wrist function distal radius fractures might occur person falls outstretched hand foosh immediate pain swelling loss wrist function common symptoms fractures wide variety classification systems arthroscopic intervention difference made extra intraarticular fractures arthroscopy used treat intraarticular distal radius fracture time examine scapholunate ligament lunotriquetral ligament articular shifted bone segment relocated necessary bone autograft used fill fracture end fracture stabilized using percutane wires arthroscopy good results treatment distal radius fracture patiÃ«nts showing good excellent postoperative persistent pain wrist conservative treatment major indication diagnostic wrist arthroscopy conservative treatment consists wrist immobilization oral nsaids andor injection diagnostic wrist arthroscopy may also indicated imaging techniques mri ultrasonography need confirmation observed uncertainties imaging techniques failed establish clear diagnosis makes arthroscopy important diagnostic tool common anomalies around however relying arthroscopic findings setting unclear preoperative diagnosis yields limited diagnostic benefit therefore use limited cases objective clinical surgery started patient positioned way wrist stabilized order patient placed operating table face upward wrist arm operated placed separate operating table side operating table properly stabilize wrist patients elbow flexed forearm immobilized using traction apparatus using traction apparatus also become easier insert general kilograms traction implemented aid finger traps surgeon either opt nylon finger traps wire traps cases nylon finger traps preferred wire traps nylon resilient material thus distributes traction force skin evenly usually traction applied two fingers namely index finger middle finger sometimes may necessary evenly distribute traction force skin patients skin may fragile atrophic traction brought traction apparatus applied three even four surgeon either opt dry arthroscopy wet arthroscopy performing dry procedure wrist still necessary approached using open surgery may example required tfcc lesion diagnosed latter possible wet procedure performed fluid used causes expansion tissue improve visualization within wrist inflow irrigation system used surgery currently several systems available gravity flow hand pump large syringes mechanical infusion pump irrigation lactated ringer solution generally used characteristics lactated ringer solution physiological rapidly absorbed moreover right equipment must available finish complete diagnostic arthroscopy well perform various operative procedures complications using irrigation system fluid extravasation soft tissues forearm result compartment perform wrist arthroscopy surgeon use standard arthroscopy set set contains variety tools diagnostic therapeutic arthroscopic intervention sets currently available contain scopes probes punches graspers joint shavers get clear view wrist high quality camera small diameter mm needed camera attached fiberoptic light source shows image inside joint probes used examination internal structures palpating pulling moving tissue essential diagnostic investigation joint probes bear markings mm intervals indicate scale since cameras used arthroscopy different punches basket forceps sharp edges cut away redundant damaged tissue suction punches punches connected suction pump immediately remove cut tissue joint graspers grasping forceps useful grab tissue floating loosely joint surgeon might want remove particular piece tissue tactile feedback every different arthroscopic intervention set tools depending difficulty type tissue available working recent years wrist arthroscopy becoming familiar technique diagnosis treatment various wrist abnormalities individual surgeons preferences concerning variety available techniques subsection techniques described description commonly used techniques prevent postoperative infections amount pathogens operatingroom minimized order achieve surgeon assistants equipment operation area sterile operation furthermore doors operatingroom opened least limited patient undergo wrist arthroscopy must positioned specific way operation procedure already thoroughly described earlier subsection procedure patient operated every requirement surgery implementedcitation needed perform wrist arthroscopy instruments inserted wrist surgeon start making small incision creating socalled portal different portals discussed next incision made portal used insert scope scope provide visualization way surgeon able orient within joint wrist clear view wrist obtained possible problem identified problem example tfcc lesion may immediately solved operative treatmentcitation needed patient may suffer various illnesses regarding wrist examples include tfcc lesion scapholunate lunotriquetral instability ganglions synovitis illnesses concern many different tissues structures using one portal
