locomotive syndrome medical condition decreased mobility due disorders locomotor locomotor system comprises bones joints muscles nerves concept put forward three professional medical societies japan japanese society musculoskeletal medicine japanese orthopaedic association japanese clinical orthopaedic locomotive syndrome generally found ageing population locomotor functions deteriorate age symptoms locomotive syndrome include limitations joint mobility pain balance disorder malalignment gait locomotive syndrome commonly caused chronic locomotive organ diseases diagnosis assessment locomotive syndrome done using several tests standup twostep risk locomotive syndrome decreased via adequate nutrition attainment exercise habit government japan established insurance system longterm care insurance resolve issue drastic increase japanese elderly people need nursing care imposed heavy financial burden japanese locomotive system disorders took approximately quarter need longterm nursing care subsequently three professional japanese medical societies japanese society musculoskeletal medicine japanese orthopaedic association japanese clinical orthopaedic association put forward idea locomotive syndrome aim enhancing public awareness locomotive syndrome calling plans globally locomotive syndrome prevalence estimated approximately researchers tried determine whether variations locomotive syndrome prevalence sexes two surveys japan showed locomotive syndrome prevalence men lower women nationwide survey participation subjects japan showed estimated locomotive syndrome prevalence men women moreover another nationwide survey subjects showed prevalence men women contrarily different study japan participation subjects indicated difference locomotive syndrome prevalence men women prevalence locomotive syndrome increases people become older highest aged locomotive syndrome prevalence people chronic pain eight times higher general population addition number orthopaedic surgery treatments need hospitalisation drastically rises age reaches peak age main components locomotive system include intervertebral disks joints bones nervous muscular system deterioration locomotive components leads symptoms pain limitation joint mobility malalignment balance disorder gait syndrome progression leads reduced ability perform activities daily living independently eventually results decreased quality life necessity nursing care people locomotive syndrome may able accomplish everyday tasks putting socks standing one leg moderately intensive house chores carrying home pounds shopping walking nonstop may also slip around trip house need hold handrails support whilst climbing degenerative changes main components locomotive system begin middle age generally initial stages progression slow symptoms become obvious pathological degeneration changes become advanced locomotive syndrome generally caused decreased strength muscles balance related ageing locomotive conditions osteoarthritis osteoporosis muscle degeneration becomes common people aged average lose muscle strength hinders ability undertake several physical routine activities elderly people osteoporosis frailty higher risk hip vertebra distal radius humerus fractures cause pain fracture site osteoarthritis medical condition synovial joints abrasion breakdown hyaline cartilage underlying bone cause joint pain thus limit spondylosis pressure spine wears intervertebral discs disfigures bone causes serious pain leads restriction specifically women locomotive syndrome may caused reduced levels bone density physical activity usually happen bone density level decreases level oestrogen hormone essential healthy bones drops causes bone resorption formation additionally women tend smaller bones lower bone mass men increases risk locomotive may also suffer insufficient nutrition due dieting order thin contributes weak diagnosis assessment locomotive syndrome done using short test battery locomotive syndrome stbls established stbls consists standup test twostep test geriatric locomotive function scale results stbl serve guide assess risk presence degree locomotive syndrome two stages locomotive syndrome stage indicates beginning mobility function decline stage indicates progression mobility function individuals locomotive syndrome categorised one two stages depending scores three tests standup test examines measures vertical movement ability body muscle strength lower test evaluates ability stand one legs stools heights difficulty level increases order decreasing stool height using one leg instead two test usually performed increasing order difficulty starting standing using legs cm high stool trial successful individual stand hold position three inability stand cm tall stool using one leg indicator stage locomotive syndrome inability stand cm tall stool using legs indicator stage locomotive twostep test evaluates balance walking ability assessing gait speed maximal step test involves individuals taking two steps forward maximum stride without losing balance standing still feet three distance covered two steps measured divided individuals height obtain twostep value correlates walking speed test done twice highest value noted score less signifies stage locomotive syndrome score less signifies stage locomotive selfadministered questionnaire evaluates pain movementrelated difficulty social activity cognitive status daily activities middleaged elderly scale consists questions referring experiences preceding month addresses four includes questions pain questions pain activities daily living questions social functions questions mental health status question scored scale indicates impairment indicates severe total score ranges serves quantitative evaluation difficulties disabilities activities daily living related locomotor score indicative stage locomotive syndrome score indicative stage locomotive strategies preventing onset progression locomotive syndrome include regular exercise appropriate nutritional intake exercise proven significantly improve motor function limit decline functional capacity habitual exercise main method locomotive syndrome prevention joa proposed set exercises called locomotion training locotra aimed improvement physical function middleaged elderly locotra consists singleleg standing eyes open squats heel raises front exercises help improve balance muscle strength lower extremities vital activities daily singleleg standing eyes open exercise effectively improves balance prevents individuals required raise one foot cm eyes open minute exercise done near stable surface desk prevent falling three repetitions leg daily squatting proven improve strength balance lower body independence activities daily squatting involves lowering torso standing position returning upright position proper squatting technique requires individuals maintain position knees toes knee flexion angle three sets repetitions recommended heel raises involve raising lowering heels standing balls feet exercise strengthens triceps muscles lower extremities associated gait speed fall two three sets repetitions recommended front lunges performed lowering upper body slowly bringing body back keeping one foot forward line back foot front lunges improve muscle strength balance flexibility lower extremities lower limb muscles activated two three sets repetitions daily addition exercise nutritional improvement helps improvement sustainment motor maintaining wellbalanced diet healthy body weight help keep musculoskeletal system healthy overnutrition increases risk locomotive syndrome extra body weight puts added strain back oppositely undernutrition reduces bone muscle mass leading osteoporosis sarcopenia joa recommends eating three proper meals day obtain balanced mix five major nutrients carbohydrates fat protein vitamins nutrients essential proper maintenance locomotor system steady supply calcium protein vitamin vitamin k required constant regeneration mg calcium per day recommended prevent protein supplementation shown additive effects exercise vitamin enhances calcium absorption gut vitamin k plays role formation bones maintenance bone important nutrients involved bone formation include magnesium folic acid vitamin vitamin hand overconsumption sodium phosphate caffeine hinders calcium protein vitamin also help formation maintenance httpsenwikipediaorgwikilocomotivesyndrome
