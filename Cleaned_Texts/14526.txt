priming idea exposure one stimulus may influence response subsequent stimulus without conscious guidance priming effect refers positive negative effect rapidly presented stimulus priming stimulus processing second stimulus target stimulus appears shortly generally speaking generation priming effect depends existence positive negative relationship priming target stimuli example word nurse might recognized quickly following word doctor following word bread priming perceptual associative repetitive positive negative affective semantic conceptual priming effects involve word recognition semantic processing attention unconscious processing many issues related differences various writing systems research however yet firmly establish duration priming yet onset almost priming works effectively two stimuli modality example visual priming works best visual cues verbal priming works best verbal cues priming also occurs semantically related words doctor priming research generally doubt due replication publication experimenter terms positive negative priming refer priming affects speed processing positive prime speeds processing negative prime lowers speed slower unprimed positive priming caused simply experiencing negative priming caused experiencing stimulus ignoring positive priming effects happen even prime consciously effects positive negative priming visible eventrelated potential erp positive priming thought caused spreading means first stimulus activates parts particular representation association memory carrying action task representation already partially activated second stimulus encountered less additional activation needed one become consciously aware negative priming difficult explain many models hypothesized currently widely accepted distractor inhibition episodic retrieval distractor inhibition model activation ignored stimuli inhibited episodic retrieval model hypothesizes ignored items flagged donotrespond brain later brain acts retrieve information tag causes conflict time taken resolve conflict causes negative although models still valid recent scientific research led scientists lean away distractor inhibitor difference perceptual conceptual types priming whether items similar form items similar meaning primed respectively perceptual priming based form stimulus enhanced match early later stimuli perceptual priming sensitive modality exact format stimulus example perceptual priming identification incomplete word wordstem completion test presentation visual prime perfectly consistent later testing presentations order work studies shown example absolute size stimuli vary still provide significant evidence conceptual priming based meaning stimulus enhanced semantic tasks example word table show conceptual priming effects word chair words belong repetition priming also called direct priming form positive priming stimulus experienced also primed means later experiences stimulus processed quickly effect found words lexical decision task semantic priming prime target semantic category share example word dog semantic prime wolf two similar animals semantic priming theorized work spreading activation within associative person thinks one item category similar items stimulated brain even words morphemes prime complete words include example would morpheme psych prime word psychology support detail individual processes word sometimes word affected prior word linked semantically previous studies conducted focusing priming effects rapid rise time hasty decay time example experiment donald foss researched decay time semantic facilitation lists sentences three experiments conducted found semantic relationships within words differs words occur sentences rather lists thus supporting ongoing discourse associative priming target word high probability appearing prime associated necessarily related semantic features word dog associative prime cat since words closely associated frequently appear together phrases like raining cats similar effect known context priming context priming works using context speed processing stimuli likely occur context useful application effect reading written grammar vocabulary sentence provide contextual clues words occur later sentence later words processed quickly read alone effect greater difficult uncommon psychology visual perception motor control term response priming denotes special form visuomotor priming effect distinctive feature response priming prime target presented quick succession typically less milliseconds apart coupled identical alternative motor speeded motor response performed classify target stimulus prime immediately preceding target thus induce response conflicts assigned different response target response conflicts observable effects motor behavior leading priming effects eg response times error rates special property response priming independence visual awareness prime example response priming effects increase conditions visual awareness prime masked priming paradigm widely used last two decades order investigate orthographic phonological activations visual word recognition term masked refers fact prime word pseudoword masked symbols presented forward manner prime backward manner prime masks enable diminish visibility prime prime usually presented less ms typically ms paradigm short soa stimuli onset asynchrony ie time delay onset mask prime associated masking make masked priming paradigm good tool investigate automatic irrespective activations visual word forster argued masked priming purer form priming conscious appreciation relationship prime target effectively eliminated thus removes subjects ability use prime strategically make decisions results numerous experiments show certain forms priming occur difficult occur visible primes one example formpriming prime similar identical target eg words nature form priming known affected several psycholinguistic properties primetarget frequency overlap prime higher frequency target lexical competition occurs whereas target higher frequency prime prime preactivates prime target differ one letter one phoneme prime competes target leading lexical affected prime target also individual differences people wellestablished lexical representations likely show lexical competition people lessestablished lexical kindness priming specific form priming occurs subject experiences act kindness subsequently experiences lower threshold activation subsequently encountering positive stimuli unique feature kindness priming causes temporarily increased resistance negative stimuli addition increased activation positive associative form priming closely related affect priming affective affect priming entails evaluation people ideas objects goods etc based physical features things also affective context research concepts affective priming derive affective priming paradigm people asked evaluate respond stimuli following positive neutral negative primes research suggests valence positive vs negative stronger effect arousal low vs high lexicaldecision affective priming might also diffuse stronger prime barely enters conscious evaluation emotions primed emotions well thus neutral pictures presented unpleasant pictures perceived pleasant presented pleasant cultural priming technique employed field crosscultural psychology social psychology understand people interpret events concepts like cultural frame switching example hung associate display participants different set culture related images like us capitol building vs chinese temple watch clip fish swimming ahead group exposed latter one hong kong participants likely reason collectivistic contrast counterparts view western images likely give reverse response focus individual people biculture society primed different cultural icons inclined make cultural activated one method pronoun circling task type cultural priming task involves asking participants consciously circle pronouns like us paragraph antipriming measurable impairment processing information owing recent processing information representations information overlap compete strengthening one representation usage causes priming item also antipriming nonrepeated example one study identification accuracy old chinese characters significantly higher baseline measurements ie priming effect identification accuracy novel characters significantly lower baseline measurements ie antipriming antipriming said natural antithesis repetition priming manifests two objects share component features thereby overlapping however one study failed find antipriming effects picturenaming task even though repetition priming effects observed researchers argue antipriming effects may observed small replicability interpretation goalpriming findings become studies failed replicate findings including age additional reports failure replicate findings socialdistance also priming often considered play part success sensory branding products connected ideas like crossmodal correspondencies sensation transference known effects eg consumers perceiving lemonade suddenly sweeter logo drink saturated towards although result yet replicated independent study although semantic associative form priming well longerterm priming effects replicated studies casting doubt
