cat gap period fossil record approximately million million years ago fossils cats catlike species found north america cause cat gap disputed may caused changes climate global cooling changes habitat environmental ecosystem increasingly hypercarnivorous trend cats especially nimravids volcanic activity evolutionary changes dental morphology canidae species present north america periodicity extinctions called van der hammen modern carnivorans including cats evolved miacoids existed approximately million years ago earlier catlike species proailurus meaning cat also called lemans dawn cat appeared million years ago generally considered first true following appearance dawn cat little fossil record million years suggest cats would prosper fact although proailurus persisted least million years felid fossils towards end dawn cats reign paleontologists refer cat gap turning point cats came appearance new genus felids increase disparity early miocene occurs time feliform fossils found north america hypercarnivorous nimravid feliforms extinct north america felids arrive north america middle miocene appearance pseudaelurus pseudaelurus crossed north america way bering land bridge surviving populations asia million years ago modernday cats descended pseudaelurus nimravids barbourofelids sabertoothed catlike animals families nimravidae barbourofelidae respectively although true cats family felidae closely related felids nimravidae either basal feliforms sister group feliforms caniforms barbourofelidae sister group felidae physically nimravidae barbourofelidae resembled sabertoothed cat smilodon would appear many millions years later nimravidae also became extinct north america cat history carnivorous mammals characterized series riseandfall patterns diversification declining clades replaced phylogenetically distinct functionally similar clades past million years successive clades small large carnivorous mammals diversified declined extinction instances cause decline energetic constraints pervasive selection larger size copes rule lead hypercarnivory dietary specialization hypercarnivory leads increased vulnerability extinction nimravids large catlike animals occupied ecomorphic niche ecosystem highly likely hypercarnivory led extinction north america extinction nimravids feliform felidlike species felids arrived eurasia crossing bering land bridge million years ago time great diversity among carnivorous mammals north america hypocarnivorous hypercarnivorous species hypercarnivorous species existed cat gap another possible explanation extinction feliforms north america changes ecology continent evidence geologic temperature record shows earth experiencing period global cooling causing forests give way climatic changes arid conditions muted variation coincides first appearance hoglike creodonts pocket gophers also beginning cat gap entelodont gap period million years nimravids felids entelodonts north america faunal overturn basis division arikareean time period arikareen nalma north american landmammal ages monroecreekian period harrisonian period catlike creatures die north america surviving eurasia replacement true cats fate may owed factors created diversity herbivorous mammals cats need forest cover hunt increasingly open america nimravids may found without ecological perch hunt particularly competition dogs prevented colonising volcanic activity also promoted possible cause cat gap well extinctions time period la garita caldera large volcanic caldera located san juan mountains southwestern colorado united states one number calderas formed massive ignimbrite flareup colorado utah nevada oligocene epoch la garita caldera site fish canyon eruption enormous eruption million years ago scale fish canyon eruption far beyond anything known human history erupting cu mi vei magnitude possibly energetic event earth since chicxulub impact thought many paleontologists caused extinction dinosaurs extinction event resulting explosive volcanism probably ejected large amounts dust debris stratosphere causing major cooling see volcanic winter climatic effects could also caused sulphur ejected stratosphere rapidly converts sulphuric acid aerosol cools troposphere blocking incoming solar radiation another possible cause cat gap could late cenozoic ice age began million years ago ice age caused glaciation antarctica eventually spread arctic regions southern alaska greenland iceland glaciers north american continent well cooling trend could made ecosystem uninhabitable feliformia catlike species although habitable coldweather caniformia species canids doglike species mustelids weasellike species ursids bearlike species also evidence miocene sill surrounding arctic ocean known ridge subsided allowing cold polar water escape north atlantic salinity north atlantic grew outflow cold polar water increased thermohaline circulation increased vigour providing mild winter temperatures large amounts moisture north atlantic prerequisites buildup large continental ice caps adjacent cold suggested result cat gap caniforms doglike species including canids bears weasels related taxa evolved fill carnivorous hypercarnivorous ecological niches would otherwise filled conclusion however prior cat gap numerous caniform species evolve catlike features indicative hypercarnivory reduced snouts somewhat enlarged canines fairly extreme reduction crushing molars north america first caniform group moderate body size move direction hypercarnivory endemic hesperocyonine canids three genera parenhydrocyon enhydrocyon mesocyon ranging size jackals small coyotes appearing early arikareean circa mya notably three evolved alongside last hyaenodont remaining three nimravids two pumasized small hypercarnivorous canids soon joined ultimately replaced numerous species families also evolved specialized meateating teeth skulls included least three larger genera similarly adapted amphicyonids one endemic daphoenodon two old world temnocyon mammocyon leopardsized mustelid megalictis well two hypercarnivorous bears hemicyonines cephalogale however paleontologists take issue conclusion suggested canids evolved hypercarnivorous morphologies feliforms absent period catgap data presented support hypothesis calculated morphospace canids never occupy area morphospace felids nimravids hypercarnivorous creodonts found pertinent issue hand however hypercarnivorous canids present disappearance nimravids became extinct appearance felids progressive marked decrease hypercarnivorous forms catgap characterized average extinction intensities average origination intensities marked increase origination intensity showed decrease extinction intensity large increase origination intensity nonetheless despite increased origination intensities decreased extinction intensities near end catgap still substantial invasion hypercarnivorous morphospace immigration felids
