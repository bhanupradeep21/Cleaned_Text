mist nets used hunters poachers also ornithologists chiropterologists capture wild birds bats banding research projects mist nets typically made nylon polyester mesh suspended two poles resembling volleyball net properly deployed correct habitat nets virtually invisible mist nets shelves created horizontally strung lines create loose baggy pocket bird bat hits net falls pocket becomes tangled mesh size netting varies according size species targeted capture mesh sizes measured along one side edge single mesh square along diagonal square measures given along diagonal small passerines typically captured mm mesh larger birds like hawks ducks captured using mesh sizes mm net dimensions vary widely depending proposed use net height avian mist netting typically net width may vary although longer nets may also used dhogazza type mist net used larger birds raptors net lacks shelves purchase use mist nets requires permits vary according country states wildlife regulations mist net handling requires skill optimal placement avoiding entangling nets vegetation proper storage bird bat handling requires extensive training avoid injury captured animals bat handling may especially difficult since bats captured night may bite research survey found mist netting result low rates injury providing high scientific mist nets used japanese hunters nearly years capture birds first introduced use ornithology united states america oliver l austin mist netting popular important tool monitoring species diversity relative abundance population size demography two ways mist nets primarily utilized target netting specific species individuals broadcast netting birds within particular area targeted netting typically used scientific studies examine single species nets deployed manner often use playback species song call model species placed near net lure targeted individuals net broadcast netting captures birds indiscriminately technique better suited examining species occur within specific habitat bird banding stations throughout united states use method typically stations collect set standard measurements individual including mass wing chord breeding status body fat index sex age molt status although setting mist nets timeconsuming requires certification certain advantages compared visual aural monitoring techniques sampling species may poorly detected ways also allows easy standardization handson examination reduces misidentification species allow scientists examine species close mist nets often used markrecapture studies extended periods time detect trends population uses data collected using mist net sampling still debate whether techniques provide precise data suggested mist netting used supplement aural visual methods observation one main disadvantages mist nets numbers captured may represent small proportion true population mist netting unique method provides demographic estimates throughout seasons offers valuable guides relative abundance certain species birds andor mist nets important tools collecting data reveal critical ecological conditions variety situations summarized study effects forest fragmentation amazonian

human activities environmental changes one example use mist nets tool ecological biological sciences mist net data also ecosystem management implications use mist nets several disadvantages mistnetting timeconsuming nets set without mistakes animal caught mist net becomes entangled net must checked often animal removed promptly disentangling animal mist net difficult must done carefully
