flies consume fruit gain nutrients proceed pupal stage parasitism led extensive economic costs nations central papaya plants grow three sexes male female hermaphrodite male produces pollen never fruit female produces small inedible fruits unless pollinated hermaphrodite selfpollinate since flowers contain male stamens female ovaries almost commercial papaya orchards contain originally southern
