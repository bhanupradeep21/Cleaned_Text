parents apparent desire child child returns home assaulted suffer permanent brain damage death id p inasmuch common knowledge exception foregoing rule apply facts alleged trial court could properly conclude matter law defendants standard professional care include diagnostic treatment procedures outlined complaint plaintiff therefore entitled opportunity prove way expert testimony circumstances case reasonably prudent physician would followed procedures whether physician would followed procedure reporting plaintiffs injuries authorities however solely question good medical practice abovecited reporting statutes pen code force evidence determination legislature event physician diagnose battered child syndrome due care includes duty report fact authorities words since enactment

admissible mandatory statute also lays rest defendant floods concern required report findings authorities might held liable violation physicianpatient section specifically exempts physician civil criminal liability making report pursuant terms defendants complain first cause action nevertheless fatally defective assertedly fails allege certain specific facts ie dr flood negligently treated plaintiffs leg fracture proper treatment fracture bruises plaintiffs back included taking xray skull dr flood negligently failed ask plaintiffs mother explanation cause fracture none allegations

defendants raise two questions statutory interpretation contend even plaintiff may rely penal code section case invoke sections latter general statutes assertedly superseded former special statute topic supersession occurs provisions inconsistent case sections directed different classes persons hence inconsistent complementary sections hand duplicative extent former deals physical injuries unlawfully inflicted minors latter deals observation injuries inasmuch penalty provided violation section present irreconcilable conflict requiring one give way nothing prevent legislature imposing
