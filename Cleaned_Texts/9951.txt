immunization immunisation process individuals immune system becomes fortified infectious agent known immunogen system exposed molecules foreign body called nonself orchestrate immune response also develop ability quickly respond subsequent encounter immunological memory function adaptive immune system therefore exposing human animal immunogen controlled way body learn protect called active immunization important elements immune system improved immunization cells b cells antibodies b cells produce memory b cells memory cells responsible swift response second encounter foreign molecule passive immunization direct introduction elements body instead production elements body immunization happens various ways wild done human efforts health care natural immunity gained organisms whose immune systems succeed fighting previous infection relevant pathogen one immunization even possible natural immunity degrees effectiveness partial rather absolute may fade time within months years decades depending pathogen health care main technique artificial induction immunity major form prevention disease whether prevention infection pathogen fails mount sufficient reproduction host prevention severe disease infection still happens severe vaccination vaccinepreventable diseases major relief disease burden even though usually eradicate disease vaccines microorganisms cause diseases prepare bodys immune system thus helping fight prevent infection fact mutations cause cancer cells produce proteins molecules known body forms theoretical basis therapeutic cancer vaccines molecules used immunization well example experimental vaccines nicotine nicvax hormone ghrelin experiments create obesity vaccine immunizations often widely stated less risky easier way become immune particular disease risking milder form disease important adults children protect us many diseases immunization protects children deadly diseases also helps developing childrens immune use immunizations infections diseases almost completely eradicated throughout world one example polio thanks dedicated health care professionals parents children vaccinated schedule polio eliminated us since polio still found parts world certain people could still risk getting includes people never vaccine receive doses vaccine traveling areas world polio still prevalent active immunizationvaccination named one ten great public health achievements century introduction vaccines people could become immune infectious disease contracting disease surviving smallpox variola prevented way inoculation produced milder effect natural disease first clear reference smallpox inoculation made chinese author wan quan douzhen xinfa 痘疹心法 published china powdered smallpox scabs blown noses healthy patients would develop mild case disease immune technique mortality rate considerably less mortality rate disease two reports chinese practice inoculation received royal society london one dr martin lister received report employee east india company stationed china another clopton according voltaire turks derived use inoculation neighbouring circassia voltaire speculate circassians derived technique though reports chinese practiced hundred introduced england turkey lady mary wortley montagu used zabdiel boylston boston year edward jenner introduced inoculation cowpox smallpox vaccine much safer procedure procedure referred vaccination gradually replaced smallpox inoculation called variolation distinguish vaccination vaccinevaccination referred smallpox louis pasteur developed immunization methods chicken cholera anthrax animals human rabies suggested terms vaccinevaccination extended cover new procedures cause confusion care taken specify vaccine used eg measles vaccine influenza vaccine immunization achieved active passive manner vaccination active form immunization active immunization occur naturally person comes contact example microbe immune system eventually create antibodies defenses microbe next time immune response microbe efficient case many childhood infections person contracts immune artificial active immunization microbe parts injected person able take naturally whole microbes used pretreated importance immunization great american centers disease control prevention named one ten great public health achievements live attenuated vaccines decreased pathogenicity effectiveness depends immune systems ability replicate elicits response similar natural infection usually effective single dose examples live attenuated vaccines include measles mumps rubella mmr yellow fever varicella rotavirus influenza laiv passive immunization presynthesized elements immune system transferred person body need produce elements currently antibodies used passive immunization method immunization begins work quickly short lasting antibodies naturally broken b cells produce antibodies disappear passive immunization occurs physiologically antibodies transferred mother fetus pregnancy protect fetus shortly birth artificial passive immunization normally administered injection used recent outbreak particular disease emergency treatment toxicity tetanus antibodies produced animals called serum therapy although high chance anaphylactic shock immunity animal serum thus humanized antibodies produced vitro cell culture used instead available immunizations impose known positive consumer externality society addition providing individual protection certain antigens adds greater protection individuals society herd immunity extra protection accounted market transactions immunizations see undervaluing marginal benefit immunization market failure caused individuals making decisions based private marginal benefit instead social marginal benefit societys undervaluing immunizations means normal market transactions end quantity lower socially example individual values immunity antigen immunization costs individual decide receiving immunization however added benefit herd immunity means person b values person immunity total social marginal benefit immunization individual private marginal benefit lower social marginal benefit leads underconsumption immunizations private marginal benefits lower social marginal benefits always lead underconsumption good size disparity determined value society places different immunization many times immunizations reach socially optimum quantity high enough eradicate antigen instead reach social quantity allows optimal amount sick individuals commonly immunized diseases united states still see small presence occasional larger outbreaks measles good example disease whose social optimum leaves enough room outbreaks united states often lead deaths handful also examples illnesses dangerous social optimum ended eradication virus smallpox cases social marginal benefit large society willing pay cost reach level immunization makes spread survival disease impossible despite severity certain illnesses cost immunization versus social marginal benefit means total eradication always end goal immunization though hard tell exactly socially optimal outcome know eradication disease immunization exists order internalize positive externality imposed immunizations payments equal marginal benefit must made countries like united states payment usually come form subsidies government immunization programs united states run local state level governments inconsistency subsidies lead regions united states reaching socially optimal quantity regions left without subsidies remained private marginal benefit level immunizations since vaccination assistance act united states whole moving towards socially optimal outcome larger despite government subsidies difficult tell social optimum achieved addition hardships determining true social marginal benefit immunizations see cultural movements shifting private marginal benefit curves vaccine controversies changed way private citizens view marginal benefit immunized individual believes large health risk possibly larger antigen associated immunization willing pay receive immunization fewer willing participants widening marginal benefit reaching social optimum becomes difficult governments achieve subsidies outside government intervention subsidies non profit organizations also move society towards socially optimal outcome providing free immunizations developing regions without ability afford immunizations begin developing societies able reach quantity determined private marginal benefits running immunization programs organizations able move privately underimmunized communities towards social optimum united states race ethnicity strong determinants utilization preventive
