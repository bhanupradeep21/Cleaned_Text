sexual reproduction adaptive feature common almost multicellular organisms various unicellular organisms currently adaptive advantage sexual reproduction widely regarded major unsolved problem biology discussed one prominent theory sex evolved efficient mechanism producing variation advantage enabling organisms adapt changing another prominent theory also discussed primary advantage outcrossing sex

advantages asexual reproduction important advantages source needed advantage due genetic variation three possible reasons might happen first sexual reproduction combine effects two beneficial mutations individual ie sex aids spread advantageous traits also necessary mutations occurred one another single line source second sex acts bring together currently deleterious mutations create severely unfit individuals eliminated population ie sex aids removal deleterious genes however organisms containing one set chromosomes deleterious mutations would eliminated immediately therefore removal harmful mutations unlikely benefit sexual reproduction lastly sex creates new gene combinations may fit previously existing ones may simply lead reduced competition among relatives advantage due dna repair immediate large benefit removing dna damage recombinational dna repair meiosis since removal allows greater survival progeny undamaged dna advantage complementation sexual partner
