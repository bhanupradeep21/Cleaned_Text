genealogical information traditionally basic information needed ensure correct identification person place names occupations family names first names dates however modern genealogists greatly expand list recognizing need place information historical context order properly evaluate genealogical evidence distinguish samename individuals great deal information available british growing resources ethnic family names simultaneously one important pieces genealogical information source significant confusion many cultures name person refers family belongs called family name surname last name patronymics names identify individual based fathers name example marga olafsdottir marga daughter olaf olaf thorsson olaf son thor many cultures used patronymics surnames adopted came use dutch new york example used patronymic system names advent english rule mandated surname iceland patronymics used majority denmark norway patronymics farm names generally use century beyond though surnames began come fashion toward end century parts country laws requiring surnames transmission names across generations marriages relationships immigration may cause difficulty genealogical research instance women many cultures routinely used spouses surnames woman remarried may changed name names children name changed names birth name maiden name may reflected childrens middle names middle name dropped children may sometimes assume stepparent foster parent adoptive parent names official records may reflect many kinds surname change without explaining underlying reason change correct identification person recorded identified one name challenging immigrants america often americanized surname data may found trade directories census returns birth death marriage records genealogical data regarding given names first names subject many problems family names place names additionally use nicknames common example beth lizzie betty common elizabeth jack john jonathan may interchanged middle names provide additional information middle names may inherited follow naming customs treated part family name instance latin cultures mothers family name fathers family name used children historically naming traditions existed places cultures even areas tended use naming conventions however means universal families may used time among children pattern might also broken name newborn recently deceased sibling aunt uncle example naming tradition england scotland ireland another example areas germany siblings given first name often favourite saint local nobility different second names known rufname child died next child gender born may given name uncommon list particular couples children show one two names repeated personal names periods popularity uncommon find many similarly named people generation even similarly named families eg william mary children david mary john many names may identified strongly particular gender eg william boys mary girls others may ambiguous eg lee slightly variant spellings based gender eg frances usually female francis usually male locations ancestors residences life events core elements genealogists quest often confusing place names may subject variant spellings partially literate scribes locations may identical similar names example village name brockton occurs six times border area english counties shropshire

remember person may change occupations titles change time well workers longer fit primary trade often took less prestigious jobs later life others moved upwards many unskilled ancestors variety jobs depending season local trade requirements census returns may contain embellishment eg labourer mason journeyman master craftsman names old unfamiliar local occupations may cause confusion poorly

community watchmaking framework knitting gunmaking occupational data may reported occupational licences tax assessments membership records professional organizations trade directories census returns vital records civil registration occupational dictionaries available explain many obscure archaic information found historical genealogical sources unreliable good practice evaluate sources critical eye factors influencing reliability genealogical information include knowledge informant writer bias mental state informant writer passage time potential copying compiling errors quality census data special interest historians investigated reliability informant individual provided recorded information genealogists must carefully consider provided information knew many cases informant identified record example death certificate usually two informants physician provides information time cause death family member provides birth date names parents etc informant identified one sometimes deduce information identity person careful examination source one first consider alive nearby record created informant also person recording information handwriting compared handwriting samples source provide clues informant genealogists treat source caution sources useful compared independent sources example census record given much weight informant unknown however censuses several years concur piece information would likely guessed neighbor likely information censuses provided family member informed person hand information single census confirmed information undocumented compiled genealogy

therefore general rule data recorded soon event usually reliable data recorded many years later however types data difficult recall many years others one type especially prone recollection errors dates also ability recall affected significance event individual values may affected cultural individual preferences genealogists must consider effects copying compiling errors may information source reason sources generally categorized two categories original derivative original source one based another source derivative source information taken another source distinction important time source copied information record may lost errors may result copyist misreading mistyping miswriting information genealogists consider number times information copied types derivation piece information undergone types derivatives include photocopies transcriptions abstracts translations extractions compilations addition copying errors compiled sources published genealogies online pedigree databases susceptible misidentification errors incorrect conclusions based circumstantial evidence identity errors usually occur two individuals assumed person circumstantial indirect evidence explicitly answer
