social recognition pair bonding anxiety ingroup bias situational lack honesty autism maternal oxytocin believed significant role social learning indicators oxytocin may help decrease noise brains auditory system increase perception social cues support targeted social behavior may also enhance reward responses however effects may influenced context presence familiar unfamiliar peripheral

appears similar effect oxytocin role social behaviors many species likely also humans study humans dog oxytocin levels blood rose five minute petting session possibly plays role emotional bonding humans oxytocin correlated preferences individuals associate members group also evident conflicts members different groups conflict individuals receiving nasally administered oxytocin demonstrate

hypothesized hormone may factor xenophobic tendencies secondary effect thus oxytocin appears affect individuals international level ingroup becomes specific home country outgroup grows include countries oxytocin typically remembered effect prosocial behaviors role facilitating trust attachment evidence however oxytocin complex role solely enhancing prosocial behaviors consensus oxytocin modulates fear anxiety directly elicit fear two dominant theories explain role oxytocin fear anxiety one theory states oxytocin increases approachavoidance certain social stimuli second theory states oxytocin increases salience certain social stimuli causing animals including humans pay closer attention socially relevant nasally administered oxytocin reported reduce fear possibly inhibiting amygdala thought responsible fear indeed studies rodents shown oxytocin efficiently inhibit fear responses activating inhibitory circuit within researchers argued oxytocin general enhancing effect social emotions since intranasal administration oxytocin also increases envy individuals receive intranasal dose oxytocin identify facial expressions disgust quickly individuals receive evidence facial expressions disgust evolutionarily linked idea contagion thus oxytocin increases salience cues imply contamination leads faster response cues especially relevant survival another study administration oxytocin individuals displayed enhanced ability recognize expressions fear compared individuals received oxytocin modulates fear responses enhancing maintenance social memories rats genetically modified surplus oxytocin receptors display greater fear response previously conditioned stressor oxytocin enhances aversive social memory leading rat display greater fear response aversive stimulus encountered oxytocin produces antidepressantlike effects animal models deficit may involved pathophysiology depression antidepressantlike effects oxytocin blocked selective

accordance may promise shown oxytocin differentially affects males females females administered oxytocin overall faster responding socially relevant stimuli males received additionally administration oxytocin females show increased amygdala activity response threatening scenes however males show increased amygdala activation phenomenon explained looking role gonadal hormones specifically estrogen modulate enhanced threat processing seen females estrogen shown stimulate release oxytocin hypothalamus promote receptor binding also shown testosterone directly suppresses oxytocin hypothesized
