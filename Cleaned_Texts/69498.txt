drotrecogin alfa activated xigris marketed eli lilly company recombinant form human activated protein c antithrombotic antiinflammatory profibrinolytic properties drotrecogin alpha activated belongs class serine proteases drotrecogin alfa found improve outcomes people severe sepsis manufacturers aggressive strategies marketing use severe sepsis october eli lilly co withdrew xigris market major study showed efficacy treatment drotrecogin alfa improve mortality severe sepsis septic shock increase bleeding risks therefore cochrane review recommended clinicians policymakers recommend use eli lilly announced discontinuation clinical following patients receive drotrecogin following patients increased risk bleeding complications due drotrecoginalpha therapy careful riskbenefit assessment made prior initiating therapy although patients high risk bleeding excluded phase iii clinical study prowess patients treated drotrecogin receiving placebo experienced least one bleeding event principally ecchymoses gi bleeding study periodcitation needed treatment serious bleeding events eg intracranial hemorrhage lifethreatening bleeding event bleeding event requiring administration least units packed red blood cells daily consecutive days occurred patients treated drotrecogin receiving placebo significant differences geriatric patients younger patients regarding bleeding events drotrecogin group found sideeffects observed farcitation needed meantime second study encompassing approximately adult patients completed results showed comparable sideeffect profilecitation needed drug interactions drotrecogin systematically studied patients severe sepsis caution exercised using drugs affect hemostasis concomitantly drotrecogin eg aspirin warfarin clopidogrel however use low dose prophylactic heparin affect safety given concurrently drotrecogin specific mechanisms drotrecogin exerts effect survival patients severe sepsis completely understood vitro data suggest activated protein c exerts antithrombotic effect inhibiting factors va viiia indirect profibrinolytic activity inhibiting plasminogen activator needed vitro data also suggest activated protein c may exert antiinflammatory effect inhibiting tumor necrosis factor production blocking leukocyte adhesion selectins limiting thrombininduced inflammatory responses within microvascular endotheliumcitation needed dosage guidelines followed drug reaches peak plasma levels two hours completely cleared plasma two hours termination infusion periodcitation needed endogenous plasma protease inhibitors deactivate drotrecogin therefore dose adjustment needed elderly patients patients renal hepatic dysfunction xigris current brand name activated drotrecogin alfa manufactured eli lilly drug sold vials
