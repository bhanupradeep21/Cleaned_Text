double aortic arch relatively rare congenital cardiovascular malformation daa anomaly aortic arch two aortic arches form complete vascular ring compress trachea andor commonly larger dominant right arch behind smaller hypoplastic left aortic arch front tracheaesophagus two arches join form descending aorta usually left side may rightsided midline cases end smaller left aortic arch closes left atretic arch vascular tissue becomes fibrous cord although cases complete ring two patent aortic arches present term vascular ring accepted generic term even anomalies symptoms related compression trachea esophagus complete vascular ring diagnosis often suspected made chest xray barium esophagram echocardiography computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri show relationship aortic arches trachea esophagus also degree tracheal narrowing bronchoscopy useful internally assessing degree tracheomalacia treatment surgical indicated symptomatic patients current era risk mortality significant morbidity surgical division lesser arch low however preoperative degree tracheomalacia important impact postoperative recovery certain patients may take several months years obstructive respiratory symptoms wheezing disappear symptoms caused vascular compression airway esophagus presentation often within first month neonatal period usually within first months life starting birth inspiratory expiratory stridor high pitch noise turbulent airflow trachea may present often combination expiratory wheeze severity stridor may depend patient body position worse baby lying back rather side sometimes stridor relieved extending neck lifting chin parents may notice baby cry hoarse breathing noisy frequently persistent cough present airway obstruction significant may episodes severe cyanosis blue baby lead unconsciousness recurrent respiratory infections common secondary pulmonary secretions increase airway obstructioncitation needed secondary compression esophagus babies often feed poorly may difficulties swallowing liquids choking regurgitating increased respiratory obstruction feeding older patients might refuse take solid food although infants severe symptoms nowadays operated upon offered solid food occasionally patients double aortic arches present late later childhood adulthood symptoms may mimic asthmacitation needed little known regarding exact causes aortic arch anomalies however association chromosome deletion digeorge syndrome implies genetic component likely certain esophageal atresia also occurs patients double aortic prenatal diagnosis fetal ultrasound today diagnosis double aortic arch obtained inutero experienced scheduled repair soon birth symptomatic patients relieve tracheal compression early therefore potentially prevent development severe tracheomalacia chest xray plain chest xrays patients double aortic arch may appear normal often show dominant right aortic arch two aortic arches might evidence tracheal deviation andor compression sometimes patients present radiologic findings pneumonia barium swallow esophagraphy historically esophagram used gold standard diagnosis double aortic arch patients double aortic arch esophagus shows left rightsided indentations vascular compression due bloodpressure related movement aorta two arches moving images bariumfilled esophagus demonstrate typical pulsatile nature obstruction indentation dominant right arch usually deeper higher compared dent left arch bronchoscopy although bronchoscopy routinely done patients suspected confirmed double aortic arch visualize sites severity pulsatile tracheal compression echocardiography babies age months echocardiography considered sensitive specific making diagnosis double aortic arch arches open nonperfused elements types vascular rings eg left arch atretic closed end ligamentum arteriosum might difficult visualize echocardiography computed tomography ct computed tomography application contrast media usually diagnostically accurate shows relationship arches trachea bronchi magnetic resonance imaging mri magnetic resonance imaging provides excellent images trachea surrounding vascular structures advantage using radiation imaging compared computed tomography cardiac catherizationaortography today patients double aortic arch usually undergo cardiac catherization evaluate hemodynamics anatomy associated congenital cardiac defects catheter ascending aorta contrast media injected resulting aortography may used delineate anatomy double aortic arch including sites narrowing left aortic arch aortography also used visualize origin head arm vessels originating two arches double aortic arch subtype complete vascular ring three types double aortic arch double aortic arch right dominant arch normally one left aortic arch patients double aortic arch ascending aorta arises normally left ventricle divides two arches left right aortic arch join posteriorly become descending aorta smaller left arch passes anteriorly left trachea usual position often joined ligamentum arteriosum patent ductus arteriosus forms descending aorta left arch gives first origin left common carotid artery left subclavian artery
