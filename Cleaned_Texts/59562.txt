dysentery uk us historically known bloody type gastroenteritis results bloody symptoms may include fever abdominal pain feeling incomplete complications may include cause dysentery usually bacteria genus shigella case known shigellosis amoeba entamoeba histolytica called causes may include certain chemicals bacteria protozoa parasitic may spread risk factors include contamination food water feces due poor underlying mechanism involves inflammation intestine especially efforts prevent dysentery include hand washing food safety measures traveling countries high condition generally resolves within week drinking sufficient fluids oral rehydration solution antibiotics azithromycin may used treat cases associated travelling developing medications used decrease diarrhea loperamide recommended may used together shigella results million cases diarrhea million deaths year nearly cases developing areas poor sanitation nearly half cases diarrhea due entamoeba entamoeba histolytica affects millions people results deaths commonly occurs less developed areas central south america africa dysentery described least since time common form dysentery bacillary dysentery typically mild sickness causing symptoms normally consisting mild abdominal pains frequent passage loose stools diarrhea symptoms normally present days usually longer present week frequency urges defecate large volume liquid feces ejected presence blood mucus pus depends pathogen causing disease temporary lactose intolerance occur well occasions severe abdominal cramps fever shock delirium extreme cases people may pass one liter fluid per hour often individuals complain diarrhea blood accompanied extreme abdominal pain rectal pain lowgrade fever rapid weight loss muscle aches sometimes also accompany dysentery nausea vomiting rare many cases cascading cramps affect muscles surrounding entire upper intestine sometimes severe enough cause lining intestine separate wall leading systemic infectioncitation needed rare occasions amoebic parasite invade body bloodstream spread beyond intestines cases may seriously infect organs brain lungs commonly dysentery results bacterial parasitic infections viruses generally cause pathogens typically reach large intestine entering orally ingestion contaminated food water oral contact contaminated objects hands specific pathogen mechanism pathogenesis general result damage intestinal linings leading inflammatory immune responses cause elevated physical temperature painful spasms intestinal muscles cramping swelling due fluid leaking capillaries intestine edema tissue damage bodys immune cells chemicals called cytokines released fight infection result impaired nutrient absorption excessive water mineral loss stools due breakdown control mechanisms intestinal tissue normally remove water stools severe cases entry pathogenic organisms bloodstream anemia may also arise due blood loss diarrheacitation needed bacterial infections cause bloody diarrhea typically classified either invasive toxogenic invasive species cause damage directly invading mucosa toxogenic species invade cause cellular damage secreting toxins resulting bloody diarrhea also contrast toxins cause watery diarrhea usually cause cellular damage rather take cellular machinery portion life microorganisms example bacteria genus shigella secrete substances known cytotoxins kill damage intestinal tissue contact shigella thought cause bleeding due invasion rather toxin even nontoxogenic strains cause dysentery e coli shigalike toxins invade intestinal mucosa therefore toxin dependentcitation needed definitions dysentery vary region medical specialty u centers disease control prevention cdc limits definition diarrhea visible others define term differences definition must taken account defining mechanisms example using cdc definition requires intestinal tissue severely damaged blood vessels ruptured allowing visible quantities blood lost defecation definitions require less specific damagecitation needed amoebiasis also known amoebic dysentery caused infection amoeba entamoeba found mainly tropical proper treatment underlying infection amoebic dysentery important insufficiently treated amoebiasis lie dormant years subsequently lead severe potentially fatal complicationscitation needed amoebae inside bowel infected person ready leave body group together form shell surrounds protects group amoebae known cyst passed persons body feces survive outside body hygiene standards poor example person dispose feces hygienically contaminate surroundings nearby food water another person eats drinks food water contaminated feces containing cyst person also become infected amoebae amoebic dysentery particularly common parts world human feces used fertilizer entering persons body mouth cyst travels stomach amoebae inside cyst protected stomachs digestive acid stomach cyst travels intestines breaks open releases amoebae causing infection amoebae burrow walls intestines cause small abscesses ulcers form cycle begins againcitation needed dysentery may also caused shigellosis infection bacteria genus shigella known bacillary dysentery marlow syndrome term bacillary dysentery etymologically might seem refer dysentery caused bacilliform bacteria meaning restricted convention shigella dysenterycitation needed strains escherichia coli cause bloody diarrhea typical culprits enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli best known types e coli also make shiga diagnosis may made taking history brief examination dysentery confused hematochezia passage fresh blood anus usually stoolscitation needed mouth skin lips may appear dry due dehydration lower abdominal tenderness may also cultures stool samples examined identify organism causing dysentery usually several samples must obtained due number amoebae changes blood tests used measure abnormalities levels essential minerals efforts prevent dysentery include hand washing food safety measures traveling areas high although currently vaccine protects shigella infection several vaccination may eventually become part strategy reduce incidence severity diarrhea particularly among children lowresource settings example shigella longstanding world health organization target vaccine development sharp declines agespecific diarrheadysentery attack rates pathogen indicate natural immunity develop following exposure thus vaccination prevent disease feasible development vaccines types infection hampered technical constraints insufficient support coordination lack market forces research development vaccine development efforts taking place public sector research programs within biotechnology companiescitation needed dysentery managed maintaining fluids using oral rehydration treatment adequately maintained due vomiting profuseness diarrhea hospital admission may required intravenous fluid replacement ideal situations antimicrobial therapy administered microbiological microscopy culture studies established specific infection involved laboratory services available may necessary administer combination drugs including amoebicidal drug kill parasite antibiotic treat associated bacterial infectioncitation needed laudanum deodorized tincture opium may used severe pain combat severe diarrhea shigellosis suspected severe letting run course may reasonable usually less week case severe antibiotics ciprofloxacin tmpsmx may useful however many strains shigella becoming resistant common antibiotics effective medications often short supply developing countries necessary doctor may reserve antibiotics highest risk death including young children people anyone suffering dehydration malnutritioncitation needed amoebic dysentery often treated two antimicrobial drugs metronidazole paromomycin correct treatment cases amoebic bacterial dysentery subside within days individuals achieve full recovery within two four weeks beginning proper treatment disease left untreated prognosis varies immune status individual patient severity disease extreme dehydration delay recovery significantly raises risk serious complications including insufficient data exists shigella estimated caused death children age five deaths people five years amoebiasis infects million people year die one per seed leaves bark kapok tree used traditional
