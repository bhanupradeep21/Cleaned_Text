dickinsonia genus extinct organism likely animal lived late ediacaran period australia china russia ukraine one best known members ediacaran biota individual dickinsonia typically resembles bilaterally symmetrical ribbed oval affinities presently unknown mode growth considered consistent stemgroup bilaterian though various affinities discovery cholesterol molecules fossils dickinsonia lends support idea dickinsonia though results dickinsonia fossils known form imprints casts sandstone beds specimens found range millimetres metres ft length fraction millimetre millimetres nearly bilaterally symmetric segmented round oval outline slightly expanded one end ie eggshaped outline riblike segments radially inclined towards wide narrow ends width length segments increases towards wide end body divided two midline ridge except single unpaired segment one end dubbed anterior unit suggested represent front disputed whether segments offset following glide reflection thus whether segments symmetric across midline thus follow true bilateral symmetry specimens displaying offset may result taphonomic number segmentsisomer pairs varies smaller individuals largest australian body
