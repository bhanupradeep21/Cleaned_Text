dacryocystocele dacryocystitis timo cyst benign bluishgray mass inferomedial canthus develops within days weeks birth uncommon condition forms result consequence narrowing obstruction nasolacrimal duct usually prenatal development nasolacrimal duct obstruction disrupts lacrimal drainage system eventually creating swelling cyst lacrimal sac area nasal cavity location cyst cause respiratory dysfunction compromising airway obstruction ultimately leads epiphora abundance tear dacryocystocele condition occur age however population affected rare condition infants intensity symptoms may vary depending type dacryocystocele three types dacrycystocele acute congenital chronic acute dacryocystocele bacterial infection includes symptoms fever pus eye region chronic dacryocystocele less severe people chronic form condition experience symptoms pain discomfort corner eye congenital dacryocystocele form appears infants infant may watering discharge common symptoms types dacryocystocele include nasolacrimal ducts drain excess tears eyes nasal cavity dacryocystocele tube gets blocked either end result mucoid fluid collects intermediate patent section forms cystic structure infection often caused nasolacrimal system located within maxillary bone purpose nasolacrimal ducts drain tears eye area lacrimal sac eventually nasal cavity dacryocystocele caused blockage nasolacrimal duct result mucoid fluid collects intermediate patent section forms cystic structure cyst formed eye nose region blockage epiphora become area infections take infection occurs lacrimal sac inflame causing swelling cystic formation diagnosis made prenatally routine obstetric ultrasound identify characteristic hypoechoic lesion inferior medial globe important distinguish dacrocystocele serious encephalocele neural tube defect dacryocystocele diagnosed postpartum noninvasive ultrasound us among adult population several tests ordered diagnose condition initially physician would use patients medical history visible symptoms indicate condition tests used diagnose patient relieve dacryocystocele symptoms warm compress placed affected area help open ducts taking counter medication antiinflammatory pain relievers recommended order reduce fever pain symptomscitation needed since dacryocystocele infection tear sacs condition resolved taking oral antibiotics acute dacryocystocele mass may spontaneously resolve pressure directed toward nose time cyst outgrow blockage however chronic dacryocystocele nasolacrimal duct probing may required open obstruction surgery may needed widen tear ducts order reduce blockage occurring eye area procedure surgery called dacryocystorhinostomy laser used remove bone structure nose order widen tear ductcitation needed infection treated early course condition dacryocystocele lead lifethreatening illnesses recovery acute dacryocystocele would couple days weeks help antibiotics however chronic dacryocystocele recovery time varies recovery time depends person chronic dacryocystocele receives surgery condition recovery time surgery specifically dcr three six months success rate surgery mortality morbidity rates condition significantly low condition high success rate treated early particularly among infants congenital dacryocystocele prominent among infants prevalence live infants condition recover time turn year old among adult population years old older likely develop condition especially women percent dacryocystocele cases adult women narrower nasal ducts men prone develop condition dacryocystocele becomes prevalent among people following preexisting conditions research study conducted northwest iran among patients dacryocystocele purpose research experiment examine bacterial antibiotic susceptibility among group condition total patients dacryocystitis participated study patients age eighteen needed written consent participation patients referred clinic ophthalmology selected participate exclusion participation taken consideration patient previous treatment antibiotics order go forward study nasolacrimal duct discharges injected growth medium isolate determine microbial agent stains present discharges test antibiotic susceptibility among dacryocystocele patients disc diffusion method utilize patients participated experiment female male patients results culture sample demonstrated aureus epidermidis pneumonaie common strains microorganisms among patients actue dacryocystitis however patients chronic dacryocystitis demonstrated prevalence among epidermidis pseudomonas spp aureus c albicans strains results antibiotic susceptibility tests demonstrated patients northwest region iran sensitive following antibiotics ciprofloxacin ceftriaxone vancomycin chloramphenicol gentamicin erythromycin concluded ciprofloxacin vancomycin effective medications among patients condition region iran study beneficial determine medications worked best treat people northwest iran adequately regions around world take consideration study order treat dacryocystocele effectively httpsenwikipediaorgwikidacryocystocele
