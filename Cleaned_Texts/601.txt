initially thought correlate earliest pliocene later studies found sediments deposited miocene skull designated usnm initially later usnm described christian de muizon establishing genus odobenocetops peruvianus serving type species due genus strange anatomy muizon also coined family several additional fragmentary fossils namely periotic tympanic bones later referred genus substantial material found form three additional specimens one thought represent female peruvianus two described second younger species named leptodon holotype specimen leptodon nearly complete skull associated atlas

estimated range metres possible odobenocetops reached mass similar modern narwhals kg skull peruvianus large measuring cm throughout preserved skull characteristic profile appearing strongly concave elevated snout skullroof viewed also clearly separated two large portions anterior portion includes premaxillae tusks nares separated back head strong constriction giving skull somewhat skulls modern whales show great variety adaptations towards aquatic life clearly setting apart mammals among adaptations commonly referred telescoping term generally describes fact bones typically far apart closely spaced cetaceans largely however odobenocetops unique due skull appears reverse telescoped condition cetacean skull achieved maxilla frontal bones regressing towards tip snout bony nares moved forward subsequently gives rostrum characteristic short round appearance contrast elongated skulls found cetaceans related type species peruvianus thought lacked melon important sensory organ least vestigial melon bony nares located near tip skull contrast blowholes whales dolphins located top skull odontocetes parts frontal maxillae cover temporal fossae odobenocetops bones reduced narrowed temporal fossae open dorsally additionally parietal bones well exposed dorsally corresponds well developed temporalis muscle periotic tympanic bones similar dolphins eyesockets oriented upwards sideways fully laterally like dolphins palate arched large deep like walruses besides two tusks premaxilla odobenocetops toothless tip snout specifically premaxilla covered important insertion points facial musculature also housing great number neurovascular foramina interpreted supporting strong upper lip potentially even vibrissae similar skull leptodon differs peruvianus several ways palate much deeper longer wider anterior border curved gently giving ushape rather vshape peruvianus palate also asymmetrical likely positioned parallel seafloor right angle sagittal plane apex snout general

unifying factor groups presence strong upper lip supporting already inferred peruvianus premaxillary foramina missing leptodon dorsal fossa shallow depression present fossa suggests presence melon leptodon organ either absent strongly reduced peruvianus hand orbit leptodon anterior edge slightly concave whereas deeply notched peruvianus suggests binocular vision leptodon wasnt welldeveloped older although mandibles known either species inferred short toothless based well developed pterygoid temporalis like rest skull periotic bone surrounding inner ear highly derived closely resemble typical anatomy expected cetacean still cochlear canal follows general anatomy also present closest relatives beluga narwhal inner ear also large semicircular canals vestibular aqueduct large count facial vestibular nerve fibres toothed whales semicircular canals notably smaller cochlear canal odobenocetops closely resembles related beluga possible correlates increased mobility neck addition unique shape skull odobenocetops easily distinguished cetacean presence pair asymmetric tusks composed entirely dentine tusks housed large processes known alveolar sheaths formed premaxilla directed back downwards angle horizontal plane tusk known single cetacean extant narwhal also asymmetric however narwhals tusk implanted left maxilla whereas tusk odobenocetops originates right premaxilla tusks two genera therefore homologous occurrence tusks odobenocetops convergence holotype odobenocetops peruvianus tusks incomplete based preserved elements estimated longer right tusk measured cm length left tusk notably smaller estimated cm long possibly entirely contained premaxillary process following discovery leptodon muizon speculated tusks could obtained larger sizes individuals however would require additional specimens corroborate hypothesis second skull described muizon differs significantly skull despite found horizon unlike drastic size difference left right tusk type specimen tusks second specimen mostly symmetrical short rather taking evidence additional species muizon suggests skull may belonged female individual displaying sexual dimorphism supported dimorphism seen modern narwhals males possess iconic tusk females lack pulp cavity elongated tusk cm long indicating grew continuously short tusk also appeared still growing even much slower holotype younger species leptodon found tusks situ right one needlelike metres ft long metres ft located outside premaxillary process left tusk cm long similar length small tusk perivianus despite small tusk slightly longer type species wear facet indicates erupted confined within bony process premaxilla larger tusk also preserves clear wear facet tip giving apex tusk strongly oblique shape due tusk given tusks length slenderness likely fragile considered argument held angle body corroborated anatomy neck way atlas occipital condyle articulate suggests neutral position neck would angled slightly downward inclines tusk slightly upward position parallel rest body due fact tusk additionally projects slightly towards side odobenocetops could lower head even without tooth get way front flippers atlas like skull asymmetrical stronger left side compensate enlarged odobenocetops early member dolphin superfamily closely related narwhals dolphins tusks projecting towards rear body muizon placed odobenocetopsidae sister group monodontidae family including narwhal beluga murakami colleagues placed odobenocetopsidae large clade together phocoenidae porpoises monodontidae albireonidae extinct group similar porpoises clade originated pacific ocean langhian diversified serravallian tortonian relation two species may sister taxa rather successive species muizon points odobenocetops leptodon clearly derived palate older relative yet retains basal melon heavily reduced peruvianus derived trait suggests two different branches genus rather one species evolved despite limited range transitional form odobenocetops whales known leaving precise origin lipotidae pontoporiidae iniidae hadrodelphis odobenocetops delphinapterus leucas beluga whale monodon monoceros narwhal phocoenidae porpoises delphinidae dolphines melon important fatty sensory organ present towards front head associated echolocation toothed whales appears either heavily reduced entirely absent odobenocetops due highly specialised skull shape animal anatomy inner ear seen peruvianus indicates odobenocetops capable ultrasonic hearing specifically cochlear anatomy resembles belugas narwhals generally allows peak perception sounds khz anatomy points towards odobenocetops lower end range peak sensitivity likely ranging khz despite peruvianus displays series characters suggesting generally less capable producing sounds includes absent melon also lack reduction premaxillary sacs nasal plugs diverticula nasal passage furthermore extremely derived skull odobenocetops likely means many nasolabialis muscles reduced entirely absent overall suggests odobenocetops peruvianus likely incapable producing beamed gated signals define echolocation could passively listen ultrasonic sound could still provide valuable information animals surroundings nearly complex biosonar seen toothed whales however muizon suggests may hindrance animal positioned oblique seafloor enlarged dorsally located eyes whale may provided good binocular vision would mean losing biosonar peruvianus instead developed much better vision compensate odobenocetops leptodon differed significantly regard eyes still oriented dorsally shape orbits support idea species also well developed binocular vision precise state species vision uncertain may ranged reduced binocular vision binocular vision unlike older species though leptodon preserves small depressions premaxillae indicate animal equipped premaxillary sacs would mean although melon absent type species least somewhat developed leptodon small melon would supported width apex rostrum peruvianus rostrum simply narrow tapering room melon regardless even melon present leptodon organ would still reduced relative toothed suggests two species varied approach foraging peruvianus vestigial nonexistent melon relied vision exceptionally well developed compared cetaceans leptodon hand appears much poorer binocular vision instead possessed small melon likely hunting primarily use another sense odobenocetops may used touch presence vibrissae sensitive hair seen modern walrus seals muizon speculates may present later discovery small foramina along sheaths tusks may correspond idea however presence fully formed vibrissae confirmed would unique adaptation among toothed whales tactile hair typically vestigial structure group found adult amazon river dolphins mysticetes calves toothed whales present strong upper lip may formed structure similar rostral disc modern generally length slenderness make rather fragile supported fact tooth holotype broken animal still function tusks entirely clear initially muizon proposed merely social instrument used foraging hypothesis favored later fragile nature enlarged tusks indicates used ways would require apply force instance digging fighting idea possibly used nonviolent social way may explain female individuals lacked enlarged tusks one way tusks could used fashion would establish hierarchy without actually however might still served unknown role feeding wouldnt require tusk endangered breakage studies conducted second species shows leptodon tusks noticeable wear facets case enlarged right tusk facet runs parallel crest palate seafloor indicating wear tooth may caused dragged along bottom ocean foraging muizon colleagues suggest tusks could held parallel seafloor serving sort orientation guide animal muizon colleagues considered function tusks greater detail writing pros cons various potential uses many proposed functions however quickly dismissed due strange nature use ballast forceful feeding adaptation considered unlikely due asymmetrical nature would use supported modern relatives analogues using tusks climbing land quickly dismissed due behavior would place anything basalmost cetaceans use would involve sea ice creating breathing holes dismissed due climate region much warm possibility simply evolutionary leftover also discarded due trait would quickly lost served purpose social function appears likely function even though exact details would used remains mysterious muizon colleagues argue although tusks positioned way would allow slash flanks individuals approaching head fragile nature seems preclude use actual combat purely visual display would consistent strength structure favored orientation tusk visible one side limited sample size serves deepen regardless function muizon colleagues propose secondary sexual character subject rapid sexual selection narrow sheathes tusks may important feature right muizon colleagues speculate may served orientation guides stabilizers mouth speculative set vibrissae muizon compares use sled runners especially relative underwater photography keep camera stable pointed right direction function less disputed tusks even though fact nearly symmetrical found sexes suggests unrelated sexually dimorphic behavior minor asymmetry thought merely compromise necessitated enlarged tusk regardless fact generally similar size indicates function beyond housing tusks likely subject selective possible functions explored greater detail publication tusks exploring different ideas assessing advantages disadvantages instance although function support tusks seems natural would explain sheaths much symmetrical despite one two tusks enlarged although odobenocetops may profited presence hydrofoils sheaths considered small serve function effectively furthermore hydrofoils might useful slowswimming odobenocetops sheaths would generated little lift anything counterproductive animal tried feed stiff attachment skull makes less effective flippers sheaths dense enough serve ballast angled correctly form effective plough foraging would clash interpretation might covered tactile hair may points muscle attachment back skull already serves purpose appear overdeveloped simply restricting area affected suction force could expanded surface area tactile hair however parts entire sheath contain foramina used infer hair whose presence confirmed begin although muizon colleagues find flaws last two hypothetical functions rule entirely suggest may even factors early evolution length sheaths reached size seen known fossils odobenocetops possible could also served social functions display combat making animal appear larger serving shield attacks idea retained primitive feature hand questioned explain caused attain size first place likely didnt serve support two hypotheses regarding function sheaths however found lack direct evidence contrary skin attached sheaths could adaptation feeding protected eyes mud sediment use orientation guides idea muizon already suggested previous publications although may several possible advantages alveolar sheaths thought secondary reason evolution instead muizon suggests primarily function hydrofoils caused odobenocetops develop elongated research conducted atlas odobenocetops suggests head held neutral position would positioned angle relative axis body means tusk angled downward relative skull would held raised position angle relative torso due flexibility neck odobenocetops could easily changed angle held head allowing change position tusk needed muizon colleagues suggest may angled head swimming would effectively bring tusk position roughly parallel rest body reduce drag looking anatomy occipital condyle values change however tusk would diverge body angle running effectively parallel rest body difference may caused difficulty determining neutral position maximum flexion maximum extension neck whichever case odobenocetops shows pronounced points muscle attachment basioccipital bone corroborates presence strong neck musculature would needed compensate weight large neck would flex bring tusks swimming foraging densely built skull tusk would keep head essentially pulling head seafloor buoyant body would held oblique ground position neck would hyperextended tusks may held angle relative torso odobenocetops shows clear convergence walrus muizon colleagues contrast position taken sirenians like dugong capable swimming parallel seafloor thanks denser bonestructure relative ceteaceans pinnipeds hyperextension performed feeding result incredibly mobile neck allows range motion includes hyperextension feeding hyperflexion far exceeds range motion seen beluga whale odontocete greatest range motion still living today support found anatomy atlantooccipital joint accordance odobenocetops range motion least greater hyperextension neck would used feeding precise purpose great possible range flexion known regardless purpose position would effectively allowed odobenocetops bring tips tusks position origin without hindering movement flippers due angle tusks protrude great range motion estimated articulation bones supported numerous strongly developed muscle attachments seen skull morphology skull odobenocetops peruvianus shares many characteristics modern walrus due believed two animals although unrelated likely shared similar lifestyle deep palate rounded snout supporting strong upper lip tusks reduced dentition traits shared cetacean walruses extant extinct powerful musculature associated movement lower jaw particular stands lower jaw likely toothless similar upper jaw strong musculature could functioned allow chewing grinding instead musculature thought enabled odobenocetops suctionfeed like walrus odobenocetops might used upper lip grab various marine bivalves sucked foot siphon help large pistonlike tongue entire mouth would essentially function like vacuum pump feeding mechanism supported musculature connecting upper lower jaw glenoid fossa allows forward backward movement mandible temporalis muscle masseter tongue throat musculature may contributed moving lower jaw back pterygoid muscles would responsible forward movement sucked soft parts bivalves fed odobenocetops could simply ejected remains also applicable leptodon although modified pronounced anatomy palate may indicate ability suck molluscs even greater older species regardless species considered bottomfeeders like modern asymmetrical palate inclined towards left compensate massive right tusk muizon colleagues also mention possibility way around asymmetry wasnt responsible preference left side rather already established preference responsible development tusk preference one particular side unheard modern cetaceans bottlenose dolphins occasionally gray whales consistently show preference feeding using right combined indicates odobenocetops bottomfeeding molluscivore detecting various bivalves crustaceans either depending species use echolocation exceptional vision possibly assistance tactile hair foraging animal would keep head tusks parallel sediment rest body would held oblique due greater density tail fluke would help keep position also providing propulsion whereas forelimbs may used stabilizers suitable prey item detected odobenocetops could created powerful jet water using mouth ability also seen belugas orcas excavating target sediment would likely used powerful upper lip grasp hold invertebrate place utilizing complex suctionfeeding mechanism created palate tongue suck soft parts shell could easily odobenocetops mainly known miocene pisco formation peru thought represent coastal environment calm shallow waters rock
