anemia prematurity aop refers form anemia affecting preterm decreased aop normochromic normocytic hypoproliferative anemia primary mechanism aop decrease erythropoietin epo red blood cell growth preterm infants often anemic typically experience heavy blood losses frequent laboratory testing first weeks although anemia multifactorial repeated blood sampling reduced erythropoiesis extremely low serum levels erythropoietin epo major causative blood sampling done laboratory testing easily remove enough blood produce obladen sachsenweger stahnke studied low birth weight infants first days life infants divided groups group ventilator support mlkg blood loss group ventilated support mlkg blood loss group support respiratory distress syndrome mlkg blood loss infants checked clinical symptoms laboratory signs anemia hours blood transfusion study found groups significant amount blood loss showed poor weight gain pallor distended abdomen reactions frequent symptoms anemia low birth weight first weeks life infants experience decline circulating red blood cell rbc volume generally expressed blood hemoglobin concentration anemia develops even significant reduction concentration normally stimulates significant increased production erythropoietin epo response diminished premature infants dear gill newell richards schwarz conducted study show weak negative correlation epo hb researchers recruited preterm infants days age soon could manage without respiratory support estimated total epo hb weekly days blood transfusion study found epo mean epo mean hb goes epo goes reason decreased response fully understood strauss nd states results physiological factors eg rapid rate growth need commensurate increase rbc mass accompany increase blood volume sick premature infants phlebotomy blood losses premature infants decline occurs earlier pronounced healthy term infants healthy term infants hb rarely falls gdl age approximately weeks premature infants even without complicating

premature infants decline hb may associated abnormal clinical signs severe enough prompt transfusionscitation needed aop usually treated blood transfusion indications still unclear blood transfusions infectious noninfectious risks associated also blood transfusions costly may add parental anxiety best treatment aop prevention worsening anemia minimizing amount blood drawn infant ie anemia phlebotomy found since blood loss attributable laboratory testing primary cause anemia among preterm infants first weeks life would useful quantify blood loss attributable phlebotomy overdraw ie blood

production brown keith studied two groups low birth weight vlbw infants compare erythropoietic response two five times week dosages recombinant human erythropoietin repo using established frequent dosing weekly amount repo generated significant continuous increase hb vlbw infants infants received five dosages higher absolute reticulocyte counts infants received two dosages however noted response repo typically takes two weeks study also showed responses two dosage schedules two times week five times week infants recruited gestational since weeks weeks randomized two groups totaling

establish transfusion guidelines neonates young children help try explain confusion recently concluded optimal dose timing nutritional support required epo treatment yet defined currently routine use epo patient population recommended similar reduction blood use probably achieved appropriate transfusion protocols strategies involve reduction blood loss extremely low birth weight infants laboratory blood testing using bedside devices offers unique opportunity reduce blood practice referred pointofcare testing poc use poc tests measure commonly ordered blood tests could significantly decrease
