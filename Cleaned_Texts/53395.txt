idiopathic hypercalcinuria ih condition including excessive urinary calcium level normal blood calcium level resulting underlying ih become common cause hypercalciuria serious metabolic risk factor developing ih predispose individuals osteopenia affects entire body ih arises due faulty calcium homeostasis closely monitored process slight deviations calcium transport intestines blood bone lead

starts increasing calcium excretion begins decreasing following age suggested ih considered daily urinary excretion mg calcium per kg body making applicable among different age groups weight classes ih shares many similarities hyperparathyroidism condition associated elevated release parathyroid hormone parathyroid discernable feature two normal blood calcium level associated ih ih presented many urinary associated signs symptoms mostly seen include hypothesized three mechanisms contribute ih increased calcium absorption intestines faulty renal tubule calcium reabsorption kidneys increased

calcium diet high sodium protein increases risk excessive protein intake may associated enlarged kidney overproduction calcitriol acts calcium absorption causing excretion calcium insufficient water fluid intake also acts risk factor lowered water concentration leads higher calcium oxalate calcium phosphate supersaturation process leads higher calcium level excreted urine diagnosis ih includes differential diagnosis diagnostic methods differential diagnosis made exclude conditions possibly contributing increased urinary calcium levels looking apparent causes interviews physical examinations dietary recall diagnostic methods done measure protein calcium levels increased levels protein urine proteinuria measured urine dipstick test three different tests may used measure calcium levels
