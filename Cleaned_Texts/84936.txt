achondroplasia genetic disorder autosomal dominant pattern inheritance whose primary feature condition arms legs short torso typically normal affected average adult height centimetres ft males centimetres ft features include enlarged head prominent complications include sleep apnea recurrent ear achondroplasia includes extremely rare shortlimb skeletal dysplasia severe combined immunodeficiency achondroplasia caused mutation fibroblast growth factor receptor gene results protein achondroplasia results impaired endochondral bone growth bone growth within disorder autosomal dominant mode inheritance meaning one mutated copy gene required condition cases occur children parents without disease result new de novo sporadic mutation commonly originates spontaneous change rest inherited parent risk new mutation increases age families two affected parents children inherit affected genes typically die birth early infancy breathing condition generally diagnosed based clinical features may confirmed genetic treatments may include support groups growth hormone efforts treat prevent complications obesity hydrocephalus obstructive sleep apnea middle ear infections spinal stenosis may achondroplasia common cause affects children achondroplasia often less muscle tone common delayed walking motor skills also common children bowed legs scoliosis lordosis arthritis issues joint flexibility breathing problems ear infections crowded issues treated surgery braces physical therapy hydrocephalus severe effect associated achondroplasia children condition occurs cerebrospinal fluid able flow skull spine fluid build associated enlarged head vomiting lethargy headaches shunt surgery commonly performed treat condition endoscopic third ventriculostomy also adults achondroplasia often face issues obesity sleep apnea also typical adults experience numbness tingling legs nerve compression research found adults achondroplasia may also experience psychosocial complications usually associated short pregnancy women achondroplasia considered higher risk women achondroplasia generally babies delivered csections prevent complications could occur natural intelligence life span usually near normal although craniocervical junction compression increases risk death achondroplasia caused mutation fibroblast growth factor receptor gene encodes protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor contributes production collagen structural components tissues gene mutated interferes protein interacts growth factors leading complications bone production cartilage able fully develop bone causing individual disproportionately shorter normal development negative regulatory effect bone growth achondroplasia mutated form receptor constitutively active leads severely shortened bones example gain function mutation effect genetically dominant one variant gene sufficient cause achondroplasia two copies mutant gene invariably fatal recessive lethal shortly birth occurs due respiratory failure underdeveloped people achondroplasia often born parents condition due spontaneous achondroplasia inherited pattern autosomal dominant couples one partner

leading lethal bone studies demonstrated new gene mutations achondroplasia exclusively inherited father occur spermatogenesis theorized sperm carrying mutation selective advantage sperm normal frequency mutations sperm leading achondroplasia increases proportion paternal age well proportion exposure ionizing occurrence rate achondroplasia children fathers years age compared general research urologist harry fisch male reproductive center columbia presbyterian hospital indicated humans defect may exclusively inherited father becomes increasingly probable paternal age specifically males reproducing two syndromes genetic basis similar achondroplasia hypochondroplasia thanatophoric dysplasia achondroplasia detected birth prenatal ultrasound although signs often subtle apparent week dna test performed birth detect homozygosity wherein two copies mutant gene inherited lethal condition leading stillbirths postnatal diagnosis achondroplasia typically uncomplicated involving assessment physical radiographic clinical features include megalocephaly short limbs prominent forehead thoracolumbar kyphosis midface complications like dental malocclusion hydrocephalus repeated otitis media risk death infancy increased due likelihood compression spinal cord without upper airway obstructioncitation needed skeletal survey useful confirm diagnosis achondroplasia skull large narrow foramen

achondroplasia even though cause mutation growth factor receptor found although used without achondroplasia aid growth human growth hormone help people achondroplasia involve different hormonal pathway usually best results appear within first second year second year growth hormone therapy beneficial bone growth therapy satisfactory longterm december treatment achondroplasia human growth hormone approved experimental drug called vosoritide shown promise stage human trials although longterm effects limblengthening increase length legs arms someone little medical consensus exists regarding practice age surgery vary early childhood research also shown introducing parents children achondroplasia support advocacy groups time diagnosis improve several patient advocacy groups exist support people achondroplasia october fda approved expanded use vosoritide oncedaily injection treatment children age achondroplasia previously approved treating genetic disorder children aged five older fdas accelerated approval achondroplasia one several congenital conditions similar presentations osteogenesis imperfecta multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda achondrogenesis osteopetrosis thanatophoric dysplasia makes estimates prevalence difficult changing subjective diagnostic criteria time one detailed longrunning study netherlands found prevalence determined birth per live another study time found rate per review metaanalysis estimated worldwide prevalence per tentative evidence found experimental peptide drug vosoritide increases growth velocity achondroplasia drug inhibits activity addition physical challenges individuals achondroplasia may also experience psychological challenges fear negative perception individuals achondroplasia gollust et al indicated adults achondroplasia tend lower selfesteem annual income educational attainment overall quality life qol compared unaffected interestingly golust study revealed subjects likely cite disadvantages relating social barriers relating health issues functioning hand investigators ancona state many individuals immediate environments natural acceptance condition beginning main challenge lies adapting world designed without condition however society rejects condition start associates destructive anxiety significantly damages individuals selfimage leads social exclusion thus author hypothesizes accepting environment crucial prevent significant suffering individuals achondroplasia ensure best outcomes corrective interventions rather perpetuating rejection similarly study conducted japan nishimura hanaki found children achondroplasia faced challenges related short stature indication psychosocial maladjustment hypothesized focusing coping strategies selfefficacy may play crucial role promoting psychological wellbeing among children social support peer connections important individuals achondroplasia support groups online communities advocacy organizations provide sense belonging help individuals achondroplasia connect others understand experiences additionally communities serve resource information support individuals achondroplasia families united states little people america lpa
