people whose hearts either returned normal rhythm undergo drug therapy electric shock treatment ie direct current cardioversion dccv maintain normal rhythm class iii antiarrhythmic united states fda approved label includes claim reducing hospitalization reducing mortality reduction mortality demonstrated clinical development trial drug heart failure stopped interim analysis showed possible

recent decompensation requiring hospitalization referral specialized heart failure clinic permanent atrial dronedarone also associated rare cases severe liver damage including liver dronedarone termed multichannel blocker however unclear channels play pivotal role thus dronedarones actions cellular level controversial studies suggesting inhibition multiple outward potassium currents including rapid delayed rectifier slow delayed rectifier achactivated inward also believed reduce inward rapid na current ltype ca channels reduction k current studies shown due inhibition kach channel associated gtpbinding reduction k current led increased ap duration increased effective refractory periods thus shown suppress pacemaker potential sa node return patients normal heart european trial average time

antiarrhythmic use amiodarone limited toxicity due high iodine content pulmonary fibrosis thyroid disease well liver disease dronedarone iodine moieties present reducing toxic effects thyroid organs methylsulfonamide group added reduce solubility fats lipophobicity thus reduce neurotoxic dronedarone displays amiodaronelike class iii antiarrhythmic activity clinical drug also appears exhibit
