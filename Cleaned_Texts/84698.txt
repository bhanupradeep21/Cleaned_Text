cane toad bufo marinus rhinella marina alternative naming schemes tropical study site prompted major expansion research program beginning central focus ecological impact toads native fauna later expanding aspects toad biology toad control discovery toad invasion front accelerated markedly time much rapid dispersal individual toads frontline stimulated another new research program colleagues benjamin l phillips gregory p brown shine proposed evolutionary acceleration toad invasion caused process different adaptive processes envisaged mainstream evolutionary biology new explanation relied upon spatial sorting traits affected dispersal rates toads fastestmoving individuals able stay near increasingly rapidly moving invasion front interbreeding among fastmoving individuals produced progeny cases even quicker parents giving rise progressive acceleration invasion speed time even advantages fast dispersal individuals concerned research shine group team bufo also measured ecological impacts invasive cane toads revealing complex pattern whereby native species benefit rather suffer toad invasion major victims large predators poisoned eating toxic toads main beneficiaries species previously consumed predators research extended new methods toad control shine collaboration michael crossland robert capon found cannibalistic nature cane toad tadpoles turned toad tadpoles attracted toxins adult toads use cue find newly laid toad eggs trapped using toxin bait within first year use community groups method thought removed million cane toad tadpoles natural waterbodies research team also discovered suppression pheromone produced older toad tadpoles kill younger ones may useful toad control shine suggested new method buffering impact cane toads vulnerable native predators releasing small cane toads invasion front induce taste aversion inducing nausea thus discouraging predators eating fatally large toads although initially greeted scepticism field studies validated
