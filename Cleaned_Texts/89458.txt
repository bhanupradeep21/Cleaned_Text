synergistic effects often provided functional advantages economic benefits relation survival reproduction favored natural selection cooperating parts elements individuals become effect functional units selection evolutionary similarly environmental systems may react nonlinear way perturbations climate change outcome may greater sum individual component alterations synergistic responses complicating factor environmental pest synergy would occur biological host organism population example introduction parasite may cause fatalities parasite b may also cause loss parasites present losses would normally expected total less yet cases losses significantly greater cases said parasites combination synergistic effect mechanisms may involved development synergistic effects include mechanisms described exhaustive toxicological synergy concern public regulatory agencies chemicals individually considered safe might pose unacceptable health ecological risk combination articles scientific lay journals include many definitions chemical toxicological synergy often vague conflict toxic interactions defined relative expectation interaction determination synergy antagonism depends meant united states environmental protection agency one detailed precise definitions toxic interaction designed facilitate risk guidance documents nointeraction default assumption dose addition synergy means mixture response exceeds predicted dose addition epa emphasizes synergy always make mixture dangerous antagonism always make mixture safe depends predicted risk dose addition example consequence pesticide use risk health effects registration pesticides united states exhaustive tests performed discern health effects humans various exposure levels regulatory upper limit presence foods placed pesticide long residues food stay regulatory level health effects deemed highly unlikely food considered safe consume however normal agricultural practice rare use single pesticide production crop several different materials may used determined regulatory level would considered individually safe many cases commercial pesticide combination several chemical agents thus safe levels actually represent levels mixture contrast combination created end user farmer rarely tested combination potential synergy unknown estimated data similar combinations lack information also applies many chemical combinations humans exposed including residues food indoor air contaminants occupational exposures chemicals groups think rising rates cancer asthma health problems may caused combination exposures others alternative explanations question likely answered years exposure population general research chemical toxicity usually performed animals examples pesticide synergists include piperonyl butoxide mgk human synergy relates human interaction teamwork example say person alone short reach apple tree person b short well person b sits shoulders person tall enough reach apple example product synergy would one apple another case would two politicians able gather one million votes together able appeal million voters synergy would produced votes worked independently song also good example human synergy taking one musical part putting together create song much dramatic effect parts played individually third form human synergy one person able complete two separate tasks one action example person asked teacher boss work write essay could improve work visual example synergy drummer using four separate rhythms create one drum beat synergy usually arises two persons different complementary skills cooperate business cooperation people organizational technical skills happens often general common reason people cooperate brings synergy hand people tend specialize able form groups high synergy see also division labor teamwork example two teams system administration working together combine technical organizational skills order better client experience thus creating synergy counterexamples found books like mythical manmonth inclusion additional team members shown negative effects productivity organismic computing approach improving group efficacy increasing synergy human groups via technological means synergy occurs work place individuals involved get work positive supportive working environment individuals get work environments company reaps benefits authors creating best workplace earth rob goffee gareth jones state highly engaged employees average likely exceed expectations leastengaged workers companies highly engaged people outperform firms disengaged folks employee retention customer satisfaction fourfold revenue also able open views company confidence heard likely organized employee helps fellow team members corporate synergy occurs corporations interact congruently corporate synergy refers financial benefit corporation expects realize merges acquires another corporation type synergy nearly ubiquitous feature corporate acquisition negotiating point buyer seller impacts final price parties agree distinct types corporate synergies follows marketing synergy refers use information campaigns studies scientific discovery experimentation research development promotes sale products varied use offmarket sales well development marketing tools several cases exaggeration effects also often meaningless buzzword used corporate microsoft word offers cooperation refinement suggestion word synergy revenue synergy refers opportunity combined corporate entity generate revenue two predecessor standalone companies would able generate example company sells product x sales force company b sells product company decides buy company b new company could use salesperson sell products x thereby increasing revenue salesperson generates company media revenue synergy promotion sale product throughout various subsidiaries media conglomerate eg films soundtracks video games financial synergy gained combined firm result number benefits flow entity consequence acquisition merger benefits may firm number cash extensive projects acquires firm cashrich thus enabling new combined firm enjoy profits investing cash one firm projects two firms little capacity carry debt individually possible join gain capacity carry debt decreased gearing leverage creates value firm debt thought cheaper source finance possible one firm unused tax benefits might offset profits another combination thus resulting less tax paid however greatly depends tax law country synergy management relation teamwork refers combined effort individuals participants condition exists organizations parts interact produce joint effect greater sum parts acting alone positive negative synergies exist cases positive synergy positive effects improved efficiency operations greater exploitation opportunities improved utilization resources negative synergy hand negative effects reduced efficiency operations decrease quality underutilization resources disequilibrium external environment cost synergy refers opportunity combined corporate entity reduce eliminate expenses associated running business cost synergies realized eliminating positions viewed duplicate within merged examples include headquarters office one predecessor companies certain executives human resources department employees predecessor companies
