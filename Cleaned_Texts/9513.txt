considered largest terrestrial turtle analysis made sukhanov et al nansiunghelyid turtle upper cretaceous mongolia demonstrated asian nanhsiungchelyids gave rise north american amongst nanhsiungchelyids basilemys considered similar many paleontologists described behaviors basilemys likely comparable tortoises due living terrestrial habitats consuming tough basilemys easily distinguishable fossil turtles due thick shell intricate sculpture rows triangular tubercles separated pits reduced inframarginal fossil record abundant material shell cranial cervical material quite rare turtles prominent members upper cretaceous thus specimens found throughout north america useful defining biogeographic partial skeleton crushed skull basilemys collected cm sternberg horseshoe
