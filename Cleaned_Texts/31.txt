fibrocystic breast changes condition breasts may pain breast cysts breast breasts may described lumpy symptoms may worsen certain parts menstrual cycle due hormonal normal breast changes associated risk factors include early age first menstrual period either children late age disease represents normal breast diagnosis involves ruling breast fibrocystic changes include fibroadenomas fibrosis papillomas management may involve education condition using well fitting bra pain medication occasionally danazol tamoxifen may used estimated women commonly ages changes fibrocystic breast disease characterised appearance fibrous tissue lumpy cobblestone texture breasts lumps smooth well defined edges freemoving regarding adjacent structures lumps sometimes obscured irregularities breast associated condition often found upper outer sections breast nearest armpit found throughout breast women fibrocystic changes may experience persistent intermittent aching breast tenderness related periodic swelling breasts nipples may also tender itchy symptoms follow periodic trend closely tied menstrual cycle symptoms tend peak days weeks period decrease afterwards peak breasts may feel full heavy swollen tender touch complications related breastfeeding found exact mechanism condition fully understood though known tied hormone level fluctuation condition usually subsides menopause closely related menstrual cycle postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy also reported symptoms fibrocystic breast changes indicating hormones may play major role condition accumulative process partly caused normal hormonal variation womans monthly cycle important hormones include estrogen progesterone prolactin hormones directly affect breast tissue causing cells grow hormones tsh insulin growth hormone growth factors tgfbeta exert direct indirect effects amplifying regulating cell growth chronic hormonal fluctuations eventually produce small cysts andor areas dense fibrotic tissue years age multiple small cysts breast pain may arise larger cysts usually occur age time presumably driven aberrant growth signals lesions may accumulate epigenetic genetic karyotypic changes modified expression hormone receptors loss heterozygosity several variants fibrocystic breast changes may distinguished may vary cause genetic predisposition adenosis involves abnormal count density lobular units lesions appear mainly arise ductal epithelial origins evidence iodine deficiency contributes fibrocystic breast changes enhancing breast tissue sensitivity exclusion diagnosis mostly done based clinical presentation ruling breast cancer nipple fluid aspiration used classification cyst type method extent improve breast cancer risk prediction rarely used practice biopsy fine needle aspiration rarely fibrocystic breast disease primarily diagnosed based symptoms clinical breast exam physical exam examination doctor looks unusual breast areas visually manually also lymph nodes located axilla lower neck examined complete accurate medical history also helpful diagnosing process patients medical history physical exam findings consistent normal breast changes additional tests needed otherwise patient asked return weeks later women may detect lumps breasts selfexamination happens strongly advised visit health professional immediately order establish whether lump cyst several imaging tests may performed may include mammography xrays mris ultrasound studies mammography usually first imaging test ordered unusual breast changes found clinical breast examination diagnostic mammography consists series xrays provide clear specific visualization areas breast ultrasounds mris commonly performed conjunction mammographies produce clear images breast clearly distinguish solid masses fluidfilled breast cysts better evaluate dense breast tissue especially young patients breast biopsy test used confirm suspected diagnosis imaging tests already performed revealed unusuallooking areas procedure consists removing sample breast tissue studied pathologist microscope specialist analyzing tissue sample able conclude breast changes benign malignant four main types procedures breast biopsy may performed including fineneedle coreneedle stereotactic biopsy surgical approach fineneedle aspiration biopsy usually ordered doctor almost certain lump cyst test generally performed conjunction ultrasound helpful guiding needle small hard find lump procedure consists inserting thin needle breast tissue lump palpated seen live sonographic ultrasound waves coreneedle biopsy normally performed local anesthesia physicians office needle used procedure slightly larger one used fineneedle biopsy procedure intended remove small cylinder tissue sent laboratory examination newer type breast biopsy technique stereotactic biopsy relies threedimensional xray guide needle nonpalpable mass biopsy performed similar manner using needle remove tissue sample locating specific area breast done xraying breast two different angles surgical biopsy performed remove entire lump part may painful done local anesthesia women fibrocystic changes asymptomatic need treatment closer followup may widely accepted treatment prevention strategy condition patient symptomatic treatment may necessary guidelines followed treatment cyclical breast pain still controversy whether benign breast conditions improve worsen use oral contraceptives hormone replacement smallscale studies indicated fibrocystic breast changes may improve making dietary changes especially reducing caffeine intake related methylxanthines found chocolate tea usage vitamin tentative evidence shown beneficial effects iodine supplementation women fibrocystic breast usually adverse side effects associated condition almost cases subsides menopause possible complication arises fact cancerous tumors may difficult detect women fibrocystic changes breast cancer risk elevated defined fraction lesions except people strong family history breast cancer risk twofold nonproliferative lesions increased risk proliferative lesions also approximately twofold risk particular atypical hyperplasia associated increased risk developing breast two types atypical hyperplasia lobular ductal lobular type associated greater cancer risk approximately fivefold especially high relative risk premenopausal women atypical ductal hyperplasia associated contrast new england journal medicine states women strong familial history breast cancer risk future breast cancer roughly doubled independent histological

independent histologic findings increased risk found among women family history nonproliferative findings first years initial biopsy excess cancers occurred breast especially women atypia well understood whether lesions precursors breast cancer indication increased risk types lesions chance developing breast cancer nearly affected unaffected breast side indicating coincidence risk factors atypical lobular hyperplasia high incidence ipsilateral breast cancers indicating possible direct carcinogenetic estimated prevalence fibrocystic breast changes women lifetime varies widely literature ranging condition common among women years condition called diffuse cystic mastopathy epithelial proliferation fibrosclerosis names condition include chronic cystic mastitis fibrocystic mastopathy
