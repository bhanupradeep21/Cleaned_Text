eukaryotes juːˈkærioʊts əts constitute domain eukarya organisms whose cells membranebound nucleus animals plants fungi many unicellular organisms eukaryotes constitute major group life forms alongside two groups prokaryotes bacteria archaea eukaryotes represent small minority number organisms due generally much larger size collective global biomass much larger prokaryotes eukaryotes seemingly emerged archaea within asgard archaea implies two domains life bacteria archaea eukaryotes incorporated among archaea eukaryotes emerged approximately billion years ago proterozoic eon likely

bundles motor proteins microtubules dynein kinesin myosin actin filaments provide dynamic character many eukaryotes long slender motile cytoplasmic projections called flagella multiple shorter structures called cilia organelles variously involved movement feeding sensation composed mainly tubulin entirely distinct prokaryotic flagella supported bundle microtubules arising centriole characteristically arranged nine doublets surrounding two singlets flagella may hairs mastigonemes many stramenopiles interior continuous cells centrioles often present even cells groups flagella conifers flowering plants neither generally occur groups give rise various microtubular roots form primary component cytoskeleton often assembled course several cell divisions one flagellum retained parent derived centrioles produce spindle nuclear cells plants algae fungi chromalveolates animals surrounded cell wall layer outside cell membrane providing cell structural support protection
