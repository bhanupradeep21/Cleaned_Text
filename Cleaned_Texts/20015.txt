urban aquaculture also spelled aquiculture aquatic farming organisms including types fish cuttlefish mussel shrimp aqua plants within urban environment rivers ponds lakes essence urban aquaculture practice aquaculture urban urbanising urban aquaculture systems associated multitude different production locations species used environment production intensity use urban aquaculture increased last several years societies continue urbanise demand food urban environments methods production include recirculating systems landbased culture systems multifunctional wetlands ponds borrow pits lakes cages culturebased production urban environments include either extensive productivity based solely natural runoff intensive tanks cages monoculture production compared aquaculture general normally urban aquaculture emerges end world war ii brought consumer demand seafood shifted smallscale community practice commercial practice furthermore described urban aquaculture continued steadily increase around world going expert detail history inception urban aquaculture throughout europe discussing early examples prototypes urban aquaculture could found roman villas monasteries castles manors millponds ancient concluded aquaculture time represented advancements technology ways demonstrate social status means avoid poor fish capture increasing consumer demand furthermore described pressures events eventually led abandoning various systems include several notable historical events fall roman empire depopulation economic regression occurred medieval time according white et al aquaculture mostly practiced asia production solely coming china amount production worlds total fish production aquaculture commonly practices industrial basis three farmed fish small scale aquaculture furthermore describe urban aquaculture continued steadily increase around world legitimacy claims backed fact writing seaweb aquaculture clearinghouse dedicated researching publishing content aquaculture policy aquaculture aqua farming dates back bce china actively used even today started spreading parts world europe asia aquaculture continued developing became noticeable industrialisation era alimentariumorg aquaculture reached global scales last decade mostly due increasing demand shrimps prawns developed countries also need possibilities fishermen due fear reduction marine population overfishing climate providing thorough account production methods currently used europe recirculation units horizontally integrated marine aquaculture facilities systems exploiting industrial various types urban aquaculture currently use throughout globe going distinct types specific use landbased culture systems multifunctional wetlands ponds borrow pits lakes cages culturebased recirculating aquaculture systems ras water reuse systems used many numerous ways using urban aquaculture systems farming systems waterbased systems mostly use cages pens landbased systems make use ponds tanks raceways recycling systems usually high control enclosed systems whereas irrigated farm systems livestock fish agriculture irrigation pondsfaoorg however said waterbased systems often used potential opportunities include underprivileged community members may able access affordable food local production fish aquatic plants may prevent food insecurity livelihoods may improve may opportunities high returns investment vast amount research bunting little conducted subject gives great legitimacy overview costs benefits urban urban aquaculture great undeniable importance multiple benefits securing food maintaining offered goods meet markets demand well guaranteeing numerous job opportunities stable income many families bunting et al important thing urban aquaculture provides society environment fact reuses wastewater byproducts agriculture bunting et al offers valid solution problem limited access resources urban aquaculture widespread encouraged benefits brings society another advantage definitely economy aquaculture great alternative food source fuel source increase number possible jobs since provides new products labor bunting little talking environmental benefits aquaculture helps reduce pollution help mollusks seaweed gives way sustainable use sea resources helps conserve biodiversity finally reduces overall environmental disturbance decreased need fishing wild stock provides alternative farming according bunting little constraints urban aquaculture include production variations denying access underprivileged members community urban sprawl user competition theft resource contamination environmental pollution high capital costs financial risks susceptibility disease technical failures volatile market according one authors assessment urban aquaculture worlds population residing cities exceeded half total lot getting poor economic bunting little recommends systembased approach aquaculture annotated bibliography provided also notable soil fertility quickly declining addition latin american makes important urban means food production twenty percent food produced world aquaculture claim method help reducing waste rather cause way aquaculture becomes threat coastal ecosystem many say actually contaminates water threatens health use water also fish food contaminated pesticides chemicals used feed fish said aquaculture generally negative impact environment since destroy order build fish cages schreibman zarnoch discuss potential results implementing urban aquaculture use new york city united states model site provide great detail process moving urban aquaculture concept specific schreibman zarnoch states united states strict standard food production open door good food production discuss potential impacts systems might environment economy metropolitan areas according authors success aquaculture dependent financial support aquaculture implemented cape town produce two tons fish annually entrepreneurs like alan flemming whose aim provide food low income communities innovative urban aquaculture system already received global recognition technology applied aquaculture farm supplied cape towns top places like cape town tried implement aquaculture producing two tons fish successful implementation aquaculture would mean sustainable functioning method aquaculture use implementation requires careful concise planning emphasis environment preservation rather destruction brazil government promoting studies zoning demarcation aquaculture parks could successfully carried make brazil largest producers fish netcages urban aquacultures starting become wide spread especially coastal areas logical observe study systems used production fish products three systems differ one another intensity managed systems extensive
