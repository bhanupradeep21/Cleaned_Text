distraction displays also known diversionary displays antipredator behaviors used attract attention enemy away something typically nest young protected distraction displays sometimes classified generically nest protection behaviors along aggressive displays displays studied extensively bird also documented populations stickleback mammal distraction displays frequently take form however animals may also imitate behavior small rodent alternative prey item imitate nesting behaviors brooding cause confusion true location mimic foraging behaviors away simply draw attention distraction displays oncewhen considered sort partial paralysis uncontrolled stressinduced movements basis several observations david lack postulated displays simply resulted birds alarm flushed nest decoy purpose noted case european nightjar bird led around nest several times made attempt lure away additionally noted courtship displays mixed distraction displays bird suggesting distraction display purposeful action unto observed display became less vigorous frequently visited nest would expected display response driven fear researchers including edward allworthy taken issue argumentswhen armstrong acknowledged displaying animals could make mistakes lacks nightjar seems done leading around nest attributed mistakes paralytic fear conflict interest selfpreservation reproductive enemy attack impulses bird experiences drive lure predator away also directly guard armstrong also thought incorporation sexual threat displays distraction display necessarily represent mistake part animal might make display effective increasing finally observation less vigorous displays due repeated nest approaches preclude parent animal simply learning human threat young jeffrey walters provided evidence lapwings possessed ability distinguish different types predators varying threat levels behavior presumably perhaps cultural armstrong additionally noted displaying animals rarely captured predators would expected display truly uncontrolled movements seemed show signs sort control animal although likely conscious intelligent one example apparent control attention seemingly paid routes used displaying animal moving away furthermore researchers noted parent animals moving towards predator cases could attributed mistakes made partial paralysis case described wiklund stigh snowy owls consistently walked ran towards predator displaying suggesting action additional hypothesis alignment armstrongs ideas conflicting impulses suggests incorporation sexual threat displays distraction display may represent displacement displacement occurs animal unable satisfy two conflicting impulses may initiate outofcontext behavior displacement behavior served adaptive function increased survival young may experienced positive selection become ritualized stereotyped new case forms distraction display may fact evolved stress responses idea alignment lacks hypothesis one rodentrun display bird fluffs feathers mimic fur rodent scurries away nest possible display originates feather ruffling reflex several conditions distraction display may advantageous animal incorporation displacement stress behaviors offspring defense likely undergo positive selection cases depend upon condition location nest distraction display tended evolve species whose nests alone provide substantial physical barrier predators nest exposed terrain close nest open terrain parent may perceive predators greater distance able leave nest begin displaying predator sufficient proximity locate groundnesting birds employ different defensive behaviors part antipredator strategies nest wide range predators access shown kentish plovers positive correlation male female defense behaviors within pairs nests parents invested defense survived furthermore nest near ground parent may able display effectively armstrong noted relative rarity literature distraction display arborealnesting species attributed difficulty displaying convincingly nonetheless anecdotal reports warblers nest arboreally dropping ground perform distraction display disturbed well displaying along tree addition distraction display tends adaptive animals nest solitarily solitary nesters lack opportunity mobbing predator otherwise performing communal defense although species observed display finally distraction display tends adaptive diurnal predation visuallystimulated predators takes place predators likely notice visual distraction display extensively studied observed many species including particularly well documented injuryfeigning including impeded displays one common forms brokenwing displays birds nest walk away wings quivering appear easy target injuryfeigning displays particularly well known nesting waders plovers also documented species including snowy alpine mourning impeded flight displays additionally may suggest injured wing airborne display false brooding approach used plovers bird moves away nest site crouches ground appear sitting nonexistent nest allows predator approach closely another display seen well passerine rodent run nesting bird ruffles back feathers crouches runs away predator display resembles flight response small additionally postulated threat displays gaping caprimulgidae wingextension killdeer sexual displays courtship dancing stilts become incorporated distraction displays bird feigning injury cases incorporated components may increase conspicuousness resulting effective distraction stickleback fish documented performing distraction displays nesting male threespined stickleback approached group conspecifics perform distraction display digging pointing substrate away nest order protect eggs two explanations proposed behavior one hypothesis display arose courtship behavior male normally points approaching female towards nest may lay eggs within therefore pointing sediment away nest containing eggs may divert cannibalistic females attention sexual second hypothesis stickleback distraction display arose displaced foraging behavior represents support hypothesis finding allmale allfemale mixed foraging groups responded equally display would expected indeed mimicking sexual though rarely documented mammals instances distraction display appeared literature one researcher documented distraction display performed female red squirrel order protect young nest approached female attempted lead researcher away trees using ventriloquistic call resembled cries additional study documented distraction display mentawai langurs whereby male call loudly bounce branches female young able quietly animals performing distraction displays rarely documented killed risks displaying animal one researcher observed documented instance second predator became attracted animal already performing distraction display displaying animal killed second additionally shown predators smart learned recognize distraction displays indicate nearby nest one study recorded red fox increased searching behavior response distraction display grouse eventually found killed grouse given risks animal must decide distraction display appropriate response predator researchers found several important factors appear influence decision use distraction display intensity display although evident factors taken consideration consciously displaying several considerations involving predator shown important including distance predator nest intensity display shown decrease distance predator nest increases perhaps representing balancing risk displaying parent vulnerable type predator also shown birds tending display intensely grounddwelling carnivores less intensely humans flying finally number potential predators also shown important sticklebacks frequency distraction displaying male positively correlated number conspecifics foraging addition presence second parent nest correlates increased display intensity perhaps representing diluted predation number potential extrapair mobbers also shown marginally increase intensity display representing possible dilution risk animals engaging third timing distraction display correlate nestling age matter particular interest birds study results showing age displays performed differs species precocial altricial young species precocial young distraction display frequent hatching altricial young frequent may represent greater tendency display times parental investment young greatest young still however failed find correlation cost replacing brood measure parental investment frequency distraction display lastly game theory employed explain grouse may decide display based proxies abundance smart predators abundance rodents preceding particular study assumed greater abundance rodents one year may result higher birth rates among foxes feed rodents therefore greater population oneyearold foxes following year yearling foxes yet experienced enough grouse hunters considered smart distraction display may profitable strategy grouse years following rodent population booms less risk encountering smart predator however low rodent population given year may result lower birth rates among foxes year thereby resulting higher proportion older experienced foxes population following year case grouse may profit displaying likely encounter smart
