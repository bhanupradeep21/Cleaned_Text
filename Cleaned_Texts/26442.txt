xerostomia also known dry dryness mouth may associated change composition saliva reduced salivary flow identifiable cause symptom common often seen side effect many types medication common older people mostly group tend take several medications people breathe mouths dehydration radiotherapy involving salivary glands chemotherapy several diseases cause reduced salivation hyposalivation change saliva consistency hence complaint xerostomia sometimes identifiable cause may sometimes psychogenic reason xerostomia subjective sensation dry mouth often always associated hypofunction salivary term derived greek words ξηρός xeros meaning dry στόμα stoma meaning drug substance increases rate salivary flow termed sialogogue hyposalivation clinical diagnosis made based history reduced salivary flow rates given objective definitions salivary gland hypofunction defined objectively demonstrable reduction whole andor individual gland flow unstimulated whole saliva flow rate normal person ml per ml per minute significantly abnormal stimulated saliva flow rate less ml per gland minutes less ml per gland minutes term subjective xerostomia sometimes used describe symptom absence clinical evidence xerostomia may also result change composition saliva serous salivary gland dysfunction umbrella term presence xerostomia salivary gland hypersalivationcitation needed hyposalivation may give following signs symptoms however sometimes clinical findings correlate symptoms example person signs hyposalivation may complain xerostomia conversely person reports experiencing xerostomia may show signs reduced salivary secretions subjective latter scenario often oral symptoms suggestive oral dysesthesia burning mouth symptoms outside mouth may occur together xerostomia include may also systemic signs symptoms underlying cause sjögrens example joint pain due associated rheumatoid arthritis differential hyposalivation significantly overlaps xerostomia reduction saliva production normal unstimulated level usually result sensation dry altered saliva composition may also responsible salivary flow rate decreased sleep may lead transient sensation dry mouth upon waking disappears eating drinking oral hygiene associated halitosis sometimes termed morning breath dry mouth also common sensation periods anxiety probably owing enhanced sympathetic periods stress body responds fight flight state interfere saliva flow dehydration known cause result body trying conserve fluid physiologic agerelated changes salivary gland tissues may lead modest reduction salivary output partially explain increased prevalence xerostomia older however polypharmacy thought major cause group significant decreases salivary flow rate likely occur aging aside physiologic causes xerostomia iatrogenic effects medications common medication known cause xerostomia may termed medications associated although drug induced xerostomia commonly reversible conditions medications prescribed frequently likelihood xerostomia increases relation total number medications taken whether individual medications xerogenic sensation dryness usually starts shortly starting offending medication increasing anticholinergic sympathomimetic diuretic drugs usually xerostomia may caused autoimmune conditions damage salivaproducing sjögrens syndrome one disease associated symptoms including fatigue myalgia disease characterised inflammatory changes moistureproducing glands throughout body leading reduced secretions glands produce saliva tears secretions throughout primary sjögrens syndrome combination dry eyes xerostomia secondary sjögrens syndrome identical primary form addition combination connective tissue disorders systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid xerostomia may symptom celiac disease especially adults often obvious digestive radiation therapy cancers head neck including brachytherapy thyroid cancers salivary glands close within field irradiated another major cause radiation dose gy sufficient cause severe salivary dysfunction radiotherapy oral cancers usually involves gy radiation often given along chemotherapy may also damaging effect saliva side effect result radiation damage parasympathetic nerves formation salivary gland ducts depends secretion neuropeptide parasympathetic nerves development end buds salivary gland depends acetylcholine parasympathetic sicca simply means dryness sicca syndrome specific condition varying definitions term describe oral eye dryness caused autoimmune diseases eg sjögren syndrome oral dryness may also caused mouth usually caused partial obstruction upper respiratory tract examples include hemorrhage vomiting diarrhea alcohol may involved cause salivary gland disease liver disease smoking another possible recreational drugs may implicated hormonal disorders poorly controlled diabetes chronic graft versus host disease low fluid intake people undergoing hemodialysis renal impairment may also result xerostomia due nerve damage cause oral dryness injury face surgery cause nerve damage head neck area effect nerves associated salivary xerostomia may consequence infection hepatitis c virus hcv rare cause salivary gland dysfunction may infection human immunodeficiency virusacquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids cause related salivary gland disease known diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome similar taste dysfunction xerostomia one prevalent persistent oral symptoms associated despite close association xerostomia dry mouth hyposalivation tend overlooked patients survivors unlike ageusia dysgeusia diagnosis hyposalivation based predominantly clinical signs challacombe scale maybe used classify extent rate salivary flow individuals mouth also little correlation symptoms objective tests salivary sialometry test simple noninvasive involves measurement saliva patient produce certain time achieved dribbling container sialometery yield measures stimulated salivary flow unstimulated salivary flow stimulated salivary flow rate calculated using stimulant citric acid dropped onto tongue collection saliva flows one parotid papillae five ten minutes unstimulated whole saliva flow rate closely correlates symptoms xerostomia stimulated salivary flow sialography involves introduction radioopaque dye iodine duct salivary may show blockage duct due calculus salivary scintiscanning using technetium rarely used medical imaging may involved investigation include chest xray exclude sarcoidosis ultrasonography magnetic resonance imaging exclude sjögrens syndrome minor salivary gland biopsy usually taken may carried suspicion organic disease salivary blood tests urinalysis may involved exclude number possible investigate xerophthalmia schirmer test lacrimal flow may slitlamp examination may also carried successful treatment xerostomia difficult achieve often involves finding correctable cause removing possible many cases possible correct xerostomia treatment symptomatic also focuses preventing tooth decay improving oral hygiene symptom caused hyposalivation secondary underlying chronic disease xerostomia considered permanent even management salivary gland dysfunction may involve use saliva substitutes andor saliva stimulants saliva substitutes improve xerostomia tend improve problems associated salivary gland dysfunctioncitation needed parasympathomimetic drugs saliva stimulants pilocarpine may improve xerostomia symptoms problems associated salivary gland dysfunction evidence treatment radiationinduced xerostomia stimulants substitutes relieve symptoms salivary stimulants probably useful people remaining detectable salivary systematic review compromising randomised controlled trials treatment dry mouth found strong evidence suggest specific topical therapy review also states topical therapies expected provide shortterm effects review reported limited evidence oxygenated glycerol triester spray effective electrolyte sugar free chewing gum increases saliva production strong evidence improves plus clear evidence suggest whether chewing gum less effective suggestion intraoral devices integrated mouthcare systems may effective reducing
