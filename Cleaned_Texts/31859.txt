photosynthesis mechanism chloroplast dna cpdna replication conclusively determined two main models proposed scientists attempted observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since results microscopy experiments led idea chloroplast dna replicates using double displacement loop dloop dloop moves circular dna adopts theta intermediary form also known cairns replication intermediate completes replication rolling circle replication starts specific points origin multiple replication forks open allowing replication machinery replicate dna replication continues forks grow eventually converge new cpdna structures separate creating daughter cpdna chromosomes addition early microscopy experiments model also supported amounts deamination seen deamination occurs amino group lost mutation often results base changes adenine deaminated becomes hypoxanthine h hypoxanthine bind cytosine hc base pair replicated becomes gc thus g base cpdna several g deamination gradients dna becomes susceptible deamination events single stranded replication forks form strand copied single stranded thus risk g deamination therefore gradients deamination indicate replication forks likely present direction initially opened highest gradient likely nearest start site single stranded longest amount mechanism still leading theory today however second theory suggests cpdna actually linear replicates homologous recombination contends minority genetic material kept circular chromosomes rest branched linear complex one main competing models cpdna asserts cpdna linear participates homologous recombination replication structures similar bacteriophage established plants linear cpdna maize still contain complex structures scientists yet however predominant view today cpdna
