communication capabilities media naturalness theory argues natural selection resulted facetoface communication becoming effective way two people exchange information theory applied human communication outcomes various contexts knowledge communication virtual business process trust leadership virtual online maintenance distributed performance experimental tasks using various modular development also consistent ideas field evolutionary media naturalness theory builds media richness theorys arguments facetoface interaction richest type communication providing evolutionary explanation facetoface mediums degree media naturalness theory argues since ancient hominins communicated primarily facetoface evolutionary pressures since time led development brain consequently adapted form kock points computermediated communication far recent phenomenon time necessary shape human cognition language capabilities via natural turn kock argues using communication media suppress key elements found facetoface communication many electronic communication media ends posing cognitive obstacles communication particularly case complex tasks eg business process redesign new product development online learning tasks seem require intense communication extended periods time simple naturalness communication medium defined kock degree similarity medium facetoface facetoface medium presented medium enabling highest possible level communication naturalness characterized following five key high degree colocation would allow individuals engaged communication interaction see hear high degree synchronicity would allow individuals quickly exchange communicative stimuli ability convey observe facial expressions ability convey observe body language ability convey listen speech media naturalness theory predicts electronic communication medium allowing exchange significantly less communicative stimuli per unit time facetoface medium pose cognitive obstacles words media naturalness theory places facetoface medium center onedimensional scale naturalness deviations left right associated decreases naturalness see figure electronic media enable exchange significantly communicative stimuli per unit time facetoface medium classified media naturalness theory lower degree naturalness facetoface medium media predicted associated higher cognitive effort case due primarily phenomenon known information overload characterized individuals communicative stimuli process able human beings possess specialized brain circuits adapted recognition faces generation recognition facial expressions artificial intelligence research suggests require complex computations difficult replicate even powerful computers situation found connection speech generation recognition generation recognition facial expressions speech generation recognition performed effortlessly cognitive effort defined media naturalness theory amount mental activity biological perspective amount brain activity involved communication assessed directly use techniques magnetic resonance imaging cognitive effort also assessed indirectly based perceptions levels difficulty associated communicative tasks well indirect measures fluency fluency defined amount time taken convey certain number words different communication media assumed correlate serve surrogate measure amount time taken convey certain number ideas different according media naturalness theory decrease degree naturalness communication medium leads increase amount cognitive effort required use medium individuals brought different cultural environments usually possess different information processing schemas learned lifetimes different schemas make individuals interpret information different ways particularly information expected actually different individuals likely look types communicative stimuli interpretation message communicated absence stimuli largely based learned schemas likely differ held individuals two individuals even identical twins raised together go exactly experiences lives according media naturalness theory decrease medium naturalness caused selective suppression media naturalness elements communication medium leads increase probability misinterpretations communicative cues thus increase communication say genes influence formation phenotypic trait ie biological trait defines morphological behavioral physiological etc characteristic mean saying trait question innate phenotypic traits innate eg blood type vast majority including connection biological communication apparatus need interaction environment fully properly substantial evidence suggesting biological communication apparatus adapted facetoface communication also ample evidence apparatus including neural functional language system fully developed without significant amount practice thus according media naturalness theory evolution must shaped brain mechanisms compel human beings practice use biological communication apparatus mechanisms similar compelling animals practice skills play key role connection survival among mechanisms one important physiological arousal often associated excitement pleasure engaging communication interactions particularly facetoface situations triggers physiological arousal human beings suppression media naturalness elements makes communication interactions duller elements complex speech enabled evolution larynx located relatively low neck considerably increased variety sounds species could generate actually one important landmarks evolution human however adaptive design also significantly increased ancestors chances choking ingested food liquids suffering aerodigestive tract diseases gastroesophageal reflux leads interesting conclusion complex speech must particularly important effective communication evolutionary past otherwise related evolutionary costs would prevent evolving natural argument similar made amotz zahavi connection evolutionary handicaps trait evolves improve effectiveness connection task spite imposing survival handicap trait particularly strong determinant performance task offset survival cost imposes media naturalness theory builds evolutionary handicap conclusion predict degree electronic communication medium supports individuals ability convey listen speech particularly significant defining media naturalness theory predicts speech imperative proposition speech enablement influences naturalness significantly mediums degree support use facial expressions body prediction consistent past research showing removing speech electronic communication medium significantly increases perceived mental effort associated using medium perform knowledgeintensive tasks according prediction medium audio conferencing relatively close facetoface medium terms naturalness see figure increases cognitive effort communication ambiguity usually accompanied interesting behavioral phenomenon called compensatory phenomenon characterized voluntary involuntary attempts individuals involved communicative act compensate obstacles posed unnatural communication medium one key indications compensatory adaptation decrease communication fluency measured number words conveyed per minute communication medium communication fluency believed go result individuals making effort adapt behavior compensatory example empirical study suggests individuals used instant messaging facetoface media perform complex knowledgeintensive tasks use electronic ie instant messaging medium caused several effects effects consistent media naturalness theory compensatory adaptation among effects electronic medium increased perceived cognitive effort approximately perceived communication ambiguity approximately predicted media naturalness theory electronic medium also reduced actual fluency approximately quality task outcomes affected suggesting compensatory adaptation media compensation hantula kock darcy derosa
