heterothallic species sexes reside different individuals term applied particularly distinguish heterothallic fungi require two compatible partners produce sexual spores homothallic ones capable sexual reproduction single organism heterothallic fungi two different individuals contribute nuclei form zygote examples heterothallism included saccharomyces cerevisiae aspergillus fumigatus aspergillus flavus penicillium marneffei neurospora crassa heterothallic life cycle n crassa given detail since similar life cycles present heterothallic fungi yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae heterothallic means yeast cell certain mating type mate cell mating type vegetative growth ordinarily occurs nutrients abundant cerevisiae reproduces mitosis either haploid diploid cells however starved diploid cells undergo meiosis form haploid mating occurs haploid cells opposite mating type mata matα come contact ruderfer et pointed contacts frequent closely related yeast cells two reasons first cells opposite mating type present together ascus sac contains tetrad cells directly produced single meiosis cells mate second reason haploid cells one mating type upon cell division often produce cells opposite mating type may mate katz ezov et presented evidence natural cerevisiae populations clonal reproduction type selffertilization form intratetrad mating predominate ruderfer et analyzed ancestry natural cerevisiae strains concluded outcrossing occurs every cell divisions thus although cerevisiae heterothallic appears nature mating often closely related yeast cells relative rarity nature meiotic events result outcrossing suggests possible longterm benefits outcrossing eg generation genetic diversity unlikely sufficient generally maintaining sex one generation nextcitation needed rather shortterm benefit meiotic recombinational repair dna damages caused stressful conditions starvation may key maintenance sex aspergillus fumigatus heterothallic one common aspergillus species cause disease humans immunodeficiency fumigatus widespread nature typically found soil decaying organic matter compost heaps plays essential role carbon nitrogen recycling colonies fungus produce conidiophores thousands minute greygreen conidia μm readily become airborne fumigatus possesses fully functional sexual reproductive cycle leads production cleistothecia although fumigatus occurs areas widely different climates environments displays low genetic variation lack population genetic differentiation global thus capability heterothallic sex maintained even though little genetic diversity produced case cereviae shortterm benefit meiosis may key adaptive maintenance sex species flavus major producer carcinogenic aflatoxins crops worldwide also opportunistic human animal pathogen causing aspergillosis immunocompromised individuals sexual state heterothallic fungus found arise strains opposite mating type cultured together appropriate sexuality generates diversity aflatoxin gene cluster suggesting production genetic variation may contribute maintenance heterothallism species henk et showed genes required meiosis present marneffei mating genetic recombination occur species henk et concluded marneffei sexually reproducing recombination natural populations likely occur across spatially genetically limited distances resulting highly clonal population structure sex maintained species even though little genetic variability produced sex may maintained marneffei shortterm benefit meiosis cerevisiae fumigatus discussed sexual cycle n crassa heterothallic sexual fruiting bodies perithecia formed two mycelia different mating type come together like ascomycetes n crassa two mating types case symbolized evident morphological difference mating type strains form abundant protoperithecia female reproductive structure see figure top protoperithecia formed readily laboratory growth occurs solid agar synthetic medium relatively low source nitrogen starvation appears necessary expression genes involved sexual protoperithecium consists ascogonium coiled multicellular hypha enclosed knotlike aggregation hyphae branched system slender
