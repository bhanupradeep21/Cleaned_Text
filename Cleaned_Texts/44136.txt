france antiischemic antianginal metabolic agent fatty acid oxidation inhibitor class meaning improves myocardial glucose utilization inhibition fatty acid metabolism trimetazidine usually prescribed longterm treatment angina pectoris countries including france tinnitus dizziness taken twice day european medicines agency ema finished review benefits risks trimetazidine recommended restricting use trimetazidinecontaining medicines additional treatment angina pectoris cases inadequate control intolerance firstline antianginal controlled studies angina patients shown trimetazidine increases coronary flow reserve thereby delaying onset ischemia associated exercise limits rapid swings blood pressure without significant variations heart rate significantly decreases frequency angina attacks leads significant decrease use nitrates however placebocontrolled randomized trial assessed trimetazidine patients recently coronary intervention heart surgery trimetazidine administered along typical antianginal therapy versus typical antianginal therapy alone significant difference two groups respect cardiac death hospital admission cardiac event recurrence persistence angina need repeat coronary angiography study therefore calls question clinical utility trimetazidine treatment angina improves left ventricular function diabetic patients coronary heart disease recently shown effective patients heart failure different clinical trials determine effective treating bipolar although trimetazidine already developed medical use became listed world antidoping agency wada prohibited substances list

cardiovascular performance program massachusetts general hospital said theory trimetazidine could aid endurance athletes generate high cardiac output cyclists rowers longdistance runners would unlikely direct impact figure skaters performance less demand besides trimetazidine young figure skater also admitted taking hypoxen lcarnitine supplements forms banned substances nevertheless

recommends doctors longer prescribe trimetazidine treatment patients tinnitus vertigo disturbances recent ema evaluation also revealed rare cases patient years parkinsonian extrapyramidal symptoms tremor rigidity akinesia hypertonia gait instability restless leg syndrome related movement disorders patients recovered within months treatment discontinuation doctors advised prescribe medicine either patients parkinson disease parkinsonian symptoms tremors restless leg syndrome related movement disorders patients severe renal mechanism action trimetazidine involves effect cellular energy metabolism specifically metabolism fatty acids glucose one primary ways cells generate energy process oxidation molecules fatty acids glucose broken produce atp adenosine triphosphate main energy currency cells healthy cell fatty acids glucose oxidized produce atp however certain situations ischemia reduced blood flow hypoxia reduced oxygen supply cells ability generate energy becomes compromised conditions cell may experience shortage oxygen necessary complete oxidation fatty acids lead decrease atp production affecting cells ability maintain normal functions trimetazidine works inhibiting specific enzyme called longchain thiolase involved betaoxidation process fatty acids blocking enzyme trimetazidine reduces oxidation fatty acids promotes oxidation glucose instead glucose oxidation requires less oxygen consumption compared betaoxidation fatty therefore enhancing glucose oxidation reducing reliance fatty acid metabolism trimetazidine helps optimize cellular energy production conditions oxygen supply limited preserving energy metabolism promoting glucose oxidation trimetazidine prevents decrease intracellular atp levels important atp essential various cellular processes including functioning ionic pumps maintenance transmembrane sodiumpotassium flow ensuring adequate atp levels trimetazidine helps maintain cellular homeostasis balance different ions
