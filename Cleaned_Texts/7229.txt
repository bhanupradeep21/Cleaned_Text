mobbing animals antipredator adaptation individuals prey species mob predator cooperatively attacking harassing usually protect offspring simple definition mobbing assemblage individuals around potentially dangerous frequently seen birds though also known occur many animals meerkat mobbing evolved independently many species tends present whose young frequently preyed behavior may complement cryptic adaptations offspring camouflage hiding mobbing calls may used summon nearby individuals cooperate attack konrad lorenz book aggression attributed mobbing among birds animals instincts rooted darwinian struggle survive view humans subject similar innate impulses capable bringing rational control see birds breed colonies gulls widely seen attack intruders including encroaching north america birds frequently engage mobbing include mockingbirds crows jays chickadees terns blackbirds behavior includes flying intruder dive bombing loud squawking defecating predator mobbing also used obtain food driving larger birds mammals away food source harassing bird food one bird might distract others quickly steal food scavenging birds gulls frequently use technique steal food humans nearby flock birds might drive powerful animal away food costs mobbing behavior include risk engaging predators well energy expended process blackheaded gull species aggressively engages intruding predators carrion crows classic experiments species hans kruuk involved placing hen eggs intervals nesting colony recording percentage successful predation events well probability crow subjected results showed decreasing mobbing increased distance nest correlated increased predation success mobbing may function reducing predators ability locate nests distraction since predators focus locating eggs attack besides ability drive predator away mobbing also draws attention predator making stealth attacks impossible mobbing plays critical role identification predators intergenerational learning predator identification reintroduction species often unsuccessful established population lacks cultural knowledge identify local predators scientists exploring ways train populations identify respond predators releasing adaptationist hypotheses regarding organism engage risky behavior suggested eberhard including advertising physical fitness hence uncatchability much like stotting behavior gazelles distracting predators finding offspring warning offspring luring predator away allowing offspring learn recognize predator directly injuring predator attracting predator predator much lower frequency attacks nesting seasons suggests behavior may evolved due benefit mobbers young niko tinbergen argued mobbing source confusion gull chick predators distracting searching prey indeed intruding carrion crow avoid incoming attacks facing attackers prevents locating besides experimental research comparative method also employed investigate hypotheses given curio example gull species show mobbing behavior kittiwake nests sheer cliffs almost completely inaccessible predators meaning young risk predation like gull example divergent evolution another hypothesis mobbing behavior known attract mightier hypothesis within hypothesis prey species produce mobbing call order attract stronger secondary predator address threat present primary predator study conducted fang et al showed significant findings unproved functional thesis utilizing three different call types prey species lightvented bulbuls pycnonotus sinensis typical call tc control treatment mobbing call collared scops owl mto treatment mobbing call crested goshawk accipiter trivirgatus superior predator mth looking variation behavioural responses different passerine species potential predator eurasian pygmy owl extent mobbing positively related species prevalence owls diet furthermore intensity mobbing greater autumn mobbing thought carry risks roosting predators including potential harm mobbing birds attracting larger dangerous predators birds risk mobbing owls cryptic plumage hidden roosts reduces environment effect mobbing behavior seen study conducted dagan izhaki wherein mobbing behavior examined particularly observing effects pine forest structure findings showed mobbing behavior varied season ie high responses winter moderate response additionally presence forest understory significant impact mobbing behavior ie denser understory vegetation birds responded mobbing say presence cover forest highly contributes willingness respond aforementioned call another way comparative method used comparing gulls distantly related organisms approach relies existence convergent evolution distantly related organisms evolve trait due similar selection pressures mentioned many bird species swallows also mob predators however distantly related groups including mammals known engage behavior one example california ground squirrel distracts predators rattlesnake gopher snake locating nest burrows kicking sand face disrupts snakes sensory organs crotaline snakes includes heatdetecting organs loreal social species also uses alarm calls fish engage mobbing example bluegills sometimes attack snapping bluegills form large nesting colonies seen attack released naturally occurring turtles may advertise presence drive predator area aid transmission predator recognition similarly humpback whales known mob killer whales latter attacking species including cetacean species seals sea lions distinction though mobbing animals fightorflight response former relies heavily group dynamics whereas latter central focus conceptually individual offspring cases study conducted adamo mckee examining cricket gryllus texensis showcases activating high predation risk repeatedly examine animals general perceive based perceived threat crickets took action save self made attempt preserve offspring mobbing calls signals made mobbing species harassing predator differ alarm calls allow conspecifics escape predator great tit european songbird uses signal call nearby birds harass perched bird prey owl call occurs carries long distances however prey species flight employ alarm signal khz range call less effective traveling great distances much difficult owls hawks hear detect direction call case alarm call could disadvantageous sender predator picks signal hence selection favored birds able hear employ calls higher frequency range furthermore bird vocalizations vary acoustically byproduct adapting environment according acoustic adaptation hypothesis study billings examining specifically lowfrequency acoustic structure mobbing calls across habitat types closed open urban three passerine families corvidae icteridae turdidae discovered size bird factor variation mobbing calls additionally species closed urban habitats lower energy lower low frequencies mobbing calls mobbing calls may also part animals arsenal harassing predator studies phainopepla mobbing calls indicate may serve enhance swooping attack predators including scrub jays species mobbing call smoothly upsweeping made swooping arc beside predator call also heard agonistic behavior interactions conspecifics may serve additionally alternatively alarm call evolution mobbing behavior explained using evolutionarily stable strategies turn based game mobbing involves risks costs individual benefits payoffs individual others individuals often genetically related mobbing increasingly studied genecentered view evolution considering inclusive fitness carrying ones genes ones family members rather merely benefit individual mobbing behavior varies intensity depending perceived threat predator according study done dutour et al however particularly terms surfacing avian species accepted byproduct mutualism rather reciprocal altruism according russell wright cooperating successfully drive away predators individuals involved increase chances survival reproduction individual stands little chance larger predator large group involved risk group member reduced diluted socalled dilution effect proposed w hamilton another way explaining benefits cooperation selfish individuals lanchesters laws also provide insight advantages attacking large group rather another interpretation involves use signalling theory possibly handicap principle idea mobbing bird apparently putting risk displays status health preferred potential
