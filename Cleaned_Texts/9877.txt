neural efficiency hypothesis proposes performing cognitive task individuals higher intelligence levels exhibit lower brain activation comparison individuals lower intelligence hypothesis suggests individual differences cognitive abilities due differences efficiency neural processing essentially individuals higher cognitive abilities utilize fewer neural resources perform given task lower cognitive since late century growing interest among psychologists understand influence individual differences underlying neural mechanisms neural efficiency hypothesis first introduced haier et al position emission tomography pet study aimed investigating relationship intelligence brain pet type nuclear medicine procedure measures metabolic activity cells body study participants underwent pet head completing different cognitive tasks raven advanced progressive matrices rapm continuous performance tests cpt pet scans showed task performance activated specific regions participant brain also negative correlation found brain glucose metabolism levels intelligence test scores results study indicated individuals higher intelligence levels exhibited lower levels brain glucose metabolism solving cognitive years later haier confirmed results study replicating considering learning early studies mainly focused certain cognitive tasks intelligence tests test hypothesis potentially confounding efficiency intelligencetest performance neural efficiency overcome limitation recent studies refined expanded hypothesis applying testing various domains one study researchers used personal decisionmaking task test neh included questions preferences like profession prefer subjective preferences used force participants make decisions preference ratings used manipulate level decisional conflict study found individuals higher intelligence test scores displayed less brain activity simple tasks greater brain activity complex tasks compared individuals lower intelligence test scores suggested smarter people use brains effectively turning areas required activity hand also intelligent people displayed quicker reaction times challenging tasks findings offered fresh evidence support neh indicated neural efficiency highly intelligent people applied tasks different typical intelligence another study focused understanding effect longterm specialized training athlete neural efficiency using functional neuroimaging performing sportspecific task results study showed athletes prolonged experience experts domains performed better novices terms speed accuracy efficiency lower activity levels sensory motor cortex less energy expenditure findings supported neural efficiency hypothesis neh proved individuals highly skilled experienced efficient brain recent studies neural efficiency hypothesis identified several limitations former research also found several moderating variables task complexity sex task type difficulty level task one key moderating variables influence neural efficiency study found hypothesis holds easy tasks difficult tasks intelligent individuals may show increased brain activation study revealed participants high iq showed weaker activation easy tasks significant increase easy difficult tasks pattern observed average iq group study suggests relationship intelligence brain activation depends difficulty former studies primarily used uniform tasks mainly focused male one study found neural efficiency influenced sex task content study tried examine possible sex differences human brain functioning aimed investigating relationship intelligence cortical activation cognitive performance various versions task using brain imaging techniques results study suggested verbal task females likely produce cortical activation patterns consistent neh whereas figural task expected neural activation primarily males comparison female participants suggested role sex task type moderating neuroscience article stub help wikipedia expanding httpsenwikipediaorgwikineuralefficiencyhypothesis
