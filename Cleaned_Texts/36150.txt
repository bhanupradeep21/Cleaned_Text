langobardisaurus ˈlæŋɡoʊbɑːrdɪˈsɔːrəs meaning reptile langobardi reference long bearded people ancient italian extinct genus tanystropheid archosauromorph reptile one known species l pandolfii fossils found italy austria lived late triassic period roughly million years langobardisaurus first discovered italian paleontologist silvio renesto calcare di zorzino formation northern langobardisaurus small reptile body size shorter despite small size langobardisaurus featured long neck elongate cervical vertebrae featuring low neural atop long neck langobardisaurus large yet short triangular skull featured small rostrum large large orbits evidence reliance visual perception suggests langobardisaurus likely good eyesight langobardisaurus skull morphology reflects unique pattern dentition front part upper jaw toothless although grooves premaxilla mistaken teeth past despite lack past toothless region snout larger tricuspid threepronged cheek teeth maxilla large molariform tooth elongated anteroposterior direction molariform tooth flattened occluding surface bent inwards covered tiny denticles lower jaw featured similar molariform tooth occluded aforementioned upper counterpart additionally lower jaw robust high coronoid process suggests capability powerful given distinct tooth pattern traits suggest langobardisaurus performed excessive grinding food however none discovered specimens included jaw articulation conclusions drawn dentition pattern described certainly unique found protorosaur analysis langobardisaurus jaw teeth morphology renesto dalla vecchia speculated langobardisaurus survived diet large insects crustaceans small fish tough additionally hypothesized langobardisaurus used long neck pluck insects air addition burying head deep burrows capture fleeing crustacean prey long neck opposed even longer tail featured caudal making twice length paleontologists hypothesize long tail langobardisaurus key adaptation genus significant impacts daily activity long tail allowed langobardisaurus balance body bipedal stance despite long able stand tall hind legs langobardisaurus could utilized keen eyesight long neck extended vertically survey nearby terrain predators prey fossil record shows langobardisaurus featured short forelimbs dwarfed much longer hollow hind limbs tibia fibula elements slightly shorter femur moving distally tarsi small facts suggest langobardisaurus capable bipedal bipedal locomotion undoubtedly large advantage langobardisaurus adaptation would allowed animal chase prey run predators based hypothesis langobardisaurus fed insects crustaceans fish ability run prey afforded langobardisaurus significant increase hunting capabilities even able run short bursts based available morphological geological information genus paleontologists hypothesize langobardisaurus adaptation aquatic life rather genus likely lived near marine environments consistent proposition survived crustaceans found tidal flats late triassic topographical features regions specimens found support claim date five specimens langobardisaurus discovered addition calcare di zorzino formation previously described produced two specimens

pandolfii considered taxonomically significant two proposed species l rossii l tonelloi longer considered unique species langobardisaurus langobardisaurus tonelloi first described muscio new species langobardisaurus due observed differences phalangeal formula limb bone proportion though reinvestigation features rendered taxonomically insignificant l tonelloi thus considered synonymous l
