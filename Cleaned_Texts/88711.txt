physiological support preoperative prevention strategies extremely important clinical picture turp syndrome vary according severity may influenced type irrigant used classical presentation turp syndrome indeed signs symptoms often vague nonspecific therefore correct clinical context clinician high index suspicion manifestations secondary fluid overloadcitation needed pathophysiology turp

small volumes irrigating fluid via prostatic venous sinuses inevitably occur turp operations average rate absorption therefore length surgery may effect total volume absorbed fluid absorption leads rapid volume expansion causes hypertension reflex bradycardia oncotic pressure blood decrease result dilution serum proteins coupled hypertension push fluid intravascular interstitial compartment causing pulmonary cerebral edema patients impaired left ventricular function may furthermore develop pulmonary edema result acute circulatory overloadcitation needed excessive absorption fluid rapidly dilute serum sodium concentration fall sodium concentration create osmotic gradient intra extra fluid within brain leading net fluid shift away intravascular compartment resulting cerebral oedema
