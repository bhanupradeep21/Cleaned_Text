vessels ability control body temperature would aided thalassodromeus intense activity hunting suggested flight heat would dispelled effectively crest aligned wind head intentionally moved sides kellner campos posited crest could additional functions display aided colour could used species recognition could also sexually dimorphic feature differing according sex proposed martill naish found

assessed size disposition crest sethi holotype hypertrophied enlarged premaxillary crest would thereby represent old adult individual mature stage tupuxuara according kellner campos found martill naishs discussion cranial crest development interesting although found proposed model palaeontologists david w e hone naish innes c cuthill reiterated martill naishs growth hypothesis since pterosaurs probably precocial able fly shortly hatching role crest relevant maturity structure fully grown deemed thermoregulation hypothesis unlikely explanation bloodvessel channels crest found consistent nourishment growing tissue keratin bird beaks hone naish cuthill suggested wing membranes airsac system would effective controlling heat crest wind water could also helped cool pterosaurs hightemperature maritime witton agreed substantially larger crests adult thalassodromids indicated important behavioural activities physiology found idea crests used thermoregulation problematic since grow regularly body size grew fast pace nearadults quicker would predicted growth thermoregulatory structure according witton large highly vascular wing membranes pterosaurs would provide surface area needed thermoregulation meaning crests needed function concluded crests bloodvessel patterns differ much seen bones beaks birds used transporting nutrients bone soft tissues rather thermoregulation witton noted although bird beaks lose heat quickly developed crests pterosaurs might also effect thermoregulation without primary pêgas colleagues noted sexual dimorphism crest size shape proposed pterosaurs crest shape seen sethi holotype may correlate one sex may result sexual selection suggested sexes could similar crests due mutual sexual selection interpretation exaggerated features challenging due small sample size sethi specimens would found evaluate theories think thermoregulation correlated crest growth relative body size since bills toucans largest modern birds grow drastically proportion body size function thermoregulatory structures well facilitating feeding social behaviour pêgas colleagues found vascular structure toucan bills comparable crest sethi concluding crest also multiple kellner campos originally found jaws thalassodromeus similar modern skimmers three bird species genus rhynchops sidewayscompressed jaws bladelike beak protruding lower

adaptations skimming concluded scissorlike bill thin crest almost made modes capturing prey swooping toward water plunging impossible conceding difficulty reconstructing thalassodromeuss fishing method envisioned lessmobile neck skimmers crest impeding head submersion would glide flapping wings occasionally found pterosaur jaws similar thalassodromeus smaller rhamphorhynchus although believed

resisting water chatterjee templin noted skimmers blunter beaks pterosaurs like thalassodromeus direct water jaw biophysicist stuart humphries colleagues questioned whether pterosaurs would commonly fed skimming said conclusions based anatomical comparisons rather biomechanical data drag experienced bird bills pterosaur jaws hydrodynamically aerodynamically tested creating model bills black skimmer thalassodromeus presumably nonskimming tupuxuara towing along waterfilled trough varying speeds researchers found skimming used energy skimmers previously thought would impossible pterosaur

skimming high speed casting doubt feeding authors used jaw tip oberlii model performance thalassodromeus since assigned sethi unwin martill suggested thalassodromids may foraged similarly storks suggested witton said although skimfeeding suggested many pterosaur groups idea criticised recent years pterosaurs lacked virtually adaptations skimfeeding making unlikely fed way thalassodromeus unlike skimmers particularly wide robust skull especially large jawmuscle attachment sites mandible comparatively short stubby witton agreed unwin martill thalassodromids equal limb proportions elongated jaws suited roaming terrestrially feeding opportunistically shorter flexible necks indicated different manner feeding azhdarchids longer stiffer necks suggested thalassodromids may generalised feeding habits azhdarchids may restricted thalassodromeus may better handling relatively large struggling prey relative tupuxuara lightly built skull witton stressed studies functional

gape inferred comment original description sethi engineer john michael williams noted although kellner campos mentioned large crest might interfered aerodynamically flight elaborated point compared pterosaur bird onefifth size suggested thalassodromeus used crest balance jaws head changing attitude depending mode locomotion williams speculated crest would inflatable blood presented varying air resistance compared handheld fan would helped animal change attitude head flight contact water keeping rotating without powerful neck muscles crest would made long flights possible rather interfering williams compared spermaceti head sperm whale stating supposedly used change buoyancy temperature adjustment kellner campos rejected idea inflatable crest since compressed bones would allow find spermwhale analogy convincing relation flying animals noting spermaceti likely used aggression sonar agreed idea crest inflight function tempting sideways movement head would helped change direction biomechanical flightmechanical studies crest would conducted determine animals witton also expressed hope analysis thalassodromid locomotion noted since limb proportions similar betterstudied azhdarchids shape wings style flight might similar thalassodromids might also adapted inland flight wings short broad unlike long narrow wings marine soarers manoeuvrable less likely snag obstacles lower shoulder muscles appear enlarged would helped powerful frequent wing downstrokes takeoff ability although may compensate large crest flight development late growth indicates develop primarily aerodynamics witton suggested proportional similarity limbs thalassodromids azhdarchids also indicates terrestrial abilities would comparable limbs would capable long strides short compact feet would
