decreased percentage type diabetic patients meeting criteria insulitis primary challenge studying pathogenesis insulitis type diabetes due lack agreement definition diagnostic conditions insulitis lack consensus exists many different immunophenotyping markers cell infiltrate thresholds used distinguish insulitis inflammatory conditions due small sample size available study lots research focused clearly identifying characteristics due islets langerhans small clusters cells pancreas difficult study diagnose insulitis requires pathology report taken donor samples islets langerhans tissue histopathological data strategy test early type diabetes development likely development insulitis taking blood test measure islet autoantibody level persons circulation diagnosis insulitis also occur imaging insulitis lesions using radiological imaging optical imaging techniques however main difficulty diagnosing insulitis images due difficulty detecting pancreatic islets within tissue radiological imaging techniques include magnetic resonance imaging mri ultrasound ct treatment would effective administered early development insulitis insulitis type diabetes development successfully detected noninvasive method prior extensive loss insulin secreting beta cells administration immunosuppressant therapy would prevent immune cell infiltration islets langerhans prevention insulitis would also serve prevention type diabetes development insulinproducing beta cell destruction body able produce sufficient levels surgical procedure pancreatic islet cells obtained braindead donors

place local anesthesia imageguided catheter inserted percutaneously portal vein blood vessel transports blood first reported transplantation took place procedure shows shortterm success evidence longterm success successful procedure results significantly improved diabetic control reduction hypoglycemic episodes indicating implanted insulinproducing beta cells islets successfully produce secrete insulin required levels registry study patients islet transplantation failed patients patients insulindependent within years low success rate transplant could due inadequate numbers islet

procedures result adverse effects patients also risk adverse effects resulting longterm use immunosuppressant success rates procedure going since first performed procedure often offered due high rate rejection patients body longterm risk immunosuppressant surgical procedure similar allogeneic pancreatic islet cell transplantation major difference implanted pancreatic islets obtained autologous pancreatic islet cell transplantation islet cells obtained patient whereas allogeneic pancreatic islet cell transplantation islet cells obtained procedure performed along pancreatectomy general anesthesia first pancreatectomy performed full pancreas removed extreme cases debilitating pain chronic pancreatitis viable islet cells isolated implanted patients liver via portal vein imageguided implanted islet cells come patients body immune rejection need immunosuppressant procedure shows shortterm success improving patient bloodsugar management longterm patients end needing insulin therapy complications arise procedure primarily arise insulitis first described german pathologist martin benno schmidt later labelled insulitis swiss pathologist hanns von meyenburg schmidt observed inflammation caused lymphocytic infiltration islets langerhans periphery islets periinsulitis diabetic insulitis believed rare condition scientists oliver stansfield shields warren discovered

concluding since insulitis found simple cases diabetes insulitis causing diabetes merely symptom philip lecompte reexamined acute onset disease short duration studying related insulitis lecompte theorised insulitis rare significant lesion may underdiagnosed cellular infiltrate could caused infection agent functional strain islets reaction damage nonbacterial source antigenantibody pathologist willy gepts speculated possible immunological origin insulitis may published first analysis insulitis juvenile diabetes relatively large sample size patients studied died within months diagnosis gepts
