early cretaceous north african taxa like ichthyoconodon dyskritodon amazighi gobiconodon palaios due rarity jurassic gondwanan fossil record presence eutriconodonts southern landmasses may interest due comparatively early eutriconodonts among mesozoic mammals present arctic locations docodonts haramiyidans generally considered nonmammalian cynodonts also present therians dryolestoids groups considered true like many nontherian mammals eutriconodonts retained classical mammalian synapomorphies like epipubic bones likely associated reproductive constrictions venomous spurs sprawling limbs however forelimb shoulder anatomy least species like jeholodens similar therian mammals though hindlimbs remain eutriconodonts modern ear anatomy main difference therians ear ossicles still somewhat connected jaw via meckels uniquely among crowngroup mammals gobiconodontids replaced molariform teeth successors similar complexity mammals less complex replacements eutriconodonts like spinolestes volaticotherium well preserved showing evidence fur internal organs latter patagia spinolestes shows hair similar modern mammals compound hair follicles primary secondary hair even preserving traces pore infection also possesses clear thoracic diaphragm like modern mammals well spines dermal scutes ossified meckels cartilage furthermore spinolestes may also display signs dermatophytosis suggesting gobiconodontids like modern mammals vulnerable type fungal triconodon subject cranial endocast studies revealing unique brain eutriconodont triconodont dentition analogue among living

liaoconodon rank among carnivorous mammal species volaticotherium liaotherium amphilestes jeholodens ranked among insectivorous mammals yanoconodon priacodon trioracodon ranked somewhere study priacodon suggests jaw roll passive eutriconodonts modern therian eutriconodonts often among largest mammals mesozoic faunal assemblages displaying broad size range small shrewlike insectivores large forms like repenomamus gobiconodon triconodon jugulator among first mammals specialised vertebrate prey likely occupied highest trophic levels among mammals faunal communities several forms like gobiconodon repenomamus show evidence scavenging among mesozoic mammals significantly exploited evidence predation significantly larger dinosaurs also least carnivorous niches eutriconodonts probably replaced deltatheroidean metatherians dominant carnivorous mammals late cretaceous faunal competition groups unattested asia early cretaceous gobiconodontid diversity replaced entirely deltatheroidean one north america nanocuris appears absence gobiconodon larger given insectivorous carnivorous mammals groups suffered heavy losses midcretaceous seems likely metatherians simply occupied niches left extinction eutriconodonts instead among specialised mesozoic mammals several taxa like astroconodon dyskritodon ichthyoconodon may show adaptations piscivory occur aquatic settings molars compared seals cetaceans caution advised comparisons however many researchers like zofia kielanjaworowska noted eutriconodont molars functionally similar terrestrial carnivorans pinnipeds cetaceans occluding shearing motion instead notoccluding providing grasping however dyskritodon ichthyoconodons teeth shows erosion associated aquatic transportation meaning animals died situ studies liaoconodon show adaptations aquatic lifestyle possessing barrellike body paddlelike analysis postcrania yanoconodon shows adaptations towards multiple forms locomotion traits common fossorial arboreal semiaquatic additionally volaticotherium argentoconodon show adaptations aerial locomotion genera closely related implying long lived lineage gliding least spinolestes xenarthrous vertebrae osseous scutes
