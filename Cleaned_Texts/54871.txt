sequence homology biological homology dna rna protein sequences defined terms shared ancestry evolutionary history life two segments dna shared ancestry three phenomena either speciation event orthologs duplication event paralogs else horizontal lateral gene transfer event homology among dna rna proteins typically inferred nucleotide amino acid sequence similarity significant similarity strong evidence two sequences related evolutionary changes common ancestral sequence alignments multiple sequences used indicate regions sequence homologous term percent homology often used mean sequence similarity percentage identical residues percent identity percentage residues conserved similar physicochemical properties percent similarity eg leucine isoleucine usually used quantify homology based definition homology specified terminology incorrect since sequence similarity observation homology sequences either homologous involves term percent homology morphological anatomical structures sequence similarity might occur convergent evolution shorter sequences chance meaning homologous homologous sequence regions also called conserved confused conservation amino acid sequences amino acid specific position substituted different one functionally equivalent physicochemical properties partial homology occur segment compared sequences shared origin rest partial homology may result gene fusion event homologous sequences orthologous inferred descended ancestral sequence separated speciation event species diverges two separate species copies single gene two resulting species said orthologous orthologs orthologous genes genes different species originated vertical descent single gene last common ancestor term ortholog coined molecular evolutionist walter instance plant flu regulatory protein present arabidopsis multicellular higher plant chlamydomonas single cell green algae chlamydomonas version complex crosses membrane twice rather contains additional domains undergoes alternative splicing however fully substitute much simpler arabidopsis protein transferred algae plant genome means genetic engineering significant sequence similarity shared functional domains indicate two genes orthologous inherited shared ancestor orthology strictly defined terms ancestry given exact ancestry genes different organisms difficult ascertain due gene duplication genome rearrangement events strongest evidence two similar genes orthologous usually found carrying phylogenetic analysis gene lineage orthologs often always orthologous sequences provide useful information taxonomic classification phylogenetic studies organisms pattern genetic divergence used trace relatedness organisms two organisms closely related likely display similar dna sequences two orthologs conversely organism removed evolutionarily another organism likely display greater divergence sequence orthologs studiedcitation needed given tremendous importance biology bioinformatics orthologous genes organized several specialized databases provide tools identify analyze orthologous gene sequences resources employ approaches generally classified use heuristic analysis pairwise sequence comparisons use phylogenetic methods sequence comparison methods first pioneered cogs database methods extended automated twelve different databases advanced aybrah analyzing yeasts reconstructing ancestry well following databases right treebased phylogenetic approaches aim distinguish speciation gene duplication events comparing gene trees species trees implemented databases software tools third category hybrid approaches uses heuristic phylogenetic methods construct clusters determine trees example paralogous genes genes related via duplication events last common ancestor lca species compared result mutation duplicated genes separate speciation events descendants lca share mutated homologs original duplicated genes genes considered example lca one gene gene may get duplicated make separate similar gene gene b two genes continue get passed subsequent generations speciation one environment favor mutation gene gene producing new species genes b separate speciation event one environment favor mutation gene b gene giving rise new species genes descendants genes paralogous homologs related via duplication event last common ancestor two additional classifications paralogs include alloparalogs outparalogs symparalogs inparalogs alloparalogs paralogs evolved gene duplications preceded given speciation event words alloparalogs paralogs evolved duplication events happened lca organisms compared example example alloparalogy symparalogs paralogs evolved gene duplication paralogous genes subsequent speciation events example descendant genes b underwent another speciation event gene duplicated new species would genes b example genes paralogous genes shape structure whole genomes thus explain genome evolution large extent examples include homeobox hox genes animals genes underwent gene duplications within chromosomes also whole genome duplications result hox genes vertebrates clustered across multiple chromosomes hoxad clusters best another example globin genes encode myoglobin hemoglobin considered ancient paralogs similarly four known classes hemoglobins hemoglobin hemoglobin hemoglobin b hemoglobin f paralogs proteins serves basic function oxygen transport already diverged slightly function fetal hemoglobin hemoglobin f higher affinity oxygen adult hemoglobin function always conserved however human angiogenin diverged ribonuclease example two paralogs remain similar tertiary structure functions within cell quite differentcitation needed often asserted orthologs functionally similar paralogs similar divergence several papers challenged paralogs often regulated differently eg different tissuespecific expression patterns see hox genes however also regulated differently protein level instance bacillus subtilis encodes two paralogues glutamate dehydrogenase gudb constitutively transcribed whereas rocg tightly regulated active oligomeric states enzymes show similar enzymatic rates however swaps enzymes promoters cause severe fitness losses thus indicating coevolution characterization proteins shows compared rocg gudbs enzymatic activity highly dependent glutamate sometimes large

major histocompatibility complex mhc human chromosome paralogy regions chromosomes much human genome seems assignable paralogy ohnologous genes paralogous genes originated process wholegenome duplication name first given honour susumu ohno ken ohnologues useful evolutionary analysis ohnologues genome diverging length time since common origin whole genome duplication ohnologues also known show greater association cancers dominant genetic disorders pathogenic copy number homologs resulting horizontal gene transfer two organisms termed xenologs xenologs different functions new environment vastly different horizontally moving gene general though xenologs typically similar function organisms term coined walter homoeologous also spelled homeologous chromosomes parts chromosomes brought together following interspecies hybridization allopolyploidization form hybrid genome whose relationship completely homologous ancestral allopolyploids homologous chromosomes within parental subgenome pair faithfully meiosis leading disomic inheritance however allopolyploids homoeologous chromosomes parental genomes may nearly similar one another homologous chromosomes leading tetrasomic inheritance four chromosomes pairing meiosis intergenomic recombination reduced fertilitycitation needed gametology denotes relationship homologous genes nonrecombining opposite sex
