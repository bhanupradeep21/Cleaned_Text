incidence live cranial malformations apparent effects acrocephalosyndactyly craniosynostosis occurs cranial sutures close soon though childs brain still growing brachycephaly common pattern growth coronal sutures close prematurely preventing skull expanding frontward backward causing brain expand skull sides upwards results another common characteristic high prominent forehead flat back skull due premature closing coronal sutures increased cranial pressure develop leading mental deficiency flat concave face may develop result deficient growth midfacial bones leading condition known pseudomandibular prognathism features acrocephalosyndactyly may include shallow bony orbits broadly spaced eyes lowset ears also typical characteristic branchial arch acrocephalosyndactyly syndromes

mutations causes syndrome kgfr keratinocyte growth factor receptor isoform active metaphysis interphalangeal joints isoform active diaphysis active metaphysis well diaphysis also interdigital mesenchyme point mutation increases liganddependent activation thus isoforms means loses specificity causing binding fgfs normally bind since fgf suppresses apoptosis interdigital mesenchyme maintained fgf also increases replication differentiation osteoblasts thus early fusion several sutures skull may explain symptoms always found apert syndromecitation needed diagnosis typically
