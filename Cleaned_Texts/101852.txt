myomeres blocks skeletal muscle tissue arranged sequence commonly found aquatic chordates myomeres separated adjacent myomeres connective fascia myosepta easily seen larval fishes olm myomere counts sometimes used identifying specimens since number corresponds number vertebrae adults location varies species containing near tails located near scapular pelvic girdles depending species myomeres could arranged epaxial hypaxial manner hypaxial refers ventral muscles related structures epaxial refers dorsal muscles horizontal septum divides two regions vertebrates cyclostomes gnathostomes terrestrial chordates myomeres become fused well indistinct due disappearance myosepta shape myomeres varies species myomeres commonly zigzag v lancelets w fishes straight shaped muscle fibers generally cyclostome myomeres arranged vertical strips jawed fishes folded complex matter due swimming capability evolution specifically myomeres elasmobranchs eels w shaped contrastingly myomeres tetrapods run vertically display complex folding another species simplylain myomeres mudpuppies myomeres overlap succession meaning myomere activation also allows neighboring myomeres myomeres made myoglobinrich dark muscle well white muscle dark muscle generally functions slowtwitch muscle fibers white muscle composed fasttwitch fibers specifically three types myomeres fishlike chordates include amphioxine lancelet cyclostomine jawless fish gnathostomine jawed fish common function shared function flex body laterally concavity provide force since myomeres composed multinucleated myofibers contractile cells force generated via muscle contraction gets transmitted intricate connective tissue myosepta network folded shape myomere v w shaped extends various axial segments allowing fibers control large amount body specifically myomeres overlapping cones bound connective tissue myomeres compose lateral musculature provide propulsive force travel along line travel sense cause flexion either side order produce locomotor force myomeres attach centra vertebrae neural haemal spines myomeres fish divided horizontal septum dorsal epaxial ventral hypaxial sections mentioned previous paragraphs spinal nerves pass different variations myomere activation depending type swimming movement example high loading situations faststarts turning require almost maximal myomere activation teleost fish swim speeds lower movement one plane less activation myomeres research discovered fish able spatially restrict axial myomeres different swimming research theorizes myomeres play additional roles fish beyond force generation swimming example microdissection polarized light microscopy research suggests anterior myomeres elongated reinforced dorsal posterior cones allow epaxial muscle force transmitted neurocranium elevation suction feeding published information pikaia gracilens wellknown cambrian era fossil explains evolution swimming ability chordates related myomere shape function specifically myomeres species possessed minimal overlap successive ones myosepta dividing gently curved biomechanical evaluation presumed pikaia capable rapid swimming like living chordates several theories idea include lacking fasttwitch muscle fibers ancestral muscle fiber types like modern slowtwitch fibers less tension myosepta due less overlap successive larval fish amphioxus myomeres vshaped involved specialized notochord amphioxus muscle cells within myomeres send synapse cytoplasmic extensions muscle cells contractile fibrils nerve cord surface amphioxus myomeres run longitudinally along length body vshape sequential contraction swimming occurs force myomeres transmitted via connective tissues notochord tailbending maneuver generated myomeres zebrafish requires innervation motor neurons hypaxial epaxial muscle regions found timingintensity neurons firing two regions varies respectively process mediated circuit controls motor neuron
