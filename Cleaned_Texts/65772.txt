genital area face onset lesions around seven weeks usually go away within year without infection caused poxvirus called molluscum contagiosum virus virus spread either direct contact including sexual activity via contaminated objects condition also spread areas body person risk factors include weak immune system atopic dermatitis crowded living following one infection possible get diagnosis typically based appearance prevention includes hand washing sharing personal treatment necessary may wish lesions removed cosmetic reasons prevent removal may occur freezing laser therapy opening lesion scraping scraping lesion however result oral medication cimetidine podophyllotoxin cream applied skin may also used approximately million people globally affected molluscum contagiosum common children ages one ten years condition become common united states since infection reason keep child school molluscum contagiosum lesions fleshcolored domeshaped pearly appearance often mm diameter dimpled molluscum lesions commonly found face arms legs torso armpits children adults typically molluscum lesions genital region considered sexually transmitted infection genital lesions found child sexual abuse lesions generally painful may itch become irritated picking scratching bumps may lead spread viral infection responsible molluscum contagiosum additional bacterial infection cases eczema develops around individual molluscum lesions may go away within two months generally clear completely without treatment scarring six twelve mean durations outbreak variously reported durations

metaanalysis randomized controlled trials suggested difference treatments short term improvement single treatment significantly better natural resolution bumps located genital area may treated effort prevent treatment resulted elimination bumps infection effectively cured reappear unless person mild cases overthecounter wart medicines salicylic acid shorten infection duration daily topical application tretinoin cream may also trigger studies found cantharidin effective safe treatment removing molluscum medication usually well tolerated though mild side effects pain blistering highquality evidence however oral cimetidine used alternative treatment pediatric population generally well tolerated less imiquimod form immunotherapy initially proposed treatment molluscum based promising results small case series clinical however two large randomized controlled trials specifically requested us food drug administration best pharmaceuticals children act demonstrated imiquimod cream applied three times per week effective placebo cream treating molluscum weeks treatment total children aged results remain incorporated fdaapproved prescribing information imiquimod states limitations use efficacy demonstrated molluscum contagiosum children aged fda also updated imiquimods label concerning safety issues raised two large trials fdarequested pharmacokinetic study latter updated safety label reads follows surgical treatments include cryosurgery liquid nitrogen used freeze destroy lesions well scraping curette application liquid nitrogen may cause burning stinging treated site may persist minutes treatment liquid nitrogen blister may form treatment site slough two four weeks cryosurgery curette scraping painful procedures result residual systematic review case reports case series concluded limited available data suggest pulsed dye laser therapy safe effective treatment molluscum contagiosum generally well tolerated side effects seen pulsed dye laser therapy included mild temporary pain site therapy bruising lasting weeks temporary discoloration treated skin long cases permanent scarring however evidence genital cases molluscum contagiosum clear naturally within two years usually within nine months long skin growths present possibility transmitting infection another person growths gone possibility spreading infection unlike herpesviruses remain inactive body months years reappearing molluscum contagiosum remain body growths gone skin reappear approximately million people affected worldwide molluscum contagiosum
