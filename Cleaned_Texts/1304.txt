luvoirs main goals investigate exoplanets cosmic origins solar luvoir would able analyze structure composition exoplanet atmospheres surfaces could also detect biosignatures arising life atmosphere distant atmospheric biosignatures interest include co molecular oxygen ozone water methane luvoirs multiwavelength capability would also provide key information help understand host stars uv radiation regulates atmospheric photochemistry habitable planets luvoir also observe large numbers exoplanets spanning wide range characteristics mass host star type age etc goal placing solar system broader
