labetalol medication used treat high blood pressure long term management includes essential hypertension hypertensive emergencies hypertension essential hypertension generally less preferred number blood pressure given mouth injection common side effects include low blood pressure standing dizziness feeling tired serious side effects may include low blood pressure liver problems heart failure use appears safe latter part pregnancy expected cause problems works blocking activation β αadrenergic labetalol patented came medical use available generic commonly prescribed medication united states million labetalol effective management hypertensive emergencies postoperative hypertension pheochromocytomaassociated hypertension rebound hypertension beta blocker particular indication treatment pregnancyinduced hypertension commonly associated also used alternative treatment severe pregnancy studies lab animals showed harm baby however comparable wellcontrolled study performed pregnant nursing breast milk shown contain small amounts labetalol original dose prescribers cautious use labetalol nursing pediatric studies established safety usefulness geriatric elderly likely experience dizziness taking labetalol labetalol dosed caution elderly counseled side low blood pressure standing severe common iv formulation vs often reason larger doses oral formulation labetalol contraindicated people overt cardiac failure greaterthanfirstdegree heart block severe bradycardia cardiogenic shock severe hypotension anyone history obstructive airway disease including asthma hypersensitivity labetalol beta blocker antagonist βadrenergic receptors specifically nonselective antagonist labetalol intrinsic sympathomimetic also antagonist receptor hence additionally alpha blocker antagonism adrenergic receptors labetalol competitive actions receptors potent labetalol equipotent blocking amount α β blockade depends whether labetalol administered orally intravenously iv orally ratio α β blockade intravenously α β blockade ratio thus labetalol thought beta blocker αblocking comparison labetalol weaker βadrenergic receptor blocker propranolol weaker affinity αadrenergic receptors compared labetalols dual α βadrenergic antagonism different physiological effects short longterm situations shortterm acute situations labetalol decreases blood pressure decreasing systemic vascular resistance little effect stroke volume heart rate cardiac longterm use labetalol reduce heart rate exercise maintaining cardiac output increase stroke labetalol possesses significant intrinsic sympathomimetic particular partial agonist receptors located vascular smooth muscle labetalol relaxes vascular smooth muscle combination partial receptor agonism receptor overall vasodilatory effect decrease blood similar local anesthetics sodium channel blocking antiarrhythmics labetalol also membrane stabilizing decreasing sodium entry labetalol decreases action potential firing thus local anesthetic physiological effects labetalol administered acutely intravenously predictable solely receptor blocking effect ie blocking receptors decrease heart rate labetalol labetalol given acute situations decreases peripheral vascular resistance systemic blood pressure little effect heart rate cardiac output stroke volume despite receptor blocking effects mainly seen person upright long term labetalol use also different effects beta blockers beta blockers propranolol persistently reduce cardiac output exercise peripheral vascular resistance decreases labetalol first administered continuous labetalol use decreases peripheral vascular resistance however exercise cardiac output remains due compensatory mechanism increases stroke volume thus labetalol able reduce heart rate exercise maintaining cardiac output increase stroke labetalol classified beta blocker low lipophilicity hence lower potential crossing turn may result fewer effects central nervous system well lower risk neuropsychiatric side accordance labetalol animal models found cross negligible minimum requirement adrenergic agents primary secondary amine separated substituted benzene ring one two configuration results strong agonist activity size substituent attached amine becomes greater particularly respect tbutyl group molecule typically found receptor affinity without intrinsic activity therefore labetalol substituted amine greater size relative tbutyl group therefore acts predominantly antagonist overall structure labetalol polar created substituting isopropyl group standard beta blocker structure aralkyl group including carboxamide group meta position adding hydroxyl group para labetalol two chiral carbons consequently exists four two isomers ss rs forms inactive third srisomer powerful receptor blocker fourth isomer rrisomer also known dilevalol mixed nonselective βadrenergic receptor blocker selective labetalol typically given racemic mixture achieve α βadrenergic receptor blocking labetalol acts blocking α βadrenergic receptors resulting decreased peripheral vascular resistance without significant alteration heart rate cardiac output βα antagonism labetalol approximately chemically designated international union pure applied chemistry iupac nomenclature labetalol first drug created combined α βadrenergic receptor blocking properties created potentially fix compensatory reflex issue occurred blocking single receptor subtype ie vasoconstriction blocking βadrenergic receptors tachycardia blocking αadrenergic receptors reflex blocking single receptor subtypes acted prevent lowering blood pressure postulated weak blocking α βadrenergic receptors could work together decrease blood httpsenwikipediaorgwikilabetalol
