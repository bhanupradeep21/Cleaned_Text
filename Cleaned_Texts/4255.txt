eustachian tube juːˈsteɪʃən also called auditory tube pharyngotympanic tube links nasopharynx middle ear also part adult humans eustachian tube approximately mm long mm named sixteenthcentury italian anatomist bartolomeo humans tetrapods middle ear ear canal normally filled air unlike air ear canal however air middle ear direct contact atmosphere outside body thus pressure difference develop atmospheric pressure ear canal middle ear normally eustachian tube collapsed gapes open swallowing positive pressure allowing middle ears pressure adjust atmospheric pressure taking aircraft ambient air pressure goes higher ground lower sky air middle ear expands plane gains altitude pushes way back nose mouth way volume air middle ear shrinks slight vacuum produced active opening eustachian tube actions like swallowing valsalva maneuver required equalize pressure middle ear ambient atmosphere plane descends diver also experiences change pressure greater rates pressure change active opening eustachian tube required frequently diver goes deeper higher pressure eustachian tube extends anterior wall middle ear lateral wall nasopharynx approximately level inferior nasal concha consists bony part cartilaginous part bony part nearest middle ear made bone mm length begins anterior wall tympanic cavity septum canalis musculotubarius gradually narrowing ends angle junction squamous petrous

fibrous membrane cartilage lies groove petrous part temporal bone great wing sphenoid groove ends opposite middle medial pterygoid plate cartilaginous bony portions tube plane former inclining downward little latter diameter tube uniform throughout greatest pharyngeal opening least junction bony cartilaginous portions increased toward tympanic cavity narrowest part tube termed isthmus position relations pharyngeal opening described nasal part pharynx mucous membrane tube continuous front nasal part pharynx behind tympanic cavity covered ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelia thin osseous portion cartilaginous portion contains many mucous glands near pharyngeal orifice considerable amount adenoid tissue named gerlach tube tonsil four muscles associated function eustachian tube tube opened swallowing contraction tensor veli palatini levator veli palatini muscles soft tensor veli palatini makes largest contribution active opening since two developments enhanced understanding anatomy eustachian tube valsalva computerized tomography endoscopic ear eustachian tube derived dorsal part first pharyngeal pouch second endodermal pouch embryogenesis forms tubotympanic recess distal part tubotympanic sulcus gives rise tympanic cavity proximal tubular structure becomes eustachian tube helps transformation sound waves frontal section left ear upper half section view inner wall tympanum enlarged right membrana tympani hammer chorda tympani viewed within behind normal circumstances human eustachian tube closed open let small amount air prevent damage equalizing pressure middle ear atmosphere pressure differences cause temporary conductive hearing loss decreased motion tympanic membrane ossicles various methods ear clearing yawning swallowing chewing gum may used intentionally open tube equalize pressures happens humans hear small popping sound event familiar aircraft passengers scuba divers drivers mountainous regions devices assisting pressure equalization include ad hoc balloon applied nose creating inflation positive air people learn voluntarily click ears together separately performing pressure equalizing routine opening eustachian tubes pressure changes experienced ascendingdescending aircraft mountain driving elevator liftdrops etc even able deliberately keep eustachian tubes open brief period even increase decrease air pressure middle ear clicking actually heard putting ones ear anothers performing clicking sound voluntary control may first discovered yawning swallowing means develop ability may discover done deliberately without force even pressure issues involved eustachian tube also drains mucus middle ear upper respiratory tract infections allergies cause eustachian tube membranes surrounding opening become swollen trapping fluid serves growth medium bacteria causing ear infections swelling reduced use decongestants pseudoephedrine oxymetazoline ear infections common children tube horizontal shorter making bacterial entry easier also smaller diameter making movement fluid difficult addition childrens developing immune systems poor hygiene habits make prone upper respiratory infections otitis media inflammation middle ear commonly affects eustachian tube children susceptible condition one theory eustachian tube shorter horizontal angle adult ear others argue susceptibility age group related immunological factors eustachian tube anatomycitation needed barotitis form barotrauma may occur substantial difference air water pressure outer middle ear example rapid ascent scuba diving
