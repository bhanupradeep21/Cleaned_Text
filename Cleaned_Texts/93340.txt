seed dormancy evolutionary adaptation prevents seeds germinating unsuitable ecological conditions would typically lead low probability seedling dormant seeds germinate specified period time combination environmental factors normally conducive germination nondormant important function seed dormancy delayed germination allows dispersal prevents simultaneous germination seeds staggering germination safeguards seeds seedlings suffering damage death short periods bad weather transient herbivores also allows seeds germinate competition plants light water might less intense another form delayed seed germination seed quiescence different true seed dormancy occurs seed fails germinate external environmental conditions dry warm cold many species plants seeds delay germination many months years seeds remain soil seed bank years germination seed dormancy especially adaptive fireprone seeds long viability period oldest documented germinating seed nearly years old based radiocarbon true dormancy inherent innate dormancy caused conditions within seed prevent germination even conditions imposed dormancy caused external conditions remain unsuitable germination seed dormancy divided two major categories based part seed produces dormancy exogenous three types inherent dormancy based mode action physical physiological number classification schemes developed group different dormant seeds none gained universal usage dormancy occurs wide range reasons often overlap producing conditions definitive categorization clear compounding problem seed dormant one reason given point may dormant another reason later point seeds fluctuate periods dormancy non dormancy despite fact dormant seed appears static inert reality still receiving responding environmental cues seeds undergo period dormancy many species plants release seeds late year soil temperature low germination environment dry seeds collected sown environment warm enough andor moist enough germinate natural conditions non dormant seeds released late growing season wait spring soil temperature rises case seeds dispersed dry periods rains enough soil moisture seeds germinate fleshy fruits retard germination quiescent many garden plants seeds germinate readily soon water warm enough though wild ancestors dormancy cultivated plants lack seed dormancy generations selective pressure plant breeders gardeners grew kept plants lacked dormancy seeds mangroves viviparous begin germinate still attached parent produce large heavy root allows seed penetrate ground falls viviparous germination adaptation mangroves saline environment exogenous dormancy caused conditions outside embryo often broken three subgroups dormancy caused impermeable seed coat known physical dormancy physical dormancy result impermeable layers develops maturation drying seed impermeable layer prevents seed taking water gases result seed prevented germinating dormancy broken natural systems physical dormancy broken several factors including high temperatures fluctuating temperatures fire freezingthawing drying passage digestive tracts physical dormancy believed developed million years physical dormancy broken reinstated ie seed unable enter secondary dormancy following unfavourable conditions unlike seeds physiological dormancy therefore timing mechanisms breaks physical dormancy critical must tuned environmental cues maximises chances germination occurring conditions plant successfully germinate establish eventually physical dormancy identified seeds plants across angiosperm families including physical dormancy recorded species cycadales thick sclerotesta slow embryo development example cycas revoluta zamia floridana groups extant generally physical dormancy result one palisade layers fruit seed coat layers lignified malpighian cells tightly packed together impregnated families anacardiaceae nelumbonaceae seed coat well developed therefore palisade layers fruit perform functional role preventing water uptake physical dormancy common feature several species families physical dormancy produce nondormant specialised structures function watergap associated impermeable layers seed prevent uptake watergap closed seed maturity opened response appropriate environmental breaking physical dormancy involves disruption specialised structures within seed acts environmental signal detector example legume fabaceae seeds become permeable thinwalled cells lens watergap structure disrupted pull apart allow water contact seedclarification needed watergap structures include carpellary micropyle bixoid chalazal plug imbibition lid suberised nature seed coats physically dormant seeds thought become water permeable time repeated heating cooling many months years soil example high fluctuating temperatures dry season northern australia promote dormancy break impermeable seeds stylosanthes humilis shamata generally weight physically dormant seeds eg abrus precatorious remains relatively constant long periods time even different environmental conditions moisture temperature due impermeability seed coat towards water air indigenous people recognizing weight abrus precatorious seeds remains stable used weighing unit mechanical dormancy seed coats coverings hard allow embryo expand past mechanism dormancy ascribed number species found endogenous factors dormancy instead endogenous factors include low embryo growth includes growth regulators etc present coverings around embryo may leached tissues washing soaking seed deactivated means chemicals prevent germination washed seeds rainwater snow melt endogenous dormancy caused conditions within embryo also often broken three subgroups physiological dormancy morphological dormancy combined dormancy groups may also subgroups physiological dormancy prevents embryo growth seed germination chemical changes occur physiological dormancy indicated increase germination rate occurs application gibberellic acid dry afterripening dry storage also indicated dormant seed embryos excised produce healthy seedlings months cold warm stratification increases germination dry afterripening shortens cold stratification period required seeds physiological dormancy indicated scarification increases physiological dormancy broken inhibiting chemicals broken longer produced seed often period cool moist conditions normally case many species ranunculaceae abscisic acid usually growth inhibitor seeds production affected light plants like peony species multiple types physiological dormancy one affects radicle root growth affects plumule shoot growth seeds classified deep physiological dormancy conditions applications increase germination excised embryos produce abnormal seedlings seeds require months cold stratification germinate morphological dormancy embryo underdeveloped undifferentiated seeds fully differentiated embryos need grow seed germination embryos differentiated different tissues time fruit ripening seeds morphological physiological dormancy combinational dormancy occurs seeds dormancy caused exogenous physical endogenous physiological iris species hard impermeable seeds coats physiological dormancy secondary dormancy occurs nondormant post dormant seeds exposed conditions favorable germination like high temperatures caused conditions occur seed
