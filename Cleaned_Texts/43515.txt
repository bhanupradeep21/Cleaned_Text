common patterns hydrological cycles throughout north american deserts specifics times source water range four deserts rely rivers precipitation underground aquifers replenish water water north american desert mainly freshwater ephemeral flow underground water wet seasons slows subdesert dry oases form four deserts groundwater reaches surface pools hollows desert surrounded mountains

differing hydrological cycles great basin receives rainfall leads creation playa lakes spring snowfall melts flows surrounding sonoran desert bimodal precipitation pattern includes winter storms summer monsoons help sustain chihuahuan desert relies primarily intense summer monsoon water summer area sees accumulation playa may similar characteristics difference location evaluation attribute diversity hydrological sources cycles although northern american deserts characteristically dry still contain water necessary fuel ecosystem sustain life humans animals plants alike north american deserts categorized climate categories hot cold deserts cold deserts include thompson okanagan plateau columbian plateau northern central basins colorado plateaus snake river plane north american deserts included cold category indicates dry midlatitude steppe desert climate areas affected interior position within continent leading broader temperature ranges considerable rainfall specifically areas affected rain shadow created neighboring mountain ranges acting barrier westerly flowing air carrying moisture cold deserts experience mm precipitation year indicating semiarid climate warm deserts north america include mojave basin range sonoran desert chihuahuan desert areas tropical desert climate known hottest driest place continent due continental interior location leeward side mountains constant subtropical high pressures high temperatures throughout year due high percentage sunshine caused high sun angles increased distance body water leads lack clouds associated much

limiting factors ecoregion climate changes major effects thus far increase average annual temperature well increase average annual rainfall prevalent factor increase rainfall events severity events measurable increases seasonal rainfall summertime monsoon southern united states northern mexico increase rainfall changes vegetative cover caused native species disappear invasive species populations

soil quality less vegetative cover leads increasingly higher temperatures sonoran desert anthropogenic land degradation well natural erosion increased rainfall caused degree increase average afternoon temperatures means many species less available water nutrients need survive effects lead less biodiversity area one main combatant factors biota climate change effects climate change continue develop north american deserts increasingly affected leading worsening biodiversity loss decreases ecoregion productivity deserts one delicate ecosystems relying limited water nutrient sources survive careful
