adjacent dead dead regions affect audiometric results perhaps way expected example may expected thresholds would obtained frequencies within dead region would obtained frequencies adjacent dead region therefore assuming normal hearing exists around dead region would produce audiogram dramatically steep slope frequency threshold obtained frequency threshold obtained due dead however appears case dead regions clearly found via pta audiograms may although neurons innervating dead region react vibration characteristic frequency basilar membrane vibration large enough neurons tuned different characteristic frequencies adjacent dead region stimulated due spread excitation therefore response patient test frequency obtained referred offplace listening also known offfrequency listening lead false threshold found thus appears person better hearing actually resulting dead region missed therefore using pta alone impossible identify extent dead region see figure consequently much audiometric threshold affected tone frequency within dead region depends location dead region thresholds low frequency dead regions inaccurate higher frequency dead regions attributed fact excitation due

phenomenon tone sufficiently loud produce enough excitation normally functioning area cochlea areas threshold tone detected due offfrequency listening results misleading help overcome issue pta producing inaccurate thresholds within dead regions masking area beyond dead region stimulated used means threshold responding area sufficiently raised detect spread excitation tone technique led suggestion low frequency dead region may related loss however one aims pta determine whether dead region may difficult assess frequencies mask without use based research suggested low frequency dead region may produce relatively flat loss gradually sloping loss towards higher frequencies dead region less detectable due upward spread excitation whereas may obvious steeply sloping loss high
