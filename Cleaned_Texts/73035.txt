influenza least different subtypes subtypes named discovered influenza viruses isolated blackheaded gulls sweden norway discovered fruit recently discovered peruvian bat first three hemagglutinins found human influenza viruses phylogenic similarity ha proteins divided groups belonging group rest group serotype influenza virus determined hemagglutinin ha neuraminidase na proteins present neuraminidase na known subtypes hence influenza virus named etc depending combinations ha nacitation needed highly pathogenic avian flu virus type found infect humans low rate reported single amino acid changes avian virus strains type hemagglutinin found human patients significantly alter receptor specificity avian viruses providing ability bind receptors optimal human influenza finding seems explain virus normally infect humans mutate become able efficiently infect human cells hemagglutinin virus associated high pathogenicity flu virus strain apparently due ease conversion active form ha homotrimeric integral membrane glycoprotein shaped like cylinder approximately nanometres ha trimer made three identical monomers monomer made intact single polypeptide chain regions linked disulfide

cleaved host proteases order infectious neutral ph residues near nterminus also known fusion peptide eventually responsible fusion viral host membrane hidden hydrophobic pocket trimeric cterminus also
