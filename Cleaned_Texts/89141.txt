one half times larger small small twice common large size classes lived alongside researchers previously suggested represent different species christopher bennett showed differences consistent concept represent females males p sternbergi sexually dimorphic skulls larger size class preserve large upward backward pointing crests crests smaller size class small triangular larger skulls also show evidence second crest extended long low toward tip beak seen smaller gender different size classes determined skulls pelvic bones contrary may expected smaller size class disproportionately large wideset pelvic bones bennett interpreted indicating spacious birth canal eggs would pass concluded small size class small triangular crests represent females larger largecrested specimens represent note overall size crest size also corresponds age immature specimens known females males immature males often small crests similar adult females therefore seems large crests developed males reached large adult size making gender immature specimens difficult establish partial fact females appear outnumbered males two one suggests modern animals sizerelated sexual dimorphism sea lions pinnipeds p
