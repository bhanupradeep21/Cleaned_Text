forensic identification application forensic science forensics technology identify specific objects trace evidence leave often crime scene scene accident forensic means courts people identified

microscopic hair comparison also bite mark shoe print soil fiber fingerprint comparisons overturned forensic analysts provided invalid testimony trial since forensic identification first introduced courts first exoneration due dna evidence additional exonerations since specialize forensic identification continue make headway new discoveries technological advances make convictions body identification subfield forensics concerned identifying someone remains usually fingerprint analysis dental analysis dna analysis feet also friction ridges like fingerprints friction ridges widely accepted form identification fingerprints entirely feet feet creases remain time due depth reaches dermal layer skin making creases valuable individualizing owner concept two fingerprints alike also applied foot foot creases grow early weeks conception volar pads begin grow pads regress creases foot crease identification used criminal case used conjunction morphology friction ridges ensure precise identification record foot crease identification used criminal case solve sometimes marks left foot ink blood mud substances appearance creases ridges become muddled extra creases may appear due cracked skin folded skin fissures order truly compare morphological feature prints feet must clear enough distinguish individuals two basic conceptual foundations forensic identification everyone individualized individualization belief invented police records clerk alphonse bertillon based idea nature never repeats originating father social statistics lambert adolphe jacques quetelet belief

dna multiple copies per another reason frequently used nuclear dna used certain segments strands amplified order compare segments mitochondrial dna comparison used figure related genes species proximity since distant relatives animals closer proximity gene said comparison process demands precision mistakes easily made due genes evolving mutating evolution determination geographic origin determining origin certain species aids research population numbers lineage phylogenetic studies often used find broad geographic area species example california seahorses sold traditional medicinal purposes phylogenetic data seahorses led researchers find origin population came species addition phylogenetic data assignment tests used find probability species belonging originating specific
