categories although overlap may occur note list exhaustive suggested certain occupational groups may increased risk developing due excessive intense vocal demands research topic primarily focused teachers singers although studies examined groups heavy voice users eg actors cheerleaders aerobic instructors present known teachers singers likely report moreover physical education teachers

techniques used clinicians examine vocal folds allows detect vocal pathology assess quality vocal fold vibrations laryngeal stroboscopy primary clinical tool used purpose laryngeal stroboscopy uses synchronized flashing light passed either rigid flexible laryngoscope provide image vocal fold motion image created averaging several vibratory cycles thus provided technique relies periodic vocal fold vibration used patients moderate severe high speed digital imaging vocal folds videokymography another imaging technique subject limitations laryngeal stroboscopy rigid endoscope used take images

traditional voice therapy often used treat muscular tension indirect therapies take account external factors may influence vocal incorporates maintenance vocal hygiene practices well prevention harmful vocal vocal hygiene includes adequate hydration vocal folds monitoring amount voice use rest avoidance vocal abuse eg shouting clearing throat taking consideration lifestyle choices may affect

treating dysphonia thus paired medical surgical treatments recommended treat organic dysphonias effective treatment spasmodic dysphonia hoarseness resulting periodic breaks phonation due hyperadduction vocal folds botulinum toxin toxin acts blocking acetylcholine release thyroarytenoid muscle although use botulinum toxin injections considered relatively safe patients responses treatment differ initial stages reported experiencing swallowing problems breathy voice quality sideeffect breathiness may last longer period time males surgeries involve myoectomies laryngeal muscles
