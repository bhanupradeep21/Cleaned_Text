somatic embryogenesis artificial process plant embryo derived single somatic somatic embryos formed plant cells normally involved development embryos ie ordinary plant tissue endosperm seed coat formed around somatic embryo cells derived competent source tissue cultured form undifferentiated mass cells called callus plant growth regulators tissue culture medium manipulated induce callus formation subsequently changed induce embryos form callus ratio different plant growth regulators required induce callus embryo formation varies type somatic embryos mainly produced vitro laboratory purposes using either solid liquid nutrient media contain plant growth regulators pgr main pgrs used auxins contain cytokinin smaller shoots roots monopolar somatic embryos bipolar allowing form whole plant without culturing multiple media types somatic embryogenesis served model understand physiological biochemical events occur plant developmental processes well component biotechnological first documentation somatic embryogenesis steward et al reinert carrot cell suspension somatic embryogenesis described occur two ways directly occurs embryos started directly explant tissue creating identical clone words without callus formation embryo explant called direct embryogenesis occurs explants produced undifferentiated partially differentiated cells often referred callus maintained differentiated plant tissues leaf stem roots acid bap gibberellic acid ga used development indirect somatic embryos strawberry fragaria ananassa plant regeneration via somatic embryogenesis occurs
