necrophages organisms obtain nutrients consuming decomposing dead animal biomass muscle soft tissue carcasses term derives greek nekros meaning dead phagein meaning mainly necrophages species within phylum arthropoda however animals gastropods accipitrimorphae birds noted engage necrophages play critical role study forensic entomology certain arthropoda diptera larvae engage myiasis colonization human members order diptera nematocera calliphoridae sacrophagidae muscidae well semiaquatic diptera larvae simuliidae chironomidae common necrophages within animalia diptera species play critical role forensic entomology tend colonize human body early floating phase flies utilize submerged corpse source food well attachment site notably diptera specifically colonize feed human diptera species musca domestica chloroprocta idioidea observed feeding carcasses mammalian carcasses including mona monkey european rabbit giant cane rat well fish carcass appeal characterized putridness odour emits thus olfactory system diptera species plays role food addition diversity abundance diptera species vary spatially necrophagous diptera calliphora vicina tend concentrated urban areas rare rural areas however researchers oppose notion claim anthropogenic impacts negligible regarding species temporally necrophagous diptera observed higher abundances summer season winter season presence specific diptera abundance depends reproductive strategy retained example calliphoridae high larval growth rate accompanied low survival rate sarcophagidae produce little offspring longer life cycles latter said benefit necrophagous diptera particular environments forests urbanized areas particular hymenoptera members genus trigona obligate trigona worker bees play similar role apis genus however along collecting pollen nectar plant resins trigona workers also collect carrion vertebrate although pollen associated higher energy value dead tissue vertebrate carcasses preferred trigona bees biochemically easier extract energy dead animal tissue muscle replace pollen primary protein source cerumen pots utilized trigona species necrophaga vesicles store foodstuff necrophaga consists honey carrion vertebrate ultimately stored food utilized developing larvae worker bee source nutrition energy due rapid decomposition carrion especially warm temperatures bees must efficiently metabolize carrion avoid rotten carrion cerumen hypogea communicate presence valuable carcass olfactory bees create odour trail nest prospective animal carcass thus bees recruit nest members respond exploit corpses resources rapidly additionally interspecific competition observed trigona hypogea bees bees observed defend colonized food item including limited monkey lizard fish snake carcass competing necrophages flies coleoptera specifically cleridae dytiscidae scarabaeidae hydrophilidae common necrophages like diptera tend play critical roles forensic dytiscidae aquatic adult larval stages life cycles thus beetles play role colonizing submerged human colonization beetles assume predacious role feed dead tissue body dytiscidae species rhantus validus retain mouthparts characterized curved asymmetrical highly sclerotized mandibles mouthparts cutting edge groove allows insect release digestive enzymes prey item maxillae sharp teeth researchers matched postmortem skin injuries human corpse mouthparts beetles revealed necrophagous activity dermis epidermis notably necrophagy elicited rhantus validus also created microhabitats smaller necrophages allowing access freshly dead internal tissue necrophagy amongst coleoptera confined mammalian necrophagous activity observed scarabaeidae species scybalocanthon nigriceps fresh carcasses tree frogs beetle observed use front legs clypeus shape frog carrion pellets eventual consumption aquatic environments dytiscidae hydrophilidae species also observed engage necrophagous activity granular nassariidae nassarius festivus nassarius clarus scavenge upon dead decaying animal matter intertidal zone eulittoral soft sandflat monkey mia world heritage site shark bay australia nassarius clarus acts necrophage feeds carrion fishes presence carrion animals proboscis performs search reaction followed quick onset feeding faced competitor hermit crab site carrion nassarius clarus attack competition defend meal nassarius clarus attracted fish bivalve carrion distance miles heightened interest areas sand disturbed thus indicating potential presence organic detritus damaged fauna necrophagy observed members clade accipitrimorphae including egyptian vulture eurasian griffon cinereous vulture black vulture turkey vulture king birds mainly vultures noted feed fleshy tissue muscle mammalian vertebrates cows pigs rabbits well additionally preyed upon carcasses recorded naturally deceased product anthropogenic events roadkill thus means prey retrieval may differ depending spatial circumstances urbanization particular notably anthropogenic impacts adverse impacts biological parameters necrophagous birds specifically territory azerbaijan adverse effects include limited shortage food shootings birds nests removal nestlings nests due advances cattlebreeding involving indoor breeding utilization dead cattle many necrophagous birds eurasian griffon losing access nutritionally valuable cow carcasses therefore feeding ecology interspecific relationships necrophagous birds directly indirectly impacted necrophagous diptera coleoptera play vital roles applications forensic necrophagy critical forensic scientists production postmortem changes human corpses example forensic medical examiner must determine soft tissues removed result necrophages entomological data utilized homicide cases determine postmortem interval pmi localize information indicated time takes necrophage larvae reach particular developmental stage thus life cycle necrophage provides detail regarding interval initial myiasis discovery corpse notably colonization human corpse diptera necrophages positively correlated particular injuries gunshot wounds lacerations nature injuries provides higher levels accessibility necrophagous diptera allows colonize corpse rapidly seasonal changes particularly temperature changes significantly affect abundance degree myiasis increase decrease temperature accompanies seasonal changes determines rate development retained necrophages particularly high temperatures lead exponential increase rate development diptera therefore body temperature corpse utmost importance necrophages prefer fresh internal tissue sexually thrive warm environments however corpses temperature may adverse effects determination postmortem interval pmi necrophages development may rapid due bodys temperature passage time addition coleoptera provide valuable information forensic specifically later stages decomposition dermestidae cleridae recorded colonize human corpses provide insight regarding postmortem interval however researchers note spatial differences affect latency necrophagous coleoptera presence httpsenwikipediaorgwikinecrophage
