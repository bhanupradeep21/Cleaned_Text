directed attention fatigue daf neuropsychological phenomenon results overuse brains inhibitory attention mechanisms handle incoming distractions maintaining focus specific task greatest threat given focus attention competition stimuli cause shift focus one maintains focus particular thought inhibiting potential distractions strengthening central mental needed directed attention fatigue occurs particular part brains global inhibitory system overworked due suppression increasing numbers stimuli temporary condition clinical illness personality disorder rather temporary fatigue inhibitory mechanisms medical source according inhibition theory natural one alternate periods attention distraction although ones efforts may involve different tasks incoming stimulus calls upon directed attention mechanismcitation needed extreme levels mental fatigue lead inability perform regular tasks irritability studies require participants carry attentiondemanding tasks conditions high distraction reveal unpleasant mentally fatigued person exposure experience individuals less likely help someone need also aggressive less tolerant less sensitive socially important cues fatigue experienced participants kinds studies induced attentionintensive observed effects fatigue correlated decline inhibitory control signs directed attention fatigue include temporarily feeling unusually distractible impatient forgetful cranky associated illness severe forms lead bad judgment apathy accidents contribute increased stress levelscitation needed major areas mental processing affected onset daf overlap symptoms six categories highly indicative directed attention fatigue symptoms attention deficit hyperactivity disorder closely mirror symptoms directed attention fatigue like directed attention fatigue adhd involves prefrontal cortex specifically right prefrontal cortex less active among children adhd experimentation shown severity adhd symptoms correlated degree asymmetry blood flow left right prefrontal source needed possible daf adhd involve disruption underlying mechanism recent clinical evidence found treatments used directed attention fatigue may reduce symptoms adhd source needed however important note unlike adhd daf temporary condition rather clinical disordercitation needed onset directed attention fatigue triggered number activities involve use brains inhibitory system activities engage system include multitasking working environment disruptive background noise lack sleep rapidly changing focus prolonged period attention daf also brought performing concentrationintensive tasks puzzlesolving learning unfamiliar ideas external factors stress resulting emergencies exams work deadlines also induce daf illness injury brain interrupts brain circuits involved maintaining attention inhibiting external stimuli may also contribute development directed attention fatigue directed attention voluntary attention requires great deal concentration focus employed tasks problem solving type attention employs inhibitory mechanisms brain help block incoming stimuli unrelated task several parts brain involved maintaining directed attention primarily located frontal lobe parietal lobe brain specifically mechanism directed attention employs prefrontal cortex pfc anterior cingulate cortex acc brain stems basal ganglia fmri studies shown directed attention involves changes anterior cingulate cortex lateral prefrontal cortex perhaps consequence increased connectivity two evidence also suggests right inferior frontal cortex ifc plays specialized role response inhibition seems region plays key role integration bottomup responserelated information facilitates goaldirected source needed areas brain known involved daf specific molecular mechanisms perpetuation daf symptoms yet known concept stress used many situations would described mental fatigue two concepts distinctly different stress involves preparation anticipated event evaluated threatening harmful though mental fatigue may well result stressful circumstances also arises hard work project one enjoys cases anticipation threat harm present still result fatigue characteristic mental fatigue difficulty focusing mentally fatigued person paying attention something uninteresting burdensome even though focusing something great interest poses particular needed hence two types attention distinguished terms effort involved use changes attentional shift measures taken order reduce impact daf include reducing number distractions present ones external environment trying clear ones mind internal distractions taking short breaks prolonged periods focus directed attention fatigue reduced getting sufficient amount sleep night inhibitory attention chemicals replenished medical source aesthetic environment may also serve restorative function fostering recovery mental fatigue research shown restorative experiences clearing ones head reflecting ones life priorities may help combat directed attention fatigue investigated attention restoration theory natural environments forests mountain landscapes beaches appear particularly effective restoring attention perhaps contain vast amount diverse relatively weak stimuli thus inciting mind wander freely relaxing strict ongoing research examining ways incidence daf decreased suggests exposure natural environment may aid reduction daf symptoms number researchers investigated directed attention fatigue recently leading contributors include rachel stephen kaplan environmental psychologists university michigan rachel stephen kaplan credited much research relating directed attention fatigue first discover extended periods focused attention lead daf research suggests directed attention fatigue alleviated exposure nature together kaplans devised attention restoration theory art states person better able maintain focused directed attention spending time natural environment number studies performed specifically focus directed attention fatigue experienced cancer patients studies suggests daf experienced cancer patients following surgery improves significantly outdoor restorative activities minutes per medical source similarly discovered even brief amounts time spent busy metropolitan street affect ones ability maintain focus given task experimental findings suggest spending time natural environment even looking pictures nature improve maintenance directed medical source landscape human health laboratory lhhl completed studies examining complex relationship people environment researchers discovered correlation directed attention fatigue irritability aggression findings suggest people deprived restorative effects nature display aggressive qualities results also demonstrate communities several trees natural areas tend stronger safer house residents higher attention levelcitation needed recent experimentation done lhhl suggests children possessing attention deficits increase attention level walking medical source according much researchwhich performed regarding directed attention fatigue brains ability maintain directed attention
