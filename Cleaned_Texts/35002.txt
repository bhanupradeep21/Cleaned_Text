photoperiodism physiological reaction organisms length night dark period occurs plants animals plant photoperiodism also defined developmental responses plants relative lengths light dark periods classified three groups according photoperiods shortday plants longday plants dayneutral plants animals photoperiodism sometimes called seasonality suite physiological changes occur response changes day length allows animals respond temporally changing environment associated changing seasons earth orbits sun many flowering plants angiosperms use circadian rhythm together photoreceptor protein
