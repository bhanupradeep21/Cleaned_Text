kyhytysuka ipa extinct genus ophthalmosaurian ichthyosaur early cretaceous colombia animal previously assigned genus platypterygius given genus kyhytysuka midsized ophthalmosaurian heterodont dentition several adaptations suggesting macropredatory vertebrate hunter living shallow waters contains single species kyhytysuka first definitive ichthyosaur remains colombia discovered paja

words indigenous muisca language name composed verb kyhyty particle suka combination meaning one cuts something sharp reference animals unique dentition species name sachicarum coined originally conceived refer sáchicas indigenous community instead refers town sáchica despite fact holotype discovered villa de kyhytysuka mediumsized ichthyosaur largest specimen measuring around metres ft entire skull measures mm length tip premaxilla posterior end mandible premaxilla relatively robust compared ophthalmosaurs slightly convex shape premaxilla makes rostrum houses shallow alveolar groove

zone pointed apices dental zone iii includes large teeth posterior premaxilla anterior maxilla closely packed together forming nearly continuous sawtooth ridge fully erupted teeth opposed smaller dentary teeth typically ichthyosaurs possess interlocking teeth stark contrast robust cutting edge formed teeth area based morphology likely served shear prey dental zone iv made remaining maxillary teeth diminished size compared previous set like dental zone ii alternating functional nonfunctional dental zone v last five tooth regions hosting tightly packed teeth robust morphology short according calculations based cohen et al relative stress throughout upper dentition follows relatively linear path throughout first four dental zones following different zones based size morphology instead stress evenly distributed differences tooth zones mitigating dramatic difference stress across dentition highest stress determined last dental zone due close proximity jaw joint combined short
