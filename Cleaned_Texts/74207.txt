nomenclature monoclonal antibodies naming scheme assigning generic nonproprietary names monoclonal antibodies antibody protein produced b cells used immune system humans vertebrate animals identify specific foreign object like bacterium virus monoclonal antibodies produced identical cells often artificially share target object wide range applications including medical naming scheme used world health organizations international nonproprietary names united states adopted names pharmaceuticals general word stems used identify classes drugs cases placed wordfinally monoclonal antibody names assigned end stem mab newer names different stems unlike pharmaceuticals monoclonal antibody nomenclature uses different preceding word parts morphemes depending structure function officially called substems sometimes erroneously infixes even usan council scheme revised several times stem mab used monoclonal antibodies well fragments long least one variable domain domain contains target binding structure case antigenbinding singlechain variable among artificial proteins new scheme published november divides antibodies four groups group uses stem tug fulllength unmodified immunoglobulins

multispecific monoclonal antibodies finally group assigns stem ment monospecific antibody fragments without fc antibody parts fc regions antibody mimetics use different naming schemes antibodies named early substem preceding stem denotes animal antibody first monoclonal antibodies produced mice substem yielding ending omab usually mus musculus house mouse nonhuman organisms neither inn usan ever

human amino acid sequences pure human antibodies engineered constant region replaced human form antibody termed chimeric substem used xi part variable regions may also substituted case called

remain nonhuman order achieve good binding partly chimeric partly humanized antibodies used xizu three substems indicate foreign species used production thus humanmouse chimeric antibody basiliximab

antibody names omit part substem preceding source antibody refers medicines target examples targets tumors organ systems like circulatory system infectious agents like bacteria viruses term target imply sort action antibody exerts therapeutic prophylactic diagnostic agents distinguished nomenclature naming scheme originally developed substems mostly consist consonant vowel another consonant final letter may dropped resulting name would difficult pronounce otherwise examples include cir circulatory system lim immune system lim stands lymphocyte ner nervous system final letter usually omitted following source substem begins consonant zu xi target substems used shortened form mul example never reduced mu chimeric humanized antibodies targeting musculoskeletal system ever received inn combination target source substems resulted endings like limumab immune system human ciximab circulatory system chimeric consonant r new shorter target substems adopted mostly consist consonant plus vowel omitted source substem begins vowel example human antibodies targeting immune system receive names ending lumab instead old limumab endings like ciximab remained old system employed seven different substems tumor targets depending type tumor many antibodies investigated several tumor types new convention source substem discontinued need dropping target substems final vowel prefix
