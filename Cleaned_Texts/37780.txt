ethology branch zoology studies behaviour nonhuman animals usually scientific focus behaviour natural conditions viewing behaviour evolutionarily adaptive behaviourism term also describes scientific objective study animal behavior usually referring measured responses stimuli trained behavioral responses laboratory context without particular emphasis evolutionary throughout history different naturalists studied aspects animal behaviour ethology scientific roots work charles darwin american german ornithologists late early including charles whitman oskar heinroth wallace craig modern discipline ethology generally considered begun work dutch biologist nikolaas tinbergen austrian biologists konrad lorenz karl von frisch three recipients nobel prize physiology ethology combines laboratory field science strong relation disciplines neuroanatomy ecology evolutionary biology ethologists typically show interest behavioral process rather particular animal often study one type behavior aggression number unrelated species ethology rapidly growing field since dawn century researchers reexamined reached new conclusions many aspects animal communication emotions culture learning sexuality scientific community long thought understood new fields neuroethology developed understanding ethology animal behavior important animal training trainers choose individuals suitable carry necessary duty taking account inherent habits various types breeds additionally gives trainers ability promote execution behaviors come easily cessation undesired term ethology derives greek language ἦθος ethos meaning character λογία logia meaning study term first popularized american myrmecologist person studies ants william morton wheeler ethology considered topic biology ethologists concerned particularly evolution behaviour understanding terms natural selection one sense first modern ethologist charles darwin whose book expression emotions man animals influenced many ethologists pursued interest behaviour encouraging protégé george romanes investigated animal learning intelligence using anthropomorphic method anecdotal cognitivism gain scientific early ethologists eugène marais charles whitman oskar heinroth wallace craig julian huxley instead concentrated behaviours called instinctive natural occur members species specified circumstances beginning studying behaviour new species construct ethogram description main types behaviour frequencies occurrence provided objective cumulative database behaviour subsequent researchers could check due work konrad lorenz niko tinbergen ethology developed strongly continental europe years prior world war war tinbergen moved university oxford ethology became stronger uk additional influence william thorpe robert hinde patrick bateson subdepartment animal behaviour university period ethology began develop strongly north america lorenz tinbergen von frisch jointly awarded nobel prize physiology medicine work developing ethology wellrecognized scientific discipline number journals covering developments subject animal behaviour animal welfare applied animal behaviour science animal cognition behaviour

concerned issues human conflict conflict resolution reconciliation war peacemaking peacekeeping english ethologist john h crook distinguished comparative ethology social ethology argued much ethology existed far really comparative animals future ethologists would need concentrate behaviour social groups animals social structure within e wilsons book sociobiology new synthesis appeared since time study behaviour much concerned social aspects also driven stronger sophisticated darwinism associated wilson robert trivers w hamilton related development behavioural ecology also helped transform furthermore substantial rapprochement comparative psychology occurred modern scientific study behaviour offers less seamless spectrum approaches animal cognition traditional comparative psychology ethology sociobiology behavioural ecology tobias starzak albert newen institute philosophy ii ruhr university bochum postulated animals may october biologists reported studies animals different species found samesex behavior necessarily related human orientation may help improve social stability reducing conflict within groups comparative psychology also studies animal behavior opposed ethology construed subtopic psychology rather one biology historically comparative psychology included research animal behavior context known human psychology ethology involves research animal behavior context known animal anatomy physiology neurobiology phylogenetic history furthermore early comparative psychologists concentrated study learning tended research behavior artificial situations whereas early ethologists concentrated behavior natural situations tending describe instinctive two approaches complementary rather competitive result different perspectives occasionally conflicts opinion matters substance addition twentieth century comparative psychology developed strongly north america ethology stronger europe practical standpoint early comparative psychologists concentrated gaining extensive knowledge behavior species ethologists interested understanding behavior across wide range species facilitate principled comparisons across taxonomic groups ethologists made much use crossspecies comparisons comparative psychologists websters dictionary defines instinct largely inheritable unalterable tendency organism make complex specific response environmental stimuli without involving important development associated name konrad lorenz though probably due teacher oskar heinroth identification fixed action patterns lorenz popularized instinctive responses would occur reliably presence identifiable stimuli called sign stimuli releasing stimuli fixed action patterns considered instinctive behavioural sequences relatively invariant within species almost inevitably run one example releaser beak movements many bird species performed newly hatched chicks stimulates mother regurgitate food examples classic studies tinbergen eggretrieval behaviour effects supernormal stimulus behaviour graylag one investigation kind study waggle dance dance language bee communication karl von habituation simple form learning occurs many animal taxa process whereby animal ceases responding stimulus often response innate behavior essentially animal learns respond irrelevant stimuli example prairie dogs cynomys ludovicianus give alarm calls predators approach causing individuals group quickly scramble burrows prairie dog towns located near trails used humans giving alarm calls every time person walks expensive terms time energy habituation humans therefore important adaptation associative learning animal behavior learning process new response becomes associated particular first studies associative learning made russian physiologist ivan pavlov observed dogs trained associate food ringing bell would salivate hearing imprinting enables young discriminate members species vital reproductive success important type learning takes place limited period time konrad lorenz observed young birds geese chickens followed mothers spontaneously almost first day hatched discovered response could imitated arbitrary stimulus eggs incubated artificially stimulus presented critical period continued days imitation advanced behavior whereby animal observes exactly replicates behavior another national institutes health reported capuchin monkeys preferred company researchers imitated researchers monkeys spent time imitators also preferred engage simple task even provided option performing task imitation observed recent research chimpanzees chimps copy actions another individual given choice chimps preferred imitate actions higherranking elder chimpanzee opposed lowerranking young various ways animals learn using observational learning without process imitation one stimulus enhancement individuals become interested object result observing others interacting increased interest object result object manipulation allows new objectrelated behaviours trialanderror learning haggerty devised experiment monkey climbed side cage placed arm wooden chute pulled rope chute release food another monkey provided opportunity obtain food watching monkey go process four occasions monkey performed different method finally succeeded another example familiar cat dog owners ability animals open doors action humans operating handle open door results animals becoming interested handle trialanderror learn operate handle open door local enhancement demonstrator attracts observers attention particular local enhancement observed transmit foraging information among birds rats stingless bee trigona corvina uses local enhancement locate members colony food welldocumented example social transmission behaviour occurred group macaques hachijojima island japan macaques lived inland forest group researchers started giving potatoes beach soon started venturing onto beach picking potatoes sand cleaning eating one year later individual observed bringing potato sea putting water one hand cleaning behaviour soon expressed individuals living contact gave birth behaviour also expressed form social teaching highly specialized aspect learning teacher demonstrator adjusts behaviour increase probability pupil observer achieving desired endresult behaviour example orcas known intentionally beach catch pinniped mother orcas teach young catch pinnipeds pushing onto shore encouraging attack prey mother orca altering behaviour help offspring learn catch prey evidence teaching limited mammals many insects example observed demonstrating various forms teaching obtain food ants example guide food sources process called tandem running ant guide companion ant source suggested pupil ant able learn route obtain food future teach route ants behaviour teaching also exemplified crows specifically new caledonian crows adults whether individual families teach young adolescent offspring construct utilize tools example pandanus branches used extract insects larvae holes within individual reproduction important phase proliferation individuals genes within species reason exist complex mating rituals complex even often regarded fixed action patterns sticklebacks complex mating ritual studied tinbergen regarded notable often social life animals fight right reproduce well social supremacy common example fighting social sexual supremacy socalled pecking order among poultry every time group poultry cohabitate certain time length establish pecking order groups one chicken dominates others peck without pecked second chicken peck others except first chickens higher pecking order may times distinguished healthier appearance compared lower level chickenscitation needed pecking order establishing frequent violent fights happen established broken individuals enter group case pecking order reestablishes several animal species including humans tend live groups group size major aspect social environment social life probably complex effective survival strategy may regarded sort symbiosis among individuals species society composed group individuals belonging species living within welldefined rules food management role assignments reciprocal dependence biologists interested evolution theory first started examining social behaviour apparently unanswerable questions arose birth sterile castes like bees could explained evolving mechanism emphasizes reproductive success many individuals possible amongst animals living small groups like squirrels individual would risk life save rest group behaviours may examples course behaviours altruistic indicated table example revengeful behaviour one point claimed observed exclusively homo sapiens however species reported vengeful including well anecdotal reports vengeful altruistic behaviour explained genecentred view one advantage group living decreased predation number predator attacks stays despite increasing prey group size prey may reduced risk predator attacks dilution needed according selfish herd theory fitness benefits associated group living vary depending location individual within group theory suggests conspecifics positioned centre group reduce likelihood predations periphery become vulnerable additionally predator confused mass individuals find difficult single one target reason zebras stripes offer camouflage habitat tall grasses also advantage blending herd groups prey also actively reduce predation risk effective defence tactics earlier detection predators increased another advantage group living increased ability forage food group members may exchange information food sources one another facilitating process resource needed honeybees notable example using waggle dance communicate location flowers rest predators also receive benefits hunting groups using better strategies able take larger needed disadvantages accompany living groups living close proximity animals facilitate transmission parasites disease groups large may also experience greater competition resources theoretically social animals optimal group sizes maximize benefits minimize costs group living however nature groups stable slightly larger optimal needed generally benefits individual join optimallysized group despite slightly decreasing advantage members groups may continue increase size advantageous remain alone join overly full niko tinbergen argued ethology always needed include four kinds explanation instance explanations complementary rather mutually instances behaviour require explanation four levels example function eating acquire nutrients
