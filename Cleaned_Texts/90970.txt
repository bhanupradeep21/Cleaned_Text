axial twist theory aka axial twist hypothesis scientific theory put forward explain range unusual aspects body plan vertebrates including proposes rostral part head turned around regarding rest endpart consists face eyes nose mouth well part brain cerebrum thalamus according theory vertebrate body lefthanded chirality theory gives phenomenal explanation addresses twist end head rest body develops addresses possible evolutionary history goal make testable predictions example theory predicted aurofacial asymmetry found explained phenomena include according axial twist developmental model anterior part head turns rest body except inner organs due twist forebrain face turned around left right also anterior posterior flipped adult vertebrate popular science videos podcasts idea twist responded severe inconsistencies prevailing scientific hypotheses explain contralateral organization forebrain cerebrum thalamus briefly visual map theory santiago ramón cajal proposes optic chiasm restores retinal image visual loop optic radiation destroys potential repair parcellation theory proposes increasing brain size conserve coincidental contralateral explain optic chiasm pattern conserved across extant vertebrates regardless brain size explanations fail sameside connections important crossing moreover explanations leave open brain stem including cerebrum sameside organization idea twist proposed two times independently suffer problems first presentation occurred conference marcel remained widely unknown first scientific publication form falsifiable scientific theory made marc de lussanet jan kinsbourne subsequently also published ideas novel kind facial asymmetry aurofacial asymmetry predicted confirmed basis axial twist kinsbourne developed ideas dorsoventral inversion hypothesis early naturalist étienne geoffroy sainthilaire proposing anterior head part head inverted also stressed axial twist concerns chordates proposal problem turn occur embryological development evolutionary foundation de lussanet osse used comparative functional morphology embryonic development starting point arrive axial twist hypothesis although embryological development axial twist studied explicitly clear indications zebrafish twist begins briefly neurulation commences rostrocaudal fronttotail direction philipp kellers group traced cell developing zebrafish embryos first tracing movements cells future eye region hind part head revealed opposite movement directions accordance axial twist whereas lefteye eyeregion cells tendentially moved outwards downwards ventrally right eye region moved upwards visualized timelapse hand surface cells hind side head moved left consistent axial chick development studied well development usually described according twisting begins stage rostral side head commences stage towards heart whereas anterior head region rotates right side moving upward direction left side downward heart region moves opposite direction end chick turned right side whereas heart taking part twisting landed left side axial twist emerges opposite asymmetric development observed wave moving across embryo anterior posterior well established nodal signaling cascade righttoleft flow produced ciliated cells primitive streak central setting asymmetric organization three aspects growth wave nodal shh well motor protein associated asymmetric growth anterior primitive node although nodal seems expressed initiation nodal csnr genes control asymmetric development rightsideturn body tightly linked genetic holoprosencephaly hemispheres cerebrum part aligned left right sides frontal occipital sides skull head usually remains small according axial twist theory represents extreme case yakovlevian may occur cerebrum turn early embryology cephalopagus janiceps twins conjoined twins born two faces one either side head twins two brains two spinal cords located left right side according axial twist model two nervous systems could turn due complex configuration body therefore remained either axial twist thought evolved common ancestor vertebrates even distant clades vertebrates agnathan lampreys hagfish possess optic chiasm contralateral brain well leftsided heart asymmetric also every vertebrate contralateral organization fossil skull impressions early vertebrates ordovician later show presence optic twisting asymmetric development well known deuterostomes hemichordata echinodermata cephalochordata tunicata turning toward side upsidedown also occurs frequently clades example sea stars turn mouth downwards larva briefly attached substrate rudimentary stalk mouth turned adult lancelet buries back downward mouth reaching fish species tend turn around feeding water surface thus axial twist evolved ancestor vertebrates possibly chordates even early deuterostome axial twist takes place early embryo vertebrate evolutionary pressure animals towards bilateral symmetry due sexual selection better looks potential mates functional selection eg better locomotion evolutionary pressure decreases better symmetry pressure also decreases body part less associated body surface locomotor system consequently axial twist theory predicts small systematic asymmetries remain outside body asymmetries larger inside body forebrain cerebrum thalamus predominantly represents opposite side body visual world however motor control usually requires information sides body contralateral representation means absolute rather almost every region brain connects sides body yakovlevian aka counterclockwise brain refers anatomical peculiarity normal brain average frontal lobes asymmetric left right lobe appears slightly larger left whereas occipital lobe asymmetric right central sulcus temporal lobe right cortical hemisphere front left overall asymmetries equivalent slight rotation cerebrum ie torque rotation exactly predicted axial twist theory given cerebrum superficial structure torque also known occipital strongly expressed occipital side frontal side spine slightly asymmetric healthy subjects thoracic vertebrae vertebra average asymmetric midline points right thus yakovlevian torque spinal asymmetry opposite direction predicted axial twist theory right forebrain represents predominantly left body left forebrain right body positions major nerve crossings behind forebrain anatomically contralateral organization forebrain manifested major decussations based upon latin notation ten deca uppercase x chiasmas greek uppercase letter χ chi decussation denotes crossing bundles axonal fibers inside central nervous system result decussations efferent connections cerebrum basal ganglia cerebellum spinal cord crossed afferent connections spine cerebellum pons thalamus thus motor somatosensory auditory visual primary regions forebrain predominantly represent contralateral side body afferent efferent connections forebrain bilateral components especially outside primary sensory motor regions result hemiplegia acquired early childhood sometimes completely compensated time four cranial nerves serve eye directly one sensory three motor nerves optic nerve sensory crosses midline optic chiasm oculomotor nerve trochlear nerve abducens nerve motor nerves control one eye muscles oculomotor nerve crosses midline leaving central nervous system trochlear nerve crosses midline chiasma dorsal side abducens innervates eye muscle fig light axial twist theory complicated pattern understood eyes like mouth nose originate anterior head region ie front twist cranial nerve originates forebrain olfactory nerve cranial nerves originate regions central nervous system lie behind optic nerve inserts optic tectum midbrain tetrapods bony fish also branches lgn thalamus forebrain vertebrates sharks skates sharks visual center cerebrum obtains fibers optic tectum way fibers cross midline hemisphere cerebrum sharks represents eye thus optic tract largely follows prediction axial twist theory branch towards lgn acquired later evolution thus makes exception oculomotor trochlear nerves originate midbrain cross midline predicted theory abducens nucleus located pons abducens nerve innervates lateral rectus muscle eye vertebrates except lampreys hagfishes thus seems lateral rectus muscle evolved later independently eye muscles presents exception axial twist model olfactory tracts run parallel optic tract form chiasm accordingly olfactory bulb connects sameside centers frontal cerebrum entirely consistent axial twist theory nose part anterior head region twists along forebrain since primary olfactory centers home cerebrum olfaction sense originates cerebrum olfactory lobe predicted represented cerebrum side aurofacial asymmetry expresses position face eyes nose mouth respect plane perpendicular axis ears shown graph asymmetry decreases age since axial twist located ears face predicted face grows left midline indeed inner organs trunk regions body least mechanically associated locomotion external body predicted axial twist theory asymmetric regions body bilaterally symmetric animals insects annelids bilaterally symmetric also inside asymmetric

scientific explanation asymmetric orientation position gastrointestinal tract liver pancreas studied much less heart probably heart prominent already early embryonic stages everyone aware heart throughout life theories hypotheses explain entire spectrum covered axial twist theory several hypotheses proposed explain certain aspects contralateral brain ie left forebrain representing mostly

thought reflect lateralization specific functions french zoologist étienne geoffroy sainthilaire noted organization dorsal ventral structures crayfish arthropod opposite mammals proposed mammals vertebrates turned upside explained marcel kinsbourne proposed body soma anterior head inverted hence somatic twist molecular evidence inversion hypothesis almost groups axial twist theory novel scientific discipline scientific papers presently addressed although considerable volume research exists genetic embryological mechanisms asymmetric development open question twist initiated inversion

open question founders de axial twist idea de lussanet osse kinsbourne agree axial twist universal vertebrates probably feature although asymmetric development chordates lancelet studied detail study analysed development light axial twist theory moreover even deuterostomes ie echinoderms sea stars sea lilies etc show marked asymmetric development even axial twist remarkable similarities
