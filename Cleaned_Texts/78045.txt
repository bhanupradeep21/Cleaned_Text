plasma cell leukemia pcl plasma cell dyscrasia ie disease involving malignant degeneration subtype white blood cells called plasma cells terminal stage aggressive form dyscrasias constituting cases plasma cell malignancies pcl may present primary plasma cell leukemia ie patients without prior history plasma cell dyscrasia secondary plasma cell dyscrasia ie patients previously diagnosed history predecessor dyscrasia multiple myeloma two forms pcl appear least partially distinct cases however pcl extremely serious lifethreatening therapeutically challenging clinical presentation primary pcl ppcl indicates far aggressive disease typical multiple myeloma case clinical features combination found multiple myeloma acute leukemia like multiple myeloma patients ppcl patients exhibit pathologically high levels monoclonal plasma cells bone marrow plus malignant plasma cellsecreted circulating monoclonal myeloma protein either igg iga light chain none cases similar b cell leukemias unlike multiple myeloma ppcl patients exhibit relative high frequencies splenomegaly lymphadenopathy hepatomegaly kidney failure bone marrow failure ie thrombocytopenia anemia andor rarely leukopenia central nervous system defects peripheral neuropathies due invasion tissues plasma cells andor deposition circulating monoclonal immunoglobulin compared multiple myeloma patients ppcl patients also exhibit high rates developing hypercalcemic crisis ie potentially lifethreatening episode high ionic calcium levels blood due excess bone reabsorption andor renal failure b higher levels serum lactate dehydrogenase microglobulin c lower rates bone higher rates soft tissue plasma cell tumors termed secondary pcl spcl diagnosed patients known multiple myeloma median time months terminal phase patients myeloma disease spcl patients typically highly symptomatic due extensive disease malignant plasma cell infiltrations failures bone marrow also organs failed broken one treatment regimens therefore may also show toxic effects pcl caused development excessively high number genetic abnormalities plasma cells particularly precursor b cells plasmablasts see plasma cells genetic instability due myriad acquired abnormalities including gene mutations single nucleotide polymorphisms depletions duplications parts gene larger portion chromosome even entire arm chromosome translocations deletions duplications entire chromosomes increases decreases expression intact genes due eg methylation gene promotors various less direct effects genetic abnormalities effect wnt signaling pathway

stability secretion monoclonal secondary plasma cell leukemia spcl results comparatively slow development plasma cellplasma cell precursor genetic abnormalities initially create clone cells cause premalignant condition monoclonal gammopathy undetermined significance small percentage cases progressive development genetic abnormalities serially create clones plasma cells cause serious still premalignant disorder smoldering multiple myeloma overt myeloma cancer ultimately contrast spcl ppcl presents de novo broad range genetic abnormalities example advanced methods examining genome viz wholeexome sequencing gene expression profiling identified nonsilent gene variants per ppcl patient sample time diagnosis abnormalities similar identical detected spcl abnormalities detected spcl closely resemble detected multiple myeloma ppcl genetic data support clinical data suggesting spcl ppcl distinct diseases spcl among two pcls closely related multiple examination plasma cell immunophenotype measuring certain cell surface antigens particularly cluster differentiation cd markers plasma cells patients ppcl differ taken form multiple myeloma spcl patients example ppcl plasma cells often express antigen considered important anchoring plasma cells bone marrow stroma plasma cells taken myeloma patients vs ppcl plasma cells often lack antigen present majority plasma cells taken form multiple myeloma patients ppcl plasma cells frequently express spcl plasma cells thus immunophenotyping supports notion multiple myeloma spcl ppcl show critically important fundamental differences may explain different clinical presentations courses responses therapy international myeloma working group defined diagnostic criteria plasma cell leukemia presence blood plasma cells per liter alternatively nucleated blood cells plasma cells recently group suggested values respectively may appropriate therapeutic viewpoint therefore studied definitive criterion recent study supported suggestion finding multiple myeloma patients circulating plasma cells prognosis much worse multiple myeloma similar plasma cell flow cytometry immunophenotyping blood cells detect clonal phenotypes plasma cells seen multiple myeloma eg phenotype may sensitive method enumerate circulating clonal plasma cells diagnose plasma cell prior use newly developed drugs treatment regimens median survival rates time diagnosis ppcl spcl months months respectively even treated aggressively vad regimen vincristine doxorubicin dexamethasone vcmp regimen vincristine carmustine melphalan prednisone alternating vincristine carmustine doxorubicin treatment pcl patients particularly ppcl patients newer methods appears made modest improvements survival rates however rarity two leukemias limited individual studies case reports small number patients retrospective analyses patient records randomized controlled trials patients reported one flaw methods patient selection bias ie patients selected treatment new regimen may less ill average patients disease therefore intrinsically less aggressive ie longer overall survival time recent case report studies suggest treatment regimens include proteasome inhibitor drug particularly bortezomib andor autologous stemcell transplantation improved ppcl survival example patients treated bortezomibbased induction regimen followed autologous stemcell transplantation maintenance regimen lenaldomide immunosuppressant related thalidomide bortezomib dexamethasone corticosteroid progression free survival rate years overall survival rate years one study patients receiving intensive chemotherapy plus autologous stemcell transplantation median survival months receiving chemotherapy alone median survival months two studies included bortezomib chemotherapy regimens likewise found addition autologous stemcell transplantation improved results current recommendations treating ppcl often include induction three drug regimen borezomiblenalidomidedexamethasone followed autologous stemcell transplantion consolidationmaintenance combination immunomodulator agents eg thalidomide lenalidomide pomalidomide plus proteasome inhibitor bortezomib ixazomib end stage multiple myeloma failed broken one therapeutic regimens spcl continues highly refractory various treatment regimens short response times regiments poor overall survival rates median survival patients spcl may shortlived responses treatment regimens communicated case reports include bortezomid established therapeutic regimens clearly shown improve overall
