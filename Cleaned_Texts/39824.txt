deep dyslexia form dyslexia disrupts reading processes deep dyslexia may occur result head injury stroke disease injury results occurrence semantic errors reading impairment nonword term dyslexia comes greek words dys meaning impaired lexis meaning word used describe disorders language concerning reading spelling numerous models hypotheses proposed attempt explain broad range symptoms experienced deep dyslexics definite consensus yet reached proposed models hypotheses helped treatment patients certain specific symptoms additionally recovery seen experienced equally patients deep dyslexia mainly characterized occurrence semantic reading errors semantic paralexias transposition letters words reading aloud eg written word view read aloud scene word bird read semantic errors major distinguishing feature deep dyslexia comparison central many symptoms deep dyslexia including visual errors eg written word thing read aloud think word skate read scale derivational errors eg written word alcohol read aloud alcoholic word governor read government poor reading function additionally deep dyslexics difficulty reading abstract concrete highly imaginable words difficulty reading adjectives adverbs verbs nouns complete inability read nonwords often impairments tasks verbal working symptoms deep dyslexia listed different independent impairments reading rare find individual displays characteristics indeed patients presenting semantic paralexias hallmark symptom disorder also demonstrate resulted deep dyslexia considered symptomcomplex led much research variety

individual may come statements predicates four legs animal barks wags tail words higher ease predication scores easily read aloud deep dyslexics words lower ease predicaton scores yet correlation ease predication ease reading seen normal adult ease predication may explain specific symptoms deep dyslexia rather indicates deep dyslexics read using imagery predicational route rather precise mechanisms used normal many different often conflicting hypotheses attempt explain deficits associated deep theories resulted several models designed conceptualize symptomcomplex found deep dyslexics models ordered chronologically rather follow general increasing trend presence field knowledge regarding deep dyslexics models may stronger others necessarily reflected models hypothesis toward end list heavily debated thus typically greater wealth knowledge surrounding glosser friedman continuum model based upon concept deep dyslexia phonological dyslexia opposite endpoints continuum reading deep dyslexia appears severe form phonological however symptoms patients change time initial diagnosis deep dyslexia later better described strictly phonological observations suggest recovery possible along semantic friedman justifies continuum hypothesis two sets evidence first involves five patients started deep dyslexia whose disorders shifted phonological dyslexia recovery semantic paralexias first symptom diminish either partially totally case symptoms resolved varying degrees however nonword reading always last symptom go complete recovery never reached second set evidence support continuum found review eleven patients deep phonological dyslexia found predictable succession symptoms placed great emphasis order reading symptoms emerged poor nonword reading first visual errors noun functor noun verb concrete abstract finally semantic errors suggested continuum hypothesis supported pattern connectionist model suggests phonological semantic features word activated activation decays rate quick cognitive processing thus errors speech output produced result fading hypothesis explains broad symptomcomplex deep dyslexics without resorting multiple loci damage approach seen eliminates need attribute specific locus damage symptom deep dyslexia instead states symptoms due decay large activation plaut shallice hypothesized units brain interact way semantic features form stable attractors space possible representations words unit interactions correspond particular attractor patterns particular attractor pattern activated network remains pattern however hypothesize pattern distorted pull pattern gravitates toward correct pattern almost semantic space filled basins one point pattern falls edge basin still gravitate toward middle lesion area neurons die basins change shape happens may distorted starting pattern end neighboring basin semantically related area correct one would account deep dyslexic patients incorrectly identify river ocean lesions occur early network change basins send different semantic words different areas network whereas occur later words much closer semantically may account severity deficit individual failure inhibition hypothesis states presentation target word activates semantic memory word along memory words semantically example target word dog may activate bark cat squirrel ball fetch deep dyslexic patients unable inhibit related words likely substitute one words target word speech production explicit hypothesis contradicts belief researchers deficits seen deep dyslexics due processing problemscitation needed researchers believe failure inhibition effect implicit processing instead cause impairments explicit task speech believe explicit characteristics reading involve conscious production speech information written words internalized without awareness implicitly ability access information process words read spoken explicit process implicit knowledge involves phonological awareness understanding morphology semantic understanding written implicit aspect reading may completely intact yet reading errors still occur defects explicit output researchers studied dissociation implicit explicit processes thus unravel underlying deficiencies deep dyslexia studies support failure inhibition show intact implicit processing deep instance studies shown deep dyslexics equally fast lexical decision task rhyming pair words booktook comparison nonrhyming pair words boughtough indicating patients able use implicit phonological knowledge phonics process additionally faster lexical decision task words sound like spelled couch pouch words sound like spelled touch showing patients using data show implicit processing fact occurring deep dyslexic patients thus researchers believe impairments present deep dyslexics explicit phonological output ie reading believe problems deep dyslexics due production errors deep dyslexics normal phonological processing implicit supported fact deep dyslexia often present patients production errors resulting expressive riley thompson expanded theory previous studies shown typical patients deep dyslexia typical members semantic category like robin category birds processed faster atypical members category like ostrich known semantic typicality effect according research typicality effect may indicate inability efficiently select correct lexicalsemantic representation suggest selection inhibition becomes impaired beginning level semantics rather later levels production like original failure inhibition hypothesis morton patterson dual route model based upon dual route hypothesis reading proposes occurrence semantic errors alongside inability read nonwords aloud must due multiple loci damage within dualroute deep dyslexic read aloud nonwords disruption phonological process assumed forcing reading proceed semantic however deep dyslexics also produce semantic errors reading alluding damage pathway researchers refer phonological semantic route believe patients partially functioning lexical module completely deficient nonlexical lexical module analogous semantic route dual route model relies lexical memory memory words name using lexical module individual accesses mental dictionary words nonlexical module comparable phonological route uses knowledge spelling graphemes create phonemes name words absent nonlexical module deep dyslexics explains patients name normal reading typically function left hemispherebased right hemisphere plays minimal role one hypothesis left hemisphere hypothesis supports idea damaged left hemispherebased reading system associated deep deep dyslexics may attempting use damaged left hemisphere resulting severe reading hand right hemisphere hypothesis states deep dyslexics attempt read using completely different reading according hypothesis using right hemisphere orthographic semantic processing given system usually play role reading deep dyslexics many reading strong support hypothesis comes studies splitbrain patients use right hemisphere reading patients makes semantic errors similar seen deep numerous studies shown right hemisphere contribute reading patients left hemisphere brain imaging studies performed deep dyslexics patients left hemisphere injury shown damaged left hemisphere still playing role however imaging also shown areas right hemisphere also active thus currently appears greater support favor righthemisphere deep dyslexia usually classified acquired reading disorder opposed developmental dyslexia previously literate adults consequence brain however recently developmental deep dyslexia also reported children williams deep dyslexia considered central dyslexia compared peripheral dyslexia peripheral dyslexics difficulty matching visual characteristics letters comprise word stored memory word prior central dyslexics unable properly match visual word words may also incapable speaking phonating sequence written letters see word letters deep dyslexia differs forms central dyslexia phonological dyslexia surface dyslexia deep dyslexics many symptoms symptoms generally according continuum hypothesis deep dyslexia severe form
