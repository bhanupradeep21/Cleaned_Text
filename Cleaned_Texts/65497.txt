angiography arteriography medical imaging technique used visualize inside lumen blood vessels organs body particular interest arteries veins heart chambers modern angiography performed injecting radioopaque contrast agent blood vessel imaging using xray based techniques fluoroscopy word comes greek words ἀγγεῖον angeion vessel γράφειν graphein write record film image blood vessels called angiograph commonly angiogram though word describe arteriogram venogram everyday usage terms angiogram arteriogram often used synonymously whereas term venogram used term angiography applied radionuclide angiography newer vascular imaging techniques angiography ct angiography mr term isotope angiography also used although correctly referred isotope perfusion scanning technique first developed portuguese physician neurologist egas moniz university lisbon provide contrasted xray cerebral angiography order diagnose several kinds nervous diseases tumors artery disease arteriovenous malformations moniz recognized pioneer performed first cerebral angiogram lisbon reynaldo dos santos performed first aortogram city fact many current angiography techniques developed portuguese university lisbon example lopo de carvalho performed first pulmonary angiogram via venous puncture superior member first cavogram performed sousa pereira introduction seldinger technique procedure became markedly safer sharp introductory devices needed remain inside vascular lumen radial access technique angiography traced back lucien campeau first cannulated radial artery perform coronary depending type angiogram access blood vessels gained commonly femoral artery look left side heart arterial system jugular femoral vein look right side heart venous system using system guide wires catheters type contrast agent shows absorbing xrays added blood make visible xray images xray images taken may either still displayed image intensifier film motion images structures except heart images usually taken using technique called digital subtraction angiography dsa images case usually taken frames per second allows interventional radiologist evaluate flow blood vessel vessels technique subtracts bones organs vessels filled contrast agent seen heart images taken frames per second using subtraction technique dsa requires patient remain motionless used heart techniques enable interventional radiologist cardiologist see stenosis blockages narrowings inside vessel may inhibiting flow blood causing pain procedure completed femoral technique applied site arterial entry either manually compressed stapled shut sutured order prevent accesssite one common angiograms performed visualize coronary arteries long thin flexible tube called catheter used administer xray contrast agent desired area visualized catheter threaded artery forearm tip advanced arterial system major coronary artery xray images transient radiocontrast distribution within blood flowing inside coronary arteries allows visualization size artery openings presence absence atherosclerosis atheroma within walls arteries clearly determined coronary angiography visualize coronary artery stenosis narrowing blood vessel degree stenosis determined comparing width lumen narrowed segments blood vessel wider segments adjacent cerebral angiography provides images blood vessels around brain detect abnormalities including arteriovenous malformations one common cerebral angiographic procedure neurovascular digital subtraction pulmonary angiography used visualise anatomy pulmonary vessels angiography also commonly performed identify vessels narrowing patients leg claudication cramps caused reduced blood flow legs feet patients renal stenosis commonly causes high blood pressure used head find repair stroke done routinely femoral artery also performed brachial axillary arm artery stenoses found may treated use balloon angioplasty stenting atherectomy fluorescein angiography medical procedure fluorescent dye injected bloodstream dye highlights blood vessels back eye photographed test often used manage eye optical coherence tomography oct technology using nearinfrared light image eye particular penetrate retina view microstructure behind retinal surface ocular oct angiography octa method leveraging oct technology assess vascular health microangiography commonly used visualize tiny blood vessels post mortem ct angiography medicolegal cases method initially developed virtopsy group originating project solutions evaluated oily require special deposition equipment collect waste water solutions seem regarded less problematic watery solutions also documented enhance post mortem ct tissue differentiation whereas oily solutions conversely oily solutions seem minimally disturb ensuing toxicological analysis watery solutions may significantly impede toxicological analysis thus requiring blood sample preservation post mortem ct angiography relatively safe procedure minor major complications angiogram sudden shock cause little pain surgery area heart attacks strokes usually dont occur may bypass surgery major complications cerebral angiography digital subtraction angiography contrast mri also rare include stroke allergic reaction anaesthetic medication contrast medium blockage damage one access veins leg pseudoaneurysm puncture site thrombosis embolism formation bleeding bruising site contrast injected minor complications delayed bleeding also occur contrast medium used usually produces sensation warmth lasting seconds may felt greater degree area injection patient allergic contrast medium much serious side effects inevitable however new contrast agents risk severe reaction less one examinations additionally damage blood vessels occur site punctureinjection anywhere along vessel passage catheter digital subtraction angiography used instead risks considerably reduced catheter need passed far blood vessels thus lessening chances damage blockage antibiotic prophylaxis may given procedures clean clean procedures results generation infarcted necrotic tissues embolisation routine diagnostic angiography often considered clean procedure prophylaxis also given prevent infection infected space blood six risk factors causing thrombosis arterial puncture low blood pressure small arterial diameter multiple
