pheromone ancient greek φέρω phérō bear hormone secreted excreted chemical factor triggers social response members species pheromones chemicals capable acting like hormones outside body secreting individual affect behavior receiving alarm pheromones food trail pheromones sex pheromones many others affect behavior physiology pheromones used many organisms basic unicellular prokaryotes complex multicellular use among insects particularly well documented addition vertebrates plants ciliates communicate using pheromones ecological functions evolution pheromones major topic research field chemical ecology portmanteau word pheromone coined peter karlson martin lüscher based greek φέρω phérō carry ὁρμων hórmōn pheromones also sometimes classified ectohormones researched earlier various scientists including jeanhenri fabre joseph lintner adolf butenandt ethologist karl von frisch called various names like instance alarm substances chemical messengers transported outside body affect neurocircuits including autonomous nervous system hormone cytokine mediated physiological changes inflammatory signaling immune system changes andor behavioral change proposed term describe chemical signals conspecifics elicit innate behaviors soon german biochemist adolf butenandt characterized first chemical bombykol chemically wellcharacterized pheromone released female silkworm attract

suppression methods nontoxic effective low species release volatile substance attacked predator trigger flight aphids aggression ants bees termites wasps members species example vespula squamosa use
