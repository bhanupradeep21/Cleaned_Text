skull traditionally restored wider shorter plateosaurus appearance may due differential crushing experienced various features skull variable individuals example thickness upper border orbit height

growth patterns affected environmental factors study indicated food plentiful climate favorable plateosaurus exhibited accelerated growth pattern growth called developmental plasticity unseen dinosaurs including massospondylus despite close relationship two study indicated massospondylus grew along specific growth trajectory little variation growth rate ultimate size another study age determination indicated massospondylus grew maximum rate kg lb per year still growing around years early sauropodomorphs massospondylus may herbivorous omnivorous recently paleontologists debated

similar extant herbivorous omnivorous barrett proposed basal sauropodomorphs supplemented herbivorous diets small prey gastroliths gizzard stones found association three massospondylus fossils forestsandstone massospondyluslike animal late triassic recently scientists believed stones functioned gastric mill aid ingestion plant material compensating inability chew case many modern birds however wings sander showed polished nature abundance stones precluded use effective gastric mill nontheropod dinosaurs including although long assumed quadrupedal anatomical study forelimbs questioned arguing limited range motion precluded effective habitual quadrupedal gait neither could forelimbs swing fore behind fashion similar hindlimbs could hand rotated palmar surfaces facing downwards inability pronate hand also supported insitu finds articulated stillconnected arms always show unrotated hands palmar faces facing study also ruled possibility knucklewalking forms locomotion would make effective locomotion possible without need pronate hand although mass suggests quadrupedal nature massospondylus would restricted hind legs since discovery rudimentary nonfunctional clavicles ceratopsians assumed shoulder bones reduced dinosaurs true robert bakker suggested would allowed shoulder blades swing forelimbs quadrupedal dinosaurs increasing functional forelimb would reduced discrepancy length fore hindlimbs quadrupedal massospondylus however recent discovery shows massospondylus possessed welldeveloped clavicles joined furculalike arrangement acting like clasp right left shoulder blades prohibiting rotation bones discovery indicates clavicle reduction limited evolutionary line leading ceratopsians also indicates furcula birds derived michael cooper noted zygapophyses neck vertebrae inclined prohibiting significant horizontal movement neck consequently significant movement direction must accomplished change position entire contradicted recent study noting basalmost cervicals show inclined zygapophyses allowing sufficient horizontal movement neck clutch seven massospondylus eggs found golden gate highlands national park south africa james kitching identified likely belonging nearly years extraction started fossils long embryos remain oldest dinosaur embryos ever early least egg clutches least four fossiliferous horizons found eggs per clutch indicates nesting site may used repeatedly site fidelity groups animals colonial nesting cases represent oldest evidence sedimentary structures indicate nesting area vicinity eggshells thin mm allowing gas exchange even low oxygen carbon dioxide rich environment indicates eggs least partly buried hints massospondylus constructed nests however arrangement eggs tight rows indicates eggs pushed position embryos probably represented skeletal features similar adults body proportions dissimilar head big short snout large orbits whose diameter amounts entire skull length neck short contrasting long neck adults girdle bones caudals relatively forelimbs equal length hindlimbs indicating newly hatched massospondylus quadrupedal unlike bipedal however reliability results discovery hatching footprints manus impressions confirmed quadrupedality impressions show hand pronated palm faces facing thumb facing unpronated manus big head indicate effective locomotion possible newly hatched notably nearhatchings teeth suggesting way feeding based lack teeth ineffective locomotion scientists speculate postnatal care might supported evidence hatchings remained nest sites doubled newly hatched juveniles known second sauropodomorph mussaurus remains resemble embryonic massospondylus suggesting quadrupedality present newly hatched mussaurus presumably basal sauropodomorphs quadrupedality hatchings suggests quadrupedal posture later sauropods may evolved retention juvenile characteristics adult animals evolutionary phenomenon known discovery therefore sheds light evolutionary pathways peculiar adaptations giant dinosaurs attained stated french paleontologist eric however recent study evaluated locomotion extinct taxa based limb robusticity found previous conclusions massospondylus transitioned quadrupedality bipedality ontogeny based unreliable allometric comparisons limb lengths model based circumferences humerus femur
