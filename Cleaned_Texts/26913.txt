respiratory arrest serious medical condition caused apnea respiratory dysfunction severe enough sustain body agonal breathing prolonged apnea refers patient stopped breathing long period time heart muscle contraction intact condition known respiratory arrest abrupt stop pulmonary gas exchange lasting five minutes may permanently damage vital organs especially brain lack oxygen brain causes loss consciousness brain injury likely respiratory arrest goes untreated three minutes death almost certain five minutes damage may reversible treated early enough respiratory arrest lifethreatening medical emergency requires immediate medical attention management save patient respiratory arrest goal restore adequate ventilation prevent damage management interventions include supplying oxygen opening airway means artificial ventilation instances impending respiratory arrest could predetermined signs patient showing increased work breathing respiratory arrest ensue patient depletes oxygen reserves loses effort breathe respiratory arrest distinguished respiratory failure former refers complete cessation breathing respiratory failure inability provide adequate ventilation bodys requirements without intervention may lead decreased oxygen blood hypoxemia elevated carbon dioxide level blood hypercapnia inadequate oxygen perfusion tissue hypoxia may fatal respiratory arrest also different cardiac arrest failure heart muscle contraction untreated one may lead one common symptom respiratory arrest cyanosis bluish discoloration skin resulting inadequate amount oxygen blood respiratory arrest remains without treatment cardiac arrest occur within minutes hypoxemia hypercapnia point patients unconscious become symptoms respiratory compromise differ patient complications respiratory compromise increasing rapidly across clinical spectrum partly due expanded use opioids combined lack standardized guidelines among medical specialties respiratory compromise creates problems often serious potentially lifethreatening may prevented proper tools approach appropriate patient monitoring therapeutic strategies necessary early recognition intervention diagnosis requires clinical evaluation detailed determining scene safe approach patient attempt converse patient responds verbally established least partially patent airway patient breathing therefore currently respiratory arrest patient unresponsive look chest rise indicator active breathing sternal rub sometimes used assess responsiveness initial assessment also involves checking pulse placing two fingers carotid artery radial artery femoral artery ensure purely respiratory arrest cardiopulmonary arrest checking pulse encountering unresponsive patient longer recommended nonmedically trained one

treatment varies depending cause respiratory arrest many cases necessary establish alternate airway providing artificial ventilation include modes mechanical ventilation many ways provide airway deliver breathing support list includes several options opioid overdose remains major cause death increase rate death united states cases overdose leading respiratory arrest recommended treatment according american heart association guidelines administer intramuscular intranasal naloxone initial dose mg dosing may repeated mg initial dose ineffective special consideration must taken individuals opioid dependency naloxone administration induce severe opioid withdrawal hence recommended starting doses goal naloxone therapy restore respiratory drive individual however mechanical ventilation may still necessary initial resuscitation resistance bag valve mask may suggest presence foreign body obstructing airways commonly used diagnostic tool treatment respiratory arrest bagvalvemask device selfinflating bag soft mask rests face bag connected oxygen supply patient receive inspired oxygen purpose bagvalvemask provide adequate temporary ventilation allow body achieve airway control however bagvalvemask left five minutes air may introduced stomach point nasogastric tube inserted take accumulated air process practitioners must carefully position maneuver bagvalvemask order keep airways open ensure adequate seal using bag valve mask ventilate specific hand positioning typically used provider places thumb index finger c shape top mask grips jaw mask three fingers creating e shape thumb index finger provide downward pressure mask remaining fingers maintain head tilt jaw thrust free hand used provide ventilation via children pediatric bags used pediatric bags valve limits peak airway pressures around cm water practitioners must tweak valve settings accurately determine patients avoid hypoventilation applying ventilation bag valve mask provider apply enough pressure bag see chest providing excessive bag pressure actually impair blood flow heart brain cpr extra caution taken limit size tidal rate manual ventilation exceed times per
