childhood blindness important contribution national prevalence disability blindness children defined visual acuity eye better vision child years generally means child see object feet meters away another child could see feet meters many causes blindness children blindness may due genetic mutations birth defects premature birth nutritional deficiencies infections injuries causes severe retinopathy prematurity rop cataracts vitamin deficiency measles conjunctivitis refractive error also vitamin deficiency common developing countries many kids experience malnourishment vitamin deficiency blinds hundreds thousands kids year preventable cause childhood blindness since vitamin required rhodopsin photosensitive pigment retinol rods deficiency lead night since globally children vaccinated measles significantly reducing number measles cases year children vitamin deficiency measles infection develop corneal ulcerations keratomalacia due immunosuppression caused vitamin newborn conjunctivitis present time birth presents within first days life severe conjunctival infection purulent discharge increases risk corneal ulcerations perforations lead blindness common organisms lead diagnosis include neisseria gonorrhoea chlamydia trachomatis infected pregnant women partners treated avoid infection newborn newborns presenting conjunctivitis treated hourly topical antibiotic drops gentamicin retinopathy prematurity rop classified abnormal growth blood vessels retina process called retinal blood vessels may bleed grow wrong direction bleeding lead formation scar tissue cause blurred vision vision loss vessels grow far wrong direction pull retina away back eye called retinal detachment retinal detachment medical emergency cause permanent blindness thus requires urgent babies born prematurely formally defined weeks gestational age earlier higher risk developing retinopathy prematurity earlier preterm baby born greater babys risk developing rop blood vessels eye typically finish development time birth therefore baby born early exposed various stimuli oxygen lights temperature etc may influence blood vessels eye develop additional risk factors rop include low birth weight pounds less giving baby extra oxygen following birth preterm infants experiencing health problems like anemia vitamin e deficiency andor breathing problems increased risk developing childhood blindness many leading causes include retinopathy prematurity vitamin deficiency infectious diseases measles newborn conjunctivitis retinoblastoma congenital conditions cataracts leber congenital amaurosis primarily affects retina typically severe visual impairment begins infancy mutations aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein linked leber congenital amaurosis frequently affected parts eyes diagnosis childhood blindness done via methods ascertain degree visual impairment affected child early detection essential provide early intervention children american academy ophthalmology recommend various screening methods starting newborns spanning throughout childhood order assess childhood blindness ophthalmic disorders newborns screened red reflex test performed shining light childs eyes red reflex produced workups done assess congenital cataracts retinoblastoma months children screened wellchild visits red reflex test assessment eye movement proper pupil dilation year years age children often undergo photoscreening test camera takes pictures childs eyes assess developmental abnormalities may lead amblyopia children ages years age assessed proper eye alignment visual acuity visual acuity assessed snellen chart lines letters child reads helps determine visual vitamin deficiency leading cause preventable childhood blindness particularly developing countries vitamin deficiency defined serum blood concentration less µmoll severe deficiency defined less µmoll per centers disease control national health nutrition examination vitamin supplied diet deficiency often results poor dietary intake vitamin arich low dietary levels vitamin worsened infections cause inflammation gastrointestinal tract prevent body fully absorbing vitamin available within digested food children united states recommended vitamin dietary allowance least good sources vitamin include vegetables carrots papaya animal products fish oils well dairy products milk cheese yogurt also sources vitamin retinopathy prematurity rop cause childhood blindness occur around time birth generally measures taken avoid preterm birth also effective preventing rop babies delivered preterm defined weeks gestation incomplete development blood vessels supplying birth increased exposure oxygen environment medical interventions high flow nasal cannula causes damage retinal blood vessels stunts growth prevention rop preterm babies involves careful monitoring oxygen delivery avoid excess neonatal ocular exams help detect whether blindness treatable depends upon surgical intervention performed cases primary congenital glaucoma review found difference combined trabeculotomy trabeculectomy ctt routine conventional trabeculotomy viscotrabeculotomy routine conventional

within primary health care important catching ocular disease issues lead better outcomes globally number children blindness approximately million representing global blind population additional million risk developing poor although number significantly lower number blind adults estimated economic social burden blindness children much greater due increase blind years childhood blindness prevalent among children genetic ancestry africa asia represent worlds affected review indicated estimated children bilateral blindness rate live eastern mediterranean also increase blindness outside developing countries due lack screening prophylactic measures treat causes pediatric vision program launched international agency prevention blindness iapb supported made controlling blindness
