classified various ways anatomic location proximity blood supply various tear patterns configurations include tears classified proximity meniscus blood supply namely whether located redred redwhite whitewhite zones functional importance classifications however ultimately determine whether meniscus repairable repairability meniscus depends number factors include tear meniscus common injury many sports menisci hold body load standing sports meniscus tear common american football association football ice hockey tennis regardless activity important take correct precautions prevent meniscus tear happening three major ways preventing meniscus tear first wearing correct footwear sport surface activity taking place means sport played association football cleats important item reducing risk meniscus proper footwear imperative engaging physical activity one offbalanced step could mean meniscus highly advised cleats contain sole molds around foot fewer fourteen cleats per shoe lower half inch diameter cleat tip threeeighths inch cleat second way prevent meniscus tear strengthen stretch major leg muscles include hamstrings quadriceps calf muscles one popular exercise used strengthen hamstrings leg curl also important properly stretch hamstrings standing toe touches seated leg extensions strengthen quadriceps quadriceps stretch help loosen muscles toe raises used strengthen stretch adequate muscle mass strength may also aid maintaining healthy knees use parallel squat increases much needed stability knee executed properly execution parallel squat develop lower body muscles strengthen hips knees last major way prevent tear meniscus learning proper technique movement taking sports involving quick powerful movements important learn cut turn land jump stop correctly important take time perfect techniques used three major techniques significantly prevent reduce risk meniscus tear presently treatments make possible quicker recovery tear serious physical therapy compression elevation icing knee heal meniscus tears likely heal physicians call red zone outer edge meniscus blood supply serious tears may require surgical procedures surgery however appear better nonsurgical long term degenerative meniscal tears often associated osteoarthritis leads poor outcomes regardless treatment type short term studies shown arthroscopic partial meniscectomy apm effective treatment regards function pain initial treatment may include physical therapy bracing antiinflammatory drugs corticosteroid injections increase flexibility endurance common antiinflammatory drugs painkillers prescribed meniscus tears include acetaminophen nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs exercises strengthen muscles around knee especially quadriceps stronger bigger muscles protect meniscus cartilage absorbing part weight patient may given paracetamol antiinflammatory medications patients selecting nonsurgical treatment physical therapy may reduce symptoms pain swelling type rehabilitation focuses maintenance full range motion functional progression without aggravating physical therapists employ electric stimulation cold therapy ultrasonography accelerated rehabilitation programs successful conservative program reduces time patient spends using crutches allows weight bearing activities less conservative approach allows patient apply small amount stress protecting
