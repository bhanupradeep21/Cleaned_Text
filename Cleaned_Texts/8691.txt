adjacent side chains point direction pleated appearance βstrands arises tetrahedral chemical bonding cα atom example side chain points straight bonds must point slightly downwards since bond angle approximately pleating causes distance cαi cαi approximately å nm rather å nm expected two fully extended trans peptides sideways distance adjacent cα atoms hydrogenbonded βstrands roughly å nm however βstrands rarely perfectly extended rather exhibit twist energetically preferred dihedral angles near φ ψ broadly upper left region ramachandran plot diverge significantly fully extended

amines planar preferred orientation peptide backbone dihedral angles φ ψ antiparallel sheets case two atoms cαi cαj adjacent two hydrogenbonded βstrands form two mutual backbone hydrogen bonds others flanking peptide groups known close pair hydrogen bonds parallel arrangement ntermini successive strands oriented direction orientation may slightly less stable introduces nonplanarity interstrand hydrogen bonding pattern dihedral angles φ ψ parallel sheets rare find less five interacting parallel strands motif suggesting smaller number strands may unstable however also fundamentally difficult parallel βsheets form strands n c termini aligned necessarily must distant sequencecitation needed also evidence parallel βsheet may stable since small amyloidogenic sequences appear generally aggregate βsheet fibrils composed primarily parallel βsheet strands one would expect antiparallel fibrils antiparallel stable parallel βsheet structure two atoms cαi cαj adjacent two hydrogenbonded βstrands hydrogen bond rather one residue forms hydrogen bonds residues flank vice versa example residue may form hydrogen bonds residues j j known wide pair hydrogen bonds contrast residue j may hydrogenbond different residues altogether none hydrogen bond arrangement parallel beta sheet resembles amide ring motif atoms finally individual strand may exhibit mixed bonding pattern parallel strand one side antiparallel strand arrangements less common random distribution orientations would suggest suggesting pattern less stable antiparallel arrangement however bioinformatic analysis
