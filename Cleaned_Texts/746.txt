fluctuations bring episodes bulimia regular barker states research found people using cognitive behaviour therapy become symptom free states order therapy work parties must work together discuss record develop coping strategies barker claims making people aware actions think people undergoing cbt exhibit early behavioral changes likely achieve best treatment outcomes long researchers also reported positive outcomes interpersonal psychotherapy dialectical behavior maudsley family therapy developed maudsley hospital london treatment anorexia shown promising results use cbt shown quite effective treating bulimia nervosa bn adults little research done effective treatments bn although cbt seen costefficient helps individuals bn selfguided care family based treatment fbt might helpful younger adolescents need support guidance adolescents stage brains still quite malleable developing therefore young adolescents bn less likely realize detrimental consequences becoming bulimic less motivation fbt would useful families intervene support working bn patients families fbt empower families involved adolescents food choices behaviors taking control situation beginning gradually letting adolescent become autonomous learned healthier eating antidepressants selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssri class may modest includes fluoxetine also known prozac fda approved treatment bulimia antidepressants sertraline may also effective bulimia topiramate may also useful greater side compared placebo use single antidepressant shown combining medication counseling improve outcomes
