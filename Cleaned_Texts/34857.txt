puce since engages theme scientific career analysis frog early development served head biological sciences fellowship alexander von humboldt foundation research german cancer research center heidelberg fulbright fellow laboratory prof joseph carnegie institution science department embryology baltimore md usa eugenia del pino recognized premier developmental biologist latin america latin american society developmental story relentless determination embracing every opportunity offered number institutions trained become high school teacher puce time president john f kennedy started alliance progress program latin america equipment professors sent ecuador help training high school science teachers one professors dr cándida acosta encouraged apply scholarship graduate studies united states america received scholarship latin american scholarship program american universities international fellowship american association university graduate studies us eugenia obtained master science vassar college went emory university atlanta obtain phd great mentor asa alan humphries jr dissertation dealt role eggjelly fertilization xenopus laevis upon returning ecuador became professor biology puce original university quito developed scientific career ecuador developmental biology blossomed unlikely place funds buy xenopus laevis came across frog called gastrotheca riobambae gardens university frog developed premier system study evolution developmental adaptations gastrotheca marsupial frog carries eggs pouch back pushed male hindlimbs terrestrial form reproduction solely occurs latin american frogs family intense competition reproductive sites south american rainforest evolved species frogs female incubates embryos inside body bringing parallelism mammalian marsupial frog embryos develop saline conditions typically found body contrast aquatic mode development found xenopus many traditional frogs marsupial frogs also differ embryos excrete waste freeswimming tadpoles excrete ammonia would toxic accumulated close quarters eugenia del pino discovered marsupial frog embryos excrete urea instead discovered addition urea reaches high levels pouch allows eggs develop outside marsupial frog urea nitrogenous waste product marsupial frog embryos use water retention water stress conditions maternal pouch eggs frogs large ranging mm diameter different species contain nutrients needed development found gastrotheca develops much like chick embryo surface yolk however instead primitive streak circular blastopore surrounded embryonic surprisingly extension starts involution blastopore concluded demonstrating important movements dissociated gastrulation analyses revealed extensive modularity developmental processes guide blastopore closure notochord elongation amphibians features correlate reproductive modes ecological flat embryos gastrotheca extend beautiful cranial neural crest branchial arches part neural crest becomes bell gills form rich network capillaries surround embryo pouch exchange gases maternal circulation still separated egg kind amphibian version placenta without uterus eugenia del pino studied many marsupial frogs found venezuelan one called flectonotus pygmaeus adapted large egg oocytes early stages meiotic nuclei single cell many nuclei gradually lost mature yolky oocyte single one remains forming single germinal vesicle eugenias discovery amazing biological adaptations marsupial frogs lead famous scientific american article work brought election latin american academy world academy sciences advancement science developing became first member national academy sciences ecuador received l orealunesco prize women science latin america eugenias life shows us identifying interesting biological problem unraveling mechanism bring science country allows creativity eugenia del pino established entire school biology ecuador focused evolutionary developmental eugenia del pino introduced field developmental biology ecuador long time puce home institution university ecuador theoretical practical undergraduate course laboratory highly productive developmental biology research research programs mainly driven undergraduate students graduate programs available ecuador time scientific collaboration one strengths partnered scientists usa japan uk germany informally programs including alexander von humboldt foundation fulbright fellowships productive scientific career resulted training active generation latin american scientists success results dedication ability train undergraduates research publication record testimony scientific commitment undergraduate training many coauthors undergraduate eugenia del pino trained students teaching research ecuador one countries latin america academy sciences reason eugenia invited several colleagues discuss possibility establishing national academy sciences ecuador aka ace spanish acronymcitation needed colleagues drafted statutes obtained legal recognition government ecuador secretariat science technology ecuador recognized six colleagues became founding members ace served vice president ace ace membership grew following years fellows ace provides recognition fellows allows communication ecuadorian scientists seeks exchanges institutions home abroadcitation needed years del pino contributed education conservation galápagos archipelago helped charles darwin foundation galápagos establishment program scholarships ecuadorian students galápagos served vice president charles darwin foundation several years later due time limitations withdrew galápagos conservation activities work made figure importance science latin httpsenwikipediaorgwikieugeniadelpino
