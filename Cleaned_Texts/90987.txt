head injury injury results trauma skull brain terms traumatic brain injury head injury often used interchangeably medical head injuries cover broad scope injuries many accidents falls physical assault traffic cause head injuries number new cases million united states year incidents leading death adults head injuries frequently age group resulting falls motor vehicle crashes colliding struck object assaults children however may experience head injuries accidental falls intentional causes struck shaken leading acquired brain injury abi term used differentiate brain injuries occurring birth injury genetic disorder congenital unlike broken bone trauma body obvious head trauma sometimes conspicuous inconspicuous case open head injury skull cracked broken object makes contact brain leads bleeding obvious symptoms neurological nature person may become sleepy behave abnormally lose consciousness vomit develop severe headache mismatched pupil sizes andor unable move certain parts body symptoms happen immediately head injury occurs many problems develop later life alzheimers disease example much likely develop person experienced head brain damage destruction degeneration brain cells common occurrence experience head injury neurotoxicity another cause brain damage typically refers selective chemically induced neuronbrain damage head injuries include injuries brain parts head scalp skull head injuries closed open closed nonmissile head injury dura mater remains intact skull fractured necessarily penetrating head injury occurs object pierces skull breaches dura mater brain injuries may diffuse occurring wide area focal located small specific area head injury may cause skull fracture may may associated injury brain patients may linear depressed skull fractures intracranial hemorrhage occurs hematoma within skull put pressure brain types intracranial hemorrhage include subdural subarachnoid extradural intraparenchymal hematoma craniotomy surgeries used cases lessen pressure draining blood brain injury occur site impact also opposite side skull due contrecoup effect impact head cause brain move within skull causing brain impact interior skull opposite headimpact impact brain site injury skull coup effect impact causes head move injury may worsened brain may ricochet inside skull causing additional impacts brain may stay relatively still due inertia hit moving skull contrecoup injuries specific problems head injury concussion form mild traumatic brain injury tbi injury result due blow head could make persons physical cognitive emotional behaviors irregular symptoms may include clumsiness fatigue confusion nausea blurry vision headaches mild concussions associated severity measured using various concussion grading systems slightly greater injury associated anterograde retrograde amnesia inability remember events injury amount time amnesia present correlates severity injury cases patients develop post concussion syndrome includes memory problems dizziness tiredness sickness depression cerebral concussion common head injury seen types intracranial hemorrhage roughly grouped intraaxial extraaxial hemorrhage considered focal brain injury occurs localized spot rather causing diffuse damage wider area intraaxial hemorrhage bleeding within brain cerebral hemorrhage category includes intraparenchymal hemorrhage bleeding within brain tissue intraventricular hemorrhage bleeding within brains ventricles particularly premature infants intraaxial hemorrhages dangerous harder treat extraaxial extraaxial hemorrhage bleeding occurs within skull outside brain tissue falls three subtypes cerebral contusion bruising brain tissue piamater breached contusion contrary lacerations majority contusions occur frontal temporal lobes complications may include cerebral edema transtentorial herniation goal treatment treat increased intracranial pressure prognosis guarded diffuse axonal injury dai usually occurs result acceleration deceleration motion necessarily impact axons stretched damaged parts brain differing density slide one another prognoses vary widely depending extent damage overlying scalp laceration soft tissue disruption continuity skull fracture constitutes compound head injury higher rates infection unfavorable neurologic outcome delayed seizures mortality duration hospital three categories used classifying severity brain injuries mild moderate severe symptoms mild brain injury include headaches confusion ringing ears fatigue changes sleep patterns mood behavior symptoms include trouble memory concentration attention thinking mental fatigue common debilitating experience may linked patient original minor incident narcolepsy sleep disorders common misdiagnosescitation needed cognitive symptoms include confusion aggressive abnormal behavior slurred speech coma disorders consciousness physical symptoms include headaches go away worsen vomiting nausea convulsions seizures abnormal dilation eyes inability awaken sleep weakness extremities loss coordination cases severe brain injuries likelihood areas permanent disability great including neurocognitive deficits delusions often specific monothematic delusions speech movement problems intellectual disability may also personality changes severe cases result coma even persistent vegetative symptoms observed children include changes eating habits persistent irritability sadness changes attention disrupted sleeping habits loss interest presentation varies according injury patients head trauma stabilize patients deteriorate patient may present without neurological deficit patients concussion may history seconds minutes unconsciousness normal arousal disturbance vision equilibrium may also occur common symptoms head injury include coma confusion drowsiness personality change seizures nausea vomiting headache lucid interval patient appears conscious deteriorate symptoms skull fracture include brain injuries lifethreatening even people apparently slight injuries noticeable signs complaints require close observation chance severe symptoms later caretakers patients mild trauma released hospital frequently
