phototrophs ancient greek φῶς φωτός phôs phōtós light τροφή trophḗ nourishment organisms carry photon capture produce complex organic compounds eg carbohydrates acquire energy use energy light carry various cellular metabolic processes common misconception phototrophs obligatorily photosynthetic many phototrophs often photosynthesize anabolically convert carbon dioxide organic material utilized structurally functionally source later catabolic processes eg form starches sugars fats phototrophs either use electron transport chains direct proton pumping establish electrochemical gradient utilized atp synthase provide molecular energy currency cell phototrophs either autotrophs heterotrophs electron hydrogen donors inorganic compounds eg purple sulfur bacteria green sulfur bacteria also called lithotrophs photoautotrophs also called photolithoautotrophs examples phototroph organisms rhodobacter capsulatus chromatium chlorobium originally used different meaning term took current definition lwoff collaborators wellrecognized phototrophs autotrophic also known photoautotrophs fix carbon contrasted chemotrophs obtain energy oxidation electron donors environments photoautotrophs capable synthesizing food inorganic substances using light energy source green plants photosynthetic bacteria photoautotrophs photoautotrophic organisms sometimes referred oxygenic photosynthetic organisms use chlorophyll lightenergy capture oxidize water splitting molecular oxygen ecological context phototrophs often food source neighboring heterotrophic life terrestrial environments plants predominant variety aquatic environments include range phototrophic organisms algae eg kelp protists euglena phytoplankton bacteria cyanobacteria cyanobacteria prokaryotic organisms carry oxygenic photosynthesis occupy many environmental conditions including fresh water seas soil lichen cyanobacteria carry plantlike photosynthesis organelle plants carries photosynthesis derived endosymbiotic bacterium use water source electrons order perform reduction reactions photolithoautotroph autotrophic organism uses light energy inorganic electron donor eg carbon source contrast photoautotrophs photoheterotrophs organisms depend solely light energy principally organic compounds carbon photoheterotrophs produce atp photophosphorylation use environmentally obtained organic compounds build structures phototrophs use chlorophyll related bacteriochlorophyll capture light known chlorophototrophs others however use retinal httpsenwikipediaorgwikiphototroph
