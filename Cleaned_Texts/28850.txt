polymerase cycling assembly pca also known assembly pcr method assembly large dna oligonucleotides shorter fragments process uses technology pcr takes advantage dna hybridization annealing well dna polymerase amplify complete sequence dna precise order based single stranded oligonucleotides used process thus allows production synthetic genes even entire synthetic genomes much like primers designed forward primer reverse primer capable allowing dna polymerase fill entire template sequence pca uses technology multiple oligonucleotides pcr customary size oligonucleotides used base pairs pca lengths used ensure uniqueness correct hybridization oligonucleotide designed either part top bottom strand target sequence well basic requirement able tile entire target sequence oligonucleotides must also usual properties similar melting temperatures hairpin free gc rich avoid complications pcr polymerase cycles oligonucleotides anneal complementary fragments filled polymerase cycle thus increases length various fragments randomly depending oligonucleotides find critical complementarity fragments way final complete sequence produced polymerase requires template follow initial construction phase additional primers encompassing ends added perform regular pcr reaction amplifying target sequence away shorter incomplete fragments gel purification used identify isolate complete sequence typical reaction consists oligonucleotides base pairs long overlapping base pairs reaction oligonucleotides carried cycles followed additional cycles end modification method gibson assembly described gibson et al allows singlestep isothermal assembly dna several hundreds kb using exonuclease chew back complementary ends overlap created reaction takes place temperature exonuclease unstable short timestep degraded overlaps anneal cambridge university igem team made video describing ligation independent cloning lic new variant method compiling several dna pieces together needing exonuclease enzyme reaction httpsenwikipediaorgwikipolymerasecyclingassembly
