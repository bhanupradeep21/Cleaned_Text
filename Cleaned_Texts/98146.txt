costochondritis also known chest wall pain syndrome costosternal syndrome benign inflammation upper costochondral rib cartilage sternocostal cartilage sternum joints patients affected multiple ribs single side typically chest pain primary symptom costochondritis considered symptom medical emergency making costochondritis common presentation emergency department one study found costochondritis responsible patients chest pain emergency department exact cause costochondritis known however believed due repetitive minor trauma called microtrauma rarer cases costochondritis may develop result infectious factor diagnosis predominantly clinical based physical examination medical history ruling conditions costochondritis often confused tietze syndrome due similarity location symptoms tietze syndrome differentiated swelling costal cartilage costochondritis considered selflimited condition resolve treatment options usually involve rest pain medications nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids ice heat manual therapy cases persistent discomfort may managed intercostal nerve blocking injection utilizing combination corticosteroids local anesthetic condition predominantly affects women age though studies found costochondritis still common among adolescents presenting chest costochondritis typically presents unilaterally one side typically left affects primarily ribs sternocostal costochondral commonly reported symptom costochondritis chest pain often exacerbated movement deep breathing pain typically widespread reproducible palpation anterior front chest affected pain costochondritis vary individuals typically described sharp aching dull pressurelike may also accompanied radiating pain shoulder arm front neck scapula shoulder condition usually onsets gradually following repetitive coughing strenuous physical activity trauma symptoms costochondritis may recurrent last weeks months however refractory cases condition persist costochondritis present heat

several musculoskeletal conditions similar costochondritis often one condition includes tietze syndrome often confused costochondritis due similarity location symptomatology typically costochondritis common condition associated swelling affects multiple joints usually ribs usually seen individuals older years age tietze syndrome rarer condition usually visible swelling commonly affecting single joint usually rib typically seen individuals younger years similar condition known slipping rib syndrome also associated chest pain inflammation costal unlike costochondritis pain associated slipping rib syndrome often felt lower ribs abdomen back commonly affecting interchondral junctions false costochondritis typically experienced within sternocostal junctions true ribs musculoskeletal conditions may cause chest pain similar costochondritis includes limited painful xiphoid syndrome muscle strain myofascial pain syndrome thoracic disk herniation rib costochondritis usually meaning typically resolve without treatment conservative methods often first method treat condition condition result trauma overuse upper extremity individuals told rest avoid activities pain relief medications analgesics acetaminophen use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids ibuprofen naproxen meloxicam may suggested relieve pain localized occasionally creams patches containing compounds capsaicin nsaids lidocaine may heat ice compresses may also used outpatient followup may also form treatment costochondritis manual therapy methods myofascial release muscle energy techniques balanced
