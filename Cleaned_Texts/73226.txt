fully understood scientists believe types stimulussensitive myoclonus may involve overexcitability parts brain control movement parts interconnected series feedback loops called motor pathways pathways facilitate modulate communication brain muscles key elements communication chemicals known neurotransmitters carry messages one nerve cell neuron another neurotransmitters released neurons attach receptors parts neighboring cells neurotransmitters may make receiving cell sensitive others tend make receiving cell less sensitive laboratory studies suggest imbalance chemicals may underlie myoclonus researchers speculate abnormalities deficiencies receptors certain neurotransmitters may contribute forms myoclonus receptors appear related myoclonus include two important inhibitory
