cause bleeding entire testicle generally removed prevent cancer spreading parts surgery becomes necessary treat hematocele may take several weeks patient recover fully due fact scrotum tends swell swelling cause discomfort pain easily go prescription medications often given help patient recover regular medical checkups help doctor look type early detection key treating medical different types hematoceles complications develop quickly particularly important receive early order prevent hematoceles important testicular selfexams help find abnormalities help understand normal body able detect
