seminal vesicles also called vesicular seminal glands pair convoluted tubular glands lie behind urinary bladder male mammals secrete fluid partly composes semen vesicles cm size cm diameter located bladder rectum multiple outpouchings contain secretory glands join together vas deferens ejaculatory duct receive blood vesiculodeferential artery drain vesiculodeferential veins glands lined columnshaped cuboidal cells vesicles present many groups mammals marsupials monotremes carnivores inflammation seminal vesicles called seminal vesiculitis often due bacterial infection result sexually transmitted infection following surgical procedure seminal vesiculitis cause pain lower abdomen scrotum penis peritoneum painful ejaculation blood semen usually treated antibiotics although may require surgical drainage complicated cases conditions may affect vesicles including congenital abnormalities failure incomplete formation uncommonly tumours seminal vesicles described early second century ad galen although vesicles received name much later initially described using term word prostate derived seminal vesicles pair glands males positioned urinary bladder end vasa deferentia enter

humans originates seminal fluid consists nutrients including fructose citric acid prostaglandins nutrients help support sperm fertilisation occurs prostaglandins may also assist softening mucous cervix causing reverse contractions parts female reproductive tract fallopian tubes ensure sperm less likely diseases seminal vesicles opposed prostate gland extremely rare infrequently reported medical congenital anomalies associated seminal vesicles include failure develop either completely agenesis partially hypoplasia failure vesicles form often associated absent vas deferens abnormal
