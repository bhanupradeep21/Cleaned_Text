bemidones ketobemidone etc others distant including diphenoxylate pethidine indicated treatment moderate severe pain delivered hydrochloride salt tablets syrup intramuscular subcutaneous intravenous injection much century pethidine opioid choice many physicians doctors prescribed acute pain chronic severe patented approved medical use compared morphine pethidine considered safer carry lower risk addiction superior treating pain associated biliary spasm renal colic due putative anticholinergic later discovered inaccurate assumptions carries equal risk addiction possesses advantageous effects biliary spasm renal colic compared opioids due neurotoxicity metabolite norpethidine toxic longterm norpethidine metabolite found serotonergic effects pethidine could unlike opioids increase risk triggering serotonin pethidine widely used opioid labour fallen favour countries united states favour opioids due potential drug interactions especially serotonergics neurotoxic metabolite still commonly used united kingdom new preferred opioid united kingdom use labour superseded somewhat strong semisynthetic opioids eg hydromorphone avoid serotonin interactions since pethidine preferred painkiller diverticulitis decreases intestinal intraluminal pethidine preferred drug management shivering therapeutic hypothermia provides greatest reduction shivering world health organizations list essential medicines effective safe medicines needed health adverse effects pethidine administration primarily opioids class nausea vomiting dizziness diaphoresis urinary retention constipation due

relationship definitively lipidsoluble morphine resulting faster onset action duration clinical effect minutes although typically administered intervals pethidine shown less effective morphine diamorphine hydromorphone easing severe pain pain associated movement like opioid drugs pethidine potential cause physical dependence addiction especially severe side effects unique pethidine among syndrome seizures delirium dysphoria primarily entirely due action metabolite pethidine quickly hydrolysed liver pethidinic acid also demethylated norpethidine half analgesic activity pethidine longer elimination halflife accumulating regular administration kidney failure norpethidine toxic convulsant hallucinogenic effects toxic effects mediated metabolites countered opioid receptor antagonists naloxone naltrexone probably primarily due norpethidines anticholinergic activity probably due structural similarity atropine though pharmacology thoroughly explored neurotoxicity pethidines
