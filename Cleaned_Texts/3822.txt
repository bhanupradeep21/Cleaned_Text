eyewitness testimony account bystander victim gives courtroom describing person observed occurred specific incident investigation ideally recollection events detailed however always case recollection used evidence show happened witness point view memory recall considered credible source past recently come attack forensics support psychologists claim memories individual perceptions unreliable manipulated biased result many countries states within united states attempting make changes eyewitness testimony presented court eyewitness testimony specialized focus within cognitive psychology psychologists probed reliability eyewitness testimony since beginning one prominent pioneer hugo m√ºnsterberg whose controversial book witness stand demonstrated fallibility eyewitness accounts met fierce criticism particularly legal ideas however gain popularity decades later dna testing would clear individuals convicted basis errant eyewitness testimony studies scheck neufel dwyer showed many dnabased exonerations involved eyewitness bob buckhout showed inter alia eyewitness conditions within ethical constraints simulated university large numbers people mistaken study nearly witnesses buckhout performed experiment athome viewers popular news broadcast television network played clip robbery produced buckhout video viewers watched man hat run behind woman knock take purse

memory reactivation many early studies memory demonstrated memories fail accurate records experiences jurors judges access original event important know whether testimony based actual experience study frederic bartlett demonstrated serial reproduction story distorted accuracy recalling information told participants complicated native american story repeat series intervals repetition stories altered even participants recalled accurate information filled gaps information would fit personal experiences work showed longterm memory bartlett viewed schemas major cause occurrence people attempt place

revolutionizing field bold stance challenges credibility eyewitness testimony court suggests memory reliable goes great lengths provide support arguments mainly focuses integration misinformation original memory forming new memory convincing experiments support claim result eyewitness crime focuses attention weapon causes unreliable memory things happened commission presence weapon impacts

holland saw much improvement eyewitness memory interview procedure referred cognitive interview approach focuses making witness aware events surrounding crime without generating false memories inventing details tactic interviewer builds rapport witness asking allow witness provide open ended account situation interviewer asks follow questions clarify witness account reminding witness acceptable unsure move approach guides witness rigid protocol implemented correctly ci showed accuracy efficiency without additional incorrect information currently us department justices suggested
