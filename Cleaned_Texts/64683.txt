order use ship player must get launch codes colleagues local observatory codes knowledge across subsequent loops allowing player immediately launch ship without first visiting central premise game exploration player compelled uncover remains nomai civilization find cause time loop complete game areas game technically immediately accessible player upon acquiring ship launch codes however many areas protected logic puzzles often solved learning nomai speaking fellow space explorers events locations change course time loop means areas puzzles often accessible certain times one example paired
