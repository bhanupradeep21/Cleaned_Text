stargardt disease common inherited singlegene retinal terms first description follows autosomal recessive inheritance pattern later linked biallelic gene variants however stargardtlike diseases mimicking phenotypes referred autosomal dominant inheritance due defects genes respectively characterized macular degeneration begins childhood adolescence adulthood resulting progressive loss presentation usually occurs childhood adolescence though upper age limit presentation lateonset possible main symptom loss visual acuity uncorrectable glasses manifests lack ability see fine details reading viewing distant objects symptoms typically develop age median age onset years include wavy vision blind spots blurriness loss depth perception sensitivity glare impaired colour difficulty adapting dim lighting delayed dark adaptation wide variation individuals symptoms experienced well rate deterioration vision vision loss attributed buildup byproducts vitamin photoreceptor cells peripheral vision usually less affected fine central foveal visioncitation needed historically stargardt first description eponymous disease recently diagnosis based looking phenotype using examination investigation eye since advent genetic testing picture become complex thought one disease fact probably least three different diseases related different genetic change therefore currently little confusing define stargardts disease stargardt disease caused biallelic gene variants ie autosomal recessive importantly exact genotype ie combinations variants highly prognostic age onset disease autosomaldominant stargardtlike diseases linked genes missense mutations play role remains seencitation needed carrier frequency general population alleles different combinations genes result widely different age onset retinal pathology severity disease inversely proportional function thought related disease role play diseases retinitis pigmentosa conerod dystrophies agerelated macular degeneration genetic defect causes malfunction atpbinding cassette transporter protein visual phototransduction cycle defective leads improper shuttling vitamin throughout retina accelerated formation toxic vitamin dimers also known bisretinoids associated degradation byproducts vitamin dimers byproducts widely accepted cause slowing formation vitamin dimers might lead treatment stargardt vitamin dimers byproducts damage retinal cells fluorescent granules called lipofuscin retinal pigmented epithelium appear reflecting damage butterfly pattern dystrophy caused mutations gene encodes membrane bound protein involved elongation long chain fatty acids diagnosis firstly clinical history examination usually slitlamp characteristic features found investigations undertaken depend locally available equipment may include scanning laser ophthalmoscopy highlights areas autofluorescence associated retinal pathology spectraldomain optical coherence tomography electroretinography microperimetry also useful diagnostic prognostic purposes fluorescein angiography used less often past investigations may followed genetic testing order avoid misdiagnosis diseases may overlapping phenotypic features stargardt disease disease multiple variants one study patients diagnosed stargardt disease physical ophthalmic examination found misdiagnosed subsequent genetic testing genetic testing utilized ensure proper diagnosis correct treatment applied present gene therapy stargardt disease however ophthalmologists recommend measures could slow rate progression prospective clinical trials support recommendations based scientific understanding mechanisms underlying disease pathology three strategies doctors recommend potential harm reduction reducing retinal exposure damaging ultraviolet light avoiding excess vitamin hope lowering lipofuscin accumulation maintaining good general health dietcitation needed md stem cells approach using bone marrow derived stem cells shown benefit various retinal diseases stargardt patients improved vision remained stable results showing high statistical significance reasons improvement may include transfer organelles mitochondria lysosomes enhanced clearing toxic vitamin byproducts neuroprotection photoreceptors ultraviolet light energy damaging wavelength spectra visible light effort mitigate ophthalmologists may recommend patient wears broadbrimmed hat sunglasses sometimes doctors also instruct patients wear yellowtinted glasses filter blue light indoors artificial light front digital screen certain foods especially carrots rich vitamin amount food foods high vitamin content often yellow orange color squash pumpkin sweet potato liver supplements market daily allowance vitamin avoided individual discuss doctor smoking overweight obesity poor diet quality may also contribute rapid degeneration hand consumption oily fish diet similar doctors recommend age related macular degeneration used slow progression diseasecitation needed advances technology brought devices help stargardt patients losing vision maintain independence lowvision aids range hand lenses electronic devices allow losing vision able carry daily patients may even opt inperson services longterm prognosis patients stargardt disease widely variable depends age onset genetic majority patients progress legal blindness means central reading vision lost however perimetry microperimetry studies indicate peripheral light sensitivity preserved long time significant fraction patients ie stargardt disease impact general health life expectancy patients usually lateonset form maintain excellent visual acuities extended periods therefore able perform tasks reading prospective epidemiologic study recruited patients stgd months
