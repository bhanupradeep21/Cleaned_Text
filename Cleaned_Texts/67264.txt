cultivation crops domestication dog often hypothesised classic example domestic animal likely traveled commensal pathway domestication archaeological evidence bonnoberkassel dog dating supports hypothesis dog domestication preceded emergence agriculture began close last glacial maximum huntergatherers preyed megafauna wolves likely drawn human camps lessaggressive subdominant pack members lowered flight response higher stress thresholds less wary around humans therefore better candidates protodogs might taken advantage carcasses left site early hunters assisted capture prey provided
