cell suspension suspension culture type cell culture single cells small aggregates cells allowed function multiply agitated growth medium thus forming suspension suspension culture one two classical types cell culture adherent culture history suspension cell culture closely aligns history cell culture overall differs maintenance methods commercial applications cells either derived homogenized tissue heterogenous cell solutions suspension cell culture commonly used culture nonadhesive cell lines like hematopoietic cells plant cells insect cell lines cultured suspension majority commercially available mammalian cell lines suspension cell cultures must agitated maintain cells suspension may require specialized equipment eg magnetic stir plate orbital shakers incubators flasks eg culture flasks spinner flasks shaker cultures need maintained nutrient containing media cultured specific cell density range avoid cell history suspension cell culture closely tied overall history cell tissue culture wilhelm roux laid groundwork future tissue culture developing saline buffer used maintain living cells chicken embryos ross granville harrison developed vitro cell culture techniques including modifying hanging drop technique nerve cells introducing aseptic technique culture later montrose thomas burrows adapted harrisons technique collaborated alexis carrel establish multiple tissue cultures could maintained vitro using fresh plasma combined saline carrel went develop first known cell line line derived chicken embryo heart maintained continuously though immortality cell line later challenged leonard hayflick major breakthrough inspired others pursue creating cell notably george otto gay assistant mary kubicek cultured first human derived immortalized cell line hela cell lines adherent hela cells able maintained primary cells cells derived directly subject must first removed subject isolated using digestion enzymes suspended media however mean cells compatible suspension culture mammalian cells adherent need attach surface divide white blood cells taken subject cultured suspension since naturally exist suspension adhesion white blood cells vivo typically result inflammatory immune response requires specific cellcell interactions occur suspension single type white blood immortalized mammalian cell lines cells able replicate indefinitely plant cells insect cells obtained cryopreserved manufacturers used start suspension start culture cryopreserved cells cells must first thawed added flask bioreactor containing media depending upon cryoprotectant agent cells might need washed avoid deleterious effects suspension cell cultures similar adherent cultures number ways require specialized nutrient containing media containers allow gas transfer aseptic conditions avoid contamination frequent passaging prevent overcrowding cells however even within similarities key differences culture methods example though adherent suspension cell cultures maintained standard flasks tissue culture flask suspension cultures need agitated avoid settling bottom flask adherent cell cultures maintained flat flasks lot surface area promote cell adhesion suspension cultures require agitation otherwise cells fall bottom flask greatly impacting access nutrients oxygen eventually resulting cell reason specialized flasks including spinner flask shaker flask discussed developed agitate media keep cells suspension however agitation media subjects cells shear forces stress cells negatively impact growth although adherent suspension cell cultures require media media used suspension culture may contain surfactant protect cells shear forces addition amino acids vitamins salt solution contained culture media spinner flasks used suspension cultures contain magnetic spinner bar circulates media throughout flask keeps cells spinner flasks contain one central capped opening flanked two protruding arms also capped allow additional gas exchange magnetic spinner bar typically suspended rod attached central cap maximizes media circulation cell suspension culturing cells spinner flask containing cells placed magnetic stir plate inside incubator spinner parameters need adjusted carefully avoid killing cells shear shaker flasks also used suspension cultures appear similar typical erlenmeyer flasks semipermeable lid allow gas suspension cell culturing shaker flasks loaded cells appropriate media placed orbital shaker optimize cell culture proliferation revolutions per minute orbital shaker must adjusted within acceptable range depending cells media used media must allowed stir disturb cells much causing excessive stress shaker flasks often used fermentation cultures microorganisms passaging subculturing suspension cell cultures straightforward passaging adherent cells adherent cells require initial processing digestion enzyme remove culture flask surface suspension cells floating freely sample culture taken analyzed determine ratio living dead cells using stain trypan blue total concentration cells flask using hemocytometer using information portion current suspension culture transferred fresh flask supplemented media passage number recorded particularly cells primary immortalized primary cell lines eventually undergo suspension cells often passaged outright without changing media order change media suspension culture cells current container removed centrifuged pellet excess media removed centrifuged sample flask refilled fresh media readding cells flask media changes subculturing important maintain cell lines since cells consume nutrients media expand cells also grow exponentially environment becomes inhospitable due lack nutrients extreme ph lack space grow unlike adherent cultures limited surface area provided expand suspension cultures limited volume container meaning suspension cells exist much larger quantities given flask preferred using cells make products including proteins antibodies metabolites produce high volume cells however far fewer mammalian suspension cell lines mammalian adhesive cell lines large scale suspension culture involves nonmammalian cells
