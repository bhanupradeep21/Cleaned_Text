insect euthanasia process killing insects way minimizes eliminates pain may apply animals laboratory schools pets food otherwise euthanasia insects invertebrates historically received limited vertebrate animal experimentation typically requires approval institutional animal care use committee united states use invertebrate animals guidelines many research papers make mention invertebrate subjects many euthanasia methods developed vertebrates transfer well number euthanasia methods proposed various invertebrate many adequately vetted research scientists debate existence extent pain invertebrates including vincent wigglesworth suggests giving insects benefit doubt case cornelia gunkel gregory lewbart suggest question pain invertebrates clearly answered analgesic given animal subjected painful jeffrey lockwood use anesthetic turns insects experience pain material cost mistake low however use anesthetic turns insects agony moral cost mistake quite high avma guidelines echo ongoing debate invertebrates abilities perceive pain otherwise experience compromised welfare guidelines assume conservative humane approach care creature warranted expected society consequently euthanasia methods used minimize potential pain distress pentobarbital anesthetic drug used medicine human animal euthanasia capital punishment avma recommends overdose pentobarbital similar drugs method invertebrate euthanasia dose chosen comparable levels given poikilotherm vertebrates adjusted proportionally animals weight injection hemolymph ideal invertebrates open circulatory system intracoelomic injection may required rather injection blood vessels may help premedicate animal another injected inhaled verifying insects death chemical injections difficult often recommended follow

mantodea coleoptera overdose inhaled anesthetics work terrestrial invertebrates like insects verifying death difficult advised use another euthanasia method alongside isoflurane sevoflurane examples volatile anaesthetics used afterward insects mechanically destroyed systems developed provide vaporized anesthetic minimal required amounts order make anesthesia pithing requires sufficient anatomical experience relevant species humane preceded means chemicals like alcohol formalin destroy nervous tissue humane preceded means ethyl acetate etoac sodium cyanide nacn commonly used field chemicals

hobbyist literature compromise tissues spiders later histopathological examination make statement effect spider british irish association zoos aquariums biaza terrestrial invertebrate working group tiwg reports survey conducted mark bushell biaza institutions found refrigeration freezing common methods euthanasia invertebrates although research suggested probably one least ethical options said freezing worstcase method chemical instantaneous physical destruction insects put ordinary freezer may require day carbon dioxide sometimes used terrestrial invertebrates including however effectiveness reported cause convulsions excited behavior perhaps suggesting animal discomfort believed induce john e cooper writes procedure considered potentially painful may merit using isoflurane halothane sevoflurane rather extent latter induces analgesia invertebrates known use vertebrate animals controversial concerns effects animals health insect farmers believe mechanical shredding least painful way kill insects suitable human freezing also commonly used commercial entomophagy operations though discussed debate whether freezing fully humane many insects eaten humans roasted fried boiled otherwise heated directly without effort made euthanasia many pets eat live insects euthanized httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinsecteuthanasia
