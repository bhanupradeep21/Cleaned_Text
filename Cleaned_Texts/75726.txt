coronosaurus means crowned lizard coming corona latin crown sauros greek lizard name refers unique crownlike shape horns top like ceratopsids coronosaurus large frill horns head include small pair brow horns eyes large nasal horn snout unique among ceratopsians irregular spiky bone masses growing around metres ft long tonnes long tons short tons weight midsized genus classified member

date middle campanian stage late cretaceous specimens precise localities archived royal tyrrell museum palaeontology drumheller alberta michael j ryan anthony p russell described named type species centrosaurus brinkmani later studies however recover monophyletic clade genus type species centrosaurus apertus phylogenetic analyses due ryan david c evans kieran shepherd erected genus coronosaurus species generic name derived latin corona meaning crown reference multiple occurrences extra epiparietals cover posterior margin parietal giving crownlike appearance saurus latinized greek sauros meaning specific name brinkmani honors donald brinkman research palaeoecology late cretaceous environments response pandemic ryan asked naming dinosaur stated came frill ornamentation made think

otherwise far known coronosaurus resembles relatives centrosaurus styracosaurus morphology example nasal coronosaurus closely resembles centrosaurus apertus unfused juvenile subadult fused adult forms appears undergone similar ontogenetic changes erect laterally compressed nasal horn core blunt tip formed fusion opposing nasals sits posterior portion external nares centrosaurines juvenile adult specimens gently recurved anterior posterior margins resulting horns apex oriented least slightly caudally original description ryan russell considered coronosaurus represent new species centrosaurus basis small phylogenetic analysis included seventeen characters nine taxa coronosaurus centrosaurus brinkmani c apertus grouped base centrosaurinae styracosaurus found closely related pachyrhinosaurus derived centrosaurines centrosaurus anthony r fiorillo ronald tykoski modified analysis currie et al characters include taxa c brinkmani found c brinkmani sister taxon clade styracosaurus c apertus pachyrhinosaurus derived centrosaurines separate lineage thus analysis found support monophyly later farke et al used morphological characters assess phylogenetic position new taxon named spinops spinops found polytomy centrosaurus apertus c brinkmani styracosaurus therefore c brinkmani excluded analysis increase finally ryan evans shepherd used data matrix farke et al assess phylogenetic position xenoceratops revised analysis significantly better resolution presented farke et al due part additional scoring missing characters taxa based direct observation specimens example five additional characters scored c brinkmani resultant tree found advanced position spinops c apertus sister taxon styracosaurus thus new generic name coronosaurus given cladogram presented follows
